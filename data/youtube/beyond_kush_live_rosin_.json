triminator i wanted to show it off how beautiful it is this is my ambassador version so i just got it in they were nice enough to ship that out david came out here to be able to unpackage it with me take a check look and i am getting ready to do a nice big squish on it so i'm gonna really break her in and have a uh see how well it does on i don't know squishy here so we're live we we're doing good here all right so let me get this set up exactly how i want to go i'm going to do four bags of 15 grams three bags on the bottom plate all right so i'm getting this set up here basically i'm using this so that we can get a good look at the flow coming out let's give this a little pressure here [Music] and i have two more 15 gram bags we're gonna do on the top level this is what i love about this press not all the time do i get a lot of product that i can push through but when i have multiple runs on the same product it really is nice to be able to get it through here all right that should look just about right just want to make sure these are in there good i don't want to have any problems okay now the fun begins okay paper set up like i want all about the prep work make sure you got everything placed right where you want it looking good all right got each one of these bags here with a directional flow so that's basically going to push everything out the front here on the front i've got these bags that are made just a little bit longer which will give them room to drip over what i love about this press is it gives me the ability to change the direction so i can tilt this at any angle i want to be able to get that rosin to flow off those plates a little bit faster when i'm doing a lot you know i can what i'm doing over i can just turn it all the way 90 degrees have it run straight out but this makes it a little bit easier for collecting and i feel like getting air mixed in with it is is kind of a little down from what i'm opposite what i'm trying to do actually so here we go start taking a look here oh that's so pretty but i like it still one bag that's still kind of everything's looking good though they're all holding pressure's just about right there we go that there is beautiful girl scout cookies ice water hash fresh frozen whole plant a few more farms here in tulsa grit beautiful that that looks a lot better than i thought it was going to that uh it's gorgeous i'm pressing that 180 on this i've been kind of changing all over the place on temperatures uh i'd like i like getting it off the plates as quick as possible you know i just don't want to have any reason for it to sit on there any longer going slower temperature wise lower temperature wise and i found this really is the best trade-offs on all sides because you're always going to give up something for something else speed temperature that's artwork right there we just need to put that up on the wall talk about expensive artwork bringing it up probably close to about three three thousand right now two thousand tons of psi i feel the bags are pretty much have given me all about all of it just want to make sure with having this many bags on there you kind of go the extra mile because some are just a little different definitely don't want to leave any i have to get this weight up see how many grams we really got off of here so the biggest thing about this is that i'm an ambassador now for triminator here in oklahoma so if you want to check out this press if you have one of these presses anything interested in it give me a call hit me up on instagram 9180g underscore and i'll be glad more than happy to show you answer any questions kind of just give you an idea in education we're going to be doing educational videos with terminator doing on the rosin education series and we'll have some really good information on there people just you know trying to get basic information not too overwhelming but also have some really good details for people that already know what they're doing just little tricks of the trade all right i really feel like that's about all i can get out of her fighting back on all the bags okay sorry i'm kind of concentrating on getting these out of here without making any mistakes and i didn't i don't know if the lighting in here will do it justice oh you can see all those terps in there beautiful the smell let's take a look at one of these bags on the bottom row that'd be the one with the least amount of power let's see how she looks so all you want to do one one good indicator of how well you did is to take a look at the bag through the light and how clear it is gives you a really good idea that you've got all of the product out of there you can see just pushed it out to the edges and that's going to be all your other material that you didn't want out of there anyways so very pleased let's look at that let's look at one on the top shelf and just see how they did comparatively all right taking a look at the same thing very similar they look pretty much identical this one has a little bit bigger that looks really good that's one thing about this product is just the hand pump everything about it being able to really feel the uh the pressure that i'm getting back and where i am in that bag so bva throw it out to them like great pump and the primary man you just can't beat it so let me know you guys want to check them out again i'm the ambassador here in oklahoma and um looking forward to putting out a lot of good uh educational videos and different types of", "zOxoyfpTVeQ": "[Music] alright guys I'm gonna go in here I'm gonna try to get some awesome that my guy on Instagram makes Greg 17 Greg he's got the seventh in between the Greg definitely is gonna count the follow right there i'ma go up in there tried to get some of that rosin and I may get some other things too that you guys like I said we'll see in the future and we'll see what they got alright I got a couple different things here as you can see I've got a couple of pre-rolls I've got a live rosin as well which is one of the main reasons I went by jungle boys I wanted to try their live rosin batter which Greg 7/10 Greg he makes that it makes a lot of it and you can follow him on Instagram with the 7th in between the Greg and that's how I even find him on Instagram an amazing page that guy is just absolutely way ahead of anything in this industry he's more than an expert that's for sure so I had to pick up some of that you got jungle boys full mouth jungle boys rosin jungle boys and jungle boys clothing that's all their pages and of course Greg and I'll mention a couple other ones down in the description for you guys to follow first of all let's look at the prices I we got the joints right here and as you can see there are $12 a piece including the tax so I mean they're lower a dollar cheaper than the joints we got back home and that's here in LA now there bud is a little bit more expensive I have that on another video for you guys if you're buying recreational it's 26 dollars a gram so I just got some pretty rolls right here and I've already actually smoked that Topanga Canyon that was just an amazing experience right there it was like great be I see with like a hint of like almost mint and it was it was really amazing so I already smoked that one and I'm gonna probably smoke the jungle cake in the morning twenty nine percent THC 291 milligrams total their strains are really high like that though they come in and extremely high some of them do now I smoked another one out here the last time though mimosa that was only like 16 percent and it was actually one of the better strains I smoked so twenty-nine percent on that one we also have cookies and cream and this one is coming in at 27 percent 277 milligrams in that 135 percent total cannabinoids Topanga Canyon yeah that one I just smoked was nice 25 percent it's that was like a in akadama net hybrid it was a oh gee Topanga Canyon oh gee really good really good I was like a great be gassy skunky with a hint of mint almost does what I would have to say describe that like and the other thing we got is the live rosin and that is a hundred and ten dollars a gram now we don't quite have anything like this back home and of course I can't really you know compare this to back home but I had to get some of that it's a hundred and ten dollars a gram recreational and I think it was a hundred dollars a gram medical I could be wrong on that price but it was one hundred and ten dollars for me including tax recreational for for this one gram right here", "LYO4xCOkZ0I": "the following concept may not be suitable for the ages of 18 and 21 and under please know that every cannabis item and alcohol product in this video is used by those

that the way that tastes is how this smells as you as you guys can see i already got myself a dab loaded let me show you what this [ __ ] looks like and voila i want you guys to take a look at this [ __ ] is beautiful beautiful i love the batter consistency it's stupid stinks and it smells like a very nice it bro it has a sweet very like soft aroma if that makes sense it has a very smooth aroma and it's beautiful i am very excited to try this because i've never tried any stizzy concentrates i've only had stizzy pods and shout out to a member of the royal family i still am yet to review the live residence disease which i will do and i called it i legit said it in that video months before they released this [ __ ] that they were gonna do it and they did which is the smartest thing they can do because live resin is a new wave but we're not we're not here to talk about that we're here to take this dab of this orange crush let's do this [ __ ] it's time i'm about to dab i got it right here that's dizzy batter i'm sorry it's dizzy rosin batter i can't wait you guys know i love these [ __ ] citrus flavors so i had to get the orange crush and orange crush if you guys did not know orange crush is actually a classic strain ladies and gentlemen cheers first time try and stizzy concentrate oh my god this is amazing everything i expect from something with a name that has orange in it holy [ __ ] this is comparable okay you guys wow i am shook oh my god i'm not lying to you guys when i say i'm absolutely in shock this stuff is definitely comparable to stizzy i mean see i'm loaded i meant to say definitely comparable to 710 it has an incredible potency it's only 73 thc i'm [ __ ] high though and that [ __ ] overwhelmed me in citrusy flavor definitely tastes a lot more like orange than what it smells like and that's a fact and i love that because it always takes you by surprise when you dab it so all props all shouts out this disney you can [ __ ] see i am beyond high but i gotta do it for you guys another one let's just dab of the gas again ladies and gentlemen cheers to you all oh my god i i'm [ __ ] loaded oh my god yes dizzy is wow i am just so shook on how crazy good their concentrates are like don't get me wrong i've always noticed dizzy's a good brand but personally me like i think they do have the best distillate but i'm not a good fan like a good fan i'm not a big fan of distillate in general so the fact that i gave their constant because their weed is amazing absolutely amazing definitely on the 710 level of flower and so are their concentrates not going to cut i mean their rosin is beautiful so yeah i [ __ ] with this [ __ ] so so far because you you guys know you need to try more than one thing in order to understand the brand

checking out some punch-drunk live rosin on today's episode of solvent les review and I've got Josh the owner of coach masters here to talk all about it and how you can even win your own Awards and what judges look for alright let's check it out today we're really excited to bring you an award-winning live rosin from cush masters in Boulder Colorado this punch-drunk is a nice combination of Bermuda punch and Mac otherwise known as miracle alien cookies - phenomenal strains that they blended together in the lab to make an entirely better creation it took home first place at the Brewster's 7/10 showdown this year and when you open the jar you can immediately tell why it caught the judges attention fruit all kinds of terpenes that are really evocative of a fruit market in South America come at you it's almost hard to tell which ones you're smelling because it's a mixture of pineapple paya maybe even watermelon looking at the consistency it's this gorgeous shiny butter mixed with sugar and you can tell that the terpenes have even started to separate ever so slightly at room temperature this strain isn't the highest in potency testing at around 74 percent THC but that's okay because it more than makes up for it and the smell and the aromas and the flavors that come along with it which we would argue are more important in most cases anyway hey everyone welcome back to solvent let's review this is Eric today we've got a really special episode got Josh from cush masters and some award-winning live rosin just to come first place at the rooster show down in the category so super excited Josh thanks for coming on the show yeah thanks for having me it's a awesome here yeah I tell me a little bit about cush masters so cush masters was a bridge anole founded in 2015 we did contract processing for you know quite a few different people in the industry and all within Colorado and then we expanded our brand outreach around 2017 and you know we're focused on connoisseur extracts and making sure that people are outputting the best quality inputs and outputs for you know come overall concentrates because it's a huge new part of and wave of the industry so we wanted to make sure that people were properly educated as they Deb as they consume as well as make sure it's some good stuff nice so you guys have been at this a little while how long have you guys been making browsing for we've been making rosin since about 2015 yeah so just so everyone knows Josh is also one of the co-owners here at pure pressure and one of the people responsible for really seeing big-time value in solvent lists a long time ago when people were making it with hair straighteners and really josh was the one that came up with the idea of how do I come up with a better press so that I can make this more viable so yeah I mean coach masters was born and you know we found and definitely a necessary need in the market for a high quality you know versatile rosin press you know what we were using just wasn't cutting it and we wanted to make sure that we could put out the best concentrates you know the same way that you know starting material creates quality extracts you know it also comes down to the machinery and the repeatability of that machinery and so you know went out and you know built the press and you know peer pressure is what it is today which is a huge blessing and it's great you know it's amazing to see everybody utilizing that technology and you know it's only getting better yeah so tell everyone a little bit about what goes into making award-winning rosin so the strain we've got today is punch-drunk which is a cross between Mac and Bermuda punch and what is Mac stand for Mac is just a strain that was bred and is it miracle alien cookies is that what we're calling cookies yeah well yeah so tell everyone a little bit more about the strain and kind of what went into this yeah so I mean both strains you know we're grown separately as their own strain and what we ended up doing they each have their own unique profile so you know each their own terpene profile their own you know necessarily bud structure features that type of stuff and trichome head structures which all take into account when you're utilizing and going in for water extraction okay because that was the first process of getting this final product right here mmm that we're about to consume here shortly so that was obviously ice water hash washed pressed when you guys were doing this is this a cross between one strain that's the punch-drunk or is it two strains have been blended together purposefully it was two strains that were blended together you know purposefully okay I'm within the Brent within the lab itself okay so they were grown separately uh-huh and then we decided the two profiles uh would create an amazing you know over what we hoped would be an amazing you know extract you know sometimes they're hit and miss you know sometimes it's harder to sell concentrate when it's a blend like that so you really have to be careful on how you mix these terpene profiles and you know don't make a flavor or something like that that somebody won't enjoy sure okay so there's there's there's some risk involved that's when you're taking a blended we're these strains wash together yes okay so you put it all together washed it and then pressed it because I've definitely heard of some companies and places where they'll wash one or the other and then they'll actually mix the heads after they've been dried but you is there a reason that you prefer that method because it's all you know one cohesive product within the bubble hash itself okay you know when you end up working with bubble hash and depending if you're in a cold room or not you know you end up getting you know those greasy patties bubble hashed a little bit harder to work with so when you have those two flavor profiles within that bud form and it's also where you're gonna have your highest terpene within those genetics itself so you know that's gonna come out in your flavors and stuff you know some are gonna be more dominant than others which is also why you got to be very careful on which ones you mix together got it so for example probably some of the gas your OGS are gonna really overpower certain blends for example exactly okay you know like even on the fruity side as well you know you're gonna end up with certain like tangerines and stuff like that to just overpower everything within extracts so your clementines and your tangerine they're gonna take over that you're making absolutely so another question I know that probably a lot of people watching are really interested in hearing about is when you're picking strains to wash well ones that are really gonna dump and be worth the time and energy to do it can you tell ahead of time like how do you know what's gonna work do you test it like what's your process there yeah I mean that's one of the you know common ash questions I think within the industry and it's you know a very challenging part of deciding on what material to choose from mm-hmm is working with the right growers I'm working with people who are open to feedback and not stuck in their ways I'll start in the garden right yes yeah definitely start in the garden you have to have a good product to work with okay and so really developing those relationships and making sure not only are they handling the products properly while they're growing it so they're not damaging the heads but also well they're packaging it up for delivery to you you know take for an example you know you just cropped all your buds and you're going into freeze them well you have a bunch of bagged stacked on top of each other that aren't necessarily frozen yet so you're gonna wait think about what that's doing to a trichome head you know it's just extremely delicate very delicate right you touch a trichome head usually you know it will explode all right yeah cool so super super interesting stuff when it comes down to actually making something that wins an award like this I mean what goes into that what are the judges looking for and in your experience having entered a couple cups and competitions and having won awards across a couple categories yeah what advice can you give for other people out there who are trying to win their own hardware here yeah I mean I think knowing your competition is really important looking at past competition sure results are also very important looking at those profiles of those strains that have won past Awards within those categories within that award so knowing what the judge is won mm-hmm and you know some competitions allow you to enter more than one per category yeah and so what that allows you to do you know normally if we enter a you know let's just say the 7 10 showdown for example which is the one that we won right here um we were allowed to enter up to 3 into whatever category we wanted we entered one into you know some of the stuff and then we entered 2 into some of the categories as well okay what are some other categories you guys are working with um just tool it around which we took first home first place home as well nice you know we did pens ok those live rosin fans of those live resin pen who live resin panel yeah and then some disposable live resin pens you know just both types of hardware okay and then we also entered wax shatter and crystalline which is diamonds so it sounds like it's probably not a bad idea to enter as many categories as your lab is able to if possible absolutely I mean your material and your products also got to be there um you know you don't want to enter something you don't think you have a valid chance of winning you know because they are very costly as well to you know be entering multiple things into multiple categories which is why we normally stay to one entry but if it's a category that you never know what the judges could be looking for or it's a newer category let's say for example rosin you know you can go with like you know like you're saying earlier the more oh gee you know dominant you know and that judge panel might be you know more of a G type of flavor profiles or the more that fruity type of profile so it gives you kind of wide range to fall within the category of the judges as well gotcha so you guys entered more than one into the Robin category is that we're saying yes we entered two into the rosin category for this strain specifically since this is what we're reviewing today the punch-drunk but if you could guess what why do you think that this one one what about this strain you know before we sample it here in a second like what's special about punch-drunk you know ever since it came out of the machine I mean even all you just knew it it was a beautiful color the clarity the smell in aroma that we are achieving off of that rosin even as its sat in the jars changing consistencies we you know just everybody in the lab kind of gradually went to it it was kind of like a natural thing and like you know we have our solvent list room which is you know separated but you know obviously with high terpenes and rosin extraction and stuff like that you can you know smell them through the doors sometimes yeah and so people are coming in and solving this room the day that we were doing this extraction and you know obviously things like that get picked up by the techniques or the texts that are working that day right when we were talking about entering this competition it was a no-brainer for us this is the one that we thought would do it but we also entered more of an OG dominant profile as well so this one's definitely on the fruitier side yeah given given the name and cross that you're describing together okay cool so let's take a look at this obviously in the video you guys are already gonna check out some sweet macros also really like this package design school got some gold foil on it yeah that's nice thank you can I can tell why people are picking that up on the shelf yeah so here's our little glass jar I'm gonna take a little sniff here so yeah it's really strong yeah like surprisingly strong when you open it I've been to you know labs all over the place done a lot of this and and this one it's just I mean it'll stink up this entire room yeah absolutely no question you're like I'm really trying to dial in it's got you know definitely the tropical fruit I mean some people if I was gonna guess it be some kind of like banana II papaya sort of smell it's hard to nestle made this one so unique you know like knowing kids put their direct finger on it it hits so many different peoples you know wants in a concentrate which was really exciting to see and it was just off to smell alone which can also give you indications yeah of what ward winning concentrates and stuff that you know could be good as other products as well so extremely stable consistency this has been sitting out today for a little while at room temperature most of the time a lot of these strains are gonna be kept in a freezer or fridge during the day and then this however you can just tell that this is really buttery its sugared up just a tiny tiny bit it's almost glistening here in the jar I mean it kind of feels like somebody brought some giant fruit bowl into the room here that we're just smelling on set natural terpenes sweat even at room temperature you know that those terpenes start to rise and separate from the actual rosin itself you know and like I was saying earlier you know the jar itself was you know so potent within the lab that every chunk up the whole place it just stinks up the entire room I mean I can't even imagine we got a graham right here you know we're talking how much were you guys pressing at a time I mean we were pressing around 80 to 120 grams at a time so before we try it because I'm really fixing to I mean I don't know how much longer I can talk about this before we give this a shot but consistency is one of the biggest things when it comes to winning awards is what you've said in the past and what we've heard from some of our other brand allies and some of our other customers can you speak to the consistency aspect especially of rosin specifically and how that matters yeah so consistency in your final product is probably one of the most important things you know especially being a lab or somebody who isn't selling it directly to that customer being on the wholesale side of that equation you know what that does is it allows you to you know no matter who's grabbing that gram within the dispensary um you know it's that gonna end up staying that consistency so making sure that you know you manipulate your material in a way before it hits the shelves so that it stays that consistency whether you're going for shatter or wax or butter or sugar or you know micro diamonds you know some Jam tech like all of those different things and consistencies those are all done within the lab so making sure that as you give it to your packagers that you have a consistent product that you're selling as a consistent product it's nice and stable yeah it's ready to go it's not changing on it so that the judges and someone who is you know buying this off the shelf is you know they're they're getting what they're seeing on the Instagram absolutely you know and that's probably one of the most important things you know for me is being able to provide the industry a consistent product awesome so cush masters is located in Boulder Colorado proud to have them here in the state so we smoke out of a couple different things on one of our previous episodes with Roz and Ryan sometimes we've got a nail we've had episodes where we're putting honey on toast today we've got a puff coke what's setting are we gonna what what do you recommend I call it low for me anything that you're smoking I like to go at a lower temperature so half frozen in general nice low temp always yeah cuz you're gonna be able to get those terpene profiles better and you know if you burn terpenes too and you have too high of a terpene rich product you can actually you know full heart right harsh yeah so you know I really like to enjoy these high quality yeah it's almost like a fine wine right we're not having our dabs medium well today okay we're we're gonna do this proper so all right let's give it a shot you want to load me up absolutely cool [Music] that's strong what are the what are the potency results on this one um so this one we got the box right here so yeah take a peek Matt just like as I'm sitting here it that that fruit that I was smelling in the jar just kind of working its way back might not like toward the back of my tongue you know sometimes certain concentrates they have like a little bit of an after flavor but man with these premium hash robins but I mean super clean and you can tell you know no throat irritation whatsoever there I mean granted I'm not someone who's taken the world's biggest abs but that's one of the biggest things for me is just it's clean I'm not coughing my brains out right now you know I can actually sit here and really let this soak in and I can enjoy it and it's just like I mean that is just really tasty stuff I mean it feels like I'm down in Central America at a fruit stand trying to pick out what pineapple or banana or you know pie I'd like to have and that's the stuff you have to hit and those profiles that you really need to you know what it's like what sounds good to you you know and it's almost like that uh technicians you know responsibilities as materials coming in to identify identify and try and work through those rows in order to achieve those high yields those flavor profile combinations all of those things to create phenomenal concentrates yeah because sometimes you know and why sometimes we do do mixes is because for run size totals for lab optimization you know sometimes you know one girl only grew you know let's say 4,000 grams of this strain and so you know we have a eight thousand twelve thousand gram capacity per run frame we go bring them together if they fit together and they mesh to go there you know why not and you know stay at full optimization yeah so I mean the the sum of parts greater than the individuals here big-time especially for this one good stuff yeah I mean the profile there is just comes together so smooth and so elegantly and like the actual almost like fruit like flavor that it gives it's like you know almost like smoothie yeah so now that we've been sitting here for a minute and I'm starting to like really feel it this is a review after all this one's really nice I'm finding that it's really relaxing it's got a pretty calming quality you know it's gonna be a it's almost like a little bit of a head huh definitely definitely a little behind the eyes in this particular one I don't get that with a lot of strains yeah but it's not overwhelming you know I wear some head high as can be you know and like it's kind of just like step back in the couch you know beat still you know not I'm here I feel lucid exactly but I'm also a lot more relaxed and I was a couple minutes ago and you know that's what we really try and hit within you know concentrates because it is such a representation of the plant and what its capabilities are yeah and you know people out there gonna experience it different ways but I can see why the judges were really pumped up about this one it is it is pretty clear once you get a chance to try it absolutely absolutely you can find us you know pretty much you can go to coach masters calm we have a map on

like I'm talking about like everywhere that I go everyone asked me as I have you tried seven ten have you tried seven ten and I've tried their hash rasen but I have not tried their what their Weed Man so I'm very very excited to get into this but for before we get into this man I have to give a big shout-out to today's sponsor man gothic comm where they sell bracelets pendants and rings super sick

in the description below man go show them some support because a support of today's video guys alright honestly we're like I said I was ready to be smoking on both of these guys they both cost me around this one right here was $80 this one right here with $70 so a total of 150 it is a pretty hefty price to paint but you know if you want to smoke it you got to pay the price so we're gonna save this for the second part of the video we're gonna roll up a nice joint with that but first since I do have my rig right here MJ Arsenal and my torch all the goodies right here I think the only thing we can do is take it out all right so I'm already have been dabbing it so I'm bushed shut you guys in there it might be missing some so this right here guys is what I have currently right now and it's honestly some of the turkeys like 710 miles has to be some of the turkeys but I mean wax that I have ever smelled man like the the Terps in this thing is just so amazing and I kid you not man stabbing on Psalm endless like wax is just so freakin good man thinking about doing is heating this up for 30 about 30 to 35 seconds and then waiting about 45 seconds to 50 seconds I feel like that gives it the best the taste and it's not very harsh smoke yet you get very very milky clouds so let's go ahead and torch this thing up boys cheers i heated it up to 35 seconds I'm gonna go ahead and let it go till 45 just because I had you have the window open man and I'm gonna go ahead and meanwhile though let's go ahead and choose a nice little chunky one just to start things off boys because honestly I have I've only dabbed it once today and I feel like man this one's gonna catch me because I'm telling you the hatch frozen is so smooth that you only really feel it when it starts building up in your chest man so we're about during your second day and still got another ten and yeah let me know in the comments below if you've ever tried 7-10 labs man if you have make sure to hit that like button on this video and if you haven't we'll hit that like button anyways cheers boys oh dude that tastes so freakin good I already look at the depths what's already coming in that was the perfect dab I kid you not watch this I love waiting all right the reason I love waiting that much time it's because you just get the smoothest hits the milk is hits and then the Terps now I'm tick I'm talking about I can taste everything in this I can taste everything man it's phenomenal and after you're done your your nail should look like this man you should still see oil in there and man there's seven ten laps definitely definitely worth that's the $80 that I paid man I would I want to buy the Percy that one right there is $100 I believe or $90 so if you guys want to see a video on the percy live rosin let me know in the comments below like this video and subscribe so auntie dad dad got me super high and I just remember that we also have to smoke another joint so I'm probably gonna step aside from the dabbing and we're gonna go ahead and crack this open man this oh gee Kb your see you guys see how fresh it is man I have not opened it brand new look well you can see the seal right there man this is gonna be the first time guys that I have ever seen this flower in person and I'm kind of excited already it's like a little glimpse right there so let me go ahead and pop this sucker out oh dude oh now just follow my computer oh dude it's as beautiful as the oh oh my goodness dude yo I know my camera is not gonna you know pick up every single watch I'm gonna have to use my phone for this guy's but this but right here you guys know the phone camera picks up every single trichome everything that's why we use the phone and look look at this guy's just look at this you guys are gonna be in all all right so this is the og KB right here look at this dude the beautiful orange hairs I'm talking about look at the trichomes look at the purple little stems think you know oh my gosh the curation on this dude is just so phenomenal I haven't even smelt it what does it smell like I have never saw anything like this smells like me but it's just a different type of legal officer dude this is like literally one of the most aya peeling pieces of bud that I have ever seen and now it's just a fact so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna roll this up I don't know how much help I roll it up but dude this thing is just so phenomenal looking I don't even know if I want to break it apart but I just want to just put this in a casing and just put it in a corner of my room do you never touch it so this thing looks so phenomenal I'm gonna like I said I'm a roll up a joint and I'll see you guys in a little bit right here we got the joint right here man it's honestly I rolled there I've been getting so much better at rolling these freaking joints so all we got to do now man is pretty much just burn off the paperboys and basically here you go here you have it your perfect little or joint now I want to say there's like 1.5 in here man but does it really matter though because I just want to know how good this is man I want to know if it's worth the money because this this 8 was more expensive than a cookie so he hasn't gonna be the first one to find out boys choose only through the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal statement choose wood hmm after that personation I did get a little bit of some a little bit of paper tape so [Music] whoo it's actually pretty freakin smooth man so far so far I do i I did roll these in some raw hemp papers organic hemp so there might be another reason why but honestly so far it's burning a really really smooth I am getting a lot of earthiness from this plant itself and it's giving off a little bit of a sweet tone but honestly it tastes very very very good like it's something like I know we did we'd look I know we do sweet guys but you can tell the difference from something that is properly cultivated to some [ __ ] that you know that that is make that is being made in mass amounts and things like that like these guys they take so much pride because it's small batch all the time they never they never overdo the batches man because they want to make sure that every single planet that they grow is growing to a hundred percent perfection on their own terms you know but so far man I haven't I'll any clips of this this it's burning very very smooth like I'm telling you let me give you guys a little close-up of pilots burning right I rolled it really really good it's burning even all the way through you got the little tip right there if you ask them to see that and it's an enjoyable smoke man it's currently 10 o'clock in the morning and usually whenever this is the first time I'm smoking also unusually whenever I smoke first my eye like I started coffee or [ __ ] to him whenever it's the first work of a bit but this is smooth like I was saying and it tastes very piney earthy but it's enjoyable as heck I don't taste any really fruitiness flavors of it no I taste a little bit of sweetness but it's not overpowering this thing is chiefing though it's obviously getting me super super baby I ended up waiting a little bit after taking the dabs and then just I mean I rolled out the joint while I was high a [ __ ] and then I roll I waited a little bit more that way I could get the full effects because I didn't want to go from being a super stone because that was a super fat that that I just took I don't want to go from being super stoned to you know getting even more stunning I even being able to differentiate the type of high that I'm getting in the flavor because my mouth was dry as heck I kid you not that dad got me so tight but I was brick and faded for it for a minute I'm not gonna lie I have not been that faded in such a long time and it's such a good feeling now and then they finished chugging milk for sure all boys that looks like we're at had a lighter fluid on our centers [Music] this thing is McEnroe I hope you guys like the new location I mean I'm just in my garage and I hope you guys not like the current location man I was gonna do it in my car but I was like man for a special day like this my mind let's just do it somewhere where you know you guys can see all the smoke around me not the same setting give you guys some a little something different I just in used to Macanese well I'm about to finish this whole joint to the face but not on camera because that would literally turn my videos so freakin long all right guys so my review for this ogk be it's about its max I'm high right now like super faded and it's such a different height such a soothing high but usually with wheat it's either I don't get high or I get like you know too high to the point where I don't even enjoy the high because my head's hurting but this right here yeah but this one right here is honestly just hitting like every single aspect bro like I'm sure I know I know for a fact after I'm done with this I'm probably I'm probably gonna have a better good morning you know I'm already have me good morning gonna go better and EMA like like I would say though I would definitely would not mind dropping another 150 hundred 60 on some 17 laps again like because there I'm telling you they're rosin smack nice it was just the perfect gap the turf through there the taste is there that I was there everything about it was so good and I feel like usually I don't get that feeling with other concentrates you know with other flower so yeah man I would definitely purchase this again time though I do want to try the Persie rosin you know want to try I'm not even sure what kind of strain this was it was like an indica or sativa guessing it's either hinder guard hybrid so next time I want to try just a straight-up indica and see how much that smacks me because I feel like if this give this is smack at me right now I can only imagine what a straight up in meter with you so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and hand out the video here because I'm high as a hack right now I just want to enjoy the rest of this man hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video and you know and if you did go ahead and leave a like comment and most importantly hit your boat with that subscribe button and reach so let's try to get 400 K subs I mean 40 K subs boys that's the next call right and you guys are gonna help me do that guys so I hope you guys have a blessed day and we're out", "_fnIWDmaWHA": "I would up y'all there's a little bit of controversy on the field of lyrics from my song top down off the lg bomb

fee knows I went through them all I found him and when I found him I named him and biscotti and I named gushers not only did I select them and name them I went on a worldwide campaign with the [ __ ] and popped it off I rapped about it in my songs I brought it to the artists to athletes to the elite smokers and you know influences in the world I was repping biscotti so hard I almost named and Scott Storch is my witness the big pescado biscotti like literally almost named to my album biscotti and I rapped about it in so many songs and trust me I really campaigned hard Frodo's and on transe is this without getting into too much detail this doesn't even matter I'm in a good point in my life if I put in all that work and all that effort to hand select to name to blow this [ __ ] up globally everybody knows about biscotti because of me and I'm not no longer participating in that and I can't grow myself and I have it and I can't use the names for anything then why would I [ __ ]

of my friends actually bred purple punch no disrespect to you but do we get got somebody I see Packers up 30 different ways mm-hmm keep it", "NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "1J_dRK1nz4E": "[Music] yo what's good

i'll be honest with you since i started dabbing i've tried shatter i've tried diamonds i've tried sauce i've tried uh rosin i've tried live resin batter i've tried almost everything except the hash what is it hash [ __ ] wash or whatever i think that's what it's called let me know if i'm wrong in the comments let me know if i'm wrong all right remember bro i'm new to this dabbing world and [ __

description for you guys hey until next time peace", "vlO1jMDzCKg": "yeah it's gonna be a long video all right today we have six courts inserts here all loaded up with different strains some are live resin some are rosin I got one giant diamond here and I even got some sugar wax here and I think that's what I'm gonna start out with this is some Blood Diamond from Agra kind this [ __ ] looks nuts and honestly it has the consistency of like a sponge has an amazing terpene profile it tastes straight-up like grapefruit it feels like it's like a charcuterie board of dads I'm about to have a very good time here I'm sure not everyone knows what quartz inserts are and how they're used but I have an entire youtube video where I break it down super in-depth so if you want to learn more about quartz inserts you can go into the description of this video and watch that first but from here on out in the video I'm going to assume that you know what quartz inserts are and how they're used it's gonna bang your nice and hot alright now that our banger is going down let's get a quick little close up if we can bounce away boys this might overflow not gonna lie one piece breast oh he's so good my god [Music] Piper hush sorry you guys got my dog with me she's away from all the deaths not bad I got a little doggie gate set up here that's oh my god man this should taste so good I'm not kidding my girlfriend even like hates the smell of weed and she smoked this [ __ ] and she was like damn you should get more of that that [ __ ] smells good that definitely raised the temperature in here holy [ __ ] those nice big shout out the cop products for making these courts inserts that fit their bangers perfectly not to mention the tweezers they make so handling them when they're super hot is really like a stress free hassle all right that was a nice way to start the session I like legit sweating a little bit yep that's what what's nice about that inserts is honestly there's not a lot of residue that gets on the banger you even want to overflows it's so much less than one actually gets an insert so it really does provide your banger from getting that like Chaz dusty look to it all right that was nice but next I'm gonna dab some rosin this strain is strong wah but number two from olio this one really impressed me even from olio it smells and tastes amazing the look on it's great honestly even when it smells it's almost [ __ ] clear let me show you all right I have number two get it nice and close time a little bit the smaller Deb but I still think it's a beige decent size with a desert no wait till it really starts to smoke up in here and then I go for it this one's a little hot oh my god Oh oh my god it's like one hit left boom Wow that [ __ ] is nice definitely burnt up though with that on that one oh my god there is nobody left in there even even when it was that hot it tasted [ __ ] good man these inserts really make the dabs last longer I sort of got I mean this time I went a little hot but even if you get a nice low time they [ __ ] Rock here alright threw down four to go [ __ ] alright next I'm dabbing on some good goog live president from Moxie I really like this drain it's a sativa hybrid but honestly it's just a straight sativa in my opinion it gets me so [ __ ] high in that like cracked-out sativa way or you're super chatty and like just want to go out and go do something like this is definitely a constraint for on-the-go I'm not gonna do a close-up on this one [ __ ] it let's see the whole function of the Ring all right let's drop it already Melton Oh Lord dude I'm already so [ __ ] big this is gonna be a long video yep it's gonna be a long video oh my god [ __ ] give me that little nose tickle oh my god I gotta hear at the chit still going Jesus Christ this is what I was talking about [ __ ] oh my god all right tap it out there I swear it man that is a straight sativa it's not considered one but like that rosin that killed me and that one's brought me back to life halfway there only three left alright next I'm gonna dive is a little scary it is like a straight THC a rock but it's actually just like lab rats and diamonds without the live presentation it it's one giant rock so this should be interesting this [ __ ] has no flavor obviously because there's no turfs but it just has this like weird chemi taste like I'm honestly just not a fan I'm kind of dreading this stab out of all of them because this is a giant [ __ ] rock of it but wish me luck this I do want to go in a little bit hopped out because since it's just straight THC a really all it needs is heat to get the full effect alright let's watch this [ __ ] melt so weird has just no flavor [Applause] a little bit left it holy [ __ ] alright it's done it's [ __ ] done oh my god dude I'm not even gonna lie there's so much replaying in here you know what that means cheers [ __ ] [ __ ] me oh this is all hot [ __ ] no bueno just has no flavor so weird the highs crazy on this stuff but it's just so weird now there's no Terps I need the Turks terms all right give me some turps next to reindeer the strong Nana I'd add this a bunch on my last video has like a super great banana terpene profile I love anything that tastes like banana I don't know why it's hard to come by and it always is just like such a nice experience when I get it and this is live rosin by the way so definitely gonna have a good Turkey in profile all right as well doing a close-up let me know if you guys are enjoying these little close-up insert drops actually really enjoy the inserts so I'll keep doing videos like this if you like it so let me know swinging a little hot on that gotta take a little breather there [ __ ] [Applause] [ __ ] me oh my god dude Robin just hit you different really does who love it great experience I'd love rosin rosin for life all right last but not least I'm going to do some only old life present my eyes are feeling heavy so I'm glad those videos under this drain is guava breath ever get what the number is let's go with guava breath to the number really never matters to me when people are like Oh what watermelon skittles is is the 16 or the 48 I don't care to that exact i honestly should but my memory is just not strong enough for that I'm like I know I like that strain or I like the sound of it I'm grown with it like it's talking me to remember what number is better make sure you ask look like you definitely enjoy the video if you made it this far I appreciate every single one of you guys watching let's do the snap I'm doing a low temp I don't care if you judgment boom get in there we're ready [ __ ] dodge like that holy [ __ ] [Music] oh dude I'm so lit goddamn alright that's it we're done it was really just an average life present nothing crazy but I honestly didn't need anything crazier than this sesh I'm already [ __ ] lit this was a lot of fun I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did don't forget to click like

"[Music] and watch it [Music] what's up DD see Scott it real and gum a friend Levi from low temp plates on the line what's up brother man I'm doing good but you know me man first off Levi always supports a DGC was that the 7-10 concentration celebration appreciate your brother yeah absolutely thanks so much for having us out we we really love being there yeah yeah okay so Levi is gonna be my source I've talked it to naazy I've talked to a few people and you're gonna be my source for a freeze dryer or at least you're gonna be my information source right now because I'm a little bit confused what I'm thinking about is I got this greenhouse coming down count aloud 1015 pounds whatever the hell we get from it different strains and I want to make some something good out of them something a little bit better than just shatter I was thinking about the laws man I can't have 15 pounds right but I can take 15 pounds and wash it down to I don't know a few ounces or a half a pound or something like that that would be legally okay no yeah yeah correct yeah I mean as long as you're lifting your your your legal jurisdictions whatever local jurisdictions that you have yeah that can definitely help cut down your total weight now if I'm thinking about it because I am a little bit of a public figure if the cops were watching me and listening to what I said if I was blasting this all with butane is that technically illegal or am I able to do that yeah yeah by far technically illegal yeah okay okay so that's where the rosin press comes in so if I wanted to play by the rules I could press you press this match pressing twelve or fifteen pounds of flour seems a little ridiculous and I'm kind of setting you up for the softball because we don't press flour correct well so you can for a simplicity sake right it's you know for commercial operations is a very easy skewer to throw on on the shelves for home users who just shop at dispensaries it's really nice just because you can go grab some flour I'm from a hair straightener stepping on a hair straightener all the way up mm presses so oh yeah you can but it is quite a bit of work if you're talking 15 pounds or whatever it is then yes yeah yeah you would much prefer pressing the hash equivalent of that it's not alive too big big key to sink your pressing flour you're pressing dried cured flour not like fresh frozen flour so that's what I wanted to get into so the difference remaking shatter and making live or live rosin is that everything has to stay cold right everything has to be frozen so we're gonna harvest it wet we're gonna instantly freeze it and then we're going to wash it in and then once we freeze it we can take our time take out some you know half pound at a time wash it in bubble bags or a bubble machine and that's where I'm a little bit confused so I've got my sifted water hash that comes out of the bubble machine how do I keep that life yeah so the best thing that you can do is as soon as you've washed it is to you've got two options the old-school way would be to freeze it and then microplane it and what you're trying to achieve there is a long-term slow dry so that can range from four to about seven days within a humidity and temperature control room okay so you've got a microplane what you explained micro planning yeah so micro micro planning it would just be freezing the bubble hash that you take out of your bags right and then at when it's frozen you're taking essentially like a grater a sifter and you're sifting it up on to a lot of people use cardboard but what you're doing is that you're trying to break it up into small pieces so it can air dry over a slow period of time on within this time you know you do experience a little bit of oxidization right they start to see things get a little bit darker versus using a free char and that gets me into the second option which would be just slapping it in a freeze dryer and that process pretty much she you pull a deep freeze on the product ranging from you can adjust your times anywhere from about seven to ten hours and that matters seven to ten hours I mean I can't freeze it for a month so you you can't actually freeze it for however long you really wish okay but the the freezer ours they are a little and they're a little bit on the pricier side yeah so it's not something that I would want to run over a long term unless you have to you know so a more conventional freezer would be a little bit more suited if you want to freeze for freeze that hash specifically for you know 24 hours or a week or whatever it is before you can actually do your full freeze drying process all right then yeah that makes sense all right so we got to the where I've got the bubble and I'm putting it in the freeze dryer now so now I just I leave it for what a day a week yeah so you've got essentially two times that on the freeze dryer that are important to you there's there's a free cycle and a dry cycle so the first part of the freeze dryer is to deep freeze the entire product right so seven hours for most product is is plenty depending on what you want to do guy so let's say seven hours there and then there is a dry cycle at the end which there is a vacuum pump and it pulls vacuum on the chamber and then there are trays within the freeze dryer that warm up slightly to allow for the tip furnace for the moisture to evaporate out of the product out of your wet hash and then it pulls a vacuum and it cycles through that so and we're not talking about we're not talking about evaporation here this is sublimation we're going directly from liquid solid to a gas and going away and what evaporation is solid to the liquid gonna do it yes mmm-hmm interesting and it'll take chemistry yeah then so you're just opening up that drain valve and whatever moisture you collected that has been sucked into the they'll just drains out so that is the water from your from your hash all right so then the last step after and how long how long does it take to do that how long do I collect into the drive yeah the dry cycle is usually around 10 to 12 hours okay longer if you've got a large freeze dryer and you're burning it up with a ton of hash if you've got full trains yeah you can easily turn that into 24 hours or so okay okay so then I want to get to the last step because you've given me the whole process I really appreciate you taking the time to do this but the last step is we gotta press it in a rosin press and this is to make you know super high-quality live or awesome am I wrong is that the last step and we just immediately take it out of the freeze dryer and do that or how's that work correct so you know depending on what kind of micron bags you're using ranging from 70 to 90 maybe up to a hundred micron okay first it could actually be full milk so if that's what you prefer you can pull those those microns out for full no and those will typically it's only your first wash that they'll be that they'll be full milk but everything else it can be squished into inter hash frozen just like you mentioned and how many washes do you do out of a bubble teas and bubble bags and the bubble later mmm machine yeah it depends on how much agitation you're getting with with washing machines are getting quite a bit more agitation right 10 or 15 minutes and you can run up to about five washes if you want but at the end at those fourth and fifth maybe even six washes if you're just trying to get everything out they're gonna be the lower quality more contaminated product and you're gonna receive less yield per wash what I'm what type of yield like on a total throughout the six washes you do on like a half pound what type of yields would be looking at so pretty much what most people like to refer to is just to rosin percentage yield so let's say and this is all fresh frozen so good yields would be considered like three to five percent range to rosin off with fresh frozen weight so you just have to run the numbers off that so if it's no 1/2 sorry what was the numbers again just let's do two pounds max is that's 900 grams what can what do we get off that yeah so you do have to remember that's not that's fresh frozen right that's only obvious that's what all the water weight still in the cannabis cheese that's not it dried at all yet so we're gonna have to give all that away and because we'd be correct so yeah if you have two pounds of fresh frozen that would be 900 grams right and let's say you got back a really good yield it's the genetics are good certain really grown you did a good extraction on it let's say to rosin you get three percent yield on that okay so that would be 90 grams yeah it would actually be 27 see why I don't do math with mana right that's why you hold on to the money all right sure all right so 27 grams out of out of okay that's not a 2 pounds of fresh frozen I mean but 2 pounds of fresh frozen Jesus that's gotta be like a half pound to a third of a pound of dried flower yeah yeah approximately they say if I'm not mistaken it's somewhere around you lose about 80% of the weight if I didn't say it I was gonna yes somewhere around eighty percent of the total way around all right all right so I'm thinking this alright so here the reason we were bullshitting is because I'm like alright so if I do this what's my investment you know what's the ROI I just went and bought a gram at the dispensary for $55 for a gram of live resin or like yeah is even live resin not life awesome I do find the rosin have a little bit more flavor I dig them a little bit more I like the consistency too it's easier to dab but um so I'm just thinking if I'm buying $50.00 grams a gram really doesn't last all that long might be cool to have a year's worth of worth of a live rosin hey you got a separate fridge I did some quick math of that 80% water weight chair go away when you dry it right if you if you dried it to that dry weight that's 15 percent of the driveway well which is 15 percent return to live hash rosin that doesn't make sense 15 percent active ingredient on some really Bank bud and and the 85 percent is no material plant material yeah definitely makes sense yeah and I mean you'd be lucky to on a large scale to get that kind of return off of dry pressing flowers and it's not going to be nearly the same quality bubble hash rosin as a rule of thumb is significantly better and quality than flower roses agree with you more Sarah tried both and there's a huge difference yeah yeah exactly all right so come on help me out what's my investment here so I need a freeze dryer first off bubble bags and the bubble later you guys sell them so we actually just started carrying bulk bags okay yeah so we really like those just for the the Frenchy full mil full mesh bags okay I really like those and they've got washing machines as well yeah so what do I got a couple hundred maybe three hundred bucks and a washing machine or some bubble bags yeah yeah you could always depending on the size so you can get down to five gallon right right to about 42 gallon bags [ __ ] as bit larger it's more material so it gets quite a bit more expensive but all in all on bags you don't even need a machine if you don't want to right let me just go with a bucket I with a spoon man my buddy used to make the a locking gank with a wooden spoon brother yeah yeah so you can you can really kick it very primitively and it doesn't take a lot of money to get started it just as you start to scale and trying to do larger and larger amounts to become more efficient that's when it starts costing a little bit extra money sure so we got so we could just end it right there if you want to buy a bubble later bubble machine and some bags or even just some bags and use a five-gallon bucket and some ice you can make really good water hash that way I will tell you the more you beat it the lesser quality is so if you're really gentle with it you can make some dank dabba bull I don't know if it's full milk but it's close whatever is not full melt you can just throw in a hair straightener thrown or press right over you impress that so you could press press that now what if we just want to go there and say hey I'm going to invest a little bit of money for quality and buy a good rosin press help me out I see him for 400 bucks tell me what the difference is between that I don't you see you don't sell no $400 presses do um so so actually how we started our business was that that smaller range I go for three to five hundred dollars just with the cage kids the plate kids at the time everybody was stepping on hair straighteners and everybody was trying to figure out how to scale so they were using the t-shirt presses in there right and then you know just growing up in Kansas and and seeing a lot of these shop presses around I figured why not adapt one of these to a rosin press so that's essentially how we started and the more recently Lucius made the more commercial setups and and higher processing and higher quality systems which are which are the V twos as of currently and so yeah you've got pressure gauges external palms you can operate them through electric means air hand you know they're open source so you choose exactly how you want to apply your force nice yep all right so so if we got a rising press what's it gonna cost us man for a good one yeah for for kind of a beginners home user setup that you wanna you know something that's portable all american-made lifetime warranty I mean the thing is bulletproof it's you know it's gonna last you a lifetime sure how many times is that so up to 20 tons which is 40,000 pounds of force so more force than you ever need but it's nice to have in your back pocket if you ever you know stacking multiple chips and doing a final extraction right what do we press that what's what's the force we press it yeah for the the force for flowers you're looking anywhere from about 1,500 to 2,500 plate and PS I got and platon psi is something that that it takes a small equation to get there but the formulas on our website if you just want to check that out but yeah that's how it breaks down and then for hash awesome you're looking anywhere from 800 to up to 2500 plate psi again got it so it's overkill what you what you're giving them yeah for sure alright and so what's that running come on what's that run my friend prices yeah brother come on DBC price yeah so if you're just if you want to start off with our intro systems those start at 397 that just sticks on any press in your choice this is a really good home user setup but for the more you say press you can go to harbor you're saying like a harbor freight pump or whatever I don't understand what do you mean yes yes that's the actual Harbor Freight brain okay guys so the downside of those is that they're a little bit larger so you may want to set it up and in the garage if you set it up in your living room if you have a girlfriend or wife they're not gonna like it good all right next the exercise bike man you'll be fine I'm sad that's all right so all right so right wow so this is pretty cool so I got a few hundred bucks in the bowl bags for 400 bucks I can get a press so so you telling me a home press yep yep and then if you want to go with something that's a lot more portable you're about ten inches tall you can just throw a bottle jack in those and they're really portable so if you're if you're hopping around from buddies houses to sessions or whatever on it you know you can tote that around with you those start around $1,000 that's shipping and taxes include all right so I'm thinking abut for under a G if I wanted to be a starter for under a G I could start making my own rosin correct yeah yeah you can even make bubble hash rosin for the air thousand bucks yeah and then so here's the big jump man you know me man I always want to go high-end I said I don't always want to go high-end but in my cannabis I do so if I want to go live with then I've got to go with a freeze dryer right mm-hmm yeah yeah so the main advantages of the freeze dryer is to quickly dry your material right so it doesn't leave loose terpenes is that when you lose the terpenes absolutely so if you're just air drying within a room you're also beating the heads up whenever you're doing that aggressive sifting you know that the micro cleaning that I mentioned earlier right so yeah it's a it's just a much better process you're keeping it cold so hence the live rosin aspect your because all you're doing is freezing it and then and then just getting that moisture out pulling a vacuum so while it's cold never really exposed to heat and it's much quicker as well yeah all right but that's a big [ __ ] step up man we're talking another couple grand if I want to get in get into the live business right yeah I'm minimum minimum so the only company that that makes free strives for our industry is gonna be harvest right and they make products ranging from 2,000 up to about 8,000 to like that still is very very very cheap compared to all other freeze drivers on the market because they're like full-on lab great equipment is that what the deal is medical grade stuff it's yeah it's pharmaceutical grade stuffs at it you know most of those machines will start around $30,000 so harvest rights really fulfilled a nice niche in the market for people like us oh very cool very cool although starting a - jeez man damn yeah I get that I get that yeah by the way so what you we were talking about if you don't if you're just drying bubble hash or freeze drying bubble hash guru doesn't let me say drying he gets my own estate but if you just freeze trying to bubble hash you don't need a huge freeze dryer right Yeah right right and so pretty much you've got you've got three different sizes you've got the small the medium and a large been on for most people for most small grows you get away with a smaller a medium I how small is it small so the small is the actual sizes on this guy so it's around a hundred and ten pounds and you can fit approximately two to three wet pounds of bubble hash inside of it no sweat that's a [ __ ] shitload man yeah yeah I mean that dries down to two to a portion of that sure but still yeah I mean that'll fit quite a bit you know that's full trays right yeah you can never make it work all right that soon what seems legit man it seems like okay I'm gonna figure for a solution for a home solution two grand three grants I've got about 3,500 bucks if I want to be in the live business no correct yeah I mean of course you can always hair dry right but yeah you're going to lose the live aspect of the of the rosin but don't make me get my calculator out but if fifty dollars a gram a bit guru could do this one is hit but at fifty dollars a gram how long has it taken it what do you got sixty sixty grams in order to recover that ROI if you're paying fifty dollars a gram at a dispensary you make 60 grams of live live rosin a it's great it be I've got five or six different strains in there and and B I cover my three grant you know I guess a three grand investment you could cover with three grand you don't have to spend in the dispensary anymore what sort of bet you I would spend it you know a couple hundred bucks go to that dispenser every couple weeks man yeah yeah yeah and it makes sense for for home growers for quite a few home growers if you are a heavy smoker or if you're supplying your friends and family that kind of definitely helps yeah definitely if you steal your buddies live rosin and tell them that you'll pay him back yeah yeah I guess still gurus live rosin for the air you know it becomes a prop at that point I love it I love it it cool man all right so I figured some [ __ ] out I appreciate it yeah I just wanted to share with the DG see you and I were texting back and forth yesterday and I was like man let's just do this for the DGC there's some really good information there you pumped it out by the way I really appreciate it Levi right on yeah absolutely and and you know as always we're just trying to put out a lot of information just to help everybody out because I understand it is really overwhelming at first trying to get into solve those expressions so you know we're putting out educational videos on on YouTube and are on our website so you guys are always welcome to try those out they're all free right and your so shout outs oh man where's everybody find it with your YouTube but your website come on yeah so our Instagram is just low temp period plates if you just youtube us it's it's low temp industries or low template so you can find a set either and the websites just low temp - plates com nice nice I appreciate you taking the time brother yeah absolutely thanks so much for having me I really like go chat with you guys all right you're right down in Denver you might see me soon he goes out just lonely at a freeze dryer in the lobby and and you might see me soon brother yeah yeah hope to see you sure well man take it easy brother yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] we're the pill to do [Music] true medicine [Music] Oh he hates the day [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "129tqQqNIjY": "what's up guys welcome back to my channel hope you guys are all having an amazing day i am going to dab it today so i'm pretty excited i haven't been dabbing it like i there was a while that i was just dabbing it every single day and i just stopped dabbing it also because i've just been low on concentrate and it's a mission to go two hours to drive to my dispensary and get some because here locally we don't have anything that's um verified and i don't know any plugs that sell some bomb like legit um concentrate so it is a little hassle but i uh we went to l.a yesterday so definitely has to be a review today and i'm super excited because i've heard really good things about this brand and the flavors that i chose [Music] also you guys look at my fingers so disgusting i freaking cut my finger at work um if you have watched my video you know that to like about three weeks ago i wasn't able to walk and this happened to me i'm like bruh like i can use my hand but i just have to make sure i'm not moving my thumb at all or like putting any so it just kind of sucks because i have to limit using this hand so i'm kind of like doing everything with one hand but you guys don't care you guys are like take the dab but i am going to be smoking off wonder brett quote me if i'm wrong if i'm sick wonder brett this is their cute packaging i love how this is um blueberry flavor and the packaging is blue it's beyond blueberry it's a premium live batter and this is the packaging for it here she is and i love you like having nails at sometimes because i can just cut the sticker off them like nothing oh cute can you guys see the blueberry right there like that and there's a w right here it says luxury you can taste i hope you guys are all dabbing it with me smoking up a joint your ball ignore that text messages um yeah let me know how you guys have been i want to know about you guys as well and it smells so good and it looks so good too y'all see that i wish you guys can smell it smells i smell that blueberry definitely i kind of just want to keep my nose in here it looks so precious too precious to smoke but um i would also like to thank every single one of you guys that is rocking with me through this journey um it's been pretty difficult and pretty shocking and i just never thought that i would be here sitting in front of a camera posting daily like videos even if i haven't put in posting like daily but i just never saw myself putting myself out there so so much you know guys we're soon gonna hit 3k so i will be having another giveaway for 3k so go ahead and tell your grandma your grandpa your uncle your sister your boyfriend whoever you need to tell so you go subscribe oh it's very creamy like it's very like i don't know it's very easy to pick up but not it doesn't look like a product that is like will fall off i don't like well not that i don't like but it's just harder like i had this imperial sauce it was too saucy like i would pick it up it was obviously like very easy to scoop up but it just like drips so whenever i would smoke it out of the aura like i would get a lot of wax around the the top of it not even inside because it would be like everywhere i'm like bruh and like i've had wax where you just like tip it over and it falls but as you can see it's pretty easy to scoop up and it doesn't fall and it smells amazing amazeballs as i will be taking a dab off my aura baby i haven't found a name for her she should be like what what's the purple name because she's lavender maybe like a violet let's call her violet she's not like a dark purple but it'll work violet i'm just gonna forget to call her violet every single time and my aura is dirty don't even judge sorry five clicks to turn it on have it on the red setting i think i'm gonna switch it up to the blue setting just take it up all the way to the notch one two three change the setting and bam the moment we've all been waiting for cheers oh can't tell it's heating up or not oh yeah it's not okay now it's heating up it gets confusing smoking in the daylight because you can't really see the light as much but right now i'm able to see it more than i thought i was going to okay so that was definitely a nice baby dab since i haven't dabbed it as much i'm like underestimating myself i'm putting like less wax but i already finished it it was bomb though like i can help taste it i just think that i needed a little bigger dab um since i do smoke more you know but i feel like if my like a beginner friend was where to um dab it out of this one they would really like it especially because it tastes very like smooth and you get a lot of that blueberry flavor so let's go ahead and take another dab cause they it's get it has me sweating but not to the point where we need to be does that make sense like if you ain't sweating you ain't diving right period like if you're in cuff cuffing coughing your lungs out like that in the dab dude all righty i just don't want to finish it's so pretty i mean i need me a plug like a legit plug that i trust that sounds like not these grammars but like the [ __ ] three gram concentrates the [ __ ] like bigger ones you know what i mean i don't know how much they are but i know they're much bigger i think it's why do i want to say an ounce is it an answer box i don't know but i know i've seen it and it looks so nice i'm like i'm jealous but one day i'll have the opportunity it would be so cool if i even had my own dispensary too um i think you might need a little bigger dab this is a dab that i have just because i'm trying to get a good cough everyone looks so [ __ ] nice in there [Music] dude oh [ __ ] a little bit more moment when you don't have to add a little bit more or not if you're debating it just grab a little bit more advice from rusty sometimes though that dab that you'll be choosing the first time it'd be like good enough too i don't know if you guys have ever like [ __ ] i over practice too much you're like dying as [ __ ] should be like that it's alrighty i have a packed you can see right there packed oh look at my finger too that's oh my god i finished it okay that was a much bigger dab and a better dab honestly it's so smooth like so smooth i can go for another dab dead ass like i can probably go for this dab it's pretty good size dab um it's i can slowly feel like a hitting but not where to i want it to hit does that make sense i just think that if you smoke on a daily basis and you're like trying out a new wax or a new product don't estimate underestimate yourself well don't underestimate yourself you know because you got some lungs just i would just start off like slow though like how i am too because then you don't want to over pack it to the point where you're just letting your wax go to waste i think i'd rather i like it more that i'm not over packing it too much to the point where i don't finish it because then it's like i can't save it you know i have it went to waste and at least i'm smoking a little bit more if i'm packing it a little bit more and more you know adding more to it every single time to see how the dab dab dab is like the you know what i mean like does anybody do do i make sense does that make sense please somebody not your head but so it's not like any black residue black residue at all look at like there's nothing left like i can tell whenever i leave like wax in there i'm like ah like i usually have to reheat but it's burning it so nicely and even evie even and it's not burning my my throat at all like for the blue setting i used to like be scared to smoke out of it because it would burn my throat but then it just it just depends on the concentrate too and this one's so smooth especially for the highest setting on the aura is above a thousand so that's hot as [ __ ] but it was so much like so much flavor um i really liked it i have a few other strains that i need to try out and that i will be reviewing i actually picked up their flour as well because they do um make flour so that's dope as [ __ ] um catch the next video perhaps being a review of the flower and another dab um and yeah let me know down below if you've heard of them uh or if you've tried them out and what you think um but i really liked it and yeah i really [ __ ] with it though um let me know down below if you prefer dabbing it or what's your favorite way to smoke and i think dabs is pretty cool and easy and until next time guys don't forget to like comment and subscribe to another subscriber to me nothing every time i have a new video i can do this so fast now back then i would have to redo it and redo it and redo it now i'm just like it's just it just comes you know yeah say hi to the [ __ ] sky and until next time bye", "AwEqGWo7dag": "all right where we out here growing for rosin growing for Roz and then I've ever grown strictly for rosin man there's entire Gardens which I mean there's whatever idea whatever 240 watt or 400 light Gardens right strictly all for extract we've seen it cuz what do you extract or he had that with the death star right it was like a work for me a seven percent extracting strain awesome flavor and everything percent by weight yeah that means yeah throw an ounce in you're getting you're getting more than a quarterback Holly that's yes sir that's a producer I don't believe it guys somebody tell me wrong in the comments show me some stuff I guess I just called the extractor a liar but no when you're growing for rosin there's a couple different phenotypic expressions of the plant that you're looking for because the the main thing and we talked about this on Wednesday the plant waxes that make up part of the trichomes right different strains can have different like ratios of plant waxes to cannabinoids making up their trichomes and ideally you're looking for a very thin waxy cell wall around the outside of the trichome so that instead of there being a ton of waxes they're either extracting or are getting left behind and you're not yielding off of you're getting all cannabinoids coming out of this question here because what's up everyone I just purchased a new rosin press no smasher which we talked about before for you he's one of those little on one press is a pretty decent price I'm looking forward to playing around with it I have just read results from pressing rosin or I've just read that results compressing rather than have a lot to do with the strains my next girl will be a heavenly influence for pressing rosin so my question is what's at the strains work best for rosin pressed are there any type of characteristics I should be looking for in a strain and what will make for better awesome so this is about to pop up you see let me just kind of say what lemon because they put a lemon GF here right made a great a great some good information yep so just absorb this case says people say hash strains and things like gorilla glue number for supposedly high yielding and if you search for ever strange I don't even tell me that my whole life man what's that sorry I've been just trying to make commentary I'm just trying to fit in did any quality strain covered in a decent amount of visible trichomes should do well but the results can vary massively from different phenotypes and a strain pack of seeds from what I've seen with varying consistency of yields for each right so keeping cuttings of what performs is very important this is where you go back to growing if you're a rising grower you're probably not playing around too much with I'm gonna have you know you're gonna grow this ain't like a production grower you're gonna grow all the same strain to a degree if that's the one that really works for you but 11g F goes on this talks about different temperatures I appreciate this really good information the difference between a high temp and low temp and pressin and then I think a lot of people lean to for the most quality though pressing that bubble hash like one step further when you're making that bubble hash you freeze everything make your bubble hash like ice hash right our ice water hash and then you freeze dry the bubble hash that you've made so that you're locking in all those terpenes none of them are able to volatize off and you're just taking all the water out at freezing temperatures so pretty much then you can press that and that's like what they call live rosin you have a freezer oh are you making up things now I I do yeah it's been like three grand along the oKed I'll be right I've rosin I didn't even haven't heard that one yet new thing yeah the ice cream place but like I was saying the different phenotypical stuff you can look for in the plant and then there's hormonal things you can do to play with the shape of those trichomes and how they actually how they are there's certain like plant hormones methyl Jasmine 8 being wise jazz monic acid methyl Jasmine is just another name for Jasmine ik acid if you're using that in gibberellins and you'll have to do your own research and experimentation on this to find the right dosages and everything they can plant up they can [ __ ] your plants to where you have like footlong foxtails but if you use them correctly in the right dosages you can start to play around with the shape of that trichome and make it a bigger trichome that is also filled with more cannabinoids and with less of a waxy cell wall around it so there are some hormonal things the plants look like hell when you do this to them uh-uh like that they do foxtail but like completely out but if you think about it when a plants Fox tailing rapidly right it's putting trichomes all over the fire tail injure when we're we're not we're service that's right more surface area more trikes and as an extract grower we're not looking for back appeal on the plane at all it doesn't matter at all what we're looking for is the trichomes it could have annoyed terpene and flavonoid yield from the plan yep and we want to try and minimize the amount of waxes that are coming out with it because either that adds another step you have to do acts and clean up this the extract you've made or you're left with waxy paraffin waxes and that stuff people don't want in their shatter I was gonna say it if guru didn't matter I think we did it I think we covered it I like it you guys check out that post there's some really good information thanks lemon gf for contributing", "rap9wQIVTgY": "[Music] answers to all the questions you've ever had about weeds what's up and welcome back to our month-long celebration of 4/20 here on the strain show today we got some sour cush live diamonds and sauce from harmony extracts they call it live nectar cuz I got the little hummingbird logo this stuff is testing at seventy five point three five percent THC let's see what it looks like check it out it's in them a little cute little wrapper oh wow oh it looks fine I've got some big chunks in here got a lot of sauce in here it's got a great color oh it smells so sour and so cush oh god it smells like a million plants all in my nose at one time oh it smells good I wish you could smell this when you turn it sideways it just all runs down it looks so cool yes I'm excited for this stuff woo the box says you're in control harmonize your responsibility well we're about to scoop out a humungous tab and harmonize our whole brain let's go [Music] oh that day's good still going yes good yeah good down no it's nice and smooth down very tasty dab as well it tastes just like it smells and it smells really sour and clunky oh it's so good [Music] Oh crushing my whole esophagus stuff it's hard it's very hard meaning it has like a very thick cave your chest in kind of hit a really nice hit that doesn't sound nice but it is nice whoa that's a puddle that's a sticky q-tip after two fat dabs this I'm already getting a nice high coming on it's all in my head I feel like mr Mackey when his head got real big when he took LSD maybe not quite that high but I feel pretty good this stuff tastes real good to taste crazy good like before I can even get the carb cap on I'm like wolf wool with the taste it's just like it smells super sour this stuff looks fire it smells fire it tastes fire I like the high a lot this is some good hash for 4/20 I think I'm gonna dab some of this on the live stream on the 28th I hope you sit in your photos if you want to be on the live stream on 4/20 that's just a couple days away don't forget to sit in a photo and your name to strain show questions at gmail.com and I'll throw you on the live stream don't forget to subscribe to the strand show so you don't miss any videos for 420 months and not what I'm all dads I'm about to go right here and smoke some weed so come on let's go", "JN0WOUvLjvI": "all right everybody and welcome back to another video with token Tim 420 this is a medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 all right like say hi to everybody out there if you haven't subscribed make sure you hit that button ring the bell do whatever you got to do um so tip me some love all right today we have a few for you guys move live ice water rosin we got the triangle coach coming at 83 percent THC zero CBD supposed to be an indica let's roll a little bit of this and then we'll talk about it and we'll take a dab at the end so make sure you stick around to hear me cough like an idiot let's get a little paper here spread some rosin on it first we got a you got it down there where you can see I have to use it a little bit focus this comes directly out the refrigerator and it's really it's still really soft see that just comes out really soft you get the paper fix you guys see down here most of the time when I get to concentrates out of the fridge I got to hit them with a lighter first before they'll spread but as you guys can see this spreads super super easy now I don't know what that means yeah if that makes a difference on the product or not though like I said it's just real even in the refrigerator it's real it must put a little bit more on there so which makes it easy to spread on joint but if you leave it out at room temperature too much I imagine it will go back to liquid real quick like I said it was more of a liquid when I got it and more of a clear clear color all right we got some of that ground flour from true leave what the hell was this year Grand Slam bubblegum and women og so we got our expensive ass this flatter comes out to what something like four dollars a gram or something it's 25 a quarter the Ronson's 95 a gram but I did get this at the grand opening at move so it was 25% off which made it you know closer to 70 something I think now also moves having a grand opening Monday in Bonita Springs so hopefully they have a little better inventory than they had it Northport I might try to go down there and hit that one too you know there are 25% off I also wanted to give a shout out to the moose call center they've got some of the nicest people working in there I've talked to Dustin a few times up there he knows who he is he packed a little bit back in there I'm sorry guys concentrate on the joint for a second there's my poker - poker - I got that packed in there like I said I've talked to Dustin a few times in there he's a real nice guy I never feel rushed when I call the call center there I called for this order here last week when Northport open and I talked to I believe it was rain it was a hippie name sorry but I believe it was rain and we talked for 45 minutes on the phone because I got the iPhones got a calendar so you can go back and look and it took less than five minutes to put the order in the rest of us was chit-chatting about her fiance her fiance also works in the gross Center their move and I've talked to a few other ones like that that work in their call center and their husband their fiance their girlfriend will work in the cultivation Center or the dispensary or something so it's more like a family-run business you know you see a lot more families in there but like I said I really do like the call center they watch a lot of our videos Celtic tech meet you 69 proper major quality they said they like you guys too so what they do on their breaks is sit around and watch YouTube videos but like I said all of them real real real nice personable people I guess I never met rain and we talked for 45 minutes about all different sorts of stuff so I'm not saying get lonely and bored and start calling the movie call center guys go back to this resin rosin whatever you wanna call this so this is live ice water extraction I'm pretty sure this is what you're going to call like a bubble hash and then they're going to turn it into a rosin so it's all Sullivant les extracts this was supposed to be an indica it's not really an indica for me there's a little tiny bit there it smells good but I didn't much care for the flavor of it I don't know if that's the strain that's why I'm hoping they get a different strain in it the mid Bonita Springs grand opening I will try it again hopefully I can get it for that discounted price but it really almost been 95 on it but I didn't see nothing that stood out that made it 95 to be honest I would rather have moobs gold for 65 30 bucks cheaper so hopefully they get that back on the shelves soon I don't even think this is better than their other what was their other $80 for their rosin I think the flavor of that was better but like I said I'm not sure if it's a strain so we will try it one more time or a couple more times you never know with us smokes good spreads on the paper good but it's just not one of my favorite flavors and the facts really wasn't like I said an indica for me it didn't really make me tired I smoked one of these last night I actually smoked two of these the other night and the second one did a little better but there was two back-to-back decent-sized joints - so that's all I got to say about that one the call center we did that said it did have flavor - it was you know nice I don't say nice wasn't a mix of flight you know like the one I had from one plane I think was a little too much mixed a little too much going on this one just was I don't know how to explain it get our carrot from the fat ass blast I'm making something for my carrot - so plus I don't know if it was because it was then or what but you guys can tell there's even a lot less now and we just spread it a little bit on the paper and we just got a little bit on the davit over here I don't think it went as far as other projects did for me that was another thing I didn't really care for it didn't it doesn't last as long it didn't spread out as much I'm not using more of it I seem to get more useless out of either concentrates put it that way and you guys can see how much I spread just a little bit on the paper if we got one of our little Terps over here if it'll help spinner and we got the little round one alright so we're gonna do a cold start so what you want is a carb cap I found it's best to do it's got so much [ __ ] going on in that going this rig right here I found that works better with a carbon cap on there then you're just gonna heat the bottom of this up and I try to they if you notice I put most of the wax over on the one side I'll try to heat back here on the opposite side in that corner so you guys can see it too and then when the wax starts to melt and starts to vaporize you'll see a little bit of smoke coming off of it starting to storm so the doors gonna slam there guys and then right about when it starts to vaporize real good I hit the other side to kind of heat the whole banger up properly there we go starting to bubble up say we guys can get it in there for you don't think I eat it that too long ah sometimes at old start can even get you see that to me the best way I can describe it as a soapy taste I don't know I know it's not so big it does hit a lot better in the UH an array little does in the joint though whoa I gotta start taking more dabs I guess it's been a while since we did all dabbing but if you guys compare that first pic I sent to this one alright first helped us up sorry I mean there's probably two maybe three more dabs in there my biggest complaint is I don't think it went as far as the other products I had it seemed to go real quick it didn't stretch alright that's gonna be it i'ma try to catch my breath finish up that joint if you guys tried moves live rather so let me know what you guys thought if you had this straight or a different strain let me know like I said I am looking for it in two different strains so I should have a new device tomorrow to unbox and we'll do now shadow review tomorrow whew so until then guys keep on token", "laaAMPz9E_A": "[Music] [Music] [Music] yo what up youtube welcome back smoking with small town you know the rules kids bounce on up out of here and if you're new to the channel click that [ __ ] down below and subscribe today i do got an extract review this one's coming to you by stizzy the strain that we are going to be reviewing today is called the rainbow cake i've never heard of rainbow cake but i wanted to try it i did get this at blue fire dispensary in merced california and it is going to run you around 30 for the gram this is some curated live resin it is an indica and it is coming to you at a 78 and a half percent on the thc and 0 on the cbd what the hell's the product at oh [ __ ] i got it right here in my stizzy fanny pack so let's take a look at it the rainbow cake by stizzy it's got a double seal on it i like that take a look at that i mean that looks really good and like always if you guys want to see up close picture of the product check it out as you can see there it looks really good we're going to get some loaded up here and ready to go it has the consistency of like a diamond sauce it's got like little chunks of diamonds in there or little rocks you know and then it's like saucy so it's got like a diamond sauce consistency cheers everybody i hope you guys are having a great day i tried to look up some uh information on what crosses like you know what strains make up rainbow cake i couldn't find anything on it i could find rainbow kush and a few others and i didn't want to give you guys the wrong information so if anybody knows what makes up rainbow cake let me know we're going to take the first dab out of the yoshi rig those of you that have been watching my reviews have seen it before still got to get a new banger for my email so i'm stuck with the torch i actually like the torch though i'm used to it stizzy i i reviewed i think one or two of their whoa [ __ ] of their uh the actual flower god damn i need to get a new torch i hate that [ __ ] this torch if you overfill it or some [ __ ] it starts doing that [ __ ] she could be dangerous if pointing in the wrong direction burning all your goddamn eyebrows off yeah but oh like i was saying stizzy i've reviewed their flower i've done at least one strain review for them i have never really reviewed their the uh the pins like the dab pins like these here the stizzies i've never really reviewed them because uh when i was smoking stizzy that was before the dispensaries were around so i've tried i've smoked so much dizzy back in the day that i kind of got tired of it truthfully okay we're almost ready let's get this dab in cheers everybody i hope you guys are smoking on something good not no [ __ ] but stizzy overall is a good product so i have high hopes for this uh rainbow cake i've actually tried it a few days ago but i wanted to do the review for you guys let you know what i think about it so cheers let's go in [Music] okay first initial thought it has great flavor i really like the flavor it's like um it's like sweet or fruity almost but it has a little gas on the back end of it but it's like sweet to me it was smooth it wasn't uh too harsh it didn't [ __ ] my throat up it did pack a punch i felt it that's why i'm coughing right now but so it has great flavor it's like i said it's a little uh sweet or fruit not fruity but i don't know sweet and um with a little gas on the back end it was smooth and it packed a punch but like everybody knows two for the review we got a beer here let's get it poured up and everybody please remember to smile are you here all by yourself yes where's your man dead where's your father dead okay the second hit we will be taking out of the drizzle puffs i haven't smoked out of this in a while i got it out of the daily high club box hella months back when i actually subscribed from the daily high club box i don't think it's worth it the daily high club boxes i don't know to me personally i think it's trash they just keep giving you the same [ __ ] over and over it's little rinky dink products and they give you one small ass little [ __ ] bong or something in it this was the coolest thing that i got out of it the rest of the rigs they're not even like functionable you take one hit out of it they clog in the bottom you gotta shake them out stupid it's like a novelty more than anything so sorry i went on a little rant about daily high club [Music] they were just i don't know 50 bucks a month or 40 bucks a month for a bunch of [ __ ] that's what it seemed like okay let's get this second hit in so i can give you guys the review i do really like this rig because you can put a lot of water in it like not like a super lot but you can put a good amount of water in there and it doesn't get in your mouth so it's got some good filtration in it like the yoshi rig you can only put so much because it will start going in your mouth or you know it's only enough room for a little bit yeah i thought i'd use two different rigs and so i didn't have to clean out my banger entirely because i hate taking dab after dab without like taking the [ __ ] thing off and cleaning with alcohol because the banger starts getting black and it looks like [ __ ] when you don't my personal opinion oh vance global just came out with their delta eight uh smokes so now they got the cbd and the delta eight i have not tried them yet as soon as i do i will let you know what i think about them the cbd cigarettes though they do [ __ ] work i gave them to my dad cause my dad smokes cigarettes and he no longer wants to smoke cigarettes he wants to switch to the vance global cbd smokes so that's a big win and those delta eights supposedly got some thc in them so they they get you like somewhat high but not high i guess i don't know i'll try it when i try it okay the rainbow cake by stizzy got sidetracked here get the second hit in it does pack a nice little punch it's not too heavy of an indica but i feel it cheers big ears oh [Music] okay damn it that [ __ ] packed a nice punch right there that was a good dab that was a nice healthy one okay i think i got enough information to calculate it up price at blue fire dispensary in merced california where i got this product it's gonna run you around i think it's 29 or 30 out the door for the gram great price the look and the smell is really good it doesn't have like a crazy smell to it a little sweet uh but the look of it looks really good it's [ __ ] like clear and looks like some crazy diamonds uh the flavor is what i like the most about it it's got a really nice flavor it is smooth it didn't [ __ ] up my throat you know i am coughing because it's [ __ ] it hit me hard in my chest and [ __ ] but it didn't [ __ ] up my throat and the high is definitely there it gives you that indica lung expansion that i'm looking for so overall for my first experience trying live resin or stizzy's live resin i'm gonna give their rainbow cake the 8.6 this is a really good product i highly recommend it if you guys have tried it let me know what you guys think if you try it because of this review let me know what you think about it so i'm giving it the eight point 8.6 or the 8.7 [Music] the 8.7 it's really [ __ ] good i highly recommend it i'm still coughing i'm getting higher and higher as i'm sitting here so uh the rainbow cake by stizzy it's getting the 8.7 that was my review i hope you guys enjoyed it until next time smoking with small town oh yeah", "1jFtPFQ8z9g": "to the people that are new to dabbing and see all these consistencies and get confused and just don't know which one to try i just say try them all today i'm going to be dabbing on some garlic cookie sauce from grassroots let's crack the seal on this as you can tell it's super [ __ ] goopy i'm gonna try to keep it as level as i possibly can jesus christ dude the whole room just reeks of garlic trying to do this without spilling any there's literally just like a straight up layer of turp juice on top of it we're gonna mix this up a little bit make sure all those diamonds and terps get mixed together nicely just look how gloopy it is you guys this stuff's so hard to handle on a dabber bloop but it's fire i love the function of this recycler that's the perfect little drain let's get our dab ready i'm not kidding when i say this stuff's running you guys you really want to make sure you have a dabber that has some sort of scoop on it so you can make sure you get a decently sized dab all right let's go you guys [Music] this [ __ ] is crazy you guys i know i talk about garlic cookies a lot on my channel but the aroma and the flavor that you get from this is [ __ ] nuts like that aftertaste just stays for so long the dab is gone i've already taken it but i can still just taste that insane garlicky feeling and these are some great effects too i swear to god that one dab does the job but this is some live resin sauce most people just call it sauce though it's a pretty popular form of concentrate there's a lot of different terms to describe extracts like shatter butter batter crumble sauce diamond sugar the list goes on and on these names are used to describe the consistency and the malleability of the concentrate not the quality everyone has a preference on their favorite consistency but none are just bad off of the consistency so just don't overthink it when it comes to quality of an extract it really just comes to what the quality of the product is going into it and the knowledge and experience of the person who's actually doing the extraction process it's not like chatter means bad sugar means good but sauce is a pretty popular form of concentrate if you've been to a few dispensaries you've probably seen it or if you know a few plugs they probably got it it looks like a million tiny rocks swimming in a pool of like yellowy ambery liquid diamonds are their own form of concentrate typically they're on the bigger side and much less terpy where sauce is usually super tiny diamonds sometimes there's a couple big rocks in there but usually it's so small where you really can't even see them mixed with a crazy amount of terpenes but those little tiny diamonds are where the cannabinoids are so that's where majority of the thc is stored and the liquid portion is live resin terpenes so there's a super high percentage of terpenes in there and a super low percentage of cannabinoids which is why it's perfect to mix the two so the sauce might not get you very high alone but when you mix it with those diamonds it just packs a punch you get pretty [ __ ] lit and the terpenes add an additional entourage effect so it really does add an additional kick to the thc but i say it's time to take another dab [Music] uh oh [ __ ] this drink feels so awkward to hold i'm not gonna lie oh my god that train is [ __ ] crazy oh [ __ ] those terpenes are always super [ __ ] heavy on sauce so i usually try to make sure i get the strains i like when i pick it up i know i said that they're all pretty much the same thing but the main difference between sauce and every other strain is that it has like the most intense terpene profile plenty of other concentrates of high terpene profiles but the most overwhelmingly high is typically sauce and the terpene profile on this one is [ __ ] insane it's five point seven percent mercy and almost five percent carry off i mean four point five percent limiting and that's just the top three it's total terpenes is 18.4 if i did my math right like that's a lot of terps sugar also has a high terpene profile but it's a little bit more easy to work with let me open this jar real quick and show you what it looks like for those who don't know all right this is a fresh gram of bubba kush sugar as you can see it's still terpy but there's more of like a solid consistency to it there's still some sauce in there but there's much bigger diamonds that are a little bit easier to handle and work with these two are made of exactly the same stuff but have a completely different consistency but the main downsides the sauce in my opinion or how liquidy it is like i just said you really can't keep it in a hot environment you can't put it on its side for a long period of time and it's hard to work with on a dabber at least if you like big dabs like using a little needle like this would be so hard even using a scooper like this you really can't get too fat of a dab but looks are deceiving with sauce and sugar in my opinion if you're used to just only dab and shatter and you really haven't experienced sauce or sugar like you really don't realize how fat of a dab you're taking if you just scoop up a giant bit of it but again not all sauce looks exactly like this sometimes sauce looks like a mixture between the two concentrates that just showed you where they have a couple big rocks in there but it's majority that like super small diamond but a lot of companies really aren't that great labeling this stuff i bought some sauce before that was just straight up sugar i've bought some butter before that was sauce there's a little bit of like subjectiveness that comes to it where they're like i mean it's sugar but it's super terpy so let's just call it sauce they do try to label it as accurately as they can so that you can get a good idea for what you're going to consume nobody likes pissed off customers so they try to make it as accurate as they can but i'd be lying if i said i've never had it be a little off but to the people that are new to dabbing and see all these consistencies and get confused and just don't know which one to try i just say try them all it's the best way to find out which one you like and which one you don't and it's like none of these are bad technically so you can try shatter you can try sauce you can try butter and you can see which one you like the best but i say we take one more dab before we head out of here this time i'm not gonna use the diver though personally this is my favorite way to dab sauce hey that's fire now that's the right way to dab sauce a lot of people message me and ask me to like clarify what consistency of concentrate they have it's mostly people that get it from the black market because it's not labeled but i feel like i might start a series where i go from concentrate to concentrate and just kind of show them off let me know if that's something you'd like to see in the comments below but click like if you enjoyed this video if you made it this far you probably did and leave a comment let me know if you want me to make this a series and if so what concentrate should i do next don't say live rosin i already have a whole [ __ ] video on live browsing and don't forget to subscribe i

beat the last one the grandpa's stash now this is the highest thc of them all that i'm pressing today i'm hoping that we get a really nice solid uh yield out of this we shall see you know i'm trying to be as consistent as i can here and anybody that's followed me for a while knows may not always get the hugest yields but i get i get pretty pretty good deals on a fairly consistent basis so just loading this up let's get the lighting together here and move the camera around and give you your your view of what's going on so i'm gonna get this as close as i can we'll see how this works and there it is right there abracadabra move back to improve focus yep knew it was gonna do that all right let's get you right there okay we got her loaded up make sure i got the lighting where it needs

patient you want your green turned into gold for you i'm the man you want to see here we go i will be adjusting the camera from time to time as i uh get closer to full pressure on this because it's going to get harder and harder to focus in on it may have to move the camera around a little bit please be patient with me as i try to get this done as efficiently as possible giving you the best view i can alright big shout out again to the healing center for having all this high quality high thca flower in stock uh when i go to the monroeville but they also have some in washington and cranberry uh really good folks always take good care of me definitely recommend them okay now let me just make sure you can see what's going on okay see how that goes i need to make further adjustment i will but it's already starting to extract you can see it in there hopefully let's see if it'll let me move it just a little closer okay see if i can do this get it right up here there it is there it is hello look at that happy trees happy trees people i have spent all day today enjoying making rosin very very nice rosin i love this plant and it loves me back and you can learn to do this too make sure you check out my youtube channel become a subscriber i don't monetize any of my stuff uh i am not making money and doing this i'm strictly an educator and an advocate always remember that i never charge patients to press for them nor do i charge to do events uh of course any cash donations to help me offset costs are greatly appreciated but never required i've never required payment uh this is about trying to help people make better medicine then veterans helping veterans do because i have a veterans focus in my in what i do but i'm open to all pennsylvania medical patients who have a valid card and bring me dispensary flour that they want turned into gold baby turned into gold isn't that gorgeous that is just looking so nice just a little right there that's max pressure for me i don't need gauges don't need timers just watch what the plant's showing me that's it that's all i gotta do look at that just beautiful i'll pack it up just a little bit but you see how it's progressing across the plates you can see just glistening the bubbles are moving you can see the movement all that extraction's happening simple heat and pressure actually it makes better meds than all the stuff they use uh solvents for in my opinion because you're as close to the parent plant as possible which means all the medicinal value is intact it doesn't have to be added afterwards because it was never removed this is the way to go this is the future of concentrates in my opinion it's solventless it's just not quite as efficient up front but you recoup everything in the back end with edibles and tinctures and all sorts of fun stuff nothing goes to waste with this process okay let's see yeah we're not adding any more pressure to that it is starting to production is slowing down you're not seeing huge things going on over here just the last little bit and we're going to pull this and then we're going to see what the yield is folks here we go one two three [Music] hello beautiful look at that beautiful medicine right there yes gorgeous now to turn the press off finally give it a rest it has done excellent work today get this down here readjust the leg real quick and give you a great view of this medicine okay all right i'll bring it in at a decent distance here it's right there dial it up a bit and here we go i know i'm enjoying my friday night i know that those that are in kutztown are probably enjoying their night too hope you guys are having fun no blowouts no contamination and look at this gorgeous medicine right here so give it a real quick pass on the cold plate here suck a little bit of heat out of this thing doesn't take long in this room i keep this room cold for a reason look at that stuff's gonna come up quickly all right everybody g-leaf and row kush with this again you got your top four or five putting out the fire on a regular basis and everybody else is hit and miss terrapin sometimes and i mean sometimes comes up with something that's really really impressive alera's even rarer than that but g-leaf prime gti grassroots they are just coming with the heat on a regular basis how gorgeous that medicine is right there and i am a quality over quantity guy if i wanted to get a bigger yield and i just wanted i didn't care about the medicinal value yeah i could cook it at 210 220 to 30 and i could get another maybe 10th maybe a little more but it wouldn't be this quality it certainly wouldn't be as medicinally valuable because you'd burn off all your terpenes and all the medicinal value be gone that's the thing you know you get to things like thca sand and diamonds and all that that none of that's medicinal it's not really medicinal they sell it as such but that's not really true this is full spectrum whole plant cannabis concentrate made without the use of chemicals this is real good medicine real good medicine and let's find out can you see it yes you can alright here we go now see unlike the grandpa stash this stuff is releasing a lot nicer i treated them all the same you know this is strictly the difference in the strain in its particular for one of a better word personality i love this because they never get bored and we got 1.84 fantastic well folks this is the last video of the day thank you for joining me stay safe stay medicated be good to each other i'm out", "sqvHlTH6nqE": "a YouTube Alex here back again with another quick video get up rise and Erie today and grab me some goji goji goji goji one gram of the go GOG I did pay a hefty $96 for one gram of this go GOG by Moxie yeah 96 bucks do they are taxing but as you guys know Moxie is fired probably the best that's the best concentrate you can get his moxie I liking the best probably prime and pharmaceutical rx so right there in a close second as far as quality Moxie's the best go GOG and I said and this is coming in at a total of ninety point five nine percent cannabinoids eighty seven point seven five THC a right there let's get this bad boy open get a few dabs I did get me a new torch I bought the torch with the the automatic lighter on it igniter pretty good these work way better then them little tiny torches butane ones you buy it head chops they're like that big they suck and then you go out and like it leaked just to last you at least a couple weeks even for heavy dabbers maybe a month if you don't have much but I go to them about every couple of weeks cuz I be dabbing heavy so it was that all right go GOG one gram of the sugar [Music] cool funky funky look at the go GOG sugar as one DRAM as a nice hefty pile there looks like a gram to me get you another zoom in close-up look at that that is go GOG buy Moxie 90% cannabinoids a couple dabs of this and let you know what I think of the go GOG I did have this before so I you know that's so I know it's good is I had it before it was really good was one of the first ones I've ever bought by Moxie was go GOG when I first got my medical marijuana card that's true story so this is my little works good get the snow he's a little fast let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comment section let me know if you've had the go GOG by Moxie before I like to burn off a lot of the old stuff get it red hot and burn off down a little [ __ ] yeah this is coming in this is a hybrid we got to tell you that it was packaged on 514 of 2020 so really fresh got stuff we set my little timer here yeah so 514 it was packaged it's pretty fresh live resident sugar not too big of a DAB a little dab you try it out small go small first Cheers go GOG buy moxie Wow got a nice very nice flavor it kind of reminds me a little bit of the Alpine og similar to that with a little bit more pining this to it it almost tastes like the lemon OG x Alpine OG it's kind of close to that kind of similar to that for me but this has a lot more like heightening flavor to that very good though go GOG very nice let me get another dab and use my other dab tool over here switch up to a cold tool we'll get it a nice that's a little bit fatter a little fatter bugger there on there look at that one we do that one now that's a pretty fat one decent size I'm so used to having a lighter I always go to reach for my lighter because I just got this like yesterday and I'm still new to me that I don't need a lighter anymore because mostly I use vape pens and now with this no lighter needed anymore kinda I always go for a reach for my lighter and I'm like wait something different do another job that you dived for you guys on this video I don't want to make it too long and it said it was a hybrid go gog giving you the basics one gram I paid $96 for the gram I did have five dollars off eight points so I paid ninety one dollars for some reason the grams are priced $96 really uneven number for some reason but it's how they do it at least eerie rise that's how they do it nice and hot set what timer I like sitting a timer because it gives me an exact I know that when I heat my when I heat my thing one over here a bowl up to red-hot that forty seconds gives me a perfect cooldown time you know trial and error so depends though if you get a cheat that's a cheap banger if you get a better quality banger probably might stay hotter longer but I bought this one for seven dollars a smoker friendly yeah Cheers let me know what you guys are smoking on smoking on the go GOG by moxie excellent that's got a really good flavor but really like pop and the flavor pops highly recommended if you haven't tried it try it go GOG by Moxie it's fire that when I'm really

podcast i'm in the studio just got done recording an episode go check it out thanks again for watching i hope you enjoy and learn something new happy growing hi my name is nate owner of grower's house one of the top suppliers of cultivation equipment in the world i help grow resource equipment and put together some of the largest most advanced cannabis growing operations i am constantly looking for the top products and methods needed to grow the best cannabis join me on a tour where i get inside access to the industry's leading cannabis grow ops this my friends is canna crips [Music] i'd like to tell you all about a brand you probably haven't heard of in the cannabis industry that's making some serious waves down here in arizona growth sciences is a cultivator bred out of cannabis industry veterans who have an unwavering focus on their team and the quality of their flour and extracts so much so that many of the connoisseurs within the arizona market line up at the door when they drop inventory at dispensaries across the state and they sell out fast we had a lot of fun on this episode as you see collaborations come together with breeders cannabis photographers and industry friends but that didn't stop us from taking breaks to skateboard and practice some jujitsu sit back relax and let our team take you on this exclusive first look at some of the best cannabis growing operations in the country we're here on your rooftop sunrise i couldn't think of a better way to start the day and tour what i would consider one of the preeminent facilities in arizona so guys why don't we talk about how gross sciences came to be so i started growing cannabis in 1997. i met mike in 2016. he owns a dispensary in washington dc with all the retail experience i had the cultivation experience and our dream vision was kind of to build something out in arizona my vision of cultivation was always the same the highest quality when we looked at the arizona market and the state license market it was truly devoid of quality we saw that gaping hole in the market we didn't see any companies talking directly to their patients it just was a mess and there was this ultimate race to the bottom when matt came to me with his idea i'd been working on starting a dispensary here in arizona i called our other partner john atamucci and was just kind of telling him the story about matt and this vision there was something though that i knew was legitimate and it was like all right if i'm gonna take this chance you know i think matt's the guy that i want to do it with so growth sciences from the beginning was meant to be a b to b to c company we want to make products that delight the consumer and frankly we want to be the best cannabis company in arizona and everywhere we go you guys just have this hyper focus on product quality and customer interaction customer satisfaction this is a building for arizona we wanted to be an embedded part of the community here however you contact growth sciences inevitably you're going to end up talking to one of us and this was built for the patients and you know if there's one thing that i'd love to see come out of this this project we're doing together that we're so excited about is that they really get to see that there's 37 people that show up here seven days a week in it for them and that they're the exact same patient and consumer that's out there delighting the consumer is in our dna and customer service has been mandatory since day one you know customer service builds trust and we think that trust is a competitive advantage customer service has illuminated a lot of blind spots that i think we would otherwise have which is so important with the high risk business that we started in this industry as crazy as it is so i think being accessible and being engaged with the community is a driving factor for how we got here so what are the future plans for growth sciences right now we are actively fundraising to get a dispensary here in arizona and really i think close the loop on the customer experience from cultivation all the way through retail and also we're expanding our facility by about 4x it's important we don't bite off more than we can chew organic growth or none at all you can't force this you know anyone can come to market in arizona and launch and go buy one get eight free that that doesn't build loyalty that builds a one-time purchase which you may or may not make any money off of but it doesn't build loyalty we'd have never done a special our specials are transparency a clean product having us there staying in contact that's building a relationship we're always pushing the envelope here we're always taking risks and i'd love to think that our patients who come to these takeovers or get our text message alerts or are on our facebook or dming us on ig know that they are part of this extended team and in every decision we make they come up and i think that is an extremely healthy approach to cannabis that's how we founded this company these are our principles and as long as we're in charge that's how we're going to proceed well guys on that let's climb down this ladder and do the grand tour let's go let's go okay matt so give us the master class look genetics phenotyping mothers teach us i'm an old-timer in this game right i mean i've been in this since 1997. what you're going to see as you walk this building is basically old school techniques on a larger scale in a search for the absolute most boutique cannabis we can provide on a commercial level to the patients of arizona and i'm not about reinventing the wheel people much smarter than me taught me what we do here at grow sciences and i stand on the shoulder of those giants i'm looking for the next gen to really show us the future i want them to invent i want them to be creative ask every question and then take what i started and make it the next grow sciences so there's 36 family members at gs they're the biggest wheat snobs you and i have ever met well you've traveled a lot more than me and cannabis maybe you've met some they tell me how it is you know old man what are you doing this is crap and i'm like okay we're out on this like let's move on from that um and we know we have a winner when everyone's thrown darts at it and it survives so it's super exciting it's what makes this place in some ways very very dynamic and you know you were mentioning that you're um you've actually gotten a little bit more efficient because there's some new technology out where you can dna test products change the whole game it's quite simply changed the whole game so back in the day a year ago uh you know for the last 24 years of 25 i'd get a seed pack you'd crack it you'd put them in the flowering room and you'd spend the next 48 hours going psychotic looking for balls to pop so you know male versus female right and you hope you get it out quickly enough so it doesn't seed out the whole room we've been blessed the whole community so we use delta leaf right at propagation so after we've got the rooted clone we take a piece of the tissue send it off there and they sex the plants for us so before we've vegetated a single plant we know if it's male or female that's got to be saving you i would say maybe six figures a year minimum easily i know you guys are on a huge phenotyping push right now and i really want to get uh up close and personal with those plants showing off what we're doing in this phenotyping room um i think you're going to be pretty happy we are packed in here like sardines sardines absolutely so let's run through you know your guys's phenotyping process because that's what's going on in here you're in the jungle let's not kid ourselves you're staring at 47 different cultivars um there's 280 plants between these two rows we're in a massive phenohunt what are some of your uh i guess most optimistic strains you have going on in this room okay optimistic strawberry guava nose look i mean that's no joke nug size arrangement look smell it's just fire i'm beyond excited so but the whole room is filled with them uh runs times mendo breath orbidos it goes on and on but some of the really special stuff in here is one of my good friends umami seeds you know blessed us to run a lot of his gear before he released it arizona is going to be the first people to experience his new lineup in rosin and flower and that's a real honor for arizona and it's certainly an honor for us to provide it and i was blessed he actually came down here to see and see how his cultivars were doing as we come to the finish line so yeah let's bring him in and let's show them what's up so i'm here with umami seeds and i know we're keeping your identity covered but i want to learn a lot about your company so first off you know you guys are up and coming you're blowing up right now and you've partnered strategically with growth sciences and they love your product you know the reason i like them so much on top of the quality right when they run new genetics they can show people what it can do right i like them as showcase figures i get to come back and physically dive through and pick my favorite you know for umami seeds uh what what's your strategy and philosophy for figuring out what you want to bring to market so umami is a japanese term it means the fifth flavor that flavor you can't necessarily put like a descriptive term for it's just it's delicious somewhat savory it's not necessarily sweet or salty or bitter right it's it's umami so the tagline is flavor over everything it doesn't taste absolutely incredible i'm less interested in it that's the first bit you you experience right you open the jar you smell it you want it to smell amazing you start to smoke it it has to taste amazing the effect is great but it's kind of the third thing that happens i like to experience new flavors but if i have something that i really like i might bring that back to the table never released anything twice but could use it as a jumping off point for something else something better constantly pushing the envelope constantly new flavors exciting terpenes there's so many plate like flavor profiles we have yet to unlock every flavor you ever thought exists in the cannabis plant all of them you just have to extract you just gotta yeah you just gotta find them unlock it you gotta unlock them so for those of you cannabis growers we actually do have links in the description where you can go to growers network and find a full list of all the seeds and strains here at gross sciences including umami go mommy now i think it's time for propagation let's do it so i want to give a big shout out to propagation everything starts here you have a bad clone you're screwed so let's talk about the gross science way to get a good club okay so luckily we're stealing the technique from everyone before us which is completely fine that's called learning they're just taking what they've already cut off the actual branches themselves scapulating the bottoms dumping it in the brooding solution and then going right into the root or cube and from there it's a 7 to 14 day process depending on cultivar with a painstaking process of checking every dome multiple times a day misting them to keep the humidity correct making sure the cube's moisture level is correct you know which is just have to be super ocd just meticulous in nature and we're very lucky to have peter doing that it's kind of interesting because you're using the grodan tray and then you flip the root right cubes over cut them it's like a game of operation so mr nick coolman the gentleman to my left here my assistant cultivation manager this is one of his strategies to success with cloning please the main reason is uh it doesn't fit properly guys i got wobbles too much uh so upside down just keeps it stable the perfectionist he is coolman the coolest guy in propagation that's creative let's leave it at that let's talk about production and production numbers we go about 10 over on some of them we're going about 20 over right now yeah so we end up throwing away quite a few plants frank look that's that's the name of the game if you want a top quality clone you know i think that in 2021 one of the goals in propagation for us is going to be to actually nail that exact number it takes to achieve that whether it's two percent over or whether it's 100 you know um what cloning gel do you guys use well it might come as a surprise to you but we actually use clonex and yet another surprise would be that josh from clonex is actually here he actually happened to be here randomly at the exact same time we were shooting this that's crazy it's almost like he's sponsored or something like well if you're shooting a can of cribs it's not like you have a top sponsor and that they would get extended time and luckily i think you'd always have a top sponsor as a good product and i can't see that it's like people all they all they want to focus on is just [ __ ] getting paid you know i will not sell out for anything yeah we're going to stay true to ourselves but josh friends he's just friends stopping by yeah josh yeah yeah good guy good i love him he's just super big muscles he's yeah he's been to my wedding i haven't had yet but okay he'll be there because i didn't even know you were married no it's not yet oh yeah maybe one day okay i hope i do get invited but shot to clonex all day you know till until the end [Laughter] josh you know you're a friend of mine and it's so awesome that you're out here and want to let the viewers know a little bit about who you are and what you do sure so josh hughes i'm with hydrodynamics international i'm our senior brand manager been with the company for 10 years and nearly 18 years in the industry as far as experience with indoor and outdoor gardening so pleasure to be here every time we go to a canon crib shoot like clonex is there it's all it's like nine times out of ten right so why don't we tell people about like where clinics came from early in the 80s there really wasn't anything like clonex there was just simple rooting powders that were talc-based and the problem with that is talc dries out the area where the cutting is where the hormones are in contact with the plants so our company founders came up with clonex as a way to alleviate that problem by putting that hormone the iba into a gel form that protected the cut and helped to root plants faster well what i love about clinics is like you guys decide to make the gel like this cool weird mystic purple color it lets you see where the cutting is yeah exactly and the reason for the color is actually there is a surgical dye that helps protect the cut surgical dye so what is that is that like antibacterial exactly yup it's it's similar to what they use and rub on you before you go into surgery yup so eliminates pathogens pat you know disease bacteria etc based on the amount of clonics that we have produced over those years we have estimated that there's been billions of clones taken using clonex gel maybe we can even say the majority of the cannabis you know that people have smoked has probably touched clonex absolutely one other important point is that it's epa registered in all 50 states washington dc and puerto rico got it yeah so a lot of those states that are pretty strict on what you can and cannot put in plants this one is good to go absolutely yup and then you guys have the mist too so a lot of people might not know about that how would they use it with a setup like this the owners determined that it was beneficial to fuller the clones and cuts or even the moms prior to the moms prior to taking cuttings um it's a profile of seaweeds and aminos that helps elevate the natural hormone levels in the plant tissue josh really appreciate you coming down here to arizona absolutely for the grow sciences episode always a pleasure no you too glad i could come out appreciate you guys at canada cribs grow sciences all you guys it's been great [Music] so matt we made it into your bedroom go through this entire room in as much detail as possible it's pots we're in a room we're in here four to seven weeks and then we're in flour sounds good to me that's enough detail [Music] you take 10 cultivators you put them at 21 000 square feet of space and you say go everyone thinks cultivation is this this really sexy job at the end you're a janitor and i think if you're wanting to get into cultivation you should probably accept that most of what you're going to do during a day is clean and that's okay because look at the end result you feel it you feel the energy in the room and we're basically building on the last 25 years of my life in cultivation they're innovating all the new technology so for instance when i got into cannabis we didn't have rolling benches the only one we use is the botanicare i wouldn't build a building without them we beat the [ __ ] out of them and they still make it through this type of stuff is insane to me you know that i would be able to create a hallway yeah and without using the slide benches you'd probably have 20 percent less you know oh a minimum i mean actually the number's about 31 but yeah it's not like you're adding additional light you know the overlapping light already exists in the room i'm building out 65 000 square feet in my parking lot and i can assure you thousands of more square feet of botanic slide benches are coming with me in terms of like feeding these plants especially in two gallon fabric pots it has to be you know probably pretty frequent yeah so we're gonna feed plants like this a few times a day four to five times a day they're going to be getting right now pure water where at the end the last 14 days they're just gonna get pure water but one of the big things in cultivation is you're starting water arizona water is [ __ ] it's unfortunate it's 600 parts per million to 1100 parts per million of complete [ __ ] just to be very frank with you so we went to a local company here headed up by the mad scientist charles it's called spectrapure it's located in tempe they basically custom built us rro system and charles does this so he'll come to your building he'll test out your water coming in and then he'll build you a system around it customer service on point he'll come to the building same day if something happens and we start with zero part per million completely unbuffered water and that is such an advantage and that's thanks to spectra pure handling that for us and the fact that they're local and that charles is just an absolute genius you know i can't recommend them high enough you know it's a tough job keeping especially very frosty sugary nugs clean and to make it so that you know you don't have any powdery mildew pests all the way through flour i mean what's your guys strategy so let me give credit where credit's due one of my younger guys came to me about six months ago and said matt let's switch to an entirely organic regimen not there's anything wrong with zerotal used around the world he said but would you mind if we i said prove it you know because we have procure come into our building every 10 days and they test every single room in the building for mold bacteria fungus so we're gonna know for us testing is a way of life and it's not just on the finished flower trochu is a local company here and they come in and test everything so we know what our cfu count for mold is in every single room down to our trimming room and you'll see a flower room like this even filled with 700 plants at seven feet tall we raided this room 10 days ago at a 27 cfu count that's insane it's all but non-existent and the acceptable standard would probably be about a thousand so we are actually now completely organic to see nick do that and prove it is humongous so there's no doubt in my mind many many people in this building are going to have some fantastic careers in cannabis and i look forward to watching that happen that's awesome so you know you guys are growing these monsters in two gallon fabric grow bags so they're two gallon pots but as you can tell we're actually only filling it with about 1.7 liters of coca-core or so we use two-four royal gold tried and true we've got great results with it fantastic pricing not enough good things i can say about the product they've given us and you can tell by the rows of bags of it as you come into our building a lot of coco core when you bring it into your building you're going to do a water test on it to test the salt content we've had other cocoa cores test as high as 600 parts per million salt royal gold is always zero to a hundred it's absurdly consistent it's absurdly clean and you know i'll knock on wood when we leave here cleanliness is godliness and grow i only go with royal gold they've taken great care of us and the relationship will continue until that time ends which i mean they've been in business many years i i think they've got it figured out and for us they certainly do let's also talk about moving the plants into the room what's your process for the first uh few weeks it's quite simple we pull them out of edge and we'll line them up we're not gonna lay this first layer of trellis for about four to five days but we're pretty lucky we've got the four foot rolls of common culture this room's only had three layers of trellis we have rooms that have upwards of five six layers of trellis i'm like five seven and those plants are way up there and i would love to get a closer look yeah i think we're about high enough i think there still might be some buds that are higher than us though this is what happens when things go right you know does every room turn out perfectly no that's that's not growing this one does this one turned out great and a lot of them do the good news is a lot of them do in cultivation you take the wins when you get them because there's definitely a lot of losses to go around man i just i wish i could translate the the aroma and the density that you guys are producing in here this is like the the marathon right you've done everything you think you know you can do you're all high-fiving each other right well there's a whole section of growth sciences that's not high-fiving yet they're saying to themselves okay our job starts now it enters the apparatus of getting it into the patient's hands and my partner mike we're gonna have to bring him in because he owns that apparatus and is responsible for that experience to their hands so i think it'd be fun to have him here anyway yeah let's go grab mike let's go grab the big guy so mike just got down off the ladders with matt and he was talking about bringing the product 70 there but we're not done yet absolutely you can look at this and see that cultivation has done its job very well now is when you know it transfers into the post-production side to make sure that what we see here is preserved all the way through minimal handling you know hand trimmed proper dry proper cure all the above um before it reaches our jar and we asked the question would you buy that aid that's like a philosophy a mantra of growth sciences isn't it 100 we rely completely on the product you guys really do let the product speak for itself you put it on center stage and i understand that you guys uh are working with someone pretty special to do that that we are we've got eric nung shots in the house this week um this is his third or fourth visit in the last couple of years it's a lot of fun when he comes to town and he's here shooting right now let's go peer over your shoulder and see what's up let's go so mr eric nug shots we finally meet yes we do your reputation precedes you and it's so cool that you're working with gross sciences so why did you guys bring eric down to grow sciences because we're fans i think eric spends a lot of time educating the public on a lot of things that frankly people just don't even know to think about it's really fun to read the stuff that he puts out as fun as it is to look at the visuals i mean that's what got us hooked if you're looking at cannabis photography it's him you know for the people who don't know who you are let's can you can you give him a little insight into what you do yeah sure i mean basically i'm a cannabis photographer so if it's a 360. it's got to be nice and straight uh if it's a macro i'm looking for you know pristine trichomes obviously and then at the very tips of colas you have like little leaflets sticking out um that's one of my favorite places to shoot sometimes the leaf will kind of taco up and you get a nice like flat surface but you know all strains are different so sometimes you don't get either of those things and you kind of have to roll with the punches and different challenge every day it's super fun what is this thing exactly yeah this is uh called the flower tron yeah it's just an interactive uh display you can walk up spin the wheel it rotates the nug on the screen you can cycle through choose other ones and these are all growth sciences but any time he's ever represented our flowers and his photography it is unified amongst this team that it's like that's what it that's what we wanted it to look like that's he captured it well eric honored to be here at the same time you are it's been a pleasure and i know these guys appreciate it as well and uh with that looking forward to your new shots awesome thanks so much for having me [Music] matt we're stepping into the curing drying area and this is where you know you can grow the perfect plant but you can make a break it here all of the work comes down to this room if it doesn't go well in here it's we're done you'll end up with a hay smelling flower that no one wants to mess with right yeah so let's talk about the drying like sure let's let's run through the details so we're going to be anywhere from 67 to 72 degrees we're gonna be anywhere from 45 to 55 humidity once again we're not going to reinvent the wheel we're going to be doing what has been tried and true for me over my entire career yeah and i saw your chopping and then putting like almost a basically a whole plant yeah we do whole plant drying here so we take the whole plant down we have about 140 plants in a row so in a phase two room that's five rows they'll fit in each one of our dry rooms very standard for me drying comes down to environment of course dehumidification being the number one you're putting 500 pounds of wet material in a confined space everything can go wrong my tried and true the last 20 years has been the quest 205 dehumidifier it's my tank it comes with me everywhere we have 45 of them in this building i'm going to have another 200 of them in the expansion they're who i go with it always works it is the most efficient um there's just not enough good things i can say about it it's one of those devices that i won't build a room without every cultivar is different almost every harvest is different and it can take anywhere from eight to fourteen days depending on that to where we're ready to buck it down and begin the cure process okay so who's making the determination it's ready to come out of that drying room you basically have gavin who runs this room his entire goal is to make this stuff as smelly as possible just straight up so the gavin method is that like a little bit of experience with the touch and the feel you guys doing moisture meter what's we don't know moisture meter we are as i will call it bare bones as someone could be we don't even have an expensive thermometer we use the old school hygrometers it's gavin's intelligence intuition and gut instincts we go off of and those have yet to fail me he's bringing it um basically out of the drying room and we're talking about curing now really it's not just out of the drying room so he's involved on the harvest side so he's watching it come into the drying room allocating the space to each cultivar making sure oh he looks it and goes i don't like these huge apple fritter colas in the middle of the room let's move those to the outside of the room and that's why when people tell me they're always in search of automation i think automation's great and i'd love some great automation but you're never going to replace the critical players who make and break decisions on a daily basis and have to be dialed into the room in that way and it's that simple i mean it really is you're never gonna be able to replace that i won't and uh i'm very lucky to have the team i have matt i appreciate that that's extremely honest so i see them taking the plants down over here let's go through the life cycle of a bud after it goes out of the drying room yep so from the drying room it'll go from the curing container to the trim room the trimmers will trim it the second they are done that's going to be put into one-pound allotments inside the grove bags from there they're logged into our system and immediately enter care in the ballroom i've been unhappy with so many different products in terms of curing grove bags just dropped the product their two pound curing bag which has changed the game for us over the past few months and we will not cure anything without them how does the growth bag actually work the goal of the grove bag is to not only preserve the terpene preserve the flower quality and maintain just an overall perfect atmosphere 62 humidity we think it achieves that pretty soundly they're coming through for us big time i think it's opened up the nose on our flower to a whole new level and i think that just seeing the bud structure maintained not get broken up pieces fall off being able to view it everything about it it's just such a more sound you know way to cure and i'm always looking for those better options so so we made our way into your guys's processing room and what is your role here my name is tanner um i'm the extraction manager here for um neurosciences i'm in charge of doing all the solventless that uh everyone enjoys so matt you know your pens i swung it last night super smooth tasty i saw you having your pocket they're really innovative and can you tell us a little bit more about why they taste the way they do took us 11 months to get there and hundreds of thousands of dollars and fighting and yelling and just all sorts of crazy [ __ ] to get to the end product we're extremely proud of it the game changer about the cartridge is that it's a totally solvent-free cartridge it's the only one on the market arizona's leading the way in rosin cartridges so you're just talking about such a different flavor such a different high such a natural real representation of the flower you started with and that's a rarity i mean when you pick up 95 of the cartridges on the market and it's a distillation you know made cartridge you have no idea what terpene's been added to it you don't even know what it started as with our rosin cartridge you know exactly what you're getting matches the lab testing that went to the rosin itself it is a completely unadulterated cartridge and it's a real representation of what we were trying to accomplish we've had a great relationship with three win heidi specifically has taken care of us in ways whether it was helping us to design our boxes or putting us in contact with this she has just gone so above and beyond that i'd be doing a disservice not to call her out besides the fact that three wins repping the c-cell cartridge which always has the best rates lowest leakage rates we don't get anywhere near as many returns before c-cell got here the cartridge market was a [ __ ] show it was basically the cheapest and what garbage products and cell kind of was the renaissance to cartridges and let me just tell you that in the state license system i would never have picked up a cartridge until i was at a dispensary and they said you gotta check out the c cell cartridge and i took a chance and on the first drag i remember being whoa that actually hit okay we have something and now we are here three years later and you've got multiple people with the c cell but there's three win and there's everyone else and there's heidi at three win which that's all says i can't recommend her enough and let's touch base because people were like so is this guy saying resin with weird accent so why don't we define rosin rosin is as cannabis resins that are extracted uh with applied pressure and heat rosin can be made from ice water hash cannabis flower sift keefe um basically the same stuff you'd find in the bottom of your grinder at home we uh we used rosin evolution for our rosin bags and we kind of had developed a relationship with them we had them make a custom bag for us a couple years back and we still to this day continue to use that they actually offer that bag on their website now and then for all of our rosin we use a 25 micron bag but for the mechanical separations we use the 15. so these are our presses that we use um this is uh our workhorses as far as making rosin goes these peer pressures are automated so basically uh they're all touch screen and you just go in and set up the recipe and you save it and once it's saved you can go into settings and use that recipe again so for days where i have two thousand three thousand grams of hash to press i can actually run both of these machines and turn my back and focus on other things while these things do the work for me which is actually amazing and saves us a lot of time on production these machines we press about 50 grams at a time on um we can do uh more or less but we like to stick between 40 and 50. um we can do you know a few thousand grams a day easily yeah on these machines i wouldn't want any other press in this lab to do the job other than these ones specifically these ones because like i said they are automated and you can set the recipe up um it makes working so much easier another thing we use is our amp equipment that is our washing vessel three months ago before we got those washing vessels we used to actually have to lift all of our buckets up and we use plastic trash bins washing eight hours a day lifting up heavy buckets it gets tiring especially when we're a production company we actually want to you know produce more the reason why with amp is i actually have a personal relationship with uh the owner and uh his name is josh he's this is an awesome dude he is completely different from cannabis brands and stuff that's out there because he is very one-on-one and he actually makes the product or has made the product before in a sense or has people to r and d his equipment before it gets sent out so every piece of equipment that i've seen him send out is pretty much it's all unique and in its own so on a day we can get about 100 pounds washed one day one work day that's a lot yeah it's a lot so i'm definitely proud to be working with amp and i'm definitely happy that we are developed we've developed a really strong relationship with each other tanner thank you so much for showing me around you guys lab i mean you guys are definitely doing something different here with a lot of that solvent list and it's tough to do at scale definitely uh glad to have you here um it was fun [Music] this is where the would you buy that eighth really starts to take form so it's a lot of attention to detail so what kind of equipment do you guys lean on here in the trimming room you know harvest more basically changed the game with the trim bin for a couple reasons first and foremost you're not just sitting over a cookie sheet which is where a lot of us were previously trimming on just any surface you get to collect all your sift which is just enormous for us and it's frankly comfortable i mean i've been using trim bins for years trim bins do a great job i know they're working on some of their technology to even filter down more but yeah that's it you got scissors you got trim bins and you got people you know that brings up a question that i have too it's like there's so many people that watch canada cribs and they want to know what are cannabis operations looking for in teammates you know you're going to get in the door drive passion a love of cannabis and what's going to keep you here is a work ethic and ability to work within the team and these people who have been with us from the beginning are going to come with us on this journey and i'm really excited by that and i i think they are too i think that's why you stay here this is too weird we've gone from you know people buying ziploc bags that are rolled up to what we have in front of us and this is innovative can we touch base on you guys packaging this is an area that we have a lot of fun thinking about there's two main things we care about when we're selecting our packaging one is preservation and the second thing that we care about is trying to have a bit of a wow factor you know i don't think i've ever seen packaging that i would say makes the bud as center stage as this that is by design for sure so this is a jar that we developed with a company named canlock we were able to create a vacuum seal so we put the flour inside and then we evacuate 80 percent of the air inside of it it's got the preservation box checked right and then when the customer gets it at home and they twist it open you get a sound like opening a soda pop and uh you please i love it yeah and then you've got the strain name on the side oh you're just gonna keep popping them on the larger quantities we've got traditional mylar that's our biggs bag and that's all of our colas i mean that's that's the cream of the crop right there i love that product more than anything i wish we could put more of it out and when our expansion is done we will yeah i don't know who doesn't like a big bag of wheat so then the other one is our smalls bag popcorn gets such a negative vibe you know we use the bag to to tell a story about why we love smalls so that's the flower side of our packaging well why don't we touch base on some of your concentrates for sure the concentrates for extracts we use a company named calyx that's just got a really clean container you know they they clearly have an eye on detail for design which is right up our alley the things that we care about it's a pinch and pull lid so it's got the child resistant feature it's got a nice clean glass underneath so you can see exactly what you're getting um and then the artwork that's applied to the top they do for us and you can see it's got that sort of nice sheen effect to it it's just all around i think high-end i love that we like it on top oh yeah it's the little things that make the big difference it's inches so yeah the calyx guys have done a lot of work for us to get to this point i feel like it's like holding a little jewel yeah you know that's what it feels like it's got heft that mission accomplished yeah right absolutely so they they give us the preservation you know we're big fans of that and we've been through a lot of concentrate containers and and this is running away with the best one you know we've got an insert that allows us to tell about how it was made in our case solventless is such a huge part of our business we wanted people to know like hey what does this even mean there's a lot of that character that i'm getting here infusing your products like i'm looking at it here and it says oh is the quote in there yeah the quote in here if you think you are too small to make a difference try sleeping with a mosquito in the room there you go that's some deep [ __ ] these witticisms i feel like they come directly from the character of the people who work here yeah we we try to make everybody laugh just for a second and and the quotes do that and so the sticker is kind of that final piece to the box all the stickers that we put in our box are a result of really fan artwork you know we put rosin on the cartridge again a lot of people had never heard the term rosin or thought that it was being misspoken because they always heard resin so that people know that oh this is different than what's in every other pen i've ever smoked for those people who maybe have tried vape cartridges and they're like man it just doesn't doesn't smoke the same as real flour probably recommend they try rosin you know the only drawback that has to every other cartridge on the market is the fact that it reeks like you have a quarter pound of flour in your pocket when you have it and that's because it is an actual representation of the flour in its truest form everything about it is just a different experience i'm excited for you to try it i am excited as well yo tambien [Music] [Music] guys this line of hundreds of people behind you is a testament to what you've done in two years which now i have to ask like what's next in store for growth sciences this is why we're working so hard to get our own dispensary right we've spent so much time engaging this community and uh and i think this is the result of all that hard work and our friends at the local joint they've allowed us to come in and do a takeover you got to bogart their space yeah these kids are crazy though it's a [ __ ] hundred degrees out here it is these kids are 110. yeah these kids are not 110 and this is a medical market right now with the passing of recreational the demand is only going to increase and it's really important for us to to really be able to reach out and touch that patient and make sure they have a place where they can always go and find our product i was going to say too that i think one of the biggest things we'll see in arizona is that if it goes legal the companies that are going to invest the millions of dollars that it takes to respond to that demand need a reason to get started which is why we're definitely pro-legalization and is it a perfect bill far from it but does it get us to that next step absolutely it also removes felonies and it lets people expunge records which is something that has to be discussed when we talk about legalization so if we're going to acknowledge legalization and say that we were wrong then you have to go back and say everyone we [ __ ] with we were wrong and this bill does talk about expungement but you've got to get everyone on board and show them that cannabis is here to stay it's completely friendly we're a member of the community we're giving back and you know we're all very good people and look at these kids man 110 degrees showing up to get their meds like that's that let's talk about what's special about an event like this new product drops man so first time ever yo first time ever baller jars of our live rosin first time baller jars we're making a forbidden pastry which is forbidden fruit times hidden pastry into a diamond rosin sauce first of its kind for the first time we've ever done it selling quarters of flour and that might seem odd but you know the arizona market's dictated by eighths and ounces and because we're so sold out we focus on our eighth product to get in everyone's hands today we launched quarters and i think it's time we go inside and take a look at what's going down yeah let's go hang out with some fans [Music] okay cool so you guys are doing something i've never seen before yeah it's like augmented reality that's right okay show me this is important because take a look you've got display cases here but not all dispensaries are created equal particularly with their shelf space the way that we figured out we could overcome that was to build something virtual and then this becomes basically an anchor for an experience that we have leveraged to show off the things that we care about so it's a chance for them to learn again how it's all made that's one of the things we work really hard on that's amazing that's game changing absolutely with cannabis now recreationally legalized in arizona gross sciences is set to push the boundaries of what's possible in boutique cannabis cultivation their passionate and hardworking team along with our dedicated fans assures this won't be the last we see them it'll be interesting to see how this company evolves in due time until then subscribe and stay tuned for our next adventure [Music] you get high with growth sciences then i might have plugged it if you need some flashes to get high with it then i might have plugged you or matt you know it's really mad you know i'm saying but you know we out here man you know do your thing is this thing on can you uh take pictures of my firstborn yeah can they sit super still for 15. you", "AORyULfIRe0": "yo yo yo what's good youtube welcome to another live stream i'm going to raise you up just a bit sweet so gopro updated and um my new wi-fi router is in we're showing signal strength here for the stream decent it didn't show that before so now that's pretty good to see anyways let me go ahead and share the link out to instagram and we're going to go ahead and get started uh all right cool well glad we got that up and running let me go ahead and uh get this stream up on my computer oh you're right let's see i'm sure you guys want to see some of this stuff that i have here before we even get started right let me show you what we got going on first of all we weighed everything out earlier we uh pulled it out of the freeze dryer fresh this morning fat fat nineteen point four percent yield killed it one thousand one hundred and thirty grams of nug went in 220 grams of full spectrum hash came out as well as 19 grams of 25 and 160 micron so this is our test press that we use for edibles and then we'll go ahead and press out the rest of these full spectrum pucks i loaded them by hand into the bags and then after putting them in the bags i pressed them down in a rosin evolution pre-press to make sure that they stayed nice and tight and they are evenly distributed went up from uh the small little four ounce jars and uh upgraded to the six ounce jars i got tired of filling those little small ones to the brim and i said it's time to upgrade baby so we got the jar all weighed out we'll be able to weigh this when we're done tonight and see what our final yield was on this run now i'm a big fan of doing my presses a little bit warmer than what most people would i'm using my stool for you guys today so i'm gonna do this but um yeah you guys that watch me often know i will press anywhere from 200 to 225 depending on the cultivar depending on the hash um not all hash comes out the same um for example we talked about trichome density before right we talked about just because it looks like a lot of hash it may not be a lot of hash because um the oil inside may not be full you know what i'm saying the trichome may just be partially full in that case it's fluffy hash where it looks like a lot but it doesn't weigh a lot that's why this 25 micron and this 160 micron it looks like a large puck but it only weighs 19 grams compared to this puck which is smaller in comparison by about a centimeter right and it's not as fat but it weighs more probably about five to six grams more and that's because this is the full spectrum 45 through the 159 which contains higher density trichomes that are full of milk oil compared to the 25 and 160. so just a little throw that in there for you interior genetics what's going on asteroid farms if you guys aren't following asteroid farms on instagram go follow so old homie of mine platinum grove colorado who used to have a really pimp-ass girl room the nasa lab right um one of the inspirations for me initially stepping up my garden well now it's his turn to come back and he just got a brand new house with a nice ass basement and guess what it's time for a brand new build out so we're gonna help each other out take some ideas off of each other and i'm basically gonna have him record the whole thing and um show you guys how he does his build out you know and he'll give you guys pointers along the way and uh you know show you how to build a grow room so by the time you know he's done with that uh build out i'll be done uploading my video on how when i built out my grow room and uh his will be pretty much part two of a series that i'm going to be doing where it's going to be either build-outs brand new or remodels or upgrades and you guys will be able to pay for each episode um individually and absorb all the information that went into that whole build or remodel so it was actually his idea and we're gonna do his build out as episode two so it's gonna be awesome it's gonna have amazing information in there and it's gonna be great for you guys because instead of just seeing my room all the time and you're like oh that's great but not everybody has your room like yours or not everybody has a layout like yours you'll get to see different layouts different places different um climates right you're gonna get to see it all and you're gonna get to see the different thought process that goes into building these so it's gonna be really cool but anyways go check out his instagram because he's already started posting updates on it and it's not often that you get to jump on board and watch it build out brand new from the start most of the time you hop in and it's like uh the person's halfway done they've already done a bunch of [ __ ] you kind of like feel like the new guy you know what i'm saying in a crowd of old guys that been around for a long time now's your chance to get in on the bottom floor be one of those old guys he's been there forever by the time he gets done finishing you could be like i was there when you were still drawing the blueprints yo whippersnapper some of this blue icy and then i'm going to glove up the press is set to 175. we're going to do a low temp press on our test bag it's not going to be a clear indication of how the full spectrum is going to respond but it's going to give me a good enough idea to know whether or not 175 is going to provide the flow i'm looking for or if i'm going to need to go up to my 204 temperature 202 maybe i will put a link up right now i'm not sure that you guys can do it that's what's up jinder mah what's up dude i haven't seen you in forever holy moly so yeah check out asteroid farms what's going on viper what's up slug upstate what's going on we're just giving everybody a minute to trickle on in taking dabs we're enjoying life i haven't even taken a dab with you guys yet have i ah let's take a dab i'm gonna go in on some of this blue icy first oh let's get in there who wants to get in those guts with me we've got 31 left on this battery oh let's get in there the gopro doesn't focus well close up so you guys are gonna take what you get and be happy all right first time catching a live stream viper you caught a very good live stream for your

plates i'm ready to go baby it's waiting on you guys i mean what do you think we're about to press a half pound of hash a half pound cheers at 413 on the email okay ah that blue icy i swear on the exhale it tastes just like a blue icy it is so crazy every time it never fails what's up easy labs green ranger nashville how you doing freshly pressed what's up annie oh gee what's up hidden creek we got the whole [ __ ] family here i think i'm gonna do a live stream prank and start a live stream pressing hash with the hair straightener so we can get a million people asking oh no what happened did the press break fantastic so huh all righty all righty all righty let's swap out the battery you already know we got it we gotta swap out the battery we don't want it to die it'll be another short live stream i had to find it i couldn't forget i couldn't remember where the [ __ ] i put it down now i can't remember which batteries are charged now let's see lucky number nothing they'd be lying sometimes you got to pull them out and pop them back in they're not lying tonight [ __ ] [ __ ] well one of you's got to be higher than 25 [ __ ] percent let's find out i i don't feel comfortable knowing i've got 25 percent left on the battery i just took a fat ass dab and i'm about to start pressing i'm gonna get excited forget and this is gonna die by the way if the stream does go down unexpectedly please stay tuned because i will bring it right back up this is a non-stop party tonight that battery was at 100 you [ __ ] lying ass charger all right all right so for those of you that are new here i do a [ __ ] ton in a very small space so this is where i'm going to be collecting at when i'm all done here okay we're gonna move some [ __ ] out of the way shout out to roz and inc i want you guys to look at something real close here custom product for who that is who has bags like that who has bags like that do you want to know why he carries these two and a half by four and a half bags hey cuz of me baby who wants some bags i know some of you press and some of you need some bags all right anyways we've got parchment laid out we've got our bags ready to go okay and here you guys are going to go you're going to go right here look at that just for you how's that view yeah you could just chill set you down now is a good time if you got to use the restroom you got to go grab a drink you know what i'm saying whatever you got to do go handle that let me figure out this lighting i don't want it to be too bright for you guys oh [ __ ] that's too bright all right i feel good about this you guys are ordering from rosin inc make sure you guys use my coupon codes they're on my site solventlessbnb.com let's get ready get up there get up there just a little love from my homie right there you know all right remember you guys we're gonna be doing the 160 micron and the 25 micron mixed together as a test press before we move on to the full spectrum presses here we have the uh [ __ ] puck come on turn on screen doesn't recognize my gloves oh well anyways i hope that you guys were able to see that now this uh this is just some uh edibles mix of some uh the last strain that i pressed out which is the grape cosby little dark but it is [ __ ] chirpy and delicious and it will do amazing for edibles because the flavor that it will add is not too over the top but it's definitely like you notice it notice it so we're going to drip this into that edibles jar this is probably not going to flow crazy this is a test press a low temp test press at 175 all right i honestly feel like i should go up a little so so so so oh that looks like it's gonna be good well i think i found the temperature i'm gonna try for the first full spectrum maybe it'll flow a little bit more i'll take it for edibles siezer um don't worry that was just a plate on top of the press jumping around my cold plate up there good extraction well the flow was okay wasn't quite what i want it's kind of a weird flow so all right well not quite what i'm looking for believe it or not 185 that's gonna give me that awkward drip i'm gonna hold pull my audience to see what you guys think the temperature is that i'm gonna go with i already know what i'm going with i'm gonna go with uh my usual all right well we're gonna go ahead and do the first full uh spec press now all the same size that one was at 175. small bag we'll do this one first oh jesus 224 no too high 202 202 202 that's that's where i'm feeling 202 today i can feel it in my huevos rancheros pressing some cool spectrum once cash baby all right the room temperature is 74 degrees i do not believe in running a cold room during the pressing stage now bear with me you guys this is going to be a tad bit awkward as i have to deal with not only the um press this new jar which is larger and doesn't sit on the edge so i have to hold it like this in fact i don't even know what your viewpoint is now does that make sense right there where it's at for you guys i mean all right here we go we're at 191.1 191.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 six that's how slow my press heats up i love it i don't care what anybody says it doesn't overshoot temperatures during pressing because it sleeps it heats up slowly it doesn't like jump up all crazy because it has some overpowered 150 to 200 watt heaters it just has two 100 watt heaters nicely spaced out let's take a dab again next time tomorrow it sounds delicious this [ __ ] is like caramel taffy uh oh uh oh ah excuse me i felt like my nose was gonna run all over camera i didn't want that oh yeah what's up mommy my [ __ ] that'll do good that'll do oh that gets the job done i'll tell you what how you guys feeling about this prize we're at 199.7 199.7.8.9 200. 201 i'm not there and dad

boy puffin comes to visit you're pressing yourself right now huh hell yeah get it dog we are warmed up to 202 degrees let's go this is gonna be a second test press slightly lower than my normal but for some reason i'm feeling this temperature why i saw gonza say 204 and i'm like yeah yeah that's my normal i feel it but then all of a sudden my balls rumbled and spoke to me from deep within and they said no 202 now they're all right [ __ ] it the balls haven't lied yet oh what would you look at that there already me gusta come here come to daddy a little [ __ ] go what i say i knew it i felt

that conversation oh elevated uh nah there wasn't a lot on the parchment there was barely anything in here really maybe like two to three grams that was a small piece of uh that was small and that was 19 grams in there and uh [ __ ] dude not a lot left in there it's all over the [ __ ] sides of this jar is where it's at you guys want to see a big squirt huh all right let's get it gotta get off this cyber dream stuff though um all right let's get it big old fatty this one feels like a 27-30-ish somewhere in there all right let's go i don't want to listen to trap sorry i gotta get i gotta get the right music on first this is bothering me put on some good old tj hotto all right let's go i'm gonna fold this one down the center i just pinch it crease it down the center diagonal the other diagonals and that gives you kind of like a good flow right there already and then you just pinch the sides together and it's like let me check my battery here 85 percent go dude i'm all smoking one squeeze okay shout out to my man mysticalgo my official artist on sbnb records back down oh yep bomb extraction on that one let's go cross mountain ranges split cells of tomorrow it flowed so well there's like not even that much on the paper let us go yes uh let's keep this party [ __ ] going good over here peace i think i put some information in the description maybe i didn't add that i guess but 25 micron double bag from rosin inc for the uh for the bags my bad y'all i tried to put some information in there and i left out that one yo if you guys can't catch the live streams sign up for my patreon i upload them there so come to daddy um is i'm the master of my own fate i determine my own yield i grew the flowers this is the source of the single i am my own god excuse you uh is that's why i keep the ends of these parchment pieces wrap them over the parchment paper i wish i could slow this down listen listen did you [ __ ] catch it though my man [ __ ] threw it in putting him on game yo understand he let y'all know i'm putting y'all on game for free i'm gonna i'm gonna take it back one time is it too loud uh um let's go ladies and gentlemen it's time to flow i'm gonna bring you guys back some i feel like i'm not bad hold on you guys don't really need that flashlight i don't think anyways let me take it off and passed wrench squad hold it down here's a pro tip on really fat pucks make sure you leave a little extra space behind the puck so that you don't get a blowout but i can mute it that's fine didn't need that light but i'm not liking how that's lining up on the [ __ ] plates i'm gonna move it over just a tad real quick like uh is i go go go go go real big extraction what is it [ __ ] this one's really done i'm calling it now it's gonna be a dumper is nobody [ __ ] with you you know what as a kid i actually did like origami and [ __ ] you know what was better than origami paper [ __ ] planes god damn it paper planes with a [ __ ] i could fold all types of paper planes you guys when i was a kid not now you know why i can't do it now because i lost the book i didn't look that [ __ ] up read that [ __ ] in the book you know what i mean books are cool as [ __ ] you can learn how to make paper airplanes and [ __ ] who would have thought mm-hmm starting to get good at this [ __ ] so um okay well brown is foreign i until you quit this next one's gonna squirt like a [ __ ] so um okay i have that camera ready i'm gonna record this one on my phone i'm not sure how i'ma do it watch me money money all the time hey money please no worries it's only 200 degrees touch it with your [ __ ] hands that sense sorry i'm trying to align this a little bit differently here safety reasons there it is my press has a ram that can adjust positions so um it's a little bit different than most the ram isn't stationary which means that it can come out of alignment sometimes if i move it or whatever but it's all we're helping to make good taking care of your summer projects is a breeze bam summer savings on all your favorite brands make things even easier so freshen up the deck and fire up the grill summer's here and it's as close as your home yard get more done let's get it i've used this prosper [ __ ] ever you're biking like five years now i just let go of the [ __ ] bar my bad you guys the camera is on a very unsteady amount kinda i don't have the tripod leg spread out very well all right is to the place whoa the puck slit in the plates when i was adjusting it apparently almost popped out of the front no blow out though but i gotta pull it out real quick and readjust it i'm so glad that didn't blow out but somehow that slipped out that's a trip i'm so happy that i didn't blow out that's crazy what the [ __ ] i've never had that happened that's a trip that's a trip son experience saved for real he wouldn't would he he [ __ ] would let's go back on the plates you go you son of a [ __ ] that was a trippy trip trippy trip trip this thing is about i was like why is it not going like it should be leaking way more and then all of a sudden the handle slipped and i was like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] what happened put that back on the plate for a second up a let that so hmm who's your daddy who's your daddy what a safe uh is before oh yeah good extraction i'll take it oh yeah let's power through it two more to go parchment gets added to the jar everything i want everything together mixed together equal even steven the stuff that sticks to the parchment might be different terpenes might be different different [ __ ] you know you don't want to leave it out shop from the comfort of your home at sprint.com that's not a lot of work bro i know i'm saying it's already time to upgrade the jar again i just got this damn jar i'm upset it's not fun i thought for sure it was going to be good enough we knew get a bigger drawer uh bertha it's time to go squirtle what the [ __ ] it did it again something's going on here is it sliding something's happening here there's no blowout but it's sliding off pressure's not being applied evenly to the plates somehow or they're too tight or i pre-packed them at an angle never had this happen okay i know what i'm about to do fix this i'm going to have to increase the pressure even slower every problem there is a solution hmm leaned on him to apply pressure for the pre-press by doing it evenly i had to have been time to upgrade and put my bigger plates on i guess for these bigger presses right inside there i hope you guys are watching this if you guys aren't [ __ ] paying attention i don't know what you're doing right now when i mess up that's when you guys need to pay attention because i don't mess up very often not to sound cocky whatsoever but i don't so if i make a mistake that's resulting in some type of mess up it would benefit everybody around me to pay attention and realize what i'm doing wrong so i got my light that's fine before i make sure i got the jar underneath there i didn't think it was going to squirt like that still this parchment is heavy from the [ __ ] first part of the press but it's still flowing good that's all that matters and no blowout fan dumb strong on the top setting don't you get a damn hum my curl is my rocker maybe i choose you and i don't even have i don't even have um i have a couple theories for what it is lots of adjusts right now it's increasing pressure too fast and also i have the press at a a pretty good angle right now leaning towards the front and i think that the hash is melting and making the puck inside uneven and then it blows out the front like that so i think i'm just going to go ahead oops just hit the table i'm going to go ahead and flatten out the press a little bit more risky with this puck anymore how would i do on the save [ __ ] crazy giving her incredible so okay my battery at 34 okay um check the alignment of the plates one more me come on gloves don't stupid i know it's not that cold in here but then mm-hmm little 74 degrees in here oh missiles contemplating life changes foreign foreign let me grab some parchment hold on i got an idea not so much as an idea that i just want to do something for this press just insurance actually all okay searching for savings on descriptions is so complex it's like getting a documentary unfortunately you just savings period not all patients eligible savings so um me yes i haven't even hit one ton of pressure you guys think i'm kidding look so just hit two and a half oh figured it out right pressure was increasing too fast and the angle probably didn't know so so well aren't you guys glad i got the internet connections really good attraction well wow please so um batteries are charged let's get a battery swap in before we do anything else we'll go from there sound good oh think so okay all right so good job bertha good job baby we're gonna take a dab and then after this dab i'm going to um go ahead and collect what's on the parchment and get it added to the jar while it's still warm man that's heavy that's heavy i mean yield wise i'm thinking it's got to be it's got to be upwards of 80 it has to be you know there's it is no [ __ ] way it's not it's a little harsh didn't it that's okay i'll turn it down i knew there was a little [ __ ] nap thingy in here a little [ __ ] flew right on me else we know there's never a good time to run out of fresh luckily our delivery and free pickup excuse me so whether it's a few extra guns from the back all right i mean you can't help it i got lights on in here when i come in through the garage little [ __ ] just came in with me i guess oh boy oh what are we taking a dab off i mean this is the 160 and 25. this [ __ ] is looking better than some people's like 90s come on man this is my throwaway edibles what's your calling air force reserve af reserve dot com all righty i got the drugs already got a little bit of runs on here i'm gonna grab some more though on the outside of one of these parchments but i smeared i know there's like a bunch on the outside i could take so i don't have to dip into the jar or anything i'm i'm weird right now you're like call that fresh press man i wish i'll give you a melt so like wood that's runs wow wow that flavor is intense now that i haven't dabbed it in a while in a while holy [ __ ] it is intense um hitter hitter hitter hitter hitter goodness q-tip foreign all right fire all right here we go we're gonna collect the rest uh i don't have a tool i can even stick that far down into the jar to reach

exclusive blueberry ock jelly sauce cartridge starting off with the material source we have a unique three-way blend of whole plant indoor cultivars such as beyond blueberry oszi cush and the brand-new strawberry OG Kush all masterfully crafted by Wonder Bread all the flour used was grown to full maturity and freshly dried prior to extraction this attention to detail is able to truly maximize both THC and overall turkey percentages the extraction process is devoid of any use of water chemicals nor salts making a true ultrafine hash frozen the next step in the process is the separation of hash frozen and inactive THC any or blue river snow from the static seed has frozen the rosin sauce then undergoes additional refinement to reduce plant fats and enables a more dynamic range of cannabinoids terpenes and flavonoids because of this process jelly sauce is going to be a bit darker in color the naturally occurring flavonoids are molecules responsible for a wider variety and spectrum of flavor exhibited through natural representation of the blend of the cultivars used the separated blue river snow is fully converted into THC and range reduced back to the refined rosin sauce to boost overall potency and onset of effects the flavor profile of this oil is something you've never had before my trooper bust mixture of right blueberry and gas coat your mouth as the vapor

connection and we're gonna go through making a hash joint and this basically is gonna be like a small tip on the end with a little bit of bud and weight wise more hash but it won't look like it's not much more and I did not invent this credit for this actually goes to live at Nirvana dispensary in West LA which is a dispensary used to go two years ago and used to sell these kinds of things I was actually I think one of the best dispensaries ever really it was a great dispensary with a lot of water hash and this method was [Music] originally used without water bubble hash and so first thing I do is I'm gonna take like a piece of cardboard something there's a piece of a book and I'm gonna make the longer crack so I'll just take a piece of paper I mean a joint paper and then roll it over to make this kind of crush and what are these joints good for well if you kind of want to smoke something you only feel like feel like doing it with dab rig maybe you got you want to smoke some you only got a little bit of bud laughs you still got a bunch of extracts it seems to be a common theme for me and yeah it's kind of what's for so this is what I do first I'm gonna get my paper ready I don't like extra paper on the paper so I was kind of clipped that down just a little bit okay so this is in a role like that let's see if we got a name probably gonna be enough bed right there sweet Stone grinder this thing lasts forever I actually prefer grinders that do not have the kief catcher and all that stuff I just like straight rind and go so that's about maybe there's a tiny little bit STEMI crap all right so let's shout out to we roll whoever gave us these at a mjp is kind of where we go that was nice actually like these papers are really good and here we go I would use an MPX live resin MPX is great products we like the cartridge really cool my resin just can't like all their stuff so I've tried so far so I'm gonna take out like yea much that might need me a little heavy tiny piece off that so here's my hash to weed ratio and of course that hash weighs way more I would think than that but the guy never on earth told me a long time ago was about a 90/10 ratio that weight-wise about 90% of the weight was actually the hash ten percent was the weed I don't know if I'm getting to those exact ratios I'm not as good at rolling it as he was but basically going in there I'm just getting that bud that has to be kind of this mix in with the bud and I found this kind of works with any hash I've been able to do this with shatter it's worked as light resin but the method originally was with bubble hash and sure you might lose a little tiny little bit and your fingers and stuff when you do this but okay so I'm gonna make sure it's not like soup or hash clumpy that's kind of the goal here okay now I got my pretty hashed up need right here let's break that bigger piece yeah okay now you're gonna pick the cleaner end to roll it on so put that right now and kind of want to fill that tip every piece because well name just regular shake anymore now I'm cashed up shake okay now I'm gonna kind of do here's kind of pack a little bit now I know about the angle and I put it in remember the hack it a little more manually kind of stick in there hey roll it up okay I don't want too much going in that hole that just ends up being a waste so I kind of pack it up that way now I'm gonna roll this see how it is okay that's kind of it now it's on the end of that right I'm gonna kind of pull that out and twist a little bit and then run with some mini fields or shorts I'll look around that point right there to kind of get it an air tightness to it lighter and then yeah basically you need to dry this up with a lighter and I'll be right back and let me find that later and we'll do the rest this all right so we got the lighter now we light it up and kind of make it's kind of a bit seems kind of like not airtight e-enough on that sometimes it'll do take a little piece with it and then just kind of wrap it around that end and make sure the air is suctioning and do a little twisty twist on this and that's your hash string okay now you could save it for later but let's take a hit and one thing you notice on this it doesn't always burn 100% evenly so what I do is lick your finger a little bit and kind of perfected us to go I'm really surprised this isn't a more popular variation closest thing I've seen to this some of my middle-eastern friends will just put straight hash in a cigarette kind of thing kind of seems like this yeah this one's pretty nice so it's really just nice hashey hits whoo yeah yeah god bless that man for coming up with these and his actually look like a nice bulb the ones that were at the Nirvana dispensary yeah that's basically yeah this actually so this is burning exceptionally well I don't expect it to burn this all the time and the better you mix the hash of the weed the better it birds but no ma'am yeah love this thing and yeah that's fair no well well you get the Polly you Bush it that hash into this big and there you go and this thing is gonna burn like basically as long as a blunt I probably won't even sit here finish all this I probably look like half of this and smoke it again look how dice knew that birds thanks love for showing me how to do this or explain the process at least now y'all can try it oh man pics product is just good and B X's carts are really good too yeah but right tried those yet I really recommend tracking those a shot so there you go and this has like a really hashey smell to it you can smell the hash burning look how nice that birds basically licking it and Evie to get out if one starts burning down bar just lick it go down look your finger the only go directly lick your finger go down that and that's it so that's it that's how you make a hash joint as if it were Nirvana dispensary ten years ago thanks for watching guys is Dow connection y'all have a great week and I hope this helps you guys out", "1dVHQhRVxls": "it was intense the intensive they are bigger than more than world war ii for this crazy war well it also it set a precedent for our lack of trust in the military lack of trust in the government that guides the military particularly how they deal with the veterans that are dealing with things like agent orange or you know people we didn't even have ptsd yeah that was but it started prop up when i got back i talked about it about ptsd which i never diagnosable it was not an ailment that you could officially catalog because if you did the army would be admitting to a huge amount of insurance and problems and medical problems that they would have to cover so it was you know it was something that there was no word for it but frankly to get back to the issue of the original question was the platoon was rejected for these two i joined the camp with the people who i would say were anti-authoritarian i wouldn't say they were anti-war because we didn't have anything like that going on it was just the army sucks black troops too because when martin luther king got killed in april of 68 impact over there so there's a lot going on in the country and people were seen feeling it new troops were coming in all the time from the copy draft team so we were you know you get a feeling for what's going on did the did the movie feel different to you than anything else you've ever done in terms of your obligation because i really do think that that was the most realistic at that point for sure war movie ever made and the the one that left people with the most conflicted feelings and just this this feeling of as much as you can relate in a film with notable actors that you you you showed the horrors of war in a way that i don't think you've ever been portrayed before in a film well we got the details right i mean when you see a dead body and you see it being lifted into a helicopter that's really looks like a dead man yeah the pain of death i mean you feel the danger it's it's never what you think it's going to be it's always comes up in another way it's like sloppy sometimes and that's what i like about a lot of the movies that battle is always just confusion breaking down things don't work it's like mike tyson said you know and your plan goes out the window and you get hit in the face that's that's the way it goes see the americans have a methodical way of doing it we go to the jungle we send the little guys into the jungle they meet resistance pull back bomb artillery 200 take minimum cabinets that's not what the marines did that's what the army's idea was and that it works to a degree but it eradicates the whole the bombiness is very sloppy and not only a friendly fire but you have a lot of civilians killed too imagine when you finish your final cut of that movie and you got that had to be a very strange almost like you're releasing a child you're you i mean it was it had to have been so much more personal and so much so much more i've been through so much i really i didn't i didn't think it was good i thought it was a good movie i had just done salvador which was about a dirty civil", "DwfFsR_AE8s": "[Music] okay so today is tremors bonus day I'm going to be taking a bunch of trim and lar from a recent harvest and I'm going to be showing you how I go about making some simple safe solving this crisis if hash [Music] there's many different ways that go about taking care of your trim in life and this is simply just one of them and by no means of mine expert I'm just going to show you what I do in terms of sifting my trim and life to further extract the cannabinoids just to get as much as I can out of the plant with that being said I'm going to leave a link down below to a video with bubbleman and D for 20k going over the dry sipping process and in that one particular video they really do go over a lot of key points so I do recommend watching that video as well after you watch this video of course guys come on now when it comes to dry sipping trim lar for actual flowers dries in the name so make sure the material you're using is dry enough otherwise the trichomes they won't fall off the plant matter as easily now I'm using trim and lar from a recent harvest and after hang-drying the flowers for 10 old days I trimmed the flowers up and place them into jars for curing and I left all the trim and larf from the harvest on these screens to further dry I had it on the screens for over a week before placing into a freezer bag and storing the trim in the freezer for future use now on top of making sure the material is dry enough to dry sift also ensure your material is as cold as you can get it during the process of sifting the cold temperatures causes the trichomes to become brittle and more liable to break off the plant so it's best to store your material in the freezer right before getting ready to sift it try to set up your work area for sifting in a cold environment I'm using my basement and I live in Canada where it's currently minus 12 outside and my basement is sitting around twelve degrees Celsius or about 55 Fahrenheit if you happen to have a garage or perhaps a spot outside that is blocked off from the wind you may want to put on a jacket and take your sift area outside this way you can achieve the best yields from your trim [Music] now let's talk zip screens so each zip screen has a different mesh count which allows different size materials to pass through your top screens are classified as you're working screens and the top screen I'm using is the ninety lines per inch this is the main screen you're gonna be working all the material over it the trichomes will be breaking off and falling through to the next screen which is the hundred and ten lines per inch this screen is an important one because it's going to continue to allow the trichome heads to pass through while catching most contaminants which are going to be your decapitated stocks and pistol hairs the trichomes will fall on the screen or roll around until dropping through the screen while the contaminants toxin hairs land flat and gets stuck on top of the screen now this leaves us with the very bottom screen which is the 200 lines per inch this screen catches all of your trichomes it has a few purposes from being the final catch system of your trichome heads but is also used as a cleaning tool to further clean and purify your drive shaft heads of contaminants this is where you can take some farmers grade hash or Keith and further clean it down into pure heads there's multiple techniques to go about cleaning your dry state further from the carding technique to static dry sifting I'm gonna leave a link down below to a couple detailed videos on how to further clean your farmers great hasher Keith [Music] so the way I sent my tram in large is I like to do it in three separate runs the main difference between each run is going to be the time and the amount of agitation the material goes through the first run is going to be quick and it's going to produce the cleanest heads while the second and third runs are going to produce the most amount of heads but they will be dirtier and not as pure the first run through the screens very quick the material is simply being dropped onto the working screens and then picked back up off the screen and set aside for run to the main point of the first run is to collect the nicest and cleanest heads the longer the material is worked over the screens the more containers will fall through into your pile of clean ash so for the first run it's important to be quick and diligent and avoid being too rough and leaving the materials on the screen for too long [Music] now as I drop the material on the top screen the trichomes are going to be falling off and passing through and hitting the second screen and then rolling around until the finds will hold a pass through to the bottom screen so what I like to do is collect what's on the bottom screen already because it will be the cleanest pile of hash with minimum contaminants I will set this aside on a parchment and then bring back the second screen and I will just give the top of the screen a flick to cause the material to bounce this allows majority of there are many trichome heads to roll down to the bottom screen these are still very clean heads but because I'm flicking the screen more contaminants are gonna pass through which is why I like to collect them in separate piles keep in mind this is just what I do you very well could flick the second screen right away and just collect it all out ones and label all of that your first one the reason why I do with this waste because that first collection with the least amount of agitation is always going to be the most meltia sand cleanest heads that you can do and in the quickest form [Music] to prepare for the second run I just make sure the screens are clean because any condemned is left on those screens will block the trichomes from rolling down through the screens to the bottom so after every single run I will brush the screens down I also like to put the material back into the freezer too brittle up the trichomes usually a wait about a half-hour before starting the second run [Music] the second run is where I start to get rougher with the material on the working screens I will start to move around the material with my hands for about 10 to 15 seconds and typically for speed I move the material to the side of the screen and then grab another handful and drop it on the screen to repeat after a couple handfuls I will remove the material and place it into a bin for its third run and then continue on until the rest is finished [Music] now there's plenty of ways to go about dry sifting your material and you don't need to do a first second and third run personally I don't like to clean the hash so by doing a quick first in second run it allows me to collect a lot of trichome heads that require less cleaning the third run is where I spend the most time working the material and will end up with more farmer's grade hash that requires to be cleaned to further purify it from contaminants that's where the carding technique and things like static dry sifting come in handy they help further clean dirty hash from removing pistols and decapitated stocks [Music] oh that's good piping hot though last night I only ended up doing two runs just ran out of time it's gonna take way too long to do the third run and it was getting pretty damn late I am gonna do a third run probably like next week sometime I placed all the trim enlarged back into the freezer what we ended up with is like three point four grams of second run sift on the first run the quick run we ended up getting like the Eagles a gram so what I'm gonna do now is actually I want to press some of this the second run hash out into some rosin this is gonna be maybe my third time overall ever pressing hash out into some rosin I'm gonna do all of this wish me luck this is the very very first run and then this is also from the first run but that's after I added the screen a bit so probably a little bit more dirty than this stuff so we're gonna go ahead and take a dab of this and will it melt it probably will I mean I've good suspicion it will never timer Londa we're at a minute at a minute so this right here is a point four and probably gonna end up doing all of it let's go oh yeah she bubbled oh yeah that was super low ten in WoW is that tasty oh yeah you can see it evens these little dirty in there whoo that was nice okay guys well let's get set up the press some hash [Music] [Music] okay so first up we got a bag the hash now I've seen on Pedro's grow room he double bags his hash frozen I've seen him use a few variations I've seen him use 237 micron bags and I've seen him use a 25 micron bag with a 160 micron bag so no reason why I'm gonna go with this variation of double bagging so well let's get this stuff so I put the three point four grams of sift the second run sift into the 25 micron bag you know what I'm gonna do I think I'm gonna just pack this down a bit with my body weight and then so the 160 micron bag I don't know if I should have packed that down before or after look at that so there we go we got 3.4 grams of dry sift inside a 25 micron bag which is also double bagged inside a 160 micron bag these are from rosin evolution and I do have a coupon code down below along with a coupon code for the low temperature and press what you're about to see in two seconds so I think I need a pair of scissors just to trim this up and the way we go give me a second so that way we could just fold it a bit and get ready to press cool so the way I'm going to be pressing out this sift is using a directional flow method now it's very simple and what it just does is it presses all of the rosin of the front and it keeps it from going out the sides of that so you're going to basically cut this parchment to the correct size and there's a simple s just like that and then you fold in each side this is the way I do it very simple takes no time to set up and then you're good to go yeah because I'm pressing out some dry sift I turned down the low temp press down to 71 degree Celsius which I believe is about 160 degrees Fahrenheit and yeah anyways she's ready to go so let's press some rosin [Music] I'm at one minute right now [Music] I really don't know how much pressure to add I don't want to blow anything l things just gonna wait two minutes it's about now and I think we're good oh wow this looks four-way go and suck your blood that alone so that alone is 1.75 grams 1.77 grams and still got all this stuff on it and this looks definitely worthy of press pressing twice so okay guys that's this week's video I really hope you enjoyed it don't forget I'm not an expert when it comes to dry sifting you can actually grab farmer's hash and clean it down and there's multiple ways to do that so a few videos on that will be down below I'm also gonna link Pedro's grow rooms Instagram profile and YouTube channel down below as well as he presses a lot of hash rasen so if you guys are interested in learning more about that that's where I learned this double bag technique my phone just made a noise guys I'm not gonna redo it we're keeping it also don't forget that links to everything you see in this video there down below included the coupon code so if you're intrigued by anything check those out you want to help me out please just leave a like if you got a question or a comment just drop those down those helped so much and that's than that we're gonna see you next week for a video and I know I'm gonna go take me a dab of this hash resin peace out guys [Music]", "ylGTr1KTI_w": "good day youtube how's it going today everybody so anyway um what i have in here is i have i almost did a fail i got 14 grams of uh midnight kush okay i had a buddy stopped by yesterday and uh he brought me over a little care package which consisted of uh ounce just over roughly about an ounce of the midnight cush that he grew and ounce of the blueberry bubble gum number two that he grew this stuff smells pretty good for blueberry nice little buds in there [Music] so what i'm gonna do is try and press it up today and he also brought me over those two down there a couple little clones he said they're rooted and everything so we'll see what happens with them it's the blueberry bubble yum or bubble gum number two the clones this thing here i don't know what's gonna happen with this that's that bruce banner autoflower i think it's [ __ ] i think it's a done deal i started i got another seed i got the other seed germinating right now i'm just gonna let this thing go and see what happens with it i'll probably get one bud off of it if anything but we'll see what happens autoflowers and i don't care for them personally but and that little clone will see if it goes or not that was a little clone i took off my plant very first one and then these girls over here i got them under the barbell now they're adjusting to it they'll get big once they're big enough i'll pour them into flour we'll go from there and see how they do they're getting there they just woke up not long ago so they got to get all their leaves up in the air and all that stuff so there we go that's those so let's see what's gonna happen with this stuff here midnight kush let's see warming up i don't know like i said i didn't grow this stuff it's a freebie so whatever i get out of it i get out of it and he also gave me this stuff here which is uh this is the blueberry bubble of young there was just over three grams of rosin in there and he also gave me uh utopia haze there's like six and a half grams of rosin in there so yeah it was a nice little care package i got i don't mind them at all stop by without any day of the week you want i like care packages so there we go i'm gonna put that in a recipe i think the blueberry for sure i'm gonna stick in something blueberries awesome so there's that now let me see what's going on here nothing coming out yet that we can see so let's see if we can press it and get something to come out big old mess on my table here don't mind oh that's why zero pressure going on that might be why nothing was coming out yet let's see here we shall see and i also have uh 14 grams of the blueberry bubble gum number two here i'm gonna press so what i'm gonna do is due to the fact i don't know how to add it i'll do this one first we'll see how it turns out and then i'm going to press this one so probably get a couple videos today it smells pretty good though that bubble gum blueberry that's all i can smell in the room right now is that stuff let's go let's hit this stuff i don't see any anything coming out anywhere yet so let's see he said it took him quite a bit of dry stuff to get the six and a half grams there of the uh what do you call it utopia hayes yeah you know what he's been growing on just over a year now and uh i try to teach you my stuff and you know people do their own thing but i'm not saying that i'm any greater or anything like that but you know people learn on their own i guess he's got the basics down and you just have to perfect it you know i'm not getting much return out of his dry stuff here so we'll see there we go i'm going to hit this thing and bring it up to five times five tons let's see what happens like i said there's roughly 14 grams in there a midnight cush and we're waiting and we're waiting still waiting i don't see anything happening anywhere oh there's a little bit little squirt i hope it comes a little better than that there we go here we go taking our time a little bit in the back so it's not a leaker i went up to six six times let's see what happens here anyway people i don't think we're gonna see a whole hell of a lot coming out of this thing so we'll see what goes on i'm gonna cut it here see what happens and i'm gonna press the blueberry make a video on that one and uh i'll let you guys know what goes on if i post it or not we'll see all right guys like subscribe comment do what you got to do stay safe be safe have a great day peace out", "7KDXXoIL28Y": "[Music] what's going on guys my name is Jeff Austin is popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys are smoking with net let me know what videos you want to see in the future make sure you follow me on snapchat and Instagram and everywhere else to see everything I'm doing I'm

probably me doing mostly vlogs so keep posting I can't do it I've never really been the big trick guy I'm gonna get to look cool to do babe tricks and I feel like I don't really look cool enough that

"G_Y9WInSwEA": "what up guys welcome to CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny and we're back for a concentrate movie today I know you thought I was gonna say strain review but we're Davin we're Davin we got some [ __ ] frosting nug man times straight organics Rasen that I've way overpaid for them how can I this done was really expensive guys and you know to be honest we're not huge rosin fans but we're still trying to give it a shot so that's why I picked this up yeah I know there's a ton of viewers out there especially nowadays that are super heavy on the rosin we've been getting a ton of requests that do concentrate reviews but rosin reviews especially so we're gonna try to start doing more of them like Dan was saying this is a collaboration between frosting nub men and straight organics the flavor is SW og what the hell is that again watermelon strawberry watermelon oh gee I don't know I haven't smoked this flavor before I think it's a strawberry grew up and a watermelon OG cross at first when I saw that name honestly I figured it was just like run or something but apparently that is a strain that I'm gonna try before god damn it tastes pretty [ __ ] good obviously knock my socks off oh my god packaging is interesting this stuff is made from ninety micron bubble hash right yeah probably some pretty good melt to begin with was already you know used for the starting material on this stuff oh it's definitely strong do tell these concentrated views are always the funniest videos because we can't even talk than [ __ ] a half if you guys doubt out there you know we're talking about that [ __ ] especially a wake-and-bake such like this first half of the day first out of the day I'm still on sweat got dad stains on my sweats and concentrates me dad in the best you know everything but whoa straight to the [ __ ] forehead dude the effect is great you know the flavor is pretty good but I feel like I feel like Jay Mike is just as good if not better so my knock on Roz bubble hash Rosen has always been it basically just tastes like bubble hash to me you know I'm saying it does and for me for whatever reason I like the high a little bit better off just regular a really really really good pull man but then all of a stop up they were gonna be like you know Robin melted rosin rosin pressed from 90 you is just gonna be better than the 90 years gonna have less you know plant material in it and other things that are in bubble but okay man I still like the bubble I still like the way it melts clear domes this is more like a you know a batter or BHO almost you know what it is I feel like every single time I travel buzzing made from bubble hash I always end up thinking okay now I want a double hash tag I would it's the only concentrate or when I smoke it I am curious to smoke the starting material yeah I smoked pho I mean maybe if it's you know I guess that's not true sometimes if I smoked some really good you know oil all like man I wish I could see the weed that that came from but right whenever I smoke good hash bras in the moments like okay I want to smoke the actual hash and see if I like that better so another thing big thing about rosin for me and I think maybe why I haven't been on the train as much especially the last year in California is like it's expensive this was what 70 to $100 a gram to get stuff like this as far as market value in California where this was selling for forty dollars a gram out the door at Colorado you know 125 for this that's insane now I'm just saying in mind guys we wouldn't tell you right now it's not worth it for me I would never pay anywhere close to 100 grams for this no for me to want to smoke every once in a while we'll go out of kind of our normal you know budget or just kind of did we do something a little different than what we would normally look for if we were just shopping for personal smoke when we're trying to find stuff for videos so that's why sometimes we'll throw a number out there oh this [ __ ] costs 80 dollars a gram 100 ollars a gram and you guys look at us like we're crazy right I wouldn't buy this again no I'm just gonna come out and say that and that being said these are two really high-quality companies that I respect that put out pretty much nothing but quality so it's not a knock on them it's just the market and the product itself I mean if that's where you gotta sell it out to make a profit then damn and I get it that it was in this in the city so you know rents obviously gonna be higher than stuff we know we consider all these factors but we really really just picked this up to review for you guys this is way outside of our budget you know book we do we do come out of pocket quite a bit for the show and this stuff was definitely pricey but shout out to straight organics frosting that man definitely grateful AB but you know if I if I had to break this stuff overall I'm probably gonna go with like a solid 7.5 the the best thing on it is the effect definitely got me super high whoo yeah yeah I bit off a little more than I could chew it thing me too so rosin the when it comes to the rating the big spot that always loses points for me is flavor yeah so this honestly the best rosin and I remember as far as like you know quality as far as just like the metal the high the smells in Terps the Samoa cookies that we got made from our grown car it was that logic right right I'm sure that was some of the best bras and I've ever had I've ever tried whether that being said the flavor is really not that different from you know I can't discern different flavors on screens as well Rasen as I can with flowers or full mil I'll tell you about this this guy it's got my mouth like straight dry as [ __ ] I'm like got straight cottonmouth definitely super cerebral high right it's honestly kind of kind of sativa tea for me I feel like I definitely need to like go do something sucks cuz it's raining outside but yeah I mean it's a it's definitely a strong but it's a good bus again I know that part of it I don't even if I feel like I don't know about you but me personally I have less experience with rosin than with all other forms of concentrates flower right so sometimes I feel not as confident giving like a real solid opinion on Roz and yet overall yeah so if you guys I shout out to all the rosin aficionados out there that watch this show especially if you're in California if you guys have tried something that you think can change our minds put it down there in the comments let us know what is the best rosin that you've ever tried personally give us any leads to you know some fire ask Rosalyn because we're definitely on the lookout for it not saying that this isn't fire but you know when when judging this hash critically you know against BHO against Jay Mike you know I got to give it a 7.5 it's interesting you said that because I was just thinking in my head like how are we supposed to rate these when we rate because when I rate a flower I only rate it against other flower you know so I'm thinking but sometimes when I bring a concentrated I kind of group everything together but maybe I need to think about this just as compared to other rasa I think it's overall dude concentrates a concentrate whether it's no matter the extraction method you know it's a concentrate that's how I judge it yeah because I would say if you break those two categories of differently my numbers would be different just based on personal preference like overall concentrates I think you're 7.5 for me personally that's pretty good rating for this right for rosin I'd give it a nine or something like it is it's as good as any other rosin that I've tried pretty much it's one of the better rosin on track for sure but when stacking it up against you know some Jay Mike you know Boston j-mac tip we're gonna review soon and to be honest we took a dab of that and it tastes better I liked it a little bit better it was a little bit cheaper this stuff had a different consistency when we got it it obviously it's right up yeah so we picked it up and we didn't actually get to take it home and do the close-ups on him for like 24-48 hours so it was yeah it kicked up right away but it looked awesome when we got it right yeah I don't know I think solid overall but I definitely want to try more rosin and get a better feel for it before I just like come out definitively and say that it's my least favorite right well what's your Regan I'm gonna go with an 8 on this guy an 8 ok that's that's pretty fair definitely shout out to straight organics frosting Eggman go follow them wherever they are follow us make sure you like subscribe do all that damn stuff that you're supposed to do down there all the buttons yeah and we'll be back for another one of these probably next week that's right so if you want to check that one out check in with us next week it's gonna be a full melt Friday that's right full melt bubble hash right here on

that like we're gone [Music]", "QAkbtBShyp0": "hey everyone how's it going Eric here with peer pressure we're gonna be showing you our top five tips and tricks for getting the most out of your flower rosin so whether you're pressing at home on a hair straightener or using an industry-leading press like our peg speak rosin press we've got all the tips and tricks so you can get the most out of it tip number one quality in quality out this is the most important thing that you should know when you're making flower rosin or any rosin the better the material you're starting with the better your results are going to be and the fresher it is the better the clarity as material tends to age it's gonna oxidize and you're gonna find that that rosin is gonna come out darker so if you're looking to make the best flower rods and you possibly can get stellar material and press it as soon after its dried and cured as possible tip number two relative humidity makes a huge difference with flower rosin now you can go check out our other video where we did the full in-depth test but what you need to know is that your flower should be at least at 55 to 62% humidity before you press it this makes a massive difference in your yield so just make sure that your material is properly hydrated before you press it tip number three choose your temperature based on your desired results so we encourage a lot of experimentation and you're gonna find that most people are either pressing on the lower temperature range which is about 160 to 190 degrees Fahrenheit or the higher temperature range which is anything from 190 to as high as 250 degrees so depending on what kind of consistency you want to achieve that's where you're gonna set your temperature on the lower range you're gonna be looking at more of a butter on the higher range more of an oil or a shatter so when you have some material that you're playing around with we encourage you to try both ends of the spectrum and see which one you like the most tip number 4 choose the right micron bag type now you can absolutely press flower outside of a bag and get great results but that's usually only a gram or two you're gonna want to press in a 90 or 115 micron bag or at the most 150 we recommend not going any lower than 90 because that's when you're gonna see a huge drop-off in yield so if you're pressing flour in a bag make sure to stick in that range and finally tip number five if you're looking to make the highest quality flour on possible you absolutely don't need to overdo it on the pressure now you can definitely over press your flour rosin by applying way too much force at your bag and in fact we've seen great results not only with yield but of course with quality pressing at the lower end of the pressure range anything from around 550 to 1600 psi at the bag so when you're applying way too much pressure in the many thousands what can often happen is that you're pushing out plant fats lipids you know the waxes as well as all of those undesirable plant materials into the rosin really over pressing it so if you're looking for the highest quality rosin we recommend trying the lower pressure range and seeing your results thanks for watching we hope that you found that was helpful for more tips and tricks make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel and follow us on social media at Goa peer pressure thanks again for watching [Music]", "JEc8S-NYomU": "[Music] all right all right guys we're the first to do this 2 000 milligrams so on the nuxmaster mini there's really the unit was designed to do two different size smashes um it's really designed for travel personal use trade shows um to go and set up heat up quick and uh then extract either a gram nug or three quarters to a gram nug in a piece of parchment paper with no [Music] bag that's one of the presses that it's made to do which we have here in the back some dosey dough and then in the front we have some chronic kush it's also made to do a three and a half gram smash in a three and a half gram bag like this bottle loaded bottle textile um we advocate that extraction method so all of our surface area to pressure calculations on all of our units have been done assuming that you load the bags bottle textile like i said the mini was made for two two different smashes a single nug smash and a piece of parchment with no bag or a three and a half gram bag smash loaded bottle textile now both of these different uh ways of extraction the different weight of extraction are going to require the same pressure because at the end you're going to get the overall same surface area on the extracted material so if you're up to a one gram nug with no bag it's probably gonna be a little bigger so it'll be a little less pressure that you're applying you know um if you go closer towards three quarter of a gram nug with no bag uh it's going to be uh more pressure on that surface area because it's going to be smaller so you'll learn that as you get a unit and you start to extract you'll see the different different results in and out from the different product and whatnot especially if you're on the growing side so we're waiting for this oil to melt over here we thought it'd be a great time to read off some of your youtube comments on the latest videos believe it or not we actually read all of your comments so let's try to keep it positive um latest video was the bubble hash let's see what you guys are saying so connor 4k hey what do you guys do with the already pressed flower as you can see this is exactly what we do we like to make potent thc oil with it and it actually comes out really clean and really high quality don't recommend smoking it i would personally do the oil 10 times out of 10 with the pucks let's see what else we've got here shady 580 cop watch nug smasher is by far the best on the market you'll get your money's worth and then some my small one is paid for itself many times over i really need to get a bigger and bigger one now production is up well shady 580 we got the nug smasher pro ready for you here just give us a call and we'll get this sent over whenever you're ready what else we got better than watching porn nick garden i'd agree with that porn for stoners i dig it complete wash 86 i could see there's a some similarities there so jared stallman how much material did you start with to get that much bubble hash at once was it nugs and trim or just nugs um for that i don't know the exact amount because our friends over at 11 11 cannabis company uh provided us with the bubble hash but it i do know that it was a fresh flower trimmed right off the plant it was still live so if that answers your question let's see what else danny thompson it's like watching da vinci paint i'm seriously considering picking up a nug smasher at harvest time this year i used to be into the whole backyard blasting thing but figure now that i'm growing the garden of my dreams with all my favorite strains why half-ass it when it comes to concentrates that keef was beautiful i'll always have a soft spot for keith full melts i definitely agree with you blasting is cool but rosin is a lot cooler all right i think that's enough for now let me know you guys thought of that we can keep reading them off like i said we read all of your guys's comments so try to keep it positive if you can

vapes and extracts for several years now and he's here to tell us all about some new groundbreaking products let's welcome the very smart nate ferguson of jetty extracts uh greetings nate how's it going it's going well brad thanks for the kind words my pleasure my pleasure i love you guys you guys do great stuff [Music] uh you guys are always doing something different uh something cool could you just give our viewers a little overview of what uh jetty extracts is and what the goal of your company is uh jetty extracts is a california cannabis company essentially we do extractions we manufacture for different types of oil and concentrates um we've been doing that seven years like i said it's something we have a passion for and you know just really founded on the ethos of being true to the cannabis plant and trying to you know express it in the best way possible your your company bio says that uh you know that you try to make the cannabis that you want to smoke so the question is what is it that you want to smoke um you know it kind of changes in my mood but essentially we want to make an extract that always tastes and resembles how the plant was at its prime at its harvest so with old extraction methods that you kind of first started doing a lot of things get degraded the flavor the aromas like a lot of things that you love about the sour diesel or this og kush doesn't quite taste or feel the same so we've always been on a mission to really express the plant the best we can and you know what what do we want to smoke we just we want to smoke good stuff i mean it depends on the day sometimes i'll i grew up on kind of like the sour diesel east coast stuff like that so i love that i'm through and through but sometimes it's og sometimes it's new exotics there's so many new strains coming out it's hard to say exactly but we just want it to taste like the plant smells and smokes [Music] you have a new line of cartridges that are categorized as unrefined live resin uh could you tell us what that is well the live resin category is a huge category it's been growing we've been watching it for many years and within that category there's all these formulations so there's you know certain types of live resin that are mixed with distillate and just high terpene extracts from live resin there's you know just the sauce fraction there's all these different types of fractions and formulations people are sort of blending to get their live resin we just wanted to make you know take fresh frozen cannabis extract it and then put that in our cartridge so keep it as simple and as minimally processed as possible so that's really what we set out to do with this unrefined it's unrefined it's very minimally processed to kind of always compare it to like unrefined versus refined sugar you know it's just very minimally processed it's very raw it's a little darker in color but all the flavor all the terpenes just all the compounds are there which really give you this entourage high or this entourage effect of all those different compounds working together as opposed to kind of slicing them up if you will uh you have described uh the unrefined live resin is as giving the user a different kind of high could you go into a little bit more detail about what you mean by that yeah it's um you know you hear the word entourage effect or entourage high it's you know there's studies in israel going on about it but essentially what it is and what we're getting from our product is because we're not refining it too much we're keeping more of the compounds intact which they all work synergistically to kind of make you feel more high or a better experience if you will than just taking like a small fraction of the cannabinoids or the terpenes and putting them back together so something that's say 80 90 potency and you know our product might be 70 to 80 but you actually feel more high when you smoke it because all these other compounds are sort of working together to to synergistically to make make that a better high [Music] you guys got a um from what i understand a new product it's so new in fact i don't think you even have it on your uh website which is a solvent-less vape could you help me understand uh walk our viewers through what that is sure um yeah just like jetty's mission has always been to make like a clean pure product solvent list has been you know something that's been around for thousands of years you know you talk about old school moroccan hash and stuff like that afghani hash and people have been making you know with sifs and different types of methods without any solvents for yeah like i said thousands of years and you know over the last you know five ten years it's really involved with the fresh frozen cannabis different methods you know taking your kind of old-school bubble hash and then moving that down the line into rosin and doing live rosin and stuff like that which is essentially taking a bubble hash or a crude hash and and pressing it to get rid of some of the contaminant and make it a pure more potent product especially at the end of the day so you know we've seen and tracked all these methods obviously and we're like man it would be great to put that into a vape but the consistency didn't really work that well in a vape and when we could find the consistency the potencies were really low the flavor would degrade through the cartridge so it wasn't something that was really you know a real nice high-end great experience through and through um so we've been r d it for you know i would say a year it's very strain specific there's only certain strains that work with the solventless type vape that we're doing so we actually actually had to identify the strains about a year ago grow those strains specifically for this product and now since croptober happened we're harvesting everything's frozen we're just starting to get some trickle some r d stuff out and some soft launch stuff into the market but essentially it's a solvent-less vape it's probably the cleanest purest thing around it hasn't touched a solvent the only thing we use to make this product is ice and water um a little bit a little bit of heat and pressure um to get the consistency right but those are the only things that touch the cannabis to make the oil that's in the product so it is like the cleanest purest product that's on the market i would say i mean what are some of the strains that uh work with a solvent-less vape sure um you know there's like i said you know everybody's breeding more from the ones that worked but you know you'll see a lot of strawberry bananas sour diesel is always a good one ogs but certain ogs and you know gmo is a good one it's always a high yielder so we see a lot of gmo crosses right now we're doing a lot of different cake strains and i think we just ran a tropicana cookies which is a really nice one as well so i mean what does that mean for you know for the typical user to have it without solvent just means like less bad stuff going in your body essentially right you know i i don't want to discredit solvent type extractions i think they work great and you know you're going to get a really good product at the end of the day and from a chemistry standpoint when you're looking at like residual solvents with left in the product i mean they're all very minuscule if not anything at all but some people prefer you know if you're going to whole foods and buying organic and and stuff like that you might really care about what you're putting in your body and you know obviously the experience is a little bit different knowing that so you know it's i wouldn't say there's like a big difference as far as like overall safety it's just you know for the people that really care about like cleanliness and just having a really pure product that was totally minimally processed with just ice and water i mean this is a great product for them and beyond that it tastes really really good we are preserving a lot of the terpenes and and certain things that other solvent extracts you might lose a little bit you know we believe in the cannabis plant we know it's a natural thing that can help people with from a medicinal side to just you know your everyday just make you feel a little bit better just going on a walk or whatever it is so um just really paying homage to the cannabis plant and just trying to express what the plant gives us and have people try it and enjoy it is really our ethos [Music] i know we've talked about this in the past but it's such a cool thing yeah and we're going to show you we're going to show the viewers some some footage of this but could you explain what the sound hash amp is and and who came up with it sure yeah we had um you know i had a idea actually of a different sift method so we talked about solventless types of extraction um people do dry sift and sift methods but we were you know just talking about you know what if we could use sound or tone to actually shake the trichomes off the plant and make some sort of extract from it so from there you know we started doing all these you know playing with different herds and 430 hertz and these different tones and stuff like that but it sort of evolved into this big giant base amp where the screens sit on top the cannabis sits on top and the cannabis actually vibrates almost levitates a little bit but you know the tones and the frequencies going through the canvas plant actually do work to agitate it enough to knock the trichomes off sift them through the screen so you essentially have like this sound made hash or sound extracted hash so you know given the pandemic we haven't been doing too many events so it's sort of just sitting in storage right now but um yeah it's a it's a really fun thing i mean a dj can get up there you know some guy les claypool or you know basis can get up there and play some licks and just make your own extraction it's pretty cool [Music] nate if you had all the money in the world what would be the first thing you would buy um don't say world peace either yeah i mean that's cliche you know i obviously want to make the world better for everybody um if i had all the money in the world and probably buy an island you know okay nice yeah for the nice surf break on it and lots of fruit and vegetable trees plants and trees right and uh you put the gigantic sound hash amp oh yeah they're on that island a massive cannabis garden extraction facility the whole thing would be a cannabis playground well once again i'd like to thank our guest uh mr nate ferguson and our terrific sponsor infinite cbd infinite is now offering 20 off all their products to high-five

Hello, Paul.\nVery nice to meet you. Can you step aboard?\nI'm -- I'm good. Thank you. \u266a\u266a I've just given cannabis\nin the privacy of my own home. Thank you very much. And, uh,\nthat's a 1:1 strain, which is 15% CBD\nand 15% THC. There's no\nrecommended dosage, because there isn't\nany medical data on how we're to do this.\nOkay. But, really,\nwhat I'd say of anyone is try a very, very, very\nsmall amount. Just take -- even just, like,\na pinhead to start with until you just\nget used to it. No need to worry about money,\n'cause that's what we do. We give out\nfree cannabis oil.\nWell, thank you very much. Because Paul lacks\nregular, safe access to medical marijuana, he uses a combination of medical oil and street weed to treat the symptoms\nof his stroke at his home in North Yorkshire. [ Birds chirping ] Andavolu: So, Paul, if you could\nsort of take me through -- What happened to you? 2005 --\nI'm living in Thailand, and I went out\nto my wife's village. Went swimming\nin the morning, and later that morning,\nI just fell, and I've got videos --\nbizarre, coincidental. Paul: Now, while you're\nplaying around on there... [ Woman gasps ] -It's okay.\n-There's no blood. [ Child crying ]\nOkay... And I was paralyzed\non the left side of my body. [ Slurring ]\nDo you need any... [ Woman speaking indistinctly,\nchild crying ] Woman: Hey. [ Crying continues ] Paul:\nAnd for the next six months,\nI was carried to the toilet. I had about 10% of my left body,\nat that point. I've had a headache\nfor 11 years.\nWow. Can you imagine having\na headache for 4,100 days? -Straight?\n-Straight -- absolutely. I never get a break. Imagine big, rolling\nboulders or marbles crashing\noff each other. It's like a tightening\nof a skull cap on my head. Did doctors sort of\nprescribe you anything to sort of help?\nOh, sure. Yeah, I-I've been on\npretty much all the medications that they're allowed\nto give me. I was on 14 pills a day\nat one point. So, on these pills, physically,\nit closed me down, and a couple of them depress you\nenough to kill you. This last Christmas,\nI decided no -- no more. And, uh, that's when\nI started, uh, smoking, because it dulled\nthe pain. \u266a\u266a It allows me to do the things\nthat I must do. It gives me potential. The pain's still there,\nbut it's in a bubble. But it's like\nthere's an extra layer between me and my pain. My kids\ndon't see me smoke. I only smoke\nin my room. I don't smoke anywhere else\nin the house. I'm a single dad.\nMy kids come first. Hello, you. -What'd you doin'?\n-Hi. There's word\nfor your brother you'll learn\nwhen you're older -- seven girlfriends,\nI mean... He's a player! Okay, that's one way\nof putting it. Yeah, sure. All right,\nhere's the view -- pizza. Can you bang it on?\nYou can do that, can't you, huh?\nMm-hmm. All right, homework --\nWhat about French?\nI got my history. What was your history like? 64%. 64%. -Yeah.\n-Well done, you. -Pizza's ready!\n-Okay. Thank you, sir. Please.\nYou're very welcome. Oh, thank you very much. Meat Feast or pepperoni? I think it's Meat Feast,\none of your favorites. -Meat Feast.\n-Looks like it's Meat Feast. Do you guys sort of,\nlike, realize that, like, the marijuana\nthat your dad's smoking is still, like,\ntechnically illegal? Yeah, we do. How does that make you feel?\nLike, what... Uh... Kind of scared that\nhe's gonna get caught. Paul: If I thought there\nwould be a situation where our life\nwould be threatened, I wouldn't smoke.\nMm-hmm. That's just\nblack and white. They're more important to me\nthan, uh -- than anything. [ Speaks indistinctly ] Ooh.\nHey, you okay? Yes, yes. Is it sort of scary\nto think that he has to do something that's illegal to,\nlike, feel better? If it's helping him,\nI allow it. But if he's doing it\nfor no reason, really, I would feel\nkind of upset. Right. But it doesn't seem like\nhe's doing it for no reason. It seems like\nit helps him a lot, right?\nMm-hmm. Well, she hates smoking --\nI think that's the main thing. And she's got a pretty good\nsense of values. And to her, whatever\nshe sees in the world, says pot's bad. And she thinks\nin black and white. And now we give her\nthis conundrum that daddy needs it. It kind of throws a bit\nof a wobbly at her, you know? Mm-hmm. So she's trying very hard\nto reconcile that. We had a bit of a cry together\nand a cuddle upstairs, and, uh, she'll be okay. I mean, it's hard, right?\nAnd it's -- It's lousy. I have to live a lie,\nand no parent, especially when you've got\nabsolute love for your kids, wants to do that. \u266a\u266a I've come\nto Limehouse Marina in London to see John on the final leg\nof his journey. Today he's gonna take\nhis tiny, little canal boat into the mighty River Thames\nto let his cannabis banner fly and to drum up support\nfor marijuana reform right in front of Parliament. What we've got here are\nsome CBD-rich cannabis seeds. They're very low in THCs. I'm gonna pop them\nin the balloon. Okay. [ Helium hissing ] We are gonna tie some notes\nto them from patients -- medicinal-cannabis patients\nacross the UK, and we're gonna send those\nup into the sky and hope they reach\ncommunities across Albion. Amazing. [ Hissing continues ] So, what do you reckon the day's\ngonna be like for you? Uh, I am...\nI mean,\nyou're taking a small boat into big old body of water. It's gonna be a big old\nbody of water out there, be nice and choppy. How is it different from the small canals\nthat you go in? Uh, it's tidal,\nso it's pretty dangerous. Do you think the boat's\ngonna handle it? The boat is gonna handle it,\nmy friend. We do not like pessimism...\nOkay. Right on. ...anywhere near my boat.\n[ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a [ Boat motor humming ] All right, John!\nSee you, man! Goodbye, Krishna.\nGood luck. Namaste. Whoo-whoo!\nWhoo-whoo! [ Laughs ] That's the little barge\nthat could. \u266a\u266a [ Crowd cheering ] It's to legalize\ncannabis in London. [ Cheering continues ] -Hey, how's it going?\n-Nice to meet you, man. Good to meet you.\nHey, man. I'm Krishna. You guys excited? \u266a\u266a [ Siren wailing ] Hey, Paul. -Krishna, how are you?\n-How's it going, man? Aw, it's good to see you. -What a great event.\n-I know. How are you feeling --\nYou excited? I'm very enthused\nand excited about it. It's not just talk. These are real people\ncoming out and demonstrating\nthe reality they believe in. And that's got to make a\ndifference, Krishna, in the end. And what's it like being sort of\nbeing amongst this group of, like,\nother like-minded people? -Brothers. Family.\n-You think so? -Yeah.\n-Amazing. They're just be so open\nand honest about it. I asked them, did they feel\nat all self-conscious? Hell no.\n[ Laughs ] You know, this is what\nthey believe and what they do. Yeah, people are just, like,\nsmoking weed next to the Thames, next to Parliament. The English are\nvery law-abiding. But I think now that we're starting to see\na movement that's gonna\ngive us a change. And this is the mother\nof Parliaments. If it can't start here... -This is where it starts.\n-This is where it starts. \u266a\u266a Andavolu:\nAll right, it looks like he's just about to go\nunder Westminster Bridge, and he's just gonna pop out right in front of the Houses\nof Parliament and Big Ben. I saw him for just this little\nbit right on the other side, and he looked really tiny. Like, the boat was small. And -- Oh, look! You can\njust see him right there. He's coming in. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] He's releasing the balloons. [ Laughs ] Amazing. Man: Go on, John!\nKeep going! Get those seeds!\nYou tell Cameron! [ Cheering continues ] Hey, John!\nHey, John! He gave the wave!\n[ Laughs ] He waved at us. And he looks so small\ncompared to that building. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] \u266a\u266a As an American,\ncoming to the UK and seeing how medical-marijuana\npatients are faring -- In one way, it's a little\ndispiriting to see that they have to improvise and sort of do\nthis underground stuff to get what they think is\nmedicine that's gonna help them. But another way -- I'm seeing\nsomething sort of special. The people I met here\nare kind of filling in the gaps. Guys like John,\nlike Paul, like Hidrow, who are making real sacrifices\nin order to help people -- Robin Hoods of sorts -- they're forming these kind of\nad hoc underground communities, taking weed\nfrom the black market, making it into oil\nand medicine, and then giving it\nto the needy. That's kind of\na beautiful thing. That sort of, like,\nmodel of compassion is something I think\nthat the world can learn from. What I've seen in the U.S. is that legal weed\ncan equal money. But here in the UK, it seems like illegal weed\nequals compassion. And what's cool\nis that compassion is free. \u266a\u266a", "YJyJ3VMEdLI": "what's up guys we're sending the smash lab right now we have to nug smasher minis here our old nugs measure mini and our newly refined next measure mini we're gonna go over the changes and improvements we made to the newly refined mini as well as walk you through a smash we have 3.5 grams of a GoSee dose flour here this looks like really good stuff we're gonna do that in a 160 micron bag 3.5 and see what kind of yield we get but first let's talk about the difference between these two units so we recently purchased a new fiber laser and bender machine which has allowed us to further refine the nug smasher product line today we're gonna focus on the notes master mini looking at the mini you're gonna see the new fit and finish we've been able to implement precise tabbing that allows us to rely less on bulky welds it also gives it a much cleaner look our new release valve has a safety feature that prevents the knob from opening too far and causing leaks one more thing we've done is move the on/off switch to the back of the machine and even made the power cord removable for easier travel so you guys been asking for a lot more informative videos lately you guys like when you have we walk you through the entire press how we do things a couple of our techniques so we'll go ahead and try to give you a little bit more information on this like I said the new on/off switch is now on the back to turn that on and doing this go see those flower we're gonna do around that out of two hundred five degrees mark that we traditionally do so it's already set while that's heating up when we take this uh flower dozy doats like I said and it's been sitting in a Boveda pack for about a week now if you don't use those you might want to try it out it mu stands up your flower and it ends up giving us about a percent to two yield higher than it would have if we had left it dry so we traditionally use these a lot pull that out we'll get this scale down our scales are the zero all right so we have about 3.6 the bud looks really good really frosty and we're gonna be using a 3 point 5 gram 160 micron bag the 160 micron bag is the micron size that we use for our freshest most Moines flowers so that's the one we're going to use okay so we'll take our 160 micron bag and we're gonna pack it a bottle textile like we usually do pressing flour first step we're gonna invert the bottom corners the 3 point 5 gram bag is the hardest to do this with it's just a little bit harder to mold around but you got your dad tool for that so get the quarters inverted okay so for those of you that haven't seen this packed ball textile or still aren't really sure how we go ahead and I include the link of the description and a link on the video for a full in depth how to on packing politics style for those of you that are pretty familiar my corners are inverted next thing we're gonna do is just go ahead and add your flour you [Music] all right so we have our bag packed next thing we're gonna do is just wait till this gets the 206 we're gonna add our parchment and go ahead and start pressing so our plates are not heated up we're gonna go ahead and turn the release valve lower the plates and insert our Kirkland brand parchment paper [Music] we have our handy-dandy Doug Smasher magnet right here go ahead and start gradually bringing the plates together so with the minute you're gonna want to get a whole standing arm pressure on it and we're probably going to do this for about 110 seconds once we apply for pressure [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right it's been about 110 seconds you can see we have some fresh dab sitting there amazing working color and consistency to pull that out and it looks great [Music] [Music] okay great looking press here's our bag you can see it has that a surface area that you were going with a mini the same that would happen with a 1 gram nug without a bag but yeah this is how you want it to look when you're done you can see why you might have less yield if the bag and look into form then it doesn't have the surface area it's because you didn't get everything out of it because of the way you pack the bag look well put that to the side and we'll use that for a later date to make some different oils and jell-o's and stuff like that you guys have been enjoying for now I'm gonna go ahead and collect this up [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so here's what we got nice easy collection really great ending product our scale zero Dow see I kind of yield we're working with okay so about nineteen percent yield decent yield a important thing though is that it's really high quality stuff we really like the way this looks the color the consistency we're gonna go ahead and try those dabs out see how they taste thanks for joining us hope you enjoyed this video let us know what you think and we'll see you next time hey guys make sure you check us out at nug smasher com to check out all of our awesome products we also have tons of great information on our site including calculator tools and Terp files be sure to check us out there at nug smasher com", "_BnAbBlMJwQ": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the canvas somali a I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for a cannabis extract review I'm really excited that we have cannabis extracts back in Canada and that I have some great friends who are making them growing them with their allowed for plants and sharing them legal rosin how cool is that if you were here from the start of the channel you'll remember that I used to do all my pairings with extracts and only extracts and as soon as legalization happen ox ox 17 20 18 I shifted to reviewing legal cannabis just to make sure that I was playing within all the rules now we've come to a point where we could finally have these craft extracts again and some of these producers from that legacy market I'm lucky to have built friendships with and have them share phenomenal phenomenal products with me which is great I love legalization in Canada super super cool what's the first one we are going to try I have two today we're gonna do two of these new reviews and see how they go I was just in Vancouver for lifting coke conference and I was finally able to meet a very cool gentleman I had done quite a few reviews of his rosin in the past and it was really great to finally meet it's melt season if you're from the show I did a lot of great things about season he has a phenomenal rosin maker it does a lot of collabs with a lot of big wonderful companies in Canada so we have our label says Sunday driver 120 you let's just break that down a little bit so Sunday driver is a genetic from can urato genetics that went to jungle boys and that's where it became really really popular as soon as it was jungle boy then it was one of these really big hype strains and what is the build of it it is fruity pebble OG from alien genetics and then a grape pie and has just all these wonderful fruits and gases and all that great stuff all the Terps that really really like our in here so I've been waiting to open this and make sure that I opened it and could review it so that's the strain we have the producer melt season and then you can see that it says 120 you and if you're not familiar with hashes or Rosen's especially hash Rosen's or hashes that might make absolutely no sense to you and when we're making hash there are silk screen sizes generally they start 190 hundred and fifty and then you get to the Year 120 you and your 90 you then you have a seventy five a sixty a 50 and a twenty five but or seventy three you sorry but that 122 ninety you section of screening is where you get the most mature heads so your 120 you and this is just as I assume this is just a straight 120 you pull of this very specific a lot of people blend their 93 you and their 120 you to get a larger output but very interesting to see the 120 you and I'd really like to do some tasting differences to see if a 93 you would taste different than a 120 you because of the size of the glandular head would be very very interesting experiment to find out so you can see in the bottom we've got a nice wet delicious rosin nice and white absolutely fantastic let's dig in to the nose you can see there I'll get a nice closer video you can see how bright and white it is I believe this is a keyword hash rosin hmm and on the nose the first layer is like this almost creamy herbaceous gas that could only be related to hmm this one's quite confusing cuz it's very complex there's a layer of white flowers there's a layer of gas there's a layer of skunk there's a layer of Rudy miss mmm absolutely delicious super complex which is great and just kind of wet we'll break it up a little with my dab tool here and see if that'll release an aroma so I can really get on point with those mmm if I was gonna relate it to something it would be almost sweet lemongrass petrol some very fresh delicious earth that has some fruits some tree fruits some black and red tree fruits falling in it some plum some blackberry some blueberry but very creamy as well hmm very interesting aromas but a medium plus exaggeration of area it's a medium plus expression of the aroma sorry for my stutter very delicious smells very fresh smells very nice and knew and loved for so I've got my puff go peak here we're gonna load it in the puff Co peak and see how it tastes we'll get that big of a dab in there but a Bing C it is it's a big one but it's not a small one or it's a small one and a big one anyways let's put make sure this is on the right temperature we're gonna put it on medium on green and let's fire it up this is really great to be able to go back and do these types of videos I'm really excited to be putting out more bras in education more hash education because there's a lot of verbiage and vocabulary in there that gets quite confusing so already this lesson on 120 u-verse 93 is fantastic hmm it really translates well I have a quartz insert in here but the flavor really translates well from what I was smelling that creamy lemongrass there's a taste of ginger there's some citrus there's some petrol it's very mouth coating it's very mouth filling and delicious how can you complain about something like that big vapor clouds on green tasty confectionery a little bit of herbs gas everything that you could really ask for in cannabis I guess that's why this genetic is so famous sent to a very famous extractor why it's made its way around the world I totally understand I really like the sunday driver thank you melt season for the wonderful gift I really appreciate it I hope for anybody watching we helped to clarify a few things I should mention that this hash was made from cured cannabis so it's not a live rosin but it's just a hash rosin absolutely fantastic make sure like comment share and most importantly subscribe so you can see all the new videos coming out always working on lots of content I'm really excited to share it with you guys till next time Cheers what's my name what's my name the cannabis Somali yay", "6klJ1KfIQEk": "[Music] p2pt [Music] what is up y'all p2 peeps and today on this very windy day we're going to be checking out some more affordable rising guys so yeah like i like i said in the title this is another one of the cheap roses this is the lowell herb co lemonade aged cured rosin so this is about 55 a gram out the door and like i said for rosin it's pretty cheap so i'm not sure if you guys seen the video yet maybe you have or maybe you haven't released it but there is another cheap brand of rosin called uh honey butter and they make some great stuff so um gonna see if this can top that so the honey butter rosin is 45 dollars that's 55 and rather normally floats around 80 to like 90 bucks a gram so very expensive normal uh you know in any normal circumstance so yeah hopefully these you know products encourage more affordable rosin to come out so let's take a look at the stats shall we this is the pink lemonade hq rosin once again uh here's the backing for y'all right there just in case uh it didn't it doesn't focus this is the stats 656 percent thc uh 1.65 milligrams of cbd so that's probably about uh 1.6 uh cbd there uh i don't think yeah we're not seeing too much of yeah no there's no cannabinoid percentage here but i do like the packaging of this this box is super sturdy like listen to that it closes like that it feels like uh like a jewelry box you know when you open this thing up if you feel like a little bit like royalty or i guess a little fancy maybe not royalty is the right word but yeah so this is the cured rosin that is inside and it smells phenomenal guys it smells a lot like flour of course like most rosin does and it's got a really really nice soury cut heart kick to that smell so a lot a lot on the nose for uh you know that pink lemonade name you know you like you like having that uh that sourness of course from the limonene and a little bit of sweet tartness there from whatever wherever else that might come from sorry guys i'm only really familiar with limonene as a profile but yeah we're gonna take a fat glob boys a fat glob right there and then i'm gonna let you guys know you know how it feels when i'm tasting all that good [ __ ] so cheers [Music] hmm oh uh [Music] it's still quite a bit to go here boys whoo try to finish it on one rip so i didn't finish it there it is that should be the last of it [Music] okay okay so what i'm tasting and what i'm feeling so i'm going over the taste before it tastes a lot sweet or not a lot sweet a lot of that like limony kind of uh you know citrusy kind of limey kind of like or a lemony flavor yellow tininess at the end there with the slight tones of sweetness not too bad on the taste actually you know like i said it tastes a lot like smoking flour so i imagine excuse me so i imagine this is how the pink lemonade strain you know tastes now like terms of potency this thing definitely hits hard you know a lot of people see aged or or aged cured silver they you know they see cured resin cured sauce all that stuff and they just automatically assume it's old weed and you know that's right in some regards but not really you know like hearing something doesn't necessarily make it worse or old you know i mean i you know well don't say old because technically curing something you know the product is going to be older than when it was fresh but you know it's curing something isn't bad at all i used to love curing my nuts you know keeping me in the jar for a little bit longer letting them lose a little bit more of that moisture just so they can dense up more and get to uh a kind of like i was about to say consistency but you know a kind of level of you know that i like you know like i like then snugs with a little bit of moisture i don't like it too moist you know i don't want to touch it and feel kind of like feel it kind of wet i like it when it's a little dry there's some bounce to it but um not not too much uh fresh wet kind of smell on there that's my preference though but i do think that sometimes uh you know fresh flour hits a little bit harder than uh cured flour but honestly guys it really is dependent on the strength yeah but yeah in terms of don't see guys this is this is a hybrid first this is hybrid as it says on the box and um i don't know if it leans anywhere uh specifically you know whether it's leaning towards sativa or indica uh right now this isn't the first time i've added this you know i've had in a few other videos maybe you guys have seen those maybe you haven't but um yeah this it's uh it's a little it's always been a little bit rough for me to decide what this one is i feel like it's because the lemony cup taste throws me off and i start thinking oh it's a sativa but like you know the effects get get me kind of stuck so like i just feel like you're not gonna be going out to smoke with other people or hang out with people who don't care if you're loaded i don't know you should go hit this before going outside and starting your day you definitely could get away with it if you got used to the high but me i think i'd like to be a homebody with what i'm dabbing on this one so without further ado i'll take one last hit for you guys and uh yeah so this one isn't as big as the last club because guys i can't lie i'm pretty faded right now but uh we're gonna go ahead and take one last one here for the video and i hope you guys can join me so get the bulls pack some dabs ready get your carpet or you know smoke up that joint and uh cheers boys just drop that in all right here we go all right thanks guys for joining me for yet another video and i hope you guys join me for yet another hit cheers hold on still a little bit more in there sometimes i miss my old rig you know dabbing the old way for those of you who are curious i know i get that question a lot but um you know like i said i'm just waiting to get a new rig and then i'll probably be dabbing again on a banner because i have turp pearls and all that stuff that i should be using okay yeah that's about i'm gonna do it for the video so once again our flavor profile we have here it's a little sweet a lot of that you know limonene kind of lemon lemony citrus piney um honestly it's really delicious you know like any rosin this tastes a lot like uh flour would taste i think you know in terms of its taste you know because flour has a distinct taste when you're smoking it then a concentrate does you know sometimes concentrates have their own kind of taste and i feel like that's just because uh when you extract something down to its very like essence like most concentrates pretty much are you're like you're gonna lose some stuff you know there's definitely some uh compounds in flour that make it taste more you know more distinctly um yeah and uh in terms of potency well this is a hybrid you know i did get i am i do feel kind of like a tv high like in the upper area but um you know i could definitely fall asleep off this too if i laid down or if i uh you know didn't want to do anything this would be a great strain as well i feel like this is a good hybrid because like i said i can't really tell where it lies but you know me personally i feel like it's laying laying there on the indica more side but um yeah the way this is hitting me is more like a 50 50 split i feel like i'm just saying indica just because i like indigo but yeah thanks for watching guys and if you enjoyed this one please like comment subscribe hit that notification bell all that good stuff please i would love to see you guys again on another video see you guys later peace out peace", "W5mwkjDFbQ0": "[Music] [Music] [Music] yo what up youtube welcome back smoking with small town you know the

calculate this up price at blue fire dispensary in merced california it's going to run you around thirty dollars for the gram it's a great price for connected product connected is a really good brand um the look and the smell of it is really good it's a it's a good looking batter it looks like most of the batters i get that are you know that are nice like that the smell isn't bad either the uh the smoothness is there it didn't [ __ ] up my throat at all the flavor is is solid i really like the flavor and the high off the first hit it wasn't really there off the second hit now it's starting to pick up my eyes dropped i'm starting to feel more loaded now so the high is definitely there it's not like a super heavy hitter indica it is more closer to a 50 50 hybrid in my opinion so overall for the docidos live batter by connected i'm giving it the 8.3 it's a solid strain it's not you know nothing it's not one of my top top ones i've ever reviewed or anything but it is the 8.3 it's solid it's worth trying out it's not a high price if anybody's ever tried it let me know what you think if anybody decides to try it let me know what you think so i'm giving it to 8.3 that was my review i hope you guys enjoyed it until next time smoking with small town [Music]", "fRMREjp9UC0": "what is going on everybody it's your boy and no girls hope everybody's having a wonderful wonderful day I've

"aB4nhPQgDxs": "hey everybody how's it going today uh giving you a special pressing i'm pressing some uh crunch bearing kush cbd hemp flour i've got an ounce of it on here i'm going to be pressing it on the crd 20 ton press at 200 degrees i've already got it loaded up with nut smasher 120 micron bags bottle text style it's all loaded up let's see what she does hope everybody's having a great start to their weekend hope you're all staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there i could be doing this for you if you want to bring over your dispensary flower turn your green into gold for you now hemp doesn't generally produce as big a yield it's generally darker in color but uh it's still a lot of fun to press so let's get this thing started here hope everybody's getting a hold of some really good flour at the dispensaries seems to be a lot of good stuff around african ties back i heard okay hey everybody it's hard for me to do both of these things at once so i got the uh camera on a tripod here let's focus in on that there okay so let's see how this hemp comes out hello to everybody who's joining me live appreciate it always love doing live videos don't get to do them that often pressing a lot more hemp than i used to but hey it is what it is so bringing this up to pressure real nice see how long it takes to start extracting tension really takes a little longer gotta be a little more patient with it hey what's up caleb what's going on brother jake what's up pressing some hemp crunch berry kush and we're gonna see what she does okay now we're starting to get a little bit of a little bit of action here starting to see it wet up a little bit you never know what you're going to get out of hemp it's real real finicky because there's just not as much material to extract out of it as there is with uh dispensary flour so if you're in the pittsburgh area a medical patient you got dispensary flour you want pressed into gold i will be available this weekend you know how to get a hold of me um especially veterans i'm always always willing to go out of my way to help a fellow vet so that's what i got going on this weekend if you want to stop by love to see you okay here we go now we're starting to get some extraction on the inner inner side yeah there we go i had to give it a little love rehydrated this stuff with uh hydra stones that's what i'm using now instead of spinach to rehydrate hey hey everybody let's see if i get in a little tighter for you look at all that medicine right there okay well in this case patricia this is this is hemp this isn't designed to get you high this is all the medicating without the high basically you can see on here it's a little dark that's a good characteristic of him we'll see what uh kind of a yield we get out of it there we go so we're just letting it extract i haven't even gotten the max pressure because trying to bring it up slowly i don't want to have a blowout on this thing it is definitely doing some nice extracting at the moment what's up dirk try to get the lighting a little bit better in there it's really hard to do my next press is going to be matte black so it won't uh reflect the light so much you know just little things you learn as you go along oh yeah look at that that's some really nice medicine right there it is just continuing to come out here come looking a little a little bit sappy yep absolutely right chris it's not get you high it does melt you out so let's do something here let's tip this a little bit forward i don't want to go a full rain mode on it but i definitely gotta damn this up here so we're not going to have wasted medicine a little crease in there now we'll just give it a little a little bit of a tilt and there it comes again the color on it is generally what i what i see a lot of when i press him [Music] dispensary flower that i press generally has a much lighter color but hey you know you learn something new with every strain you press that's why i like doing this always get to learn something new so let's bring down the hammer fully okay we got it at max pressure now and production's still moving along a little bit but it's starting to slow down we're gonna pull this stuff here real quick so here it is all right here we go yep that's what it looks like so hang on a second let me pull this off of here get it down onto the cooling plate reorient camera so that you can see what's going on get the lighting moved all right i'll just turn it like this give you a nice view right there so let's see what we got oh hello hooks came out perfect didn't didn't blow him out not a super high yield that i would expect from an ounce but i'm not gonna pre-judge it i'm gonna let it cool down a minute and then we will see what it gave us so run this over here get it set up a little easier didn't look super stable but hem seems to come one of two ways it either is really really super stable or it's not stable at all you don't find a lot of middle ground with it like you do with dispensary so again you're you know you're talking about plants that are similar but not exactly the same and uh they react differently under pressure oh wow yeah that's gonna be that's going to be a challenge to to gather up because it is definitely not want to set up here but these patients do care and we'll get it all let's get into this hope everybody's having a good night tonight hope you're staying safe staying healthy you know i am staying here at the house but definitely make myself available to anybody who wants to come over for press and sash even if you just want to come over and hang out watch some tv and laugh at some stand-up comedy i'm just chilling at the house this weekend next weekend i'm going to be busy be over in new jersey over at new jersey weed man spot watching major mclennan do another concert that place is off the chain i love new jersey weed man spot i mean think about this this guy has been doing this [ __ ] for decades now they've been they tried to bring this guy up on charges 12 separate times and he managed to get off every single time jury nullification that is some serious sack on top of that he sets up his spot right across the street from the courthouse it's like a big [ __ ] you to them i love it now he's got a bunch of tahoes he dressed up to look they're like delivery vehicles or something for his business but they're dressed up to look almost like cop cars almost just enough different he can't get in trouble for it but uh man he's he's just out there running around waving the flag man gotta admire a guy with that that kind of commitment i don't know if i could go into court 12 separate times facing major prison time and come out of it smiling like he did i give him all the props in the world for that and i'm going to be hanging out with him next weekend m and major mclendon and my buddy matt several other people are going to be coming along i'm sure we're going to go there for that concert and have a good time safely social distancing you know but they can't stay you can't stay chained to your house forever they'll be willing to come out come see people come do things there we go let's get a little a little bit better maybe it just need a little more time to cool down just keep at it stay patient with it get it all back yep so what's everybody vaping on man what you smoking on vaping on whatever um i'm still working on my gg4 jar but i started off with a month ago still working on that thing i just love it been liking some of the new flower i'm seeing hope some of you guys bring some of it over so we can do a few videos press that stuff for everybody to see yeah you guys got an eighth or better bring it on by we'll shoot a video have a good time with it wow some of this stuff just doesn't want to set up at all this is crazy get a lot of that back later all right you have definitely pressed a lot better hem uh this stuff is not not the easiest to gather up definitely isn't going to have the kind of well it will have probably average hemp yield of course but like the yields i like seeing when i do my videos with dispensary flower that's always much more satisfying for me pressing hemp is a good way to to let people see the process not having to spend too much money uh and and cbd is fantastic for some patients um concentrates you make from hemp like this are still just as medicinally valuable as dispensary stuff just no high and not a lot of trichomes or anything like that it's just not as not as complicated a plant to me this is stuff with thc in it but even these cousins they make real good medicine when you treat them right there we go let's throw this paper in the freezer overnight and all the stuff that's still sticking to the paper i'll just pick it off in the morning but we're getting lying share what's on here now so but as you can see it's it's very dark and not super stable this is definitely not the near the highest quality hemp that i've processed a lot of stuff i get from thrive is some of the best i've had here in pa from from local pa growers and then you got people like out in oregon with tweedle farms that are putting out some really really good quality hemp as well but honestly the the best i've pressed so far in terms of hemp has been thrive flower those guys out of philadelphia are really really putting their heart and soul into their plants and you can definitely tell uh when you press it the yields are better the quality is definitely higher um but hey you know everybody's still learning this is still a young industry for for people in everywhere you know so i think over time we're going to see a lot more quality uh just in general but this is uh you know it is what it is i like to show the good the bad and the ugly this is some of the ugly you know i don't hide anything from anybody not everything i do is going to be you know show quality but again we're dealing with the quality of the flower to be going with this stuff is so so not stable um i'm not going to waste any more time trying to scrape it i'm just going to freeze it we'll get it into another container later so that's what we got yields gonna be scary small but uh hopefully the medicinal quality of the hemp's going to be good enough anyway yeah 1.859 yeah it's that's uh oh that's super low yeah that's what you what you expect from him most of the time that's not top tier top tier hemp you can get up to you know 20 21 yield sometimes i've heard some get a little higher than that but not very often this is what you can expect to get from low to medium quality hemp flour um yeah it's about what i expected like i said but anyway i appreciate you guys joining me for this uh please uh come see me if you have any flour that you want uh i want pressed over the weekend i will be here for that and my camera is doing weird weird stuff okay so thanks for joining me for this sorry it wasn't more spectacular but when you press and hem that's what you get sometimes stay safe stay medicated be good to each other i hope to see some of you here over the weekend i'm out", "SM12-6QEfLI": "what's up everybody we're here in the smash lab and today we're gonna be making some very very strong THC oil using 17 different rosin pucks [Music] the thing about these rosin pucks is they are still loaded with THC we haven't been pressing super high pressure lately we've been doing around 650 to 700 so there is a lot of rosin left over in these the great thing is we've got a new teach egg tester so we're gonna find out just how many milligrams is left inside this oil at the end the last video you saw when our boss drank that entire thing he was completely loaded we are gonna find out just how many milligrams that was and we anticipate this one's gonna be a lot stronger so stay tuned to see just what the measurement comes out to we'll start by getting a little bit of coconut oil 60 milliliters and our beaker over there and warm that up to about 140 degrees for 5 minutes alright so there's our 60 milliliters what we're gonna do is add it to this larger beaker because we're gonna be putting the pucks inside here we need a little bit more space [Music] all right so we're gonna let that heat up for a few minutes it's at about 170 degrees right now okay so our oil is now at around 125 degrees we're gonna go ahead and start adding our pucks like I said we have 17 bucks right here if you want to take a look at these you can see these things are cake this thing has got a nice yellow color still kind of sticky smells great wish you guys could smell this we're gonna start by adding 2 at a time try to save a little time here so I'll take these two right here take a look at these I want you to see what they look like before and after they're gonna be a lot more clear and that oil is gonna be bright yellow by the time I'm done with these two so let's go ahead and have these in there make sure they're fully submerged and boom as you can see we can easily add two at a time in here as we lose a little bit of oil we might have to drop down to one at a time so this all depends on how much oil you're using [Music] all right so it's been about five minutes we're gonna go ahead and take a look at these pugs make sure we got all the rosin outside of them it was about five minutes and we're doing two at a time it's important to know that you can even do seven to ten minutes depending on how your puffs look after we're gonna take a look right now you can see that the oil is already a completely different color than it was originally so these do look pretty clear we'll probably go ahead and let those sit for about two more minutes make sure we get everything out and then we'll completely remove them [Music] okay so it's been two more minutes let's go ahead and remove these our first one here as you can see that was a lot more clear take a look at our oil here it's got a nice yellow color it was originally clear so we're gonna do is go ahead and squeeze the rest of the oil out of these pucks here okay so our first two pucks got them right here as you can see those things are really clear we pulled a lot of rosin out of those here's a one we haven't done yet next one we have done as you can see there's a lot of rosin inside of these puck still what we're gonna do is bill the other 15 bucks in there on a time lapse to save you guys time and go ahead and see how this oil tests out at the end okay so that was the last puck we just did all 17 as you can see these are completely clear now we pulled all the rosin out of those as you can see the oil is way dark way darker than last time we assume is gonna be very potent we're gonna go ahead and test it out but first we've got Adi carbon so let's get that last puck out of there [Music] okay so we just removed that last puck and we turned the temperature up a little bit on our hot plate we're trying to get around that 220 to 240 degrees range we're gonna let that boil sit there for about 10 minutes so we can de carve this is gonna activate all the THC that's inside that oil this should take about 10 minutes but we're gonna pay attention to the bubbles that are forming as you see those bubbles that means it's d carving and once those disappear you're pretty much good to go [Music] okay so next we're going to do is take a nug Smasher 37 micron bag and strain the oil through it what that's going to do is get rid of any of that plant material was left over [Music] all right so what were left with is 20 milliliters of completely activated THC oil what we're gonna do is use our new teach egg test machine a lot of you have been recommending this to us you really want to know how many milligrams of THC was in a in the oil when we were done what this does is it uses light to analyze the oil and give us the total cannabinoid count we know that flour that we pressed was predominantly THC however if you were doing heme it would give you the CBD results as well the only thing is it only tests up to 15 milligrams of THC or total cannabinoids per milliliter so we're gonna have to dilute our rosin oil right here in a twenty to one ratio with coconut oil so we'll do that now all right so let's get our scale zeroed we're gonna add a point 400 grams of clean coconut oil right here alright next we're gonna add point O two of our rosin oil [Music] turn this on alright so we're testing isolate infusion we're doing coconut oil temperatures about 75 and the infusion has been deep carbs we're going to go ahead and begin the test first we got to ensure the tray slot is empty which it is okay let's just calibrate yeah and while that's calibrated we can go ahead and add our oil to the tray right here [Music] all right all right we got the results ten point six times twenty so two hundred the point six times two would be [Music] so two hundred and twelve per milliliter and how many do we have twenty Destin that's that's a lot for one person to drink that's pretty heavy all right so extremely potent oil right here we just got this tea check yesterday we've been playing with it for the past two days really cool device we were really interested to see how many milligrams this was 4240 that's a lot more than most people would do in one dose like we did last time thanks for watching the video and make sure you stay tuned for next time hey guys make sure you check us out at Doug smasher com2 check out all of our awesome products we also have tons of great information on our site including calculator tools & Turf files be sure to check us out there at Doug smasher com [Music]", "T6o8v7FV_kw": "[Music] your people what is good so we've just done the like review sort of quick extract video on the odv free hash rosin by sub-zero extracts really really enjoy an x-ray for you know what [ __ ] it let's get another pot ordered uh so what we've got here is a 3.5 gram of cool latte rosin by sub-zero extracts uh it's in a slightly different part we'll do should give you a quick little sort of teaser so you can see definitely looking nice from the bottom what we'll do is we'll get that opened up so we can have a little look into it and see exactly what that's looking like so just got that opened up damn it's defo looking fire really really nice a real nice color to it looks like it's got a bit of wetness to it not quite as wet as the other one but definitely still a little bit of sort of wetness to it but that looks a really nice consistency does it doesn't it's a little bit paler than the odv3 i would have said adv feels almost like a little bit more yellow this one's a little bit more paler it's a really nice color and for those who don't know uh coolatto is across her face on fire across girl scout cookies cross gelato 33 i've got admit i'm really excited to try this one let's have a little smell yes really really fire like um like a cookies or a gelato just with quite a lot of gas in there as well definitely spending fire when i put my nose to the pot looking like a real nice consistency i can't go i can't wait to start having a little dab of this what i'll do is i'll quickly work the flashlight for you so hopefully you can see that maybe a little bit better and then i will like last time i'll get a video of you playing it but i'll get it recorded outside so we can try and see it in the natural lighting and stuff let's just get the flash on quickly and have a look at this there you go that is the cool art oh just with the flash on like i say a little bit paler than the odb3 it's a really nice color this one is definitely a little play around with it and stuff like that see exactly what it's saying in the natural lighting when i get a chance but damn that's definitely looking good in it trying to get the zoom to see sort of the wetness in there damn looking really really fire i don't think this flash is quite doing it justice what we'll do is we'll get some videos out in the natural light and like i said we'll try and get a milk shot as well but yeah cool art oh hash rosin by subzero extracts looking really really fire let's get to dabbing this [ __ ] your people so i just want to show you this really quickly this is the uh cool latto uh hash rosin super super fire i've been absolutely loving it i just want to quickly show you sort of a consistency sort of check as you can see it's just real real nice waxy consistency there's a little bit of moistness there but it's not quite as wet as the odb3 sort of bounces back there when you when you do press into some of these parts but generally speaking up real nice sort of waxy hash rosin sort of consistency perfect for like donuts and that melts beautifully as well we'll try and get a little melt sharp but i just wanted to quickly show you a video this consistency just so you can see that this this cool light is absolutely banging probably probably one of the best things i've ever done personally sub-zero extracts have killed it with this one so yeah we'll try and get a little milkshake but just so you've seen it in the natural light that's the consistency of it coming real real nice banging yo people what's good i just wanted to try and do as a quick sort of melt shot of this uh cool latto hash rosin by sub-zero extracts you'll see i've got a nice little glob for us in there ready to hit a dab um i do have a new dab rig as well this is the uh wax made aries e-rig uh saw papa shane uh reviewing this i thought you know what i'm gonna grab one of them give it a try looks all right on that i've been enjoying it i stuck a fresh out of my zorans so we can see how nice this burns really because this cool light is super super fire got a real nice sort of gelato we should be taste to it some gas underneath there as well but yeah we'll try and get a little mulch shot i don't know how what i'm going to do with this but i'll do my best to try and get you a little a little something so you can see how nicely it's melting but yeah big ups or zero extracts for this one absolutely smashed it like i said we're going to try to get a little milkshake on this ear rig but uh just bear with me i don't know how well i'm gonna do this um but we'll at least try and get a milk shot i don't know if you'll be able to see me smoking or not but try and get a metal shot so let's just [ __ ] get this on there you go all on and fire away cheers boys let's go in for a little dab oh straight away you can see how nicely that one's melted let's get the uh carved cap on let's get hitting the dab all right cheers boys yo people so slightly flop that air melt shot obviously you got to see a note in and put the e-rig ran out of charge as i was dabbing it so i only got sort of like a decent pull of it uh i'll work on that for the next time we'll try and get your proper mulch on there film some clouds as well but this one's been absolutely lovely i mean i said it a few times in this video absolute fire big up sub-zero extracts like i say some of the best stuff i've ever dabbed on this definitely getting more of their work in the future because i just love these last two bits this and their adv4 both been special so big up sub-zero extracts and yeah we're back with uh with more content and all that good stuff real

higher than the live rosin i was like things make you go hmm regardless let's check it out this is what it looks like it was nice big chunky monkeys it smells like it's very gassy now i had the guru before and the guru was like just a little too gassy for me i thought there was something wrong with it but i think it was just me because i got the rso and it's gassy but this right here is gassy but it's like skunky gassy so let's do a dab okay maybe if i can get some out there's that new dab tool uh it's a prototype bullets a and yes they're spent okay oh come on okay there's that all right let's go a one a two three oh if anyone's wondering this is how you do a cold start no no guessing this is a cold start easy peasy easy breezy beautiful dab girl that's good let's do this cheers who would be the first time today i was a lie i think i put a little bit of fire yeah i'll show you guys again i'll clean that well this the water is supposed to be room temperature but it's so freaking cold in here [Music] but if you get your banger filthy boom i know people use alcohol i do have alcohol but in fact this when it's hot it kind of boils all the oil away oh sorry being a little anal all right why does it still why is it so effective oh you know what time it can is handle it all right recovery modified grapes muv ultimate let's talk about it gas gas ass good quality medicine if you ask me super terpy mad flavors like mad mad flavors and the effects yo the effects i'm gonna go ahead and call this i really enjoyed the live rosin but i enjoyed this a little bit better who would have thought i don't know why uh the live browsing that i got prior to the one the first one that i got i liked a little bit better i mean i liked it it was fire but i was like holy [ __ ] this is like a little more a little bit more uh indication it's like it is it's a heavy indica to me because i feel it in my eyeballs when i feel in my eyeballs i'm like yeah yeah i have been using this a little bit this week i definitely use it i had a killer headache this week hit this a couple times bye it definitely helped with my shoulder pain so and if you want to take a little nappy poo which was a bad idea because i'm waking and baking with this this morning but hey i just wanted to get the full effects there's that muv modified grapes crumble 10 out of 10 will be getting again boom facts that is some fire i really enjoyed this i will probably get this over the uh rosin because it's cheaper and i actually enjoyed it more and let's be real i gotta buy one get one free next time i go it might be some rolls and i mean hey they got it there we go i i think yeah i really enjoyed this i can't believe i liked it more in the live rosin but i did who would have thought yeah i think we're done here are we done here i think we're done here if you made it all the way to the end of this video you are awesome please go ahead and drop a like you can be a dick face and drop it dicks my channel says hit that bell to get notified when i post yeah perfect timing bye", "lwK48X845JI": "[Music] all right so we're going to weigh out this pile here we're going to try to press it in the old rosin press so oh [ __ ] jesus four grams wow so 5.7 grams we're gonna put it in a bag we're gonna put it in the press see how she goes i'm gonna make a highly sophisticated roll i wonder if i should have done this in a different manner i don't know on the nug smasher website they do say to do it bottle text style so still learning myself on how it's going to be [Music] all right so we have the press set to 185 degrees what i'm going to do is grab my little pouch i don't know if that's the right way to really get it in there or not now online these guys do what's called the directional flow method i i've not been able to conquer that very well i don't know why but i'm gonna attempt it right here because if this does start oozing out [Music] crazy all right so i just felt the first bit of resistance what i'm going to do is just give this a couple of seconds to heat up kind of get my package warm [Music] okay start adding some pressure to it so looks like something's coming up yeah i'm going on the side hard huh 25 seconds here we can see [Applause] something's happening there [Music] [Applause] it's dark we're at one minute 12 seconds i'm gonna let this go probably three minutes thanks all right so we're hitting three minutes 30 seconds we're about to stop it right now oh boy as you can see there is definitely a return there i don't know exactly how much it is but i can squish this again there's still stuff inside of that so i'm going to fold it over once more and do a second squish [Applause] all right let's see if we're able to get any of this [Applause] for sure [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] all right so that's kind of what we're working with right there everybody let's go ahead and throw this on the scale just to see what it is only 1.4 grams that doesn't make no sense that's what we got", "EHMZ_kDCuys": "here we go now for real so I welcome everybody to the 1:30 presentation solving lussac's traction strategies for success if you haven't already done so please silence your cell phone so that we're not hearing those I am shake the Laos host of the shaping fire podcast if you like listening to smart interviews with the top minds in cannabis I invite you to check out the show at shaping fire calm we also have an extraordinary YouTube channel with over 150 speaker videos that reported at events just like this one in fact our philosophy one of our speakers already appears on the channel teaching about rosin tech Josh Rutherford is one of the founders of pure pressure as well as owner of push masters and award-winning processing lab based in Boulder Colorado Erik loskis director of marketing for pure pressure and the two of them operate pure pressure the industry-leading saltless equipment supplier so please welcome Josh and Eric awesome thank you all for coming we appreciate your time we've got a really good seminar here to empower anyone either if you have an existing business that's running solvent list and you're looking for tips and tricks on how to make it better or if it's a form of extraction that you're looking to get into either as a complete net new or as one that you're gonna be adding on to an existing operation so the whole point of this presentation is to give people advice tips and strategies that you can be successful with solvent lists it's one of the extraction forms that needs the most education and that's what we're here for so Josh and I will be you know tag-teaming these topics we've got a lot of great ideas to share with you guys and we're gonna go through this presentation in a cadence kind of leading you through how to really think about being successful with solving this processing because there are a lot of elements to it that if you're not really orienting your business in the right way you can make some missteps you can stumble and it'll make it a little more difficult for you to do so so we're here to help anyone who's trying to do salt and let's do it right so the first big point is in today's market with concentrates if you are not making samos concentrates you do not have a premium extraction brand and a lot of our customers solvent list might be five percent of their business and some of our customers it's a hundred percent of their business but if you are trying to make concentrates solvent list is the way that you attract influencers and come source because that's really the product category that that specific segment of the market is looking for now we go to tons of trade shows we talk to business owners I mean business owners of co2 companies hydrocarbon companies those guys that are owning and running those companies are smoking processes that's what they tell us the absolute secret I mean it's the clean concentrate as well you know the solvent is concentrates it's also fleshing the highest dollar you have a variation of skews that you're able to create with rosin with ball hash and really escalate what you guys are doing whether it's an existing lab we're trying to start justice all tooless lab or having a solvent and solvent this labs it's really really important to be able to have and we'll get into this a little bit later is a variations of SKUs and saltless can bring you that and you know it's a definitely one of the cleanest concentrate forms that I enjoy smoking laws yeah so another quick note here is that many of our customers are doing all kinds of forms of extraction and and most labs should be so that is the perfect segue I don't know if anybody checks out MJ biz they put out a fact book every year they updated we are not affiliated with them in any way I'm not a salesperson for MJ biz but they're Factbook provides some of the best data in the industry and if you're serious about learning where trends are totally recommend it and that's where this slide is coming from I know the resolution isn't very good but what this very complicated set of bars and numbers is trying to tell us is that the profitability of processing operations increases dramatically when you're making a number of SKUs so for processing operations that are making one two three different products only six of them are reporting that they're profitable that is very very little now you get into four to six 20% but then once you get to that bottom what that's really saying is that processing labs that are making between 11 and 15 unique SKUs unique products 83% of them are reporting profitability that is a massive Gulf in the difference of how many products these labs are making and their profitability as a result yeah and the reason you know you kind of see that trend in the industry is because we're in a limited market you know wherever you're opening up whether it's Colorado whether it's you know Illinois or California you know there's only so many dispensaries licenses so being able to capture more skews more volume with each of those stores and have a bigger presence in those stores is very important in order to be the most accessible with yourself in this business or so and most importantly solvent lists is the least expensive way to add additional SKUs when you compare cost you know for the equipment for everything that need to go in on to actually release a number of Samba SKUs it's Ovilus tends to be the least expensive of all of them so it's the easiest way the cheapest way to add additional SKUs to your product mix if you aren't already good so yeah that's all about the post process cost process that you're actually using to make those SKUs so whether it's going to be topical edibles carts you know rather than batter there's a bunch of different jams and micro-diamonds all sorts of different things each one of these can be ask you for your business to be selling and what it's going to come down to is also the material that you're able to source or grow so that's also something that we're going to get into here down the line yep absolutely so helps you attract more consumers there are consumers in the market and I'm sure a number of them in this room right now that you probably will pretty much only smoke salt list or maybe really good live resin but the high-end the connoisseur the influencer consumers this is the product that they're looking for and if your lab isn't producing it then you're not even competing in that market in the first place so now we're going to talk a little bit about the different types of products that we see as the most popular that are being sold the most and right now really catch rosin has risen over the last couple years to be pretty much the dominant solvent list product in terms of quality in terms of volume being sold at dispensaries so Josh you know running coach master and making a lot of hydrocarbon solvent list he makes a whole variety of products not just solving list this is what you can see right oh yeah it's definitely the industry trend and my career I was just mentioning you know there's many different consistencies that you can make off of your cell phone this concentrates so it's really off of the post-processing and actually maximizing and using industry specific equipment so that you're optimizing yourself on this metric because you don't want to leave 2 3 % behind and you know end up you know not having the extra that you could have that it's gonna actually make your business Bible yep and we're gonna talk about food grade solvent lists and kind of dispelling the myth of how to get a better yield out of your product with hash drawers and specifically you're seeing that people are really developing a taste for live rosin products just like live resin coming from fresh frozen plants that terpene profile and for a whole variety of other business reasons labor time there's all these reasons that companies are doing live products and live rosin is pretty much the king right now in terms of high-end Abbeville concentrates now full metal six star is also starting to make you come back a lot of the people that have you know been enjoying hatch for a long time it's a pretty unparalleled experience experience to get great full melt now more and more places are trying hard to produce full mel bricked hash is making a comeback as well we are seeing some really cool ice water cash products and not to leave sift out of this there's a lot of companies also making really great stiff crossing flour rosin however is a product that we're not seeing as much of in mature markets like colorado in newer markets it's easy to produce we're seeing a lot more of it there but as markets tend to mature we're seeing a little bit consumption of flour oven yeah and we kind of talked a little bit about that and why you kind of see those trends those trends are also because of the price point of the flour compared to in that relative market so you know for example if the East Coast I mean I'm sure pound flour on the recreational and medical market are still going for three thousand plus we're here in Colorado there two thousand and below so you start to see those trends and those shifts within those camp cannabis businesses and those mitts so those nips were basically going to be able to create different SKUs and varieties based on the price points they're able to start sourcing material yep so these are kind of big dogs right now and then where we see and have seen really great opportunities for existing and new businesses to take advantage is with leash saltless products there's a number of them out there and there's producers kind of all across the country that are building their brands and their businesses today on these CBD and CBD rosin we're going to talk about that cartridges the proliferation of true rosin cartridges is just going haywire right now concerns there's just so many of these high end hash makers that are now starting to make cartridges topicals and salves that's another thing you know just having a product that is based in rosin that is solvent list is immediately a differentiator that people can identify with and one that will can also increase the price point of your product because it is a higher quality product to begin with yeah and topical themselves and edibles and stuff like that your grams of concentrate you know it might not be a demo to dabble gram or something that you want to hit the shelf well then you're able to take that type of product or even a second press rosin and really ship those into those type of products and that potency is going to go so much farther than selling one gram your dog and you know coming from my and the things working in marketing talking with so many of our clients and kind of their marketing endeavors you know this is one of the most powerful tools you can give a marketing team and your company is to say this product is solvent list this product is full spectrum this product that has these quality identifiers z' to it whether or not it was made from a food-grade rosin or not so there's a lot more flexibility with solvent list now than there was a year ago when we were giving this talk and we're seeing a lot more businesses a lot more of our customers you know really diversifying what they're doing with their material as they press it and turn it into a variety of different things yeah now more than ever setting yourself apart this industry is exactly what you need to be able to make a stamp and a brand so just before I move on resolution very good but poplin Barkley one of our biggest customers out in California they've become famous for what they put out our mainly topical zein I mean they're one of our biggest customers and the majority of what they do with their rosin is is making topicals in California I mean that is the clearest example of a brand in an extremely competitive and difficult market California is extremely tough to operate in right now using a food-grade high-quality rosin to make topicals and being extremely successful with it so one small example obviously really nice packaging doesn't hurt but they do a really good job another thing CBD rosin this is something that unlike ice water hash and sift is still very much in the mastering process I think a lot of businesses are really trying to figure this out right now and a lot of people are interested this is farm house hemp they're located in Fort Collins Colorado we did a video with them talking about that but that they use browsing for all of their CBD products there are some issues depending on the concentrations of course but using CBD rosin is a a huge differentiator and there's a ton of things that you can put it into it's not just selling a CVS Ram and within you know they'll CBD and you know you're pressing something you're activating it next y'see well you're just concentrating it you know that will happen whether you're distilling it or you're using ethanol or whether you're using solvent list you're gonna end up having a higher concentration of THC in that product which is going to make it uncomplaining within you know the farm bill to be shipping so what you do at that point is you end up mixing it into you know MCT oils or you end up making products themselves that because even if it has 1% THC in the overall concentrate after you've done after you've made it well after you've diluted into that one ounce jar for that pet now you're maybe 0.1 percent THC and we're always allowed to point three are there any products that you've seen on the CBD side that are particularly popular right now I mean that products tinctures salads are probably one of the most popular that I've seen right now just totally on the market but pet products you know I feel like you know anything well anybody will do anything for their pets so yeah definitely I know so another big thing that we really get a lot of questions about and now we're gonna kind of lead into you know really actionable advice and items for your business or any business that you're planning on starting is kind of explaining what yields with solvent this look like and and what they mean so and it's really shifting so when you've got flour rosin you're looking at ranges of 18% or above and all of these ranges are what you can expect and what you should strive for with your business now with ice water 1/2 specifically since we've been talking a lot about that when we're talking four to eight percent that's a fresh frozen product that is a product that is about three-quarters wet weight we're not talking about a dry to a dry we're talking to that a wet product yielding into a final dry state yes so taking a frozen and a dry pod basically your frozen pond will basically be like a quarter pound dry so I always use the math to 7525 when you're talking about frozen weight so you're talking about frozen way for true frozen pounds equals one dry pound so when you're doing your math and you do your numbers based on these numbers there's actually pretty it equals you know that eighteen percent range compared to you know that four to eight percent it's the same math it's just a different volume of water within that cup within that but mass yep and we're about to talk pretty heavily about genetics because that is going to be one of the key factors here and how to achieve yields that are profitable for your business and the way to really think about this is if you're trying to make a full milk product you're trying to you know capture the best trichomes you possibly can and sell that as a standalone product what you would do as a business is watch that product very gently at first and then you're gonna go back and you're gonna re wash it for a full spectrum you're not just gonna leave all of those trichomes in the bag and weave them behind this is a multi-stage process to get multiple products out of a single strain or cultivar that you're working with so that again you can diversify the amount of products that you're actually selling here same goes for sift you know you might tumble what you've got very very gently to make a really high-quality sift that you're gonna press into your best sift rosin and then you can continue sifting it getting more out of it to create other products yep and that's what I was talking about earlier where then you take that stuff that you're not going to end up hitting the market with that is a what I call it a bubble concentrate and you're basically putting in top of clothes you're putting in edibles you're putting in it or distilling it you know doing all sorts of other post-processing to create it into a final violent consumable product yep so with yield and solve unless it really comes more down to the types of plants that you're running and the types of strains that you're using so with other types of extraction salt Neum solvent based extractions one of the key questions we get asked all the time you know what what really is the difference between a solvent and a solvent list extraction process look I'll take them real quick wait huh he makes more so you got to look at a solvent process so at the solvent process we're liquefying ANCA trichome heads and so since we're liquefying were looking liquefying them and then reclaiming that gas and leaving the THC and then purging it purging that gas off later in the post-processing and so with solvent list what we're doing is we're basically stripping it with either ice water you know co2 dry ice or just tumbling it in itself and or just pressing it in itself so we're got to be a little bit more delicate with it as well and you know with saw the list you're stripping it you're basically keeping it as a whole plant so hold about I'm sure you're all familiar you have different micron screens well at each different micron screen you're gonna have a different grade and those different grades are gonna create a different final product for you and what it will allow you to do is stretch that solvent less material that much further to create that anymore skews to make yourself as business that much more viable ultimately what we are trying to do is solve unless is isolate the resin glands intact and then create various products from those isolated trichomes whereas with solvent based it's a dissolution process graphically exactly see they're stripping at your liquefying it and you're also taking a bunch of fats and lipids with it where we're actually able to keep it more here throughout that process and as we get rougher with that process we're able to you know get that higher yield for topicals edibles also different products yep so sourcing proper material whether you're growing it or purchasing it through your business is one of if not the most important steps to be successful assault unless and I'm sure as people in here who have created solvent list but no you know we talk to our customers and you know sometimes they run tangey their cost program to produce it is there they are losing money on that gram whereas with other ones they're making a lot more you know if you're watching math or you have some of these other strains your price for gram to wash and create that product there's a giant range there so being able to actually get material that's going to work for saltless is one of the most important steps here and when you're vertically integrated that gives you a lot of control because if your head grower is on board and actually looking for genetics that they know will do well and their strain hunting then that's really gonna help you yeah the lineage in the genetics I mean we'll get into a few strains and crosses and stuff like that we have a list out of you know just some you know things to look out for you know as you're going out buying seeds as you're going out and you know buy clones from these different businesses making sure that the lineage is there so that those trichomes structures which we have a slide here coming up that will shows Tricon structures and how full those trichome heads are and if they're just shelves because when you look at a track go ahead and if it's gonna be full you're gonna end up you know having a much higher yield than the salt and ice extraction process compared to if it's a shell you just wash that away when we're that's where you're gonna have a half percent or 1 percent and that's gonna be more on your high higher Terpening of like tangi those type of flavors you want more 10 type of flavor and cross its case but yeah get into that a little bit yeah so what we like to tell people is that if you're growing your own it's really important to identify strains that are gonna work well like we're just about to go into a whole bunch of crosses and strains that you can start hunting for yourself or if you're purchasing from the third party you really need to make sure that they are aware that either this product has been washed in the past or the strain you want to ask them you know can I get a little bit to do a test wash does the is the grower aware that this may work well or not for solvent list in the first place there's a lot of questions that you can ask before you go all-in on a batch that you're gonna produce and turning into Roslyn yeah that your grows and you bet your sourcing material that is probably the best advice I can give each and every one of you you know I test washes you know buy three pounds of each strain that they're growing in XY and Z and you know see how they do in each different type of salt in this process and then that gives you data and then it also gives you partners you know they're able to rely on you you're able to rely on them and you have this nice symbiotic relationship where you they are learning how you want it to be come to your facility how you want impact how many increments all of those things are going to lead you to very very successful business so just a slide here on the different try some of the different trichome structures and what they look like across the top even though it's a little hard to read you know that's so small it's a spike 20 it's gonna go pretty much straight through your bag and there's a lot of hemp strains actually that those are the types of trichomes kind of a top across the top row there that you're gonna see that are common in certain CBD strains which is why they can be really hard to wash whereas with you know d here in the bottom left corner that is pretty much your ideal trichome structure for pressing the rosin washing or sifting because it's large enough to be captured well and it's got a large glandular head yeah and it's full you know you're gonna see a lot of trichome heads you might be able to see those track dome heads underneath the microscope but it might be empty and even if you see that track on that that's how people otherwise you're not going to end up having a successful yield of on your salt less material yep so with many of our most successful customers how they've gotten that way is by being relentless and detail-oriented about how they select the material and strange that they choose to run through solvent list so that they can increase their yields and increase their chance of success you know getting a jeweler's loupe looking at the plant seeing where the trichomes are how big that are what kinds they are you know it's that attention to detail that will make the biggest difference in selecting genetics that you can really be profitable on really build your brand on and get connoisseurs and influencers you know behind your brand online for your solvents products here are some strains take a picture happy to send this out I mean this will be on shaping fires podcast and yeah we're doing it on our website on our website is not secret information but these are some of the strands that we see with many of our customers and some of the biggest hash makers online that the cultivars and the lineages associated with many of these are so popular and they yield so well that they deserve special attention and you know kind of like we have a node at the bottom here I mean there's so many great breeders that come to this show and sell their stuff a lot of breeders are now really really trying to make strains specifically for rosin and solvent lists Josh has had some pretty incredible results with a couple of these at his own lab Eric Simpson who's with us in the audience told us that he had a record-breaking wash of nine percent on a related strain so you know the money sitting right over there so these are some really great strains to start with now a caveat here is that just because you pop a chem dog scene does not guarantee that that streams is you know gonna yield five six percent in your wash but that's not what that means but that these are generally lineages and cultivars that have proper tricone structure and that have the best shot at being able to give you a bud structure a tri comb structure and the turkey profile that's going to play nice with salt and stretch exactly and this is the thing you also have to think about if you're fully integrated you're going to be growing these are the genetics and stuff that you're going to want to be sourcing and buying because that also not only is going to give you a versatile product but it's going to give the mipzor whatever boy labs say you have an influx of material you're able to sell that as salt on this material and hydrocarbon material it doesn't limit you one route or the other now you're probably getting 25 50 bucks more per pound you know just because you got a versatile product and also you're gonna end up with clients and you know you're gonna end up with crosses and you know I can arkad you that we did together you know we talked about artisan blends where you end up having to compete grew it completely sucker and then you mix it up into the washing process to make you know a very interesting terpene profile like the pumps trunk that we put out at you know there's some essential extract is to do that very well - yeah and they were around here so yep it's keys to being successful you know what as your sourcing material purchasing seeds and you know definitely keep that money yep so again keeping an eye on the genetics you know many hash makers and growers are really proud of the products that they put out as they should be and they are not shy about what kinds of strains are working well for them so highly suggest going out you know following hash makers on Instagram that are making solvent less being successful with it they're always talking about the new strains that they're running they're not going to give you a cut of it I can pretty much guarantee that but you should have any opponent sure yeah or find a client's daughter who has a similar one you know cookies-and-cream is a huge one the cream crosses ice cream just on this list along GMO mac the cake and the chem dog crosses and lineages are by far my favorite on this list and we'll do you really really well you know hit that nano a at nine percent there's a lot of good options here we've been told that roughly a quarter to a third of phenotypes and strains out there are gonna be in that profitable yield range for what you're good so it's not every single one but there's more of them than people expected absolutely so here's a really really big one you know once we've kind of gone through the idea of what kind of SKUs you're thinking about making and whether you're an MSO a multi-state operator looking to install the same lab in multiple states or you're a boutique grower who is just building your brand around a core line of solvent list products really thinking about your lab space is one of the best things that you can do for yourself early on in the process I mean it can be very exciting - yeah man we're gonna Rob the press we're gonna get in there push this [ __ ] awesome you can make a solvent list lab be very successful in under a thousand square feet and we see people and they are making their rising in a closet and they are winning awards with it so square footage is one of the smallest concerns but planning against it is one of the most important things you can do so streamlining your floor spent floor space and you know really making sure that it's optimized for what you guys are really doing at your lab is important so figuring out the SKUs not only that you want to produce in the future but that you're going to be really see when you go to market or the excuse that you have in the market all of those things have to be factored into place before you say I'm gonna go put that route and press on that table and this at the freeze dryer up here and the wash machine over there you know because that includes plumbing that include you know there's a lot of little things that will make your life a lot easier if you put things in the right spot yeah and for anyone who is considering getting into this or already is and is looking to upgrade like we're talking about the very beginning if you have questions about you know how many free strawberries do I really need or how much space do I need to plan against that's something that we can actually help you guys out with and those are some of the most popular questions that we get asked on a daily basis is you know I've got X amount of material and I'm trying to wash it week you know what do I really need how do I really lay out my space how do I lay out my lab design and and we've become you know pretty much the top dogs in helping lab build and grow out with that so happy to help there anything else you want to add on this all right so we're gonna leave you know good 10 to 15 minutes here for QA since the last time when we do presentations that went way over that they kick us off the stage so we've got some predictions here that we're expecting for 2020 and beyond just based on the trends and speaking with our customers browsing cartridges are coming in hot people are really excited about this product it's not available in that many markets yet but now businesses are really starting to see that if I master my solvent list process a cartridge is a product that is the luxury cart that is it is the top-of-the-line product that your business can sell pretty much that's going to appeal to the widest range of consumers so that's gonna be huge you wanna have something that and I think it's gonna be one of the bigger things that we're gonna see in 2020 you know and it will take you know some time you know to get your business there to be launching you know all sorts of carts all sorts of you know hash rods and you know it is a learning process and sourcing the right material to be coming out with these exotic SKUs yep so there's a lot of businesses coming out in Colorado with it and really the progression is you know mastering the hash rods and mastering the SIP rosin and then doing the Rd to create a product like this and I mean it's crazy we're talking 70 to 90 dollars for a half gram of these type of cartridges so very high price points and then niche solvent list products like we were talking about before CV rosin topicals edibles especially a major new opportunity there's just not a lot of businesses out there that are promoting that and that are using those products and the solvent list as a differentiator to do so but now that but now people are really picking up on that as competition is increasing people are looking for different ways to differentiate themselves in the market these are going to be products you're gonna start seeing a lot more of and then many more labs that are not doing solvents processing are starting to realize how much they're missing out on by not competing in the first place so we're getting a lot of calls and a lot of people are coming to us saying you know hey I've been thinking about this for a long time or you know I'm just not really sure if this is gonna work for me but all of my guys in the lab like will not show up about they will not stop asking me when but when we're gonna start releasing rosin so we're seeing a lot of these businesses really starting to come out of the Woodworks and realizing that you know this is an area to compete in there's a lot there I mean you don't need you know a thousand square feet you can do it start with 500 you know or and then move up to a thousand square feet or you know if you have extra allocated space I mean the cost to get in to solve unless extraction or add into your business and add all of those SKUs I mean I can guarantee you six months down the road if you did you know half of what we said on here you're gonna an extra three to six skews or at least and all those hundred of sub stores that you're already in are going to start to pick those up and then those invoices just paint keep going up but no enough so the last thing we'll close with here before we go into the Q&A is you know from my perspective and from speaking with many of our customers it's hard to understate how big of a brand builder solvent list can be and in a really really flooded market with cannabis products having your brand be something that people recognize on the Shelf whether it's through your packaging you know really through the quality of your product that these are the kinds of products that people are really talking about and especially the influencers I mean I just cannot understate that enough and that's how some of these big brands like push masters you know having come out won an award that if people talk about it on Instagram all time like that is free advertising for your business and and the value cannot be understated exactly go let's get some questions so that's it Cheryl Mike with Joshua sure so we've got about 10 minutes for questions go ahead and raise your hand and we'll get right to it we came in late you may have artists talked about the equipment that you're using and if so I apologize but you did mention the freeze-dried line yes peer pressure equipment you know we have everything from you know solvent lifts equipment to freeze dryers to sift equipment you know we're basically a one-stop shop for you know all saltless products that you would need and we try and source everything you know that is going to end up coming with certs for doing all sorts of different you know and help you build your business and it's also about when kind of touched on this earlier about industry specific equipment we built designed all this equipment from the ground up and made it functional from the ground up to make sure that this saltless is viable because five years ago you know it really wasn't no I mean one thing talked about because you couldn't do it on the commercial scale well now you can and now it's you know really one of the highest quality highest price point things I'm shelves fed and after this if you like you know with our booth at 411 if you want to come by we'd be happy to talk with you about just the different options and what kind of equipment you need and it's really all based on what your processing needs are and so it every business is gonna need a different solution and that's really the approach that we take I know you showed kind of the percentages that you're coming out but just straight away unlike an average kind of run that you're kind of seeing from fresh frozen to year green a cash frozen one and a half percent two percent what do you really think that the average market is and I know there's monsters that dump I know that's X gifts so to rosin I mean you're looking at around 3% to rather than on your average you know frozen and you know you'll have those dumpers that are going to offset you and you know create it because yes there is loss in each post processing that you do which will then determine your yield at your finished product but then through that it's though also those byproducts that we were talking about earlier from that post-processing that you're able to extend and save and create that many more SKUs that now you it wasn't a loss you see what I mean know the highest quality is really going into the carts and that's a you know partly the tricky part and why you don't see as much of them on the market yeah for states that have just gone medical or states like Illinois or Missouri have you seen any problem with production of fresh fresh frozen and like the supply of fresh frozen not being adequate yeah I think the supply is an issue in some newer states because as markets mature is what we've seen pretty much consistently across the board is that you know smokeable flour is the dominant product when a market launches because people have not had access to this it before other than buying it on the street or from friends or whatever it is so getting fresh frozen product can be a challenge for some businesses in emerging markets but I think some of these markets are starting to leapfrog each other whereas a couple years ago you could barely buy it in some of the emerging markets but then now in Illinois you know things are getting more sophisticated and that people who are coming to shows like these going to the trade shows and learning things are thinking like okay well smokeable flour is going to be big today but in five months from now I know that I need to get a great source of fresh frozen so I can be washing and making these kinds of products as that trend goes down and as that price point goes down as well like we were talking earlier you know in that market more people will convert because there won't be as much of a demand for dry flour they'll convert it to fresh frozen and then you'll see an increase in fresh frozen and you know it's kind of like Colorado now where you know you can get fresh frozen all the time where you can get dry material all the time and it's just about the way the market sits and the how all of these grows set up their business for you know whether it was that frozen model or that drug to your model and you'll see a lot of these dry material models start to change and start to go to fresh frozen as that price point drops have you seen anybody take the wash material and then process it with solvents after so you know you know drive material and then you know throw a co2 machine or hydrogen and if so what's the best way to get that material correct to run of those pieces absolutely and I mean if you have a giant facility I mean it's totally doable but once you actually factor in the profitability on the material what you've made on it and you if you utilized at all you know it's not necessarily worth it the labor that it's gonna take to be able to read extract it dry it you know you're gonna have a lot of moisture and if you don't read right after you just washed it and then you have price to melt you know there's there's definitely problems with it today you know couldn't be down the lines and machines that you know will do that but you'd be having around a 2% 3% yield I mean you look at solvent extraction when you read you know don't you know solvent over it after you've just extracted it again you're looking at a 3% yield or less out the door and then you know it's basically waste material at that point we have heard of some people taking that approach but like Josh said it's very uncommon because once you actually total up the labor it ends up really digging into what you can do with it what most places are doing is doing they're getting multiple washes on the same material to start you know with that 3% which really dry weight is like 12% to getting that a grade hash product and then washing again into more full-spectrum into more of a food grade and just getting everything out of it so that your actual yield on your first grade you know it might be that 3% but the total yield for you know these more sophisticated extractors it's going to be a lot higher than that or at least a bit higher than that by re extracting it but through solvents ways yeah yeah all right this will be our last question is there any like tricks that you do in your grow to tell what's gonna wash better any like ways of you know kind of something super greasy is it gonna wash well it's it's not gonna wash well or what's like kind of tips or tricks again see if I'm at ya so I'll start up to present really get input on this again one of the tips that I talked about in the beginning that we've heard from a lot of places I'm Church oft as well you know using magnifying glasses and other magnification technology to look at the trichomes beforehand and you can even you know brush your finger on something and see how well they attach because detach ability of your trichome heads is a really important thing to figure out what a lot of places do is also a very small test wash so you could even I mean the people that have done this I think can wall was one who put some info out that most recently was just you know putting some in a jar and letting some of the trichomes just naturally separate and then seeing how they settle and really eyeballing it and seeing you know how much is in my jar right now does this look like a lot does this look like a little you know if you're doing a test wash there's a lot of things that you can figure out before you're committing you know tens of thousands of fresh frozen grams to actually doing it yeah and I mean it's basically test watching all of your genetics and looking at those trichome heads are keys but you know starting with genetics that you can know our fee knows that are going to wash well and you know you're gonna have maybe 14 seeds and of that genetic that you washed and you can watch those trichome head structures you can watch all those fee notes and then you can decide okay this one has a dumper the structure looked really good you know it's healthy that's the those are the three that I want to go into my grow moving forward that's gonna be the keys to dialing in your girl definitely trial and error right oh that is all of our time thank you very much thank you [Applause] you", "kX_Q94myqoQ": "what is up YouTube fabric boy baskets you're gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys and then a Saturday morning today it's time to wake and bake so I really hope you guys are really having a good day hopefully you guys staying blessed the world's kind of [ __ ] up right now but it'll it'll be over soon guys so everything will be back to normal so I really hope you guys are doing good and yeah guys last week got posted like two videos I usually post like on a Friday or Saturday so you know my bad had kind of been a little busy you know with all this [ __ ] going on but today actually last week I have picked up this moxie these are actually new you know I've never seen them before I had gotten one before it was super super fire you know they taste like an Ursa cartridge like actual actual like resident and I had a like a question you know if you guys ever know like don't you guys think like why is raw Gardens live resin so lighter than other live resins like like this one right here for example this was like a dark amber color compared to this one like I'll show you guys right now like live resin for the raw gardens are really really like you know which there's a lot there's some people I'm a comment section that say like regarding this fake like fake life resin so I don't know I just want to get your guy's opinion on that and that's a couple people already telling me you know but we're going to take a hit others before we get in the cartridge just waking big guys Cheers but I want to appreciate my new subscribers and those who are new here you guys are awesome for watching my videos you know I really appreciate you guys but let's get into this Moxie cartridge these are called MX brand but I had gone in there um on their Instagram page and it says they have to do something with Moxie so I'm guessing it is Moxie cuz it's like the same letterings everything this one's a yellow og this one's of life as full spectrum life resin so THC on this is 80% so it's a pretty good cartridge for some live resin there's some licenses that don't really get that high THC you know but this one's around 80 so it's pretty good cartridge I paid like maybe like 40 bucks for this so it wasn't too bad you know so we're just gonna go ahead and pop it open guys I had had one before it was like the it was like watermelon OG it was really really good you know it had tasted like an actual dab you know it tasted like really weed and it is like no discipline and intake and I like a really really different flavor than like what a raw garden would have like that clean like rock gardens to me that kind of tastes all the same you know they have all that fresh clean taste to it which is I don't know it's pretty good I'm getting wrong but they all kind of do taste the same here you have a cartridge it's a seesaw I really love these seesaw cartridges right here you know they're like the dank dank vapes how the tips are I really really love these tips now this is what I mean you know raw Gardens this one's life resin and this is my resident as well so and this one's a Moxie and this was a raw garden as you guys can see this one's way lighter than this one this one's the darker amber color so a lot of people been saying raw Gardens fake live resin so let me know what you guys think about that and that's just coming from couple people not just one you know so let me know what you guys think about that oh I thought about it as well like it is kind of lighter than what this one is and on this is real dead live resin so guys let me know on that so this one's it's really really thick yellow oh jesus was the indica hybrid I'm guessing so I'm good and dry hedges let me see what it tastes like you know flavors off it so the best way to try to just to [ __ ] hit it so we're not going to take this off I didn't do a cartridge you'd be on this raw garden I was just too lazy and I got a like on a Wednesday or something Wednesday night so I just started puffing the [ __ ] out of it so we're gonna gonna screw this on the cartridge battery hopefully I was smoking well wouldn't you guys plot you guys vape pens whatever you guys got to get [ __ ] high mass waking day just around 7:00 in the morning before I hit this let me get up Oh Red Bull sponsors we may get sugar-free Red Bull but besides that guys oh hopefully got a smoke along with me work on ahead and try this [ __ ] this one's the yellow og moxie I guess MX brand whatever you want to call it so cheers guys oh wow right off the bat if you guys ever had a if you guys ever had a Ursa cartridge these cartridges taste exactly exactly like them they taste exactly like weed you don't get like that raw garden like taste to it you know it tastes actually like dad and that's one of the things that I was wondering like why does this taste more like dab you know and like the raw gardens taste like a little chemically you know I don't get me wrong they're pretty good but I don't know that's kind of weird to me but these cartons are pretty far guys are like 40 bucks for some actual life resin I said these taste like an oyster cartridge the taste on it it's like a strong dad taste you know really really good you definitely get that OG taste like a strong cushy taste at the end but it's mostly like a clean fresh oh gee tation well it tastes really really good like when I tried these cartridges like last week it was a watermelon og cross was something and I was really amazed by the turf shamash it was crazy I little smoked the coke cartridge like in two three days you go back-to-back that's how good it was but this one it tastes kind of the same but it's just had like a more strong cush taste to it now I'm feeling like a little good high right now I know like a really good buzz you know there's my waking bag I'm gonna take a bigger hit to see if you know I [ __ ] get a big cloud for you guys I hope you guys are smoking along with me and I'm also having a vaporizer I'm going to give away I don't know if you guys had seen my review I had done on these belief goes if you guys want to go ahead and check out my video I did on these but I would appreciate it and I'm also gonna do a giveaway because they gave me two of them so I'm not gonna use the other one so I'm gonna give it away I will personally share to you guys his doorstep I'm sending out to UPS wherever you guys are at so you guys let me know and guys she got something loaded already I'm glad and hit it again she'd like to take a blinker man [ __ ] it never tried to blink on these [ __ ] arm pen cards which is only like on Stevie or like a plug-and-play but we're going to try it blink on this [ __ ] I'm already loaded this card you just smacked guys if you guys ever see these MX brands Moxie cartridges like presents they're pretty fired they have a lot of flavors as well you know just as you guys can see they say Moxie on there so they say MX like I don't know it's it's weird but yeah that's just like a MX for like a little short you know we're

blessed day and these guys", "qxESYtdlXCM": "[Music] hey beautiful people it's dr bacon and i got a note to check my p.o box this will be my third third item very exciting got something something in the mail what a way to start the day i'm pretty excited about this let's see what i got that i got to give baby jade and wonder egg nope one more wow this is very nice darling dog i'll be down i got a bunch of seeds well thank you very very much that is like beyond kind i think i can share this so i'm gonna share it uh so here's our straight information this looks interesting i'm definitely gonna have to do some seeds soon a little garden report and still have some tomatoes kind of late in the season um checked out the ladies just now in the barbie house and i wanted to just take you guys along and show you so i'm gonna spend a few minutes up here just looking for hermes take some leaves off spend some more time down here than anything and like there's a decaying leaf i'm gonna see what that's all about and make sure there's no surprises in here so just be patient and pick around a little bit this lady that was previously identified is definitely a jack-o'-lemon the purple is the giveaway so that's that's good news this will be a treat always is okay so i seem to have a lot of people telling me i harvested my ak-47 early and i get this every time i grow one of these long skinny butted plants so i got my loop and i'm gonna take a look at this for you guys all right so here's our mo get a couple i just plucked this from the this is a motorola turbo 2 just a regular phone there's nothing special about my phone you put it on here to you uh so you can center the vignette and then you zoom till the vignette disappears and then you use a loop like use a loop you just bring it in and it should focus on time so here we are with checking out our troy combs and nice nice opaque i really appreciate it trichomes zero clear and an occasional amber could they have gone a little longer they could have this is my source for my willow water and they absolutely never seen them cut these things back so hard but they're not cutting them down half of these are ready for water and half are uh need another day for sure maybe two uh so pretty much the jack glues which are the super green ones are not ready last time i watered them all to keep them in sequence but these are still very very much not ready for water so rather than just continuing to over water these i'm just going to set these three plants off to the side and just water the rest which do need water i have two of these i started in water only as an experiment i'm gonna let those go an extra day as well and keep those on the same cycle as as these that's looking good circle august so this is 8k from the end of august very poorly trimmed but this is as big as it got in the sunshine we have bigger ones in there let's find a bigger one you're going to film this press are we gonna just yeah okay are you ready uh 210 210 i think we're ready [Music] okay my eyes really shrinking down nicely don't come out the side that's all i want from you okay so i can tell this is going to press pretty easily so i'm actually going to up the pressure a little slightly a quarter turn the time or eighth of a turn at a time there we go nice balls down you know you do it right when everything falls off the shelves this is 10 seconds into the press nice looking good there it is good grief that looks good that looks way better than the last one it is there a second attempt oh yeah that's no that was not an attempt that was due okay this is our second execution [Music] nice that's uh round two oh yeah oh somewhere yeah there not quite big enough for those bags i feel like the bags are ideal on larger press it's funny that ironically the ones where you really struggle to get the right pressure come out the best because that means you're actually getting it right at the limit i think how quickly it came out just now flying out of there you can you can see there's a lot on there but that bag is just gonna sit here and get all the good stuff there let's swallow this right now oh it's pretty substantial right there very nice it's been a good dab very nice there's such a pain to get them out of here too i think our work is done here yeah that will serve for our chair hey i'm back i never did find a drummer so uh we're gonna get on that so i can pull my ticket in style for our raffle um so we made some really good uh a rosin with our jack glue and that was really interesting my jack blue plants are dry now we just went through daylight savings my lights go out in an hour so i'm gonna water these when the lights come back on tonight and i never really save mixed nutrients but i did yesterday so i'm gonna do that i'm gonna think i have enough left to do yeah i definitely have enough left for three cups so i'm gonna do that i'm gonna put sand right now and uh i gotta go find me a pretty girl and a drummer and pull this ticket for the gobi hey guys i hope you have the best day and thanks for everything those seeds were awesome thank you ty uh ty browser that's just beyond

up the tents would they never thought we had the cream cushions yo people what is good um so for a while i have been saying on the channel i've been wanting to get into hash rosins and that um so i'll just grab this and this is some uk hash frozen by subzero extracts i've seen a lot of good things from subsidiary extracts a lot of this stuff looks absolutely unreal so i wanted to jump on this we've got a nice little 3.5 grand park like i said i've been wanting to jump on hash rosins this year i'm going to try and get a lot more into my dabs loads of uk dabs loads of like caddy dabs definitely got on all the hash rosins and that so hopefully if you're into your dabs definitely definitely subscribe to the channel we should have more stuff coming like this um but this is from odv free or orange diesel v3 hash rosin like i said by sub-zero extracts but yeah we'll get this open see exactly what we're playing with okay people so there we go that is the odv free hash rosin by sub-zero extracts looking absolutely fire oh mate i'm excited for this one i've got to admit super super excited for this one looking nice and wet moist and terpy oh mate for those who don't like to say orange the odv free or orange diesel v3 is a crust of orange diesel cross orange diesel it was bred by lady sativa genetics who are of course from the uk uh also responsible for your marmalade and yeah this was a pressed by uh sub-zero extracts and i've got to say it looks like they have done an unreal job it's our first time smoking hash rosin obviously we've gone with the uk and that looks [ __ ] unreal it's a nice sort of like batter consistency and i'm not gonna i'm not gonna frontier i don't know loads about like you know dab some stuff i've said this before on the channel there's people out there that knew far more about all these dabs and stuff than me you know i just sort of see stuff i think you know that looks nice and i've been told for a while i need to get on the hash rosin so here we go i am going to try and do a melt shot of this uh if i can remember to you know you might as well get into that and obviously i'll do a little sort of maybe another video just chatting about you know what i'm actually thinking to it but my god it's looking good just on initial inspections that is looking absolutely fire damn wow smells [ __ ] good as well uh it's not like that but i've had other pots of dabs as soon as i've opened the pot of dumb i've been slapped in the face with with like uh with turps but this one is it's not like that but the closer i get to it the more i start picking it up and it's got this real real nice orange spot to it like a real real nice i mean i don't know how to describe it about just calling it what it is it just smells like an orange diesel it's like an orange like gas super gassy super orangey once i get up to it's leaking turks out there really really nice orange trips coming out of there but like i say it didn't hit me in the face as soon as i opened the park but as i get closer it's my unreal down let's get the flash on to see how that looks as well i'll get a little a knife or something i'll have a little play with a consistency you just see what that's saying once that you also just wet the flesh on as well just so if you can see that you can see how moist is how it's sort of glistening real real nice color yeah damn that's looking good i just had a little play a bit just for the consistency hopefully you can see that a little bit better looking absolutely unreal i need like something to properly hold my camera on so you can see me playing with it properly but i'll try and figure that out but for the moment as you can see free hash browsing uk hashtags in by subzero extracts it's just [ __ ] there and uh damn i'm excited to try this out looks absolutely unreal wow we'll try and get a melt shot we'll see what this is saying so people i just wanted to just quickly show you this and i didn't do it very well the other day so i wanted to just sort of get out in the light and show you a bit more uh this is just the consistency of this hash rosin as you can see it's sort of sort of wet and terribly it's been in the fridge it's got a little bit of wetness to it but you see that sort of sponges back bounce back sort of pulls away like that look really really nice consistency nice and sort of waxy almost like i say it does have a wetness to it though as well i don't think that'll quite pull up quite nice on the camera certainly more clips coming out and playing with it put down death or death for a nice consistency and what we'll probably try and do as well is like i said we'll get a melt shot and then we'll also probably try and do a doughnut so yeah this as well but i've been loving this hash rosin absolutely loving it just want to show you that just see hopefully you can see the consistency a little bit better because it's that nice sort of batter quite wet but not not over the top wet really really nice your people my lighting's uh really poor so i've got the sort of flashback on again i just want to sort of bring this uh video sort of to a close really obviously i've been dabbing on this odb3 and my sub-zero extracts really really enjoying it like i said starter videos first time probably trying hash frozen and stuff and i've definitely definitely been enjoying it and it's got this real real nice sort of orange sort of flavor to it but it's not over the top on the oranges while it's not sort of an orange flavor it's also a lot of that easily gassy game in the background that together honestly it's a really real real nice smoke i've been enjoying it certainly my boy i've just making some of this with it's also been enjoying it um and yeah i just wanted to sort of come on and just sort of say big ups and zero extracts really night i've got to say i've been loving this but it has really really been nice you know as good as i thought it was going to be if not better and just to you know sort of say and it is been sort of a quick video and i also sort of flopped the milk shot uh but obviously i will try and get better at all this [ __ ] you know the middle shot tried to record like three different times and that was the best one i wanted to record it and obviously i had to get someone to film it so i will get all this figured out i'll get a way to sort of film milkshakes myself and that but i just wanted to give you something just to show how nice this thing has been melting super super nice really nice consistency lovely turds coming out of it like i say i've really enjoyed it we're going to have more hash rosen on the channel i don't know if i'll stick to these formats of you know how i've been doing it or if i'll do it a different way or what but we are going to show you more dabs on the channel this year it's definitely something i'm going to get a lot more into so if that's what you know you're here for and you enjoy definitely definitely sort of like the video and subscribe and let me know that you're enjoying it we'll have another hashtag vid real real soon probably in like you know a week or so and i've got another pot on its way um but yeah sub-zero extracts odv free real real nice super nice consistency and yeah i've been absolutely loving this absolutely loving it like i said without more hashtags and videos and more extra videos coming for you real soon just thought i'd give you that last little zoom in as well looking super super nice and yeah big up everyone we're back with more content for you real soon", "NP5px4BB3BM": "what's up you guys let's go ahead and show you guys how to make some dry ice hash I thought countless requests to see how this process isn't done and realistically it's one of the most simplified extraction processes you can come across and cost next to nothing let me show you the process to the parts a requirement for this process sorry about that real simple you need some kind of screen a bubble bag you can use pantyhose cheesecloth anything to pretty much separate the more bulky plant material from the final resins that we're looking for so kind of bucket I'm just using what's supposed to be like a utility can use a five-gallon bucket or whatever it is anything give me some dry ice you need dry ice to make dry ice ash we can go to Windows final if you can find pellets use pellets but if you need to you can get the block to smash it up here I need some herb we're just gonna start with something real simple here I like two ounces of mixer from Tar Heel cannabis all the real fine shake and the really keep covered stuff you can see how much Keef is there in the base that's all gonna come back in our product so well we've got to have some kind of bowl on the side to you this is a put your bubble bags or your screening device or anything in here so it's not on the ground we'll see dirt so let's get to business here we're gonna start with a nice seventy-three micron this is the golden layer on the typical bubble bags and this is gonna be your finest glands and it's gonna be all the fight the fact trichrome heads as well as the more like turf ridden that a parts of the plant you see it's gonna be the most flavorful and the most abundant in the resin so I'm going with that for my first process here go sample dump the lead in I know that was a complicated part so go ahead and do that got the weed air in the base listen it go as far as you really don't want any piece it's you know bigger than a baseball baseball or bigger it's just you want to kind of avoid getting too much powder so if you can find any other method using a mallet rubber mallet or something to get finger breaks I do recommend clutter I'm kind of just chilling in a friend garage and we're just you know kind of free ball in the air now we're just gonna put this right up on top of that weed every last bit of it all right good glance nice quad machine this is exactly what's going on when you see fog machines it shows you guys just then releasing this co2 that's a compiled together makes this really cool effect now next step we're gonna tie this up real nice and take this bowl coincidentally perfect size to work as a cover we're gonna cover this up I do recommend before time taking your your product whether it's fresh or it's already dried out product and freezing it for at least 24 hours what this does is that helps make the trichrome heads more brittle where they separate and you get a higher yields in return you have to do less agitation to get that return so we're going to let this hit 10 15 minutes smoke a nice fat bowl and it will come back to show you the sifting process mmm-hmm pretty simple dude got the Biagio out got some more of that gargoyle melon berry oh the prime limited Garbo melon berry you guys we got some nice [ __ ] wheat point for you here this [ __ ] is off the hook you just wait till you get to explore through the freakin countless caves wonder there's just trichomes and diamonds everywhere man it's it's like when you perfect the ability to use an eagle at ten times gems in but then not having to perfect that weird kind of concentration with your with your Isaac you don't have to do that now we got it for you mishit it was never tested because it happened it's not enough of an abundance yet to have been tested but I saw the surrounding strains that were tested at thirty-one percent THC which was one of the Tahoe San Fernando Valley crosses and this looked like that one frickin diamond in the rough we're just going to cross that off everything so dang convinced that go holy [ __ ] what is what is this and you kind of move the planet it's like oh my it smells like frickin crunch berries like what is this stream man just like chronic crunch berries and then I see the name and just like gargoyle melon berry you serious I ready I'm [ __ ] nice and rip that [ __ ] is killer is completely complex anyways this sat a little bit of extra time but no harm no foul all I did was to make sure every last bit of it was nice and close so I insist on if you're using the bags I like to wrap my hand up so it's not sitting there dragging a nice powderized key all right and then I go to the base to try to use gloves this [ __ ] is cold you will freeze your hands and it will hurt so kind of mix it up gently don't get too abrasive with it and when you're sipping it's gonna be real gentle see the movements get married just like if I was milking of so people have to get that reference how do you milk the cat and what I'm really aiming for is making sure I get optimal amounts from this layer of filtration but I'm not overdoing it to the extent that I start getting a lower grade quality patch so I try to do like 1520 seconds and I'll kind of shake it around and then I will take that out and then I do that process you know a few different times that way I'm ensuring serious every time it's gonna make sure that I'm only getting the fat trichrome heads that's super important you guys all right we'll call good and please do not sit there and you know handle the bag like that like trying to shake it out because that will actually expand the micron filter that little screen that we're relying on for the most optimal results of quality you're gonna expand them and it's going to get more plant debris through no bueno all right this is for probably like three more runs and I put that in the bowl and show you it's like we don't have much material so let me go ahead and scrape this together and from the looks of the amount we are kind of really fan tool with it but it's more important to to get those financed resin glands all right on doing is taking that down to the bottom see if we can get a good lighting here you can kind of see the collection of that nice real light color it's like so light color that it's almost hard to see it and that's that's kind of why we'd want to only do little intervals where we make sure we keep discoloration and don't go a little bit further and get it to where it's kind of getting a green color we want that stuff to be blond all right let's go ahead and toss this on the place so you can get a an understanding of what this actually looks like if we could only do some smellivision you guys show you the Terps on this it's it's nice and powder but what's funny is it's it sticks together very well and it's it's kind of deceiving some people have compared to like moon sand where I think that's the the sand that you would you know see it's kind of sticking to the battery spatula yeah it's kind of separated up so you can see how fine it is no debris up in there nice and light use ooh so this is pretty much what you're gonna do I mean you could use more material can get better returns but oh I'd rather instead of just getting one giant pile you know all the way out to here nice pile from it with the potential of some green I'd rather have a bunch of small miles of it perfectly colored when I see the difference the change in the color mint I can actually back cope with you so I'm gonna go ahead and do this process and I'll come back with you guys to kind of show you what I mean 100 K so I went ahead and did four different runs with the really nice quality one ninety or the one I need the seventy-three micron and that went ahead and did the same amount for different processes of about fifteen twenty second sifts with the hundred and ninety microns so let's go ahead and give you a gander you can see this is one I just did with you guys and each one is like became more of like a light tannish color you know not so much green so we didn't get any green that's good all this is a really good material and this is the one ninety and I went ahead and just put it together it's still really good material you know so it there dude I I'm seeing a little hair in there and I don't like when that happens we have dogs you guys be really meticulous about the location of where you make your ash cuz I can make a difference glass and the other kind of utensils that you're gonna use kind of draw through static electricity and I've got John those real fine hairs and then they become a part of your product and you have to freaking sift it out again anyways yeah this is what I got right here I went ahead and kicked it up to the next level and it's a 220 micron and what this is for is like a real vigorous shift and it's gonna have a lot of plant material very low present content but I'm gonna use it for capsules what I'll do is I'll take a finer quality hash that lower quality i'll decarboxylate which I'll explain more about that later the fine quality hash activate the trichomes in the way that we want and then also have the dietary benefits that come with the young carter decarboxylated form of plant material especially the higher plant material will have a lot of real good benefits for your dietary tracts and everything involved with it so check it out I'm gonna go ahead and get [ __ ] really going on this [ __ ] again even with the 220 I'm gonna wrap that [ __ ] up but this I'm gonna get a little bit harder and you can already hear it starting to become one solid sitting there too long I'm gonna just do this until almost all the planet Eire is gone for this last sip and those are perfect for the dietary supplement capsules so yes you guys this is awesome I'm glad you guys join me hopefully you know how to make a real basic form of hash and keep on following me because I'm just gonna do every method that I can of all the unique forms of extraction methods as well as some new up-to-date ones so yes have a good one it's up welcome to the head of the day I'm Danni cush just got done making some amazing dry ice hash the [ __ ] is just [ __ ] blonde delicious you can see it up in the bowl is just fantastic it's a 73 micron percolate filtered out process of just using the dry ice it's tears but no entered introductions of any solvents we don't introduce any kind of water so it's tough as pure and got so much terpenes I wish I could is you know show you the the smell because it's beyond the look but we got the Bozzio this girl needs a cleaning really badly but she hits like a mother let's go ahead and take a rib like slowly sleeping in there not even a little bit of a cup that stuff is so smooth oh man smooth as could be quality checked this shit's got an A+ I got a pack like four more of those because that [ __ ] was freakin delicious oh man we did a great job thanks for joining on the hit of the day kind of like testing out the product before I put it out you guys have a [ __ ] great one I'm Danny Kirsch Zeus oh yeah", "shDLGiq9Chs": "[Music] hey what's up guys today we're going to smash 7 grams on our fully automatic nug smasher x we're going to show you how to get a little less psi on your material by increasing your surface area we weighed out 7 grams of white fire we normally recommend using nug smasher x bags but today we're gonna use nug smasher 14 gram 120 micron bags we're going to smash this bag with inverted corners bottle text style take the corners of your bag and turn them inside out [Music] grab your everything tool and use it to help push the corners in it is very vital that the corners overlap this is going to give you the cylindrical round bottle textile shape we are looking for since we are using higher quality flour we are going to increase our surface area and reduce our material psi to do that use a 14 gram bag even if you plan on smashing 7 grams this is going to give you 150 to 200 less psi on your actual material equating to a lighter result you might lose a small fraction of your yield but with higher quality flour it will give you a higher quality extract next we're going to cut off the excess bag one unique thing about our bags they are double backstitch which means you can cut and shorten them and not have to worry about them unraveling or blowing out during your smash [Music] next we're going to raise the plates of our fully automatic nug smasher x [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] here's a quick pro tip once you're all situated let the plates come down real slow so that the heat neutralizes with the material so by the time it reaches maximum pressure all the material is the exact same [Music] temperature [Music] now as you see some of the rosin start to come off the plates we're actually losing some material surface pressure because it's extracting off so we'll add a little more pressure to compensate for pressure loss [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] and there it is seven grams of flour one button 22 percent yield from flour to

like butter that looks really good huh let's give this a shot so I only usually dab about a point at a time I find it's the best way to get a flavor off a low temp on a quartz bucket you so really nice light flavor on that like kind of piney oh really almost refreshing and no particles in the bottom of the bucket nice amber leftovers boom first impressions are really positive alright it's been about 15 minutes since I did that dab and I mentioned right off the bat super nice really reflect really refreshing kind of flavor on it almost like a minty or eucalyptus type lemongrass fish flavor really really clean didn't have like the heavy Bobble hashing type flavor that comes with a lot of rosin either and really really nice color on the bottom of the Buckeye no particles or anything

another video if you couldn't tell from the title we are going to be comparing live rosin and live resin first off let's get this out of the way live resin is made with bho which is a solvent and live rosin is made with no solvents then let's get that out of the way but the brands that we have in question here is raw garden and we got classics this being the live resin and this being the live rosin and i made a video on this one already but i did not make a video on this but i woke up today and i was just like i want to make a video so let's just see what i got and see what videos i can make so you know like i said i rarely get live rosin so when i do i try to make the most videos out of it as i can and once again shout out to p2ps for making this possible he gave me some funds to uh purchase some live rosin myself he didn't tell me to purchase live rosin but you know i figured you guys have been asking for me to get live rosin for quite some time now you know i don't get it all too much but when i do it's a it's a special occasion but once again shout out to p2 peeps he finally reached 1k on youtube here's hoping the 10k this year you know what i'm saying so like i said uh i did a video on this classics live rosin already but i didn't do a video on this but i would like to say that this strawberry rose from raw garden is super fire i will be giving you close-up shots and all that stuff but i would i wanted to make this video to explain the differences between live resin and live rosin because it's an only one letter difference and i feel like some people especially people get getting into cannabis or extracts and stuff don't really know what's up also take what i say with a grain of salt because i am not an expert in any way this is just me uh researching stuff from myself but live resin for those of you who don't know is basically the live and live resin means is when you harvest your plants and you flash freeze right when you harvest them instead of allowing the plant to cure over months and all that stuff and basically reduce the moisture in the plants but the initial moisture from when you just harvest the plants is the initial terpenes that you get from that live resin so right after harvesting you know how plants look super sticky when you just harvest them but then when you cure them they kind of like dry out and become less crystallized and all that stuff but when you just harvest them you flash freeze them you get all the live resin terpenes the initial terpenes that are there when you just harvest the plant usually extracted through a closed loop system using bho and all this other stuff but yeah that's generally how you make live resin live rosin on the other hand you would think you know you would just uh you know flash free some rosin or something and make it that way or maybe flash-free some plants and then just squish it but for those of you who don't know rosin is made by heat and pressure you know i've made some rosin on this channel before i use the the juice box which is a handheld rosin and basically you get a little you shape your little nug into like a hockey puck and then you squeeze the [ __ ] out of it with metal plates that are hot and in return you just get oil that squeezes out in between the metal plates and that's what you collect in terms of rosin but that is not live rosin that is flower rosin live rosin is a little bit more complicated that's probably why it costs so much more in terms you know 710 labs costing like 70 to 80 this might i add was like around 45 to 50 so still pretty pretty pricey uh but probably on the lower end of live rosins that you can get on the market uh but live rosin basically have to make ice hash which is you know you put your your your flour into like an ice bath and you shake out all the trichomes and then you filter it with micron bags and then you get like this bubble hash or bubble melt hash and then you smash it with heat and pressure and then that's the end result and the end result is a very terp terpy terp rich [ __ ] end result you know it is usually like whitish to brownish light brownish uh but the end result is very very good top of the line concentration you can get today is it's got to be live rosin so uh i figured i'd make a video comparing the two and yeah you know like i said it's not every day that i have live rosin in my inventory you know so uh i will get some close-ups on it but we're gonna be hitting it out of the smoke ski so let's just open this i do want to show you guys what they look like all right so we got the strawberry rose as you can see percentage right here eighty seven point five five percent tc not bad i will post the crosses post process but pretty much that's what it looks like i mean it's been picked up but definitely one of the the better raw garden strains that i've tried in a while you know don't get me wrong all of them taste pretty fire but this one stuck out very strong strawberry taste just all around good and then we got this one right here so this is the rosin as you can see right here the percentage of thc is not that as much as the live browsing but still very very tasty so let's open that for you guys sorry one hander so that's what it looks like not the greatest looking live rosing honestly it looks like some nasty crumble but i'll tell you right now the taste is there guys holy [ __ ] stevie really enjoyed this on the santa clara vlog those are what we're working with in this video i'm gonna take a hit of both and we're gonna see um i mean i kind of explained the differences between the two already now we're just gonna have to just hit the damn thing you know we're gonna turn on the smoke ski and uh we're just gonna let it rip i definitely used the [ __ ] out of the smoke ski yesterday so hopefully it's still running good it is that blue battery so might i add that this is awakened make as well so i won't go too too crazy but we are going to take some hits to say the least hopefully you guys have been enjoying the content lately i try my best to upload frequently so i appreciate you guys let's start that over again and uh let's take a hit so like i said i did try i tried these already strawberry rose phenomenal raw garden like uh if you're a fan of strawberry and you're a fan of raw garden i don't see why not you're not getting this uh because it's honestly one of them the raw gardens that stuck out to me most recently other guava cookies did too also but this one too so tasty still a little bit more in here i'm gonna finish that um but like i said as far as the taste goes very very refreshing uh very strong strawberry sweetness to it but as you can see it's 87 thc as well so it's definitely high up in terms of potency and the taste is there so i definitely would recommend for all you raw garden fans out there i'm saying this as i wear this sweater but good stuff let's clean that real quick let's take a hit of that all right take a hit of this live rosin about it i would like to mention is that when i put this onto the nail it kind of heats up faster than live res uh it starts bubbling quicker um i don't know if you guys notice that is too maybe it's the thinner in some ways i don't know but it just seems like it bubbles up quicker and it vaporizes quicker like starts bubbling quicker but cheers oh jesus okay there's something about live rosie it just tastes clean it could be just like the placebo of you knowing that it's solventless that you just you just think it's cleaner i don't know but it's for some reason it just tastes cleaner a lot more smoother the hits was faster that's why i cough but i feel like live rosin is but a bit more bearable in terms of uh smoothness or you know harshness so but with this video with the end of this video i will take this last hit and hopefully you did enjoy this video hopefully you learned something between the differences between live resin and live rosin because you know i would i would have loved to see someone make a video on this [ __ ] you know i'm saying i'm sure there's videos out there but there could be more you know so cheers this oh that is going to be the end of the video like i said hopefully you did learn something between the differences between live resin and live rosin you know there's a major difference in terms of price between the two so it's good that you know what makes them so different in terms of that major discrepancy and price you know what i'm saying but other than that hopefully you did enjoy the video peace out [Music] [Music] hey [Music] you", "usMZkmBsciI": "apparently nitro rosin is just the bottom of the barrel when it comes to creating hash rosin today i'm showing off something i've never showed off on my channel before it's called nitro rosin i picked up three different strains of it but i'm going to start off with the dab of the swamp fruit you can tell off the bat it's a little dark sometimes that doesn't really matter with rosin though but we will see got a nice little glab ready to go uh holy [ __ ] god damn i'm sure a lot of you guys right now are like what the [ __ ] is nitro rosin is it hash rosin is it good is it flower ross and like what the [ __ ] is it let me answer all these questions for you and hopefully give you a better idea for what this really is let me start by saying that this company peria has been talking about how that they were going to bring hash rosin into pennsylvania forever now and there's been a lot of hype around it and this is what they brought it is considered hash rosin but it's pressed from dry sift triceps is essentially just keef that's collected in large amounts instead of getting a small amount of weed that would fit in a grinder they get a [ __ ] ton of weed and sift through that however since that weed is fully cured that means this hatch rosette is not live hatch rosin it would be cured hash rosin so what their method is they're using liquid nitrogen on weed to help the sifting process then once they have their dry sift they press that in a rosin press to get the rosin so it is made from a form of hash and it is 100 solvent less but this really is not what i was hoping for it looked super dark when i first got it i mixed it up a little bit and it lightened up the color but really not by much it smells pretty good it tastes alright not outstanding not like any hatch ross and i've had before but there is so much plant matter in this rosin you can see it in the banger after you've dabbed all of those little dark specks or plant matter that can't be vaporized but make sure you get your old banger out when you're diving this because that plant matter is gonna leave a mark i've been using this stuff called bong aid recently it's super simple it's a banger cleaner and all you gotta do is spray a little bit in there get a q-tip use both sides and it really gets majority of that stuff off if you're dabbing something with this much plant matter left in it you're going to need an extra q-tip in there but this bong aid really does the job this banger cleaner as well as a bunch of other glass cleaners are going to be available on my website by the way you guys it's going to be up any day now so make sure you're signed up for the newsletter if you're not already it's going to be the link at the top of this video people that sign up for the newsletter get 24 hours exclusive access to the website before it's up and it is this close you guys all i'm waiting for is a credit card processor to approve it but they said that this wasn't going to be the best rosin in the world so i wasn't expecting any 710 labs or laser cat quality but honestly i was expecting something a little bit better than we got but apparently nitro rosin is just the bottom of the barrel when it comes to creating hatch rosin my biggest complaint about it is you need to dab it at such a low temp on the cloud banger i literally wait two minutes before dabbing it typically i wait like 80 90 seconds so actually i've been using this in the peak a lot because it's super easy to control the temperatures and i don't really care if the bucket looks dirty drop this right in the bucket i'm gonna take the top off take the top off got the peak loaded up ready to go gonna do it on the blue heat setting just because it matches my carb cap in my top and that's the lowest and that's really all we need right now hasn't even vibrated yet it's smoking up a little bit on the blue setting so this [ __ ] really needs to be dabbed at a low heat setting there we go by the way you guys if you press your peak after the second exhale it'll cycle through for a couple more seconds [Music] it honestly is much better out of the peak than out of a break you really can't say that with most concentrates i don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing it still gets me high but not like hatch rosten does live hash raws and just hits different the taste the effects everything's just better about it and yes i will be upgrading to the pro eventually honestly the peak still really does the job for me i love the normal peak and i'm not the person that buys the new ps5 or the new iphone the day it comes out but i definitely will be getting the new peak it does look [ __ ] cool and i'm going to be trying to get it from my website too puffco is pretty weird about how they do wholesaling distribution it's not like you can just be like hey i want 10 puffco pros they only let us store by a certain amount of pros off of the amount of puffco peaks they've sold and my store hasn't even opened that's the time i'm recording this video so i'm a little behind the game on them but using liquid nitrogen to get dry sift and then pressing that is a much cheaper and easier way to make hatch rosin versus the typical ways of doing it so this is a good way to keep the prices down but it really also keeps the quality down i was not expecting this low quality of a product compared to hatch rosin yes it is a hatch rosin but like for me this was not exactly what i want but i must say this is the cheapest rosin mpa ever so if you are just looking for a cheap solvent-less product this is the product for you however i just don't feel like i should be dabbing a solvent-less product wishing you as bho typically when i get hatch rosin it's live rosin and that is just by far the best way to experience cannabis in my opinion and i know this is hatch rosin but i'd honestly consider it closer to flower rosin than hatcherizing with the way that it smokes you're always bound to get a little bit of plant matter with flower rosin but if hash rosin is done properly you are not going to get any plant matter and a little bit of plant matter is no big deal but the amount of plant matters on here i'm literally like jesus christ dude i just destroyed my banger all three of the strains i picked up from this company were super disappointing i kept opening the next jar hoping it was going to be better than the last one but honestly just got progressively worse i was so disappointed and i'm not kidding when i say you have to dab these at a low temperature like almost baking temperatures are good my one buddy texted me and said he was dabbing it at 520. and i'm like bro i think my oven goes that hot but i must say this is better than the flower owls than i got from g leaf i made a whole video on that and i was honestly kind of nice to them for some reason and i feel like that [ __ ] was horrible compared to this not that this stuff's much better but i must say that this stuff does look better and have a better taste to it but this product is made great at best and i honestly don't like to share make great products on my page but i wanted to show pa patients or patients in any other state who might see this nitro rosin and thinking it is actually hatch rosin but just know it smokes more like flower awesome if you're okay with that good for you if you're not make sure you get the different product to me getting hash rosin is like getting steak at a restaurant and getting this kind of hatch rosin is like if you went to mcdonald's for the steak it just isn't going to be good the people that ask for hashrats and what the cleanest highest quality like best product and if you're going gonna come out with this much cheaper version of hash rosin just to say that you did it it's kind of like what the [ __ ] are you doing bro we don't want this i'm sure some people do like this and aren't complaining as much as i am but someone who's used to dabbing the hatch rosin from colorado or from california is not going to be too impressed by this if you've never had hash rosin or a solvent list before you might just be blown away by this but this is like really low grade when it comes to hatch rosin we're going to cold start this one see how it goes look how fast that [ __ ] melted might be able to use a little bit more [Music] heat [Music] oh [ __ ] [Music] that was a little hot rest in piece of this banger bro holy [ __ ] but ultimately this does get me high it does taste alright but i just not satisfied with the look of it and the amount of plant matter it does have a really cool bubble to it at first i'm not gonna lie that doesn't really mean anything but you can see all the little specks in there on your banger once it's actually being smoked and i'm being nice when i say it tastes okay it tastes like flour rosin it doesn't taste like any hatchbacks that i've ever had before personally i used to love to taste the flower rosin until i had real hatch rosin and that just tainted me forever a little bit of the bong aid in there this bong ain't seriously saved this [ __ ] banger look at that look at that but i do have to cut these guys a little bit of slack because this is only their second drop ever it's their first time dropping concentrates they are very new into the industry and i'm sure they will get better as they go on but they've really been hyping themselves up before they dropped and if you're not coming out the gate with what you've been hyping up just shut your mouth let your products speak for themselves these people are really just gonna get their hopes up and be disappointed and be more disappointed than they'd be if they just had it without any hype originally because if you're gonna say that you're going to be dropping hashgraphs you're going to have hatchbacks you're going to have hatchbacks and then you're going to be like well i mean it is hash rosin technically but it smells like flower rosin but it's cheap and it's like no dude you said you're going to have the best price hash browsing in the market and it's like yeah you did that but you know that's not what we wanted and you know that's not what we thought you meant so people might feel deceived honestly i don't really give a [ __ ] i bought it i'm gonna smoke it i'll get over it it gets me high but i'm gonna quit bitching and dab through this i really just have my hopes up a little bit there maybe eventually one of these companies will actually press some high quality hash rosin but priya i give you a participation award at least you tried but to any companies in pennsylvania that might be listening to this we want real quality live hashtags and none of this [ __ ]

fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive yo what's up ladies and gents my name is shaka zulu and if you're new to the channel welcome man this is my channel shaka x 420 and i'm back here for another video guys shout out to everyone that was in the live stream yesterday guys i went live yesterday mainly because you know i just been blagging a little bit this week on the videos i think i only have like two vlogs maybe posted this week or something or like one vlog posted for this week but your boy wanted to hit you guys um with at least a little something to show you guys i'm there um because i don't want you guys thinking that i forgot about you guys or anything because i never forget about you guys because you guys are what make the channel i know you guys love just vibing to me but no matter what way i look at it man i wouldn't be here without you guys man shout out to getting me to 3k and we're only going up from here guys so let's go um today we're going to do another cart review but um this weekend hopefully we're going to switch up from the car reviews we're going to get a nature session and hopefully a hot box test so stay tuned for that guys this weekend hopefully if it doesn't rain um the nature session will for sure happen hopefully and then um the hotbox will always it'll just happen i'm just gonna try and make it all happen this weekend sorry if i don't make it happen but i'm gonna try and make these videos happen because i've been really wanting to make uh those videos for a long time and i just you know time just got away from me and i just uh forgot about them but um today guys we got two cards we got a solvent-less rosin cart and we have a live resin and we're gonna put up um and we're gonna put these two up against each other just because they're both lemonade flavor and we got the low well [Music] low well pink lemonade live rosin or just raw i don't think it's live i'm not sure how you would say it and then we got the ursa extracts live resin guys shout out to them and they're both pink lemonade so um i wanted to do a cart review of verses to where it was more more of an even match they're both like kind of the same strain coming from the same flower because i'm assuming that they both come from um the strange the same strange stained flower to make the pink lemonade whatever it's crossed with or whatnot but um so for the for the low well rosin it's sitting at 53 thc and for the ursa extracts it's a little bit higher it's sitting at 68.6 uh thc guys with um no cbd in that one and then the uh the low well has point 32 milligrams of thc so we're actually doing a pax pod 2 versus the 510 thread guys and honestly the only reason why i think people don't like the pax era is because um you you can't get the app for apple iphone i think you can only get the app to change the temperature for android and then they don't know how to change the temperature um by themselves because they also have these preheated settings that if you know how to change it you can just change without having the app or whatnot so you can get fat clouds because i feel like a lot of people want to get fat clouds with um with that you know with the packs but i love the packs because you can change the temperature to that low temp because that's where you get the most flavor um out of your cart so i'm gonna open these up and i'm gonna try and get them out if i can alright guys we got the ursa extracts open you guys seen this man it's in a ceramic freaking cart guys shazam and then i'm going to pull out the uh pax limited also just so you guys can see the quality of the oils right up next to each other guys so we got two different oils let me get a close-up as you can see the ursa extracts is actually a little bit more lighter you can kind of see it and the low well it looks light but it's actually not light it's actually pretty golden it's actually pretty similar to the ursa extracts actually but it looks a little darker in here all right guys so i gave you guys a close-up real quick i got the popper herbs on my neck right now guys so we're going to hit the pop-up herbs real quick hopefully this vlog isn't ruined and you guys can actually hear me but there's a lot of loud noises going on right now so hopefully you guys can hear me but [Music] i can't even [Music] cheers guys if you're not smoking right now so this is just the papa herbs ugh wax just came off and onto my mouth that's so disgusting i hate it when that happens guys when the wax comes on the tip and just gets into your mouth but hell yeah man we're gonna take this one off the bat and we're gonna put on the ursa extracts guys let's go because i haven't tried the ursa extracts pink lemonade but i have tried the low well pink lemonade so i'm gonna test this one out and we're gonna move guys we're gonna move because i can't hear myself talk and i'm the type of person that likes to hear himself talk while he's doing reviews [Music] i'm digging i'm digging the pink lemonade right now i can't lie it's not bad it's pretty dank it doesn't have much lemon flavor or anything but it tastes pretty dang it tastes like a dab it has that ursa you know that ursa extracts tastes like that typical ursa extracts taste but it tastes pretty damn good guys i like the oil and i'm just shutting the door real quick because people can just see in my backyard so we shut the door and but cheers guys i hope everyone's smoking right now so let's try out the packs man let's try out the packs we gotta we're putting this up against the packs guys and people will be hitting on the packs so let me just put this on the battery real quick put that on the bat shazam and let's go see right there guys you can see that the pax is a ripper i'm telling you right off the back though guys i'm starting to get more of a sweeter taste to it other than just you know the dab waxy taste um it's a lot smoother than the ursa extract the ursa extracts makes you kind of want to it makes you want to cough i mean if you're not coughing you're not getting high guys but it makes you want to cough way more than the rosin but i think that's just because um the rosin is made solventless and ursa extracts live resin isn't is it's not solventless but um it's still pretty damn good like ursa extracts on a scale of one to ten i'd put ursa extracts got like you know probably the pink lemonade at like a eight and i'll put i don't know i put actually i'll put him at a seven and then i'll put the low well rosin at like a nine it tastes better it's it tastes better it's a better product but ursa extracts i still love ursa extracts live resin man that's some some good ash good ass oil [Music] but yeah guys it's just been a chill day um i got off off for work i thought i was gonna take the vaccine today but i decided and i don't know i just decided not to take it just because um honestly i would be real with you guys the only reason why i didn't take the vaccine is literally because they wanted me to make a copy of my insurance and i didn't want to do it i didn't want to fill all this paperwork and stuff and it was easier just to sign the paper saying that i don't want to do it so i was a little bit lazy so i'll probably get the vaccine eventually guys because i want to be able to travel i want to be able to get out of here i want to go to the uk i want to go to canada i want to go to japan those are some of the big places i want to make sure that i get to uh before the end of my life you know not saying that i'm gonna die anytime soon but those are definitely some of the places that um are on my bucket list to um travel to let me know what your guys's bucket list is your travel bucket list is down in the comments guys because i know we all got freaking dreams guys we all got dreams and we all want to um you know live out our freaking dreams man and i appreciate you guys for freaking watching the video guys and um always interacting with me and helping me follow my freaking dream man seriously guys you don't even freaking know how much this [ __ ] means to me but um i hope everyone enjoyed the video i'm gonna end it here um in this video i'm just gonna be real the rosin is way better than the pink lemonade live resin but that's just because it's solventless and i don't know it's just smooth i just like i like my smoothness i like i like it when stuff isn't too harsh but like i'm not saying that um i'm not saying that ursa extracts is super harsh it's super bad or something but it's definitely harsher than the low well the low wells way more smoother but at the same time um ursa extracts is way smoother than like other live resins or other distillates out there like papa herbs that i was smoking this is way more harsher than the ursa extracts so you know sometimes it's just up for you guys to decide on what you guys want to freaking smoke but shout out to everybody thank you for watching the video more videos to come more live streams to come guys man i freaking love the live stream so make sure you guys i just dropped my packs make sure you guys freaking stay tuned for the live stream make sure your notification notification bell is on i know sometimes the notifications don't pop up but still click that notification because you never know when it will work and you feel me and when if it does work you want to know when your boy is hopping on because sorry guys um you know i know some of you guys hop in the live late but you know sometimes i just i've already been on the live for an hour or two and i just been high and smoking hella products so i just we want to get off and chill for a second um so sorry for the people that come in late and miss it i'm not ending the live just because you come in or something but um thank you guys man talk to you guys soon see you guys on the internet in the comments on the lives peace out you can zoom in whatever [Music] is [Music] what is being free if i can no longer be me you don't like what you see so you rub up on my energy i just wanna be me smoking on that end of wheat so i just close my eyes because i know [Music] heart you see all my scars you see all the love that i push in the dark i always felt alone so i hop in my car push button start i dream every day as i look to the stars spilling my heart while i'm spitting these bars [Music]", "ylc16phLqDE": "i mean this right here is some live rosin bro this is really what you want to do what's good everyone it's haikai as you can see we're at the dispo right now pick up some fire and i'll show you guys what we get when we get back all right we just got back from the dispensary we picked up some real nice stuff for sure she was expensive but um definitely like i'm just gonna say now this is honestly worth it to me um we picked up some rosin and rosin right now is going pretty crazy it's a solving this extract it's like the top-tier extracts in my opinion like because it's solventless and there's no butane or anything extra added into it it's just literally using heat to get the extract from flash flooding flower or regular cured flower it's some fire bro i've only tried it once before and that was literally last night that's why i wanted to make a video about it i picked up and i want to go back today and get some more and bro that [ __ ] was i did one dab of it i only take i only took one down because i wanted to save more for the video but dude just one like it just hit so much different like i can't even describe how like how much different it hits your chest and like your head it just like feels because the the high doesn't even feel like groggy like you would from a distal high like when you get high from just slit you just get like i guess high and then you just like want to go lay down and just like i don't know want to [ __ ] off for a bit but if you take a dab of some like real live browsing bro that should just like i don't know it just makes you feel so much more uplifted and good like it gives you the actual like i don't know feeling of high like it re it really gave me like flash faster like when i first started smoking because like right now my tolerance is pretty high since i've been smoking like every day for like a while now so dab of rosin is just like up here compared to like some shatters just like all the way down here this is completely different experience in my opinion at least solving this is definitely the way to go we picked up three different types of roses actually and we're going to get into like the different types of rosins you can get we got some aged cured rosin we have some live rosin and then we also have a full spectrum rosin yeah it's going to be dope video for sure because like this [ __ ] smacks bro uh we're gonna get some cool we'll get some cool milk shots and everything you know the vibes but yeah first let's get into the aged cured rosin from the well it's a hybrid one gram of solventless cannabis extracts that's what you like seeing um get a little shot of the back as well and as you can see it says whoops it's age cured rosin as you can see um which train is it uh melon rings and yeah on the inside it gives like a little uh biography of why i like solving this extracts are really the way to go so we at lowell love concentrates but we don't love the chemical solvents used to create low quality extracts we also know that cannabis is far more than complex in thc alone and that's stripping out the rich and complex variety of cannabinoids and terpenes found in the plant undermines the whole plant cannabis experience our artisans worked tirelessly to perfect an extraction method encompassing the whole plant using pressure and time instead of solvents and volatile extraction we knew with the cold pressing of cannabis which preserves all the natural properties we can finally create concentrates worthy of the well named alaskan fire bro um this is just some regular age cured rosin it's a bit different from regular live rosin this can be full spectrum anything can be full spectrum uh it can either be full spectrum or live i'm not sure if it's live or full spectrum because age cured is referred to um the process after that and the carrying process usually involves rosin being collected in a suitable jar heated and then treated with some variation of hot or cold temperatures and then stored in a stored in the jar for a few weeks or longer and then if done well can result result in some jam that can be like some of the most flavorful important and potent uh concentrates imaginable and that's what this is exactly and yeah dude this should definitely smacks like no other bro like i can't wait to get some more of this because it really isn't that expensive like i was saying um hq rosin is from the well i think that's like one of their it's like specialties i guess because i don't really see any other age gear rather for anywhere else but yeah there's just gonna be some fire bro we'll take a globber of this um let's get this shop set up [ __ ] globber boys [Music] smoke down smoked out positive squad protect dj smokey at all costs [Music] [Music] all right bro that [ __ ] just smacks so different i i can't even describe it like i'm i'm just like so much [ __ ] iron than i was before i i i like i didn't i've been all right yeah i haven't smoked like at all really today i've like to rip the card maybe once or twice but bro this [ __ ] just smacks me so differently than just like a regular like live resin dab or something like that like this [ __ ] just makes my whole body feel so different but in a good way just you could really taste the full flavor profiling and all the chirps in them and that dab it just tastes so good dude whoa i forgot which string that was i think it was like melon rings like you could really just taste that [ __ ] it tasted so amazing i can't wait to take some more uh take some more [ __ ] globs of that bro it's some fire like seriously this it was really worth it and i think the melon rings honestly wasn't even that expensive either like that for a gram was i think i think 45 or something and that's really like that's pretty cheap in my opinion for some rosin and it was it's still pretty good quality and like you can get some live resin or diamonds for about the same amount and this is solventless and i would honestly rather prefer this and it hits like so much so much better dude i can't even like i'm not over exaggerating or anything because like i'd be smoking every day and like and i'll be smoking some like like i think in the last video like it was like some purple punch like it'll give me high and it made me feel pretty good but it doesn't give me that like full body high like this is giving me right now and this is like it's just smacking for real but um yeah let's get into the next thing the which is this full spectrum hashtag so what basically what a full spectrum extract is is about preserving the natural ratios of compounds within cannabis while removing the impurities that can compromise the full experience and then full spectrum exercise can also be called whole plant extract just because it keeps all the properties of the flower it doesn't remove any of it but however because heat is involved in this uh solvent extraction method compared to like a regular um full spectrum extract with uh like bho or co2 however since this is a salt in this extract and the only extraction method is like through heat basically um it is a concern that full spectrum extracts going solventless um can lose some terpenes if it isn't done right and some other profiles of cannabis but if it's a well-known company not some like boof they know what they're doing for the most part and like have it down to its science really but yeah that's basically the difference between full spectrum and live ones originally coming from a dry flower and then the other one's coming from a flash flowers and flower which is live resin we just dabbed on with some cured aid frozen i accidentally got that mixed up with uh with this the full spectrum live rosin so everything i just talked about i was referring to this which is a full spectrum like i was saying like you get the full profiling of the flower and everything from full spectrum compared to my bras and you get my rods and you only get like parts of it because it does remove some um profiles we'll get into this full spectrum now i pretty much explained everything about the difference between full spectrum and uh live resin but yeah this [ __ ] looks fire as [ __ ] as well um i'll read the little things they have um this is from honey butter this is their brand uh the last brand was the wells like it's cool how like you can tell the difference about the brands that really care and i feel like these like saltiness extract brands because like there's so much more work goes into it i feel like um they really care about their products and stuff and you can tell like they have like a whole last thing it shows you like what temperatures you should be taking your dabs out of stuff and like if you have a puffco or i think the other thing is the aura or email it even says with temperatures to take it out and that's really [ __ ] helpful like no other thing does that and like it says you should be taking them at low temps and like low temps is definitely the way dude you can really taste the chirps at low temp and it's the move and then mainly it says thank you for choosing to support craft cannabis our family business small farmers of uh meniscento county from the soil to oil every step of our process performed with love and intent of delivering the best experience for you down to the last dab we are incredibly grateful to share our patient we are incredibly grateful to share our passion for this amazing plan with you thank you kindly the honey butter team and then message us anytime we're always here to chat honey butter rosin dot co so yeah this is that honey runner rosin this shit's fire bro i haven't even tried it i can't even say it's fire but it sounds fire it's peanut butter cup bro it's crazy i'm allergic to peanut butter so uh bro imagine this like gives me an allergic reaction i've never even like had peanut butter so i wonder it's gonna give me the taste but yeah this is that um this is that full spectrum rosin and like i was saying full spectrum rosin does come from dried plants not um fresh frozen plants so that's why it does look a bit different it also could be different press as well from the live resin but yeah it still looks fire as [ __ ] and smells it smells like it's gonna be super tasty um like dude the other the melanie smelled super good too but yeah we'll take a nice uh nice glob of this too i'm already [ __ ] hiding and i'm working like an hour so hopefully i can get this video finished [Music] check [Music] so that peanut butter cup um that was pretty fire too as well and that was the cheapest out of all of them there's only like 38 dollars before tax that's really not too bad for grandma rosin um but i can understand why it is the cheapest it definitely felt like the quality it wasn't as like refined as maybe the cured age rosin and i just felt like like i said i mean like in the name said this just feels more cured and like they like the feeling of that one more i feel but this definitely gave me a good uh full body high more in the head i felt like yeah but this for sure with some fire bro and again it's solving this and if you can get some cell phones the same price as um some bho or um other [ __ ] like that i don't understand why you wouldn't cop some solvent list because it's like honestly like better for you in the long run i felt like personally and yeah it's honestly it's just really some fire it's worth the extra couple bucks in my opinion and then right now we'll get into like the most expensive one which is the live rosin that i got bro that's just some fire i i can't even describe it that's definitely my favorite one i think it's just some um banana korean premium live rosin it's a banana oj um mixed with a creme brulee so it's a hybrid this is definitely the most expensive one at 85 before tax and which isn't even like too expensive for rosin because there's there's jams there that are like 110 120. i mean that might be a little taxed just because of the hype i feel like right now but like 80 80 to 90 is what you're usually going to pay for raws and like i feel like no matter what unless it's like i don't know for at least for some live rosin and like bro this just smacks differently so any products that are like immediately frozen like after they're harvested or called like live so that's why this is called live rosin it's referring to the flower that was immediately frozen once it was harvested and basically what live resin is is a solventless hash oil made with full milk bubble hash that was made with freshly frozen materials and as you guys saw in like my other video i was um smoking some full melt bubble hash it was no it wasn't full mount bubble hatch because i wasn't able to dab it if it says full melt you are able to dab it but if it's bubble hash um just regular bubble hatch you can't dab that it will like it just won't burn correct but you can put it on top of bullets or inside joints but yeah that's basically just like all trichomes and then you go from that to uh you basically take the water hash and that gets pressed and then that's what becomes a live rosin and that's basically what this is bro i'm gonna open this up now no time to waste bro just some fire um yeah it doesn't even have like a long description like the other boxes though all it says on the top is flavor as nature intended in a smaller batches let's fire around i mean this right here is some live rosin bro this is really what you want to be smoking if you can some fire bro um just take a bobber of this [Music] [Music] like i was saying that should just hit way different than like all of them honestly don't get me wrong it's not like the most insane high ever i just feel like it's like maybe the cleanest high that i've ever gotten from at least the the papa select this is the most expensive rosin that um that i picked up it was the live rosin and like it tastes great and everything but i feel like the chirps like aren't really there compared to the aged cured rosin and then the i think this was the full spectrum rosin this is definitely worth it and it gives you the i felt like it gave me the cleanest high it was 85 before tax which is pretty expensive for one gram if you want to know you're smoking like the best [ __ ] possible you can definitely be getting this um these two as well any type of solvent this extract is honestly gonna be so much better than any bho or a co2 extract which is like um like shatters and stuff you can for sure always still get good batters and i'm like still going to get that of course because they're always going to be cheap and everything but like that means solving this is just honestly like superior just like it's just a step above it's honestly really worth the money i don't understand the hype now but like out of all three of these i'd say that the cured age rosin was my favorite and it was only 45 dollars for the gram and like this should super tasty bro like you could really taste the chirps on it i'm gonna take another glove of this before i go and yeah that's gonna pretty much be the end of the video uh thanks guys for watching if you can try out some solving this extracts bro definitely try if you can uh definitely worth the money if you've ever been thinking about it like comment subscribe i'll see you guys next week", "fYMCA_Tg_vk": "Welcome to Endoca's beautiful organic\ncannabis fields. Come I'll show you Well, in order to make a good cannabis extract\nyou need good starting plant material. In my hand I have a cannabis plant it\nsmells fantastic. In order to make a nice extract you need to obviously dry the\nplant material first. Come let's go to the lab I'll show you how to make an\nextract. Welcome to Endoca. My name is Henry Vincente and today I will show you\nhow to cannabis extraction using ethanol We will use cannabis material which is\nthe leaves and the flowers all in one Very important to use organic so that you\nknow there is nothing inside that can harm you. There are over 4,000 different\nvarieties of cannabis now the one I chose has a lot of CBD inside. You could\napply the same method or what kind of cannabinoid eschews so called ethanol\ntake a ball put the plant material inside so the process has to be very\nfast. You don't want the ethanol to touch the plant material to a long time. If it\ndoes you get a lot of other stuff inside which you don't want. You just use enough\nethanol to cover so that we can separate the plant material from the cannabinoids. You need to be fast in this process because we can only stir for three\nminutes so I use a plastic spoon. You don't use mechanical devices because you\ndon't want to create a spark. If I create a spark now everything will burn. You mix\nwell then we have to separate the ethanol from the plant material. I do\nsimply by taking a sieve and put it in another Bowl. It can drip a little bit\nyou know there's still some alcohol left This was the first filtration now we're\ngoing to do the second filtration in order to remove the plant material you\nhave left, and we do that by using a simple coffee machine\nIt can heat your material and it can filtrate and we start with the\nfiltration part coffee filter, take your spoon you take now the material on the liquid\nand you pour it into the filter paper and you see the process starts. In order\nto accelerate the process we change the paper, every time a single filtration has\noccurred if you have more material you just continue until you don't have any\nmore, and like this and it's dripping beautifully. Now it's time to cook so\nwhen you cook at home you can use many different things I have here an example\nof a rice cooker which works fine a pot and a heating device works also fine and\na water distiller. Now my favorite is the water distiller because if you cook with\nany of these methods we need a cleanroom box like this for those of you who\ndoesn't have a box like this you can cook outside but to make it all easier\nlet's use the water distiller. Now this is the process where we separate the\nethanol from the cannabinoids. The time it will take for the full separation\ndepends of course of how much material you put inside I use a bowl to collect\nthe pure ethanol that's going to come out here because you can you reuse it\nagain and again we give it some juice and we wait so now the question is when\nto stop I can see I have 80% of my original ethanol volume so that's\nindication that it's time to see what's going on inside you open the lid slowly\nand look inside and you can see that is very little material in my case this is\nthe time to stop just to be sure not to breathe it here we go and be careful\nwhen you pour because there's very little material you don't want to lose\nit and now I'm going to show you the final step using the coffee machine what\nwe have to do is remove the remaining ethanol from our extract put it on the\nheating device turn it on and we wait best is to wait for 24 hours so that\nyou're sure that no ethanol is left I already did this and as you can see from\nall the work with it we have very little material the final test is a quality\ntest we do it by using a paperclip dipping it into the material and you use\na lighter you light it fast and see what happens if there is a spark you know there is \nstill ethanol left so you can see comparison see it's burning then you\nneed to put it back on the heater but in our case it was well done. To make a\ncannabis extract at home you need a lighter\nfilter coffee machine some small bowls, two bowls\nsieve plastic spoon coffee filters alcohol cannabis. Put the cannabis into\nthe bowl cover with cold alcohol steer three minutes with plastic spoon filter\nthe alcohol through the sieve filter again through the coffee filter it still\nuntil 80 percent of the initial alcohol volume is gone pour into a small ball\nhit the small ball with the coffee machine for 24 hours to remove the\nremaining alcohol. To check if there is any remaining alcohol use a small spoon\nand the lighter if there is any remaining alcohol the product will\nproduce sparks when burning with a lighter keep heating until you don't get\nany sparks anymore Enjoy your cannabis extract Stay tuned\nnext time I'm going to show you how to purify the extract and turn it into pure\ncannabinoids in my hand is 99% CBD beautiful crystals See you next time", "Z1_JJMsFR1U": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with token Tim for twenty-some Medical Marijuana review for those over the age of 18 if you're not a teen get out I'd like to say hard everybody out there hello how are you doing you guys haven't subscribed hit that button down there leave me a comment down below if you ain't got nothing to say just leave me emoji that's what I do and I got nothin to say I just throw up a peace sign all right let's roll one up and then we got a whole video today let's go for some sherbert seventy seven point three percent THC it's a little darker roll this up real quick and system member berries know that [ __ ] this is some mini as I picked up a bit the other day and then we do have a two different dispensaries we went to today so we'll get those knocked out here I'm sorry you guys can see that down there just so you could see the lava lamp decent-sized piece out there all right we got a real good sized piece they're just gonna see it and break some of that up in there maybe all of it and this like I said you could just sprinkle it right on top crumble with unless it's too hard then you have to kind of stop it or get crazy with it but if you can see with the crumble it does leave some stuff on your fingers so you're wasting a little bit that's why I kind of switched up to the wax whenever you can find it but I do still like the crumble because it doesn't melt real good out in the Sun for going to work and stuff I've said that before going to the beach sitting out in the backyard cutting grass whatever you got going on crappy all right when you're poking too kind of didn't seal there at the top I didn't lick it good so we kind of lost a little bit there trying to keep it in frame but not look through the camera as a painter but sometimes yeah well we poke that down a little too much just a tiny bit every couple times because some of you like to watch it roll some of you just want to get into the review so I try to mix it up to make everybody happy I have to do it let's light it up mmm never very taste good all right stir the flour back in here make a tiny heads up I wouldn't risk that grab that later all right so we got some halls today first one will do is move and talk about them make sure you stick around for the second one because I've got some interesting stuff going on and we got two of the live rosin I hadn't taking the labels off of these to give me just a second so we got the rainbow train wreck coming in at seven hundred and sixty two now you're gonna move the decimal point over one so it's gonna be seventy six point two okay get the label off this one to you guys sorry I wasn't real prepared I guess something this one's ripping on me sorry guys that's enough you can't tell what it is and then we got the black fire coming in at 758 so again we're gonna move it over one so it's gonna be seventy five point eight let's take a peek at these real quick now these didn't show up on the website but I know they got a delivery yesterday because they had a different strain of wax on there they had I can't remember what it was they had a crumble on there that was different and they didn't have last week so apparently these Rosen's are coming in small enough batches they're not putting them online so I'd say keep an eye if you're looking for the roz and keep an eye on their website and when you see they have new product just go in you can't call I tried I called the other day they said they didn't have any I couldn't get the guy in the call center he was a new one I couldn't get him to call over to the store but since they're only a few minutes away I figured I could run in there now you can see that one's got a little bit of a darker line in it it's a little different now they kept these refrigerated there somebody said not to refrigerate them because it was live Roz and I'm not sure I keep mine refrigerated now these again are 95 dollars a piece now I did use my loyalty card we're going to talk about that I seen a lot of stuff on another channel and then I seen a lot of stuff the other night on one a couple of Facebook groups alright first of all if your doctor does not carry the loyalty card call around your local area see which doctor does and just go in and pick one up they're not Pacific they're not numbered they didn't have your name on it and nothing like that so you can pick them up anywhere there is no move doctors that are just specifically for move some doctors are just too lazy to call also have to do is call move and move will send them a stack up they send them to my doctor my doctor is not affiliated with move it's against the law order for a dispensary and a doctor's office to be affiliated it's just throwing that out there I heard that was a bunch of stuff I heard on Facebook so hopefully somebody will post this on Facebook and straighten them out now if you remember I just my car didn't even really expire yet this was my last recommendation I used up all the flour I went to my doctor got a new recommendation and a new card which you can do that twice a year the only way I can get ahead on the flour so I had my loyalty card well I didn't have a loyalty card they emailed me one cuz I did the online doctor's visit so you don't even have the heart I have to have the hard copy at the moment because of the coronavirus you can just have your doctor email it to you get another doctor to email you one you probably have to go in there and pick one up unless you find a nice one that will email it to you they didn't look at somebody was saying they had an emailed one but it wasn't from their doctor they wouldn't accept it mine doesn't say my doctor's office mine says Josh whoever Josh was in the office that emailed it to me so just throwing that out there plus I haven't used any of my three things on there if you look at it the first one's 25% off the second one is 75 off 150 the third one is buy one get one free that's what I use today she told me I could use them in any order they prefer you to use them in their order they're there because it helps them keep track of it better but you're allowed to use it in any order you want she almost didn't let me do it because when she looked on there now this is a different something altogether I just used my buy one get one in February because you guys know move was an hour drive and I hadn't been going much and I was saving that last one for a rosin and I finally found some rosin in February so it looked like I just used it I'm like that's just because I just around got around to using it because you guys are so far away so I will go back tomorrow and use the 75 off 150 I've got something special planned for that one but you can use them in any order you can go to any doctor's office and pick these up you don't have to go to yours so hopefully that helps a few of you out out there that doesn't have a the doctors not using move or what have you and we can always save some money all right then we also stopped a true leave and we got a bag inside a bag I got two different size bags that you leave now apparently so I had to go back in twice because I did online order and they wouldn't let me add to it they was letting me add to it so I was getting I was getting one or two people every time I went in there that was real nice and they would just let me add whatever I wanted onto order today I had to order it and go back and go back again which was a pain in the butt but true leave has the clearance items now I got the sherbert clearance it's coming in at 74 74 percent THC now I only got one and I was kind of leery of it this was $42 it's 30% off you're getting the same discount as the employees and everything else they won't add no other discounts to it you can't do your points I wasn't allowed to use my points on this or anything like that now I was figuring this was old stuff that's why I really only got one if I've known different ID it got more this doesn't expire until 421 2021 so this is barely a month old right now it's always good for a year so they just made this it's not old it's just they had a little bit excess stock of it and this stuff looks really service what we just put in the joint so you guys seen the big chunky pieces of that this stuff looks a lot better it's a lot more smaller pieces but the pieces you can see the bigger stuff it is nice and a honeycomb look at that that stuff just looks amazing now the other one over there I think is 411 so this one's a little bit newer stuff looks good smells good and $42 guys so if you see that clearance if you go under shop under true leaving and look down it's got flour all that blah blah blah then you're gonna see the clearance click on that and it has wax pins it had the only concentrates they had was shatter and crumble like I said I would have got some the other night but I was kind of leery and figuring they was old stuff but so if you see I don't know you want to save some money grab that then we got some skunk ape crumble this isn't showing up on the website either one of you guys mentioned it to me and I think it was expedite I'm not sure if it was somebody else sorry so I did run in and pick one of those up coming in at 73 percent THC I haven't even looked at this one yeah this one was for 14 so the other ones newer and that this was full price and again we're more back into that slab a crumble so honestly the discounted crumble is the best-looking one that I got so far it's been hard to find indicas lately the only indica wax they had well they had a mandarin dream I guess they had Skywalker and that crescendo which I didn't really care for the crescendo and I still got Skywalker in there I still got meander and dream in there too but I really like this so you guys make sure you see the review on this which it'll be out soon and again this wasn't as butteri as the other stuff it has more of that granule look to it like it was got you know some sugar crystals or salt crystals or something you know I mean towards the other ones are more like buttery and these are more sugar it up granule so whatever you want to call them so I'm happy this one would still come out the same way so we do have a lot of reviews to go through now I was gonna I know I told me Qi 69 I was gonna pick up an RSO completely out of indica or esos not one in the whole damn building so I know couple have you been asking for those I never tried it but amici 69 Celtic Tech you they seem to really like it I've had a few other people say it really helps for you insomnia and my insomnia is kicking my ass right now I don't know if it's you know the added stress of the virus and all that other [ __ ] kids being home from school but I ain't been sleeping worth apart lately at all so I'll down some nasty old alright so if I have to and that was pretty much been what's stopping me I know it's not going to taste great I'm I know it's not I'm not gonna like the flavor of it but hopefully the effects will like concentrate tre there there's some crumbles there's some blue there's some shatters oh and I also want to mention a lot of you had asked if the rosin was stronger than the old rose and if it was stronger than the wax it was hard to say because the last batch I got was that triangle Koosh I had never tried triangle Koosh before so you can't compare Girl Scout cookie to granddaddy purple in a wax and one in a shatter they're gonna be different because they're different strains the rainbow train wreck I do have this and flower so I got a little bit of a comparison there the black fire I've had this before it's one of my favorite indicas I've still got some in shatter you can see how this has been here for a minute like it was March last year I've had that for a while yes I guess that's a year old huh I better use that up it's been at the bottom of the tray I keep it that's my go-to for when my insomnia gets really really really really bad so I been kind of I hide it on the body cuz gets a little dirtier than the rest and I didn't think it was that old though but but like I was saying so I've had the indica the Blackfyre in an indica before I've had it in chrome boy I've had it I don't think I've had it in Flour but I know the effects of it so we'll be able to say if it hits any harder in the ice or not so like I said we do have quite a bit of that turned around I know it got a little quiet there we're gonna have some how-to videos because I've got to do something my refrigerator is filled and I got two more Rosen's to put in there and that wax and they're not gonna fit those were pretty stocked up but if you notice this only come with one shelf and I kind of use this because it does leak a little water down there so I didn't want stick anything on the bottom but this really doesn't hold it's got the Skywalker in there and some other stuff so I'm gonna do something to this my little mini fridge remember that was my Christmas gift for 20 bucks Black Friday so we do have like I said a lot of concentrates I know michi 69 said she was stocked I think I got you beat girl but like I said I got nervous at the beginning of this epidemic thing I couldn't stock up on flour so I started stocking up on concentrates then they come out with the wax so I had to get some more of those to try that so I ended up with a lot of this crap so that's why somebody said I was dabbing a little bit more that's one of the reasons I'm trying to slow down the flour and try to get some of this stuff used up because I don't have more room in the fridge and if they come out with a new product or somebody else comes out with Roz and I don't have no place to put it so I hope that helps you guys hope that helps you with the multi-card like I said make sure you check out that clearance stuff is good stuff it's not old it's not discontinued there's nothing wrong with it this was the diskens item for $42 for crumble and it's the best-looking crumble I have from truely even awhile I will say that that's

marijuana reviews bringing a review on one plant's live rosin that is fresh from harvest frozen plant that is pressed into beautiful beautiful rosin so essentially the strain is mac one i've torn into the gram quite a bit it has stayed perfectly together i don't feel like i've lost any terpenes since having it over the last 10 days it has stayed fully intact other than me of course dabbing the hell out of it the thc isn't going to be what a lot of people want it's of 72 roughly so i know there's a lot of people out there that think thc is everything so they may be slightly disappointed but let me tell you this product is on point true leave will sit there and tell you their rosings will give you a terp tickle slight cough it's just they have harsh shitty concentrate this right here will never give you a turp tickle this is immaculate now the reason this live rosin is 105 a gram is because it is lives when they harvest the plant they freeze it immediately and from there they prepare the trichomes for the pressing that's like one breath big dab i could not even feel the slightest of any kind of tickle in the entire thing granted i took a very low temp dab so some would argue that that's partly why it's not that hard even off a harsh hot dab i don't even feel like it's that harsh because this product is so clean now the only other dispensary out there that pushes a live rosin that is comparable is going to be move but theirs is a little bit harsher but this mac one strain from one plant absolutely out of the park indica i get just a little bit sleepy i feel like my body feels great on it now it does have a low cbd percentage a lot of people would argue that indica should have higher cbd percentages but with a live product like this i mean you get every terpene that was ever present in the plant from the start and i think that's exceptional i think for me that's a great medicine it tastes better it's cleaner", "vDz6bMTdPDE": "alright guys this is my second video figured I would do it over viola my man want to call every brand my favorite company but Buell is a pretty interesting one founded by a former NBA player al Harrington back in 2011 got its name because that's his grandmother's name she suffers from glaucoma and diabetes and reluctantly agreeing from a long time of him persuading her helped her a lot and she now medicates with his help from viola and cool story great company all butane extracts I have a nice little flavor assortment recent pickup from Denver big fan so I'm gonna run you through a couple of these flavors actually I'm gonna go through all of them just because I'm reviewing viola today so first we have tangerine hash plant now some of these I have written to two grams on them because I combined them so no yeah I'll say that this one is one of my favorites which I probably say about four of them super citrusy flavor definitely getting the tangerine flavor and I got three of them they're incredible I love tangerines but each each it's gonna be to each his own what you think ghosts domina that's gonna be a live sugar 98 percent THC a and that total totally THC 86 percent you gotta look at that big difference with that live sugar it's a it's pretty easy to work with ghosts domina my girlfriend said it was her favorite fantastic that's another one of the two grams and I've been I've been small a little bit of these because I couldn't I couldn't wait to make this video my pay my patience is not there yet this was cool it's a life crumble and my girlfriend rated all these I agree oh this one's number one sour bean it just smells like sour if you if you can understand what that like a Sour Patch Kid like kind of makes you want to wrinkle your nose up haven't try that one yet Mac cake one of my favorites obviously if I got two grams of it been hitting it already no mmm super pungent another sour flavor that's what I love about viola I'll say like I said many of my hey many of these companies are my favorites but they each specialize and have their own qualities violas especially is the pungently sour flavors [Music] another one is called extra citrus where's that one right here so this one tangerine hash plate and lemon Lotus and key lime pie combined to make extra citrus a 94% THC a I smoked a lot of this one because look at some of those big diamonds Wow smell is undescribable just extra citrus they named it well it smells like like just sniffing a lemon juice jar from the store this one's called THC a witch that's literally the name of the strain I guess is Kim for the wipers or is it just THC a camphor don't know big rocks smells pretty pungent fruity though very fruity very nice this is a smooth one pretty good no they're all pretty similar on those numbers live sugar try dog cush makes a triangle cushion underdog again pretty soon one little number yummy wondered on how to hit that one yet in five days eighty-eight percent that was a little lower total THC at seventy-seven but a little darker which lots of sauce very flavorful oh yeah that one's a little I want to say almost Darla key kinda sour garlicky moonshine haze fantastic [Applause] gorilla dog that's a huge one no no these oh that one smells so different like that's the it's it's just quite a spectrum and it's incredible how different the flavors can smell 83-73 so everyone knows that the higher the percentage I guess the less of the flavor and that one smacks me in the smack to me in the face with the 73% and makes sense yes this one's the last one to buy batter it's much a little bit of that one you can see it herbal like that hahaha but really good um I hope you've watched my video about the peak and its upgrades and I pretty much exclusively smoke out of the peak now which I know a lot of you guys are gonna roast me for it but hey we're gonna we're gonna do a little bit of this ghost domina blue that's the ghost domina and we're smoking on the fade space str2 unum nitride insert that's in my first video all about the upgrades of the peak and I'm gonna superheat it that's my method of superheating so much flavor again that was on blue the lowest heat setting I'm gonna begin on red or green even but yeah that's my man I guess what do you think I should try maybe some of the sour bean laughs crumble throw it in there on the second Heat we just add a little bit more flavor do it again Wow Wow al Harrington viola well done I'm in citrus paradise th citrus and there are so many flavors I could hardly pick I hope you'll enjoy it subscribe if you enjoy these", "_NCAiW3f0Y8": "what up guys it's wojie and today we're making another video for you we're going to be taking this chatter and turning it into butter for those who don't know we're going to be doing the whipping technique so stay tuned shut up pay attention and you might just learn something let's get to it [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] so [Music] [Music] what's up guys and welcome back let's check out these results so as you know we first took shatter something that looks like this yeah i don't want to crack it you can see there's other little pieces here i'll crack this piece see that how it just breaks apart yeah so we just took shatter and we went ahead and applied the whipping technique to create a butter like substance and here is the final result so we took that one ounce of shatter and we have one ounce of butter i'm definitely gonna have some close-ups and some pictures that pop up but as you can tell it's completely different all right now that i got my uh little dabber check it out i mean it is literally like a different strain it's literally like a different strain typically when you do the whipping technique what you find is it'll discolor slightly and it will become a little bit lighter in color you know and that's about really it you might also lose some uh just a little bit just because in the process of whipping it you're not only losing some of the butane and weight that's in there but also you're gonna maybe just you know get some on your hands get some on the dishes get some here and there and so you always do seem to lose just a tad bit keep that in mind but overall this whipping process is a great process for people who prefer this kind of uh this kind of uh extract you know versus a hard shatter i mean why you would want this is because it's more manageable a hard shatter will you know melt under certain conditions but this this just kind of gets wet if it's really warm in the room it doesn't really get like sticky the same way also you know shatters uh they tend to break and when you break them you can lose pieces so some people prefer this kind of goopy play-doh like extract because it allows them to handle their dabs a little easier other people they just think that this kind of dab this kind of extract smokes better and is a clearer high which may be true it may be slightly clearer because of the butane leaving it you know might be a little more refined than what it was prior and that stands to be true and i mean other people they just use this technique um you know just to get a little bit of something different so you get two ounces of ice cream cake but you rather have one of this and one of that well now you have an ounce of ice cream cake butter and an ounce of ice cream cake shatter so that's really nice it gives people that extra option of you know what they would like to choose from as far as the taste the smell and the high nothing has changed i know you guys are wondering well is does it smoke the same does it get you the same kind of high yup it's the same kind of high has the same kind of smell same aroma same high no real difference other than other than the obvious structure form you know anyways i hope you guys enjoy watching this episode i know it's a little different than most of my review episodes but yeah i like to inform you guys of things i pick up as i go and things i learn and it's not always like you know it's not always a hundred percent uh true and whatever i say isn't necessarily fact checked i'm just trying my best and i'm trying to teach you guys something that i know so i hope you guys enjoyed it and um get ready for the next video this is well g i'll be back peace", "HPeCUvEf2XA": "I have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made my opponent it's just like alright you won't turn it so I have to do it like this I got to hold it that's gonna be the video guys I hope you all enjoyed make sure to check out all the links in the description make sure to share the social media do all that [ __ ] like the video comment a subscribe do all that [ __ ] I'll see you in the next video we're just gonna be on I'll see you in the next video which is gonna be on Wednesday maybe even sooner [Music]", "7jTt35Eu8cE": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another Ursa cartridge you know I'm very very happy although I did spend a little bit more than expected because I went to fee knows and it's not authentic and authentic when they had it it was $40 but at vinos it's 55 but I really wanted a cartridge so I was like [ __ ] it I'll pay $15 extra and you see if I'm not lying right here I mean the tax is killing me it was the one it's $41 without the tax but then it was like 54 with it so yeah definitely one of the the pricier cartridges I'm actually at a park right now I'm actually gonna hit a few in the car just because you know it's easier that way and then I'm gonna walk around and hit the cartridge - just to prove that I'm in a [ __ ] park okay guys [ __ ] Park [ __ ] park brother so let's just open this thing like I mean you guys already know the deal bros like I've opened this not this one but okay okay [Music] I didn't want to [ __ ] pull out the cap you know accidentally Laureus yes dope or battery I do have my dad's mate and do not have the magnetic piece on it so I'm just gonna use the side where it's cruising cheers boys who that wasn't even a blinker right this is a blueberry muffin in oh my god that show taste a pretty [ __ ] [Music] god damn holy moly cracker mode damn [Music] this is probably the the smoothest cartridge I've hit in a while if not the best or the smoothest the taste is there everything is there like I liked when I tried the first person car it was from the homie Chiron and he had ice cream cake which is a strain I didn't really enjoy as much this one has a sweeter taste of more blueberry taste obviously it's blueberry muffins and it's actually quite pleasant what [ __ ] it was just like [ __ ] the stats let's just read this [ __ ] right here so we got THC we're coming in at seventy two point one two percent it was packaged and manufactured on the channel on January 30th 2020 Best Buy same date but 2021 one gram all that good stuff not gonna lie it [ __ ] this [ __ ] hits so what I am going to do now pocket this water you can see right here guys very nice Park it's very nice outside I was actually getting pretty [ __ ] hot in that car I'm not gonna lie I want to go over there and smoke you see that boys that little stairway [ __ ] let's go there no one there and we can take some hits on the way to boys that's the thing about cartridges you could bring that [ __ ] anywhere and take a fat hit and especially with a cart like this that hits like a [ __ ] dab rig like it's a game-changer it really is you know like I honestly can't stress that enough you know cartridges are getting better just like technology with the mores I believe it's Moore's law where technology gets better every six months and technology is in everything when it comes to vapes computer it's anything you know I'm saying like the hits aren't that fat right now what you just take off let me see if I can take you about that the camera turned off let me see if I can take a little a little fatter hit damn well yeah I wanted to do I wanted to get my own orsa you know after Chiron showed me his I was just like damn there's just no way I cannot just try this muhfuckas and not buy my own it did take some a long time I would say about a month or something but it's only because Ursa hasn't been that much available in my area and it's probably something I won't buy that much often you know because $55 for a gram cartridge I know it's a it's average in LA but in Modesto that's not average that's a above average so you know I do enjoy it though I really really do enjoy it very very tasty you get the whole terpene profile of the of the strain which is good you know I wanna take one more hit for you guys I'm probably gonna call it a video hopefully you guys enjoyed it you and also in the car you could actually see the smoke thickened out here it's very spread out it's not a really good visual representation of actually how much I'm hitting but these are fat hits don't get me wrong but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I really enjoyed hitting this to be honest and making this video it's a nice [ __ ] day outside and hopefully you're having a good day so far peace out expecting company but that's ok cos don't try to prove", "n7cP6YWO_nc": "Hey guys, Nick with Precision here and\ntoday I'm gonna teach you a brief overview on how to make every extract\nunder the sun. So what I want to start off talking about is live resin and why\nlive resin is so relevant in the market and why you guys hear this this term\nbeing thrown around rather commonly. So live resin, the entire process really,\ntakes into account harvesting the plant while it's still technically \"alive\". So\nyou're harvesting the plant, you're not drying the plant, and what you're\nactually doing is taking those flowers and putting them into a vacuum type food\nsaver device and freezing them right away. So you can imagine like harvesting\nfresh blueberries or strawberries obviously you want to pick at the peak\nof ripeness, so that you have the maximum amount of terpenes, the maximum amount of smell, flavor and all the positive attributes of that plant. And you're\nactually freezing that in time by putting it into a freezer once you put\nit into the vacuum bag. Now it's very common for some people to deep freeze\nthat could be all the way down to -40C or -80C. I would say most commonly\nit's somewhere between -10C and -40C, so once we have this\nmaterial harvested and we have it frozen in vacuum bags - ultimately what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to extract it and we're going to extract it with\nhydrocarbons. The reason that we use hydrocarbons is because it's a very\ngentle process. The process of using hydrocarbons will actually take those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes out without disturbing a lot of the other\nplant-based matrices that are in there, and our result ultimately is a extract\nthat is very, very close to the native plant. So when you smell the extract of\nthe plant that we've extracted via a live resin process what will happen is\nyou'll actually smell the original orientation of that plant, it you'll have\nthose original flavors and they'll be extremely robust, extremely profound in\nthe way that you're actually smelling and almost tasting it when you consume\nthe product. Now the best analogy is if we keep that\nfreshness preserved we eliminate the oxidation, the degradation, and all the\nthings that can kind of take that \"fresh fruit\" so to speak or that \"fresh cannabis\"\nand turn it into rotten cannabis so to speak or rotten fruit. And that's\noxidation, that's degradation from the environment that could be disruption or\ndegradation from high temperature solvents. So with live resin were always\nfocused on preserving that natural state of the plant. We're focused on freezing\nthat biomass right away, and we're focused on ultimately extracting it at\nvery cold temperatures to retain our terpenes, to extract the cannabinoids in\na very gentle fashion, and ultimately to have a highly, highly desired end product\nthat's artisanal and a vast majority of consumers enjoy in terms of theirs their\nsatisfaction of consumption as well as their ability to just actually taste and\nsmell the product once it's been on the shelf for a while. So that's just an\noverview on live resin and the next thing I'd really like to talk about and\ngive you guys an overview on is shatter. So you may have seen shatter in the\nretail dispensaries and things like that and ultimately with shatter we're trying\nto get that end product from a sort of a plant-based entrapment of those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes to a glass-like finish. So it's very common at\nroom temperature for shatter you hit it and it'll shatter almost like a piece of\nglass. To get that consistency there's certain aspects of extraction, certain\nthings that you want to deal with. Shatter first and foremost is always\nmade with hydrocarbon, and the preparation of the biomass is almost\nalways under every circumstance dried very, very, very, very well almost to a\nfive percent or lower humidity. We want to avoid a lot of that water that would\nbe pulled out with the solvent, and we ultimately want to extract that product\nat a cold temperature in order to avoid a lot of the lipids and fat profiles\nthat you might create by extracting with a warmer temperature solvent. Hydrocarbon is obviously ideal for this because not only can we extract with hydrocarbon\ncold but it's hydrophobic so that the water is going to be separated very\neasily from the hydrocarbon, but in addition to that it's going to extract\nthat cannabinoid profile and it'll extract those terpenes with leaving\nbehind,  because of the cold temperature, a lot of those fats, waxes, and other\nadulterants that we don't want in our end product. So when making shatter are\nultimately extracting the dry biomass with the cold solvent we're going to\ntake that to a finishing process which is called vacuum oven purging. So once we\nhave our shatter and we want to vacuum oven purge it, what we do is we we spread\nthis out on vacuum oven trays and we go into a very low vacuum, very deep vacuum\nwith a mild temperature increase from atmospheric. So a temperature increase\ndepending on methodologies it ranges vary widely depending an operator but it\ncould be anywhere from 75 Fahrenheit to will say 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be\na common operational range, and we're always trying to get to a very deep\nvacuum we're talking about 28-29 inches of mercury - very, very deep in terms of\nbeing able to purge out those residual solvents. So not only do we have a\nsolvent free product but purging out the residual solvents and the terpenes is\nalso going to take away some of that some of that added viscosity and\nreally get that product to the point where it's like a glass-like consistency.\nAnd we commonly call those as they're coming out of the oven \"slabs\", sometimes\nthey look like Swiss cheese, sometimes they'll they'll be you know a perfect\nslab of glass, sometimes they'll flip over. And it can vary between a\ncomplete glass-like type consistency and it can also vary to you know sort of\nlike Jolly Rancher or warm Jolly Rancher type consistency - but the good part about\nthis process is to make shatter using hydrocarbon you can generally\nstill make a very good end product on biomass that's been properly dried\nproperly preserved even though it does have maybe a little bit of degradation\nit does have a little bit of oxidation of the cannabinoids and loss of the\nterpenes it's okay because you can still make a very very credible saleable\nproduct that's widely consumed in the form of shatter. And optimizing that\nprocess as a way that you can create a lot of revenue for your\nextraction company. So the next thing that I'd like to talk about is diamonds.\nTerp sauce. There's all sorts of crazy names, \"the sauce\" -  that they coined for\nthis type of extract and really what we're after on this type of extract is\nterpene preservation. So it starts off very much like a live resin\nprocess in the fact that we're harvesting these these buds or these\nflowers in a live state, we're freezing them, and we're ultimately preserving\nthose terpenes. Because terpenes are very volatile compounds in general. Too much\nheat they evaporate and they get degraded by heat, they get degraded by processes, they\nget degraded by solvent - so we want to use a very light solvent, like a light\nhydrocarbon, and in this case mostly moving towards a propane dominant blend. Propane has a much lower boiling point which means it's much more volatile in\nterms of removing it from the end product - easier to remove from the end\nproduct is another way to word that. So ultimately extracting this\nlive resin like prepared biomass with a propane dominant or a lighter\nhydrocarbon dominant blend at low temperatures and ultimately what we end\nup with is we end up with this extract that really becomes a sort of miscella of the cannabinoids but also a very amount high amount of terpene\ncontent. And as I stated before the terpenes are quite volatile and any sort\nof heat, any sort of degradation, even just being an atmosphere for too long\ncan degrade those terpenes. So imagine this kind of cannabinoid and terpenes\nsludge coming out of the machine because we've preserved them up to that point.\nImmediately usually what's done with sauce and live resin is you're taking\nthe terpenes and generally spinning them off in a classified centrifuge. The\nreason we use the classified centrifuge is because there's still a little bit of\nsolvent in there, so we just want to be cautious, but what that ultimately does\nis it spins off the terpenes and it separates a terpene layer from the\ncannabinoid layer. You separate those two now there's a variety of different\nproduction processes that go back into this. In some cases if you're if you're\ndoing crystallization you can leave a little bit of solvent in there and you\ncan ultimately recrystallize the THC-a through a supersaturation method.\nYou can ultimately take the cannabinoids off from that terpene fraction and\ndecarboxylate the cannabinoids and then add the terpenes back in - and that's how\nyou make live resin pens. So for example you know once that decarboxylated\ncannabinoid profile is there you take your original terpenes blend them back\nin and it's going to give you the viscosity in order for the pen or the\nvape cartridge to be able to uptake and atomized that extract. And make, again\nthis is an extract that is absolutely in line with the original orientation of\nthe plant, the original smells, flavors terpenes, and the uniqueness. It's very\ncool because you have such variety within these plants and to capture the\nnative essence of that plant and to reconstitute it and to several\nconsumable forms is a massive value add for an extraction business. And if you\nlook at some of the best extraction companies in the world that do this, this\nis exactly what they do and this is exactly how they do it. So on the flip\nside of what we've spoken about here which has mainly been artisanal\ntype extracts and hydrocarbon extracts. Let's talk about crude oil, let's talk\nabout distillate, let's talk about the high-value type extracts. So crude oil is\nexactly what it sounds if you think about crude oil coming out of the ground\nin like petrochemicals or something like that.\nIt's an oil that has a lot of adulterants in it. It needs a lot of\nrefinement. It needs to go through further processes in order to be\nconsumable or in a consumable form. So what we're looking for with crude oil\non an extraction is really any type of biomass but preferred dried biomass\nlow-grade biomass that can be purchased cheap and ultimately refined into\nsomething of high value. So if we've got for example you know a thousand pounds\nof biomass sitting it's been sitting for six months, we're not going to be able to\nmake really a credible shatter product out of that, we're not going to be able\nto make a credible live resin, definitely not going to be able to make any sort of\nhigh terpene extract or anything out of that. But what we can do is we can\nmaximize the extraction of the cannabinoids out of that biomass with a generally\nwarmer solvent - of course there's ways that you can do it with a cold solvent.\nAnd this can be done with hydrocarbon or ethanol. This is where ethanol becomes\nreally applicable it becomes really easy it becomes really user friendly and\ncost-conscious. And this is where you can still use hydrocarbon but not as\nefficient of a method as ethanol for bulk crude oil. So what we actually do is\nwe take our biomass we load it in and we'll saturate it with ethanol for\na given amount of time. Ultimately we take that miscella stream is what we\ncall it which is the cannabinoids and all the other stuff that comes out of\nthe plant along with the solvent and we evaporate that solvent off. Once that\nsolvents evaporated off ultimately we have our crude oil. Now this crude oil\nhas got all sorts of chlorophyll and whatever came along with the plant and\nany sort of adulterants in there. Generally it'll have a lot of fats, waxes,\nand lipids in there that generally come out of the plant in extraction. So\nthere's a variety of refinement processes. One of the most common\nprocesses to refine is to get to distillate and that's what I'd like to\nchat about next. So let's talk about guys how that distillate actually gets made.\nNow distillate is a process that's made through distillation so quite commonly\nor to break it down in really simple terms if you're putting a pot of water\non the stove and ultimately that water is boiling and turning into vapor - \nthat's a process of distillation. That water is being distilled into the\natmosphere in the form of vapors. So that's exactly what we're trying to do\nwith the cannabinoids in the crude oil. We're actually trying to take those\ncannabinoids, we're trying to vaporize them, and ultimately we're going to\nrecollect them in a more concentrated form. But before we can distill there's\nseveral other things we need to do. We need to make sure that there's no\nadulterants in that distillate or in that crude oil that are going to inhibit\nmaking the distillate. So those things can be waxes, they can be chlorophylls,\nthey can be fats, lipids, all sorts of weird stuff that can come over in a very\nrough crude extraction. The way that we refine that is we commonly\nuse winterization processes, we also commonly use fine filtration, there's\nguys that use what are called adsorbent - which could be diatomaceous earth or\nactivated carbons in order to clean up some of these undesirables from this\ncrude oil in order to make it into distillate. But ultimately once it's\npassed through a distillation process it's normally used a what's called a\nfractional distillation, or a wiped film distillation process when you're at\nscale. We're taking those cannabinoids and we're evaporating them and we're re-concentrating them. So what happens is we take this very, very poor quality\nbiomass, turn it into a really rough crude oil, but ultimately extract the\nwe'll call it \"the goodies\" - but the cannabinoids out of that crude oil and\nconcentrate them in a very refined format. That can be remixed in and\nreconstituted into several different products. This process is awesome because it can literally take any grade of biomass and turn it into a shelf-stable,\nreplicatable, scalable, repeatable product that has a consistency across the board\nfor end-users expectations. For example, you get Pepsi every time it tastes like\nPepsi every time you don't want it to taste like Coke one time or taste like\nyou know RC Cola the next time. You want consistency and a repeatable fashion for\nwhich to make your product. So last product that I want to talk about is\nisolates and isolates are made from actually in almost all cases distillate.\nSo we're taking this crude oil remember as we spoke about with distillate,\nrefining it into a distilled product. So we have this distilled product and the\npotency of that can be anywhere from say a little very low-end 75 percent on the very high-end 95 percent - but it's not 100% pure. And what\nwe're gonna do with that distillate is we're actually going to go through a\nsecondary refinement process called crystallization, isolation of\nthese individual cannabinoids. So each one of these cannabinoids has a\nmolecular structure and based upon what that molecular structure looks like we\ncan come up with ideal ways to actually crystallize and crash out of solution\nthese individual molecules. This is a very common process in chemistry. It's\nused very widely and it's ultimately how CBD isolate is made, it's ultimately how\nTHCA diamonds are made, it's a process of crystallization. So how we do that is\nwe use a selective solvent the selective solvent most often used is hydrocarbon.\nVery often it's either butane or pentane in order to make these isolates.\nAnd what happens is you actually take your distillate and you mix it into\neither the pentane or the butane if it's THCA depending on what you're trying to\ndo and you have your distillate or your fine cannabinoids back in matrices at\nthat point it's back in that now that miscella of hydrocarbon and\ncannabinoids. And what happens is over time and over a temperature ramp spike\ncurve and over a slow period of time these cannabinoids will start\nto actually crystallize. And they'll form one little crystal and it will grow upon\nitself. As we reduce the saturation of the solvent they actually fall out of\nsolution. So what will happen is you'll almost see like rock candy or crystal-like formation growing. Once those crystals are fully formed they can be\nharvested and once you optimize this process you actually have nearly 100%\npurity on any given compound. Now there can be adulterants you know that gets\nstuck on the crystals that need to be washed off but in ideal state this is\nsomething that you can refine up to say a good benchmark is 99 to 99.5 percent\nif you're a really good chemist you can get it up close to 99.7 to 99.9. This is where that last little bits very, very\nhard to get, but there is ways to do that. So if we look at you know the the world\nof cannabinoids in conclusion. There's several different ways to make extracts.\nThere's a lot of different ways to make very, very viable market products. There's\na lot of ways to drive revenue in your extraction business with these products.\nUnderstanding this knowledge base and understanding how you're going to occupy\neach one of these market niches, what access to biomass you have, what\ndiversity and methodology do you have in order to create these products and\nultimately drive diversity and revenue in your in your business. And then really\ntaking that to the next step and taking the next level of understanding of how\nto create these products. That's something that we do here all day long\nat Precision. We absolutely understand all these processes very intimately. We\nhave a very robust team of install / integrators that\noptimize these processes, so again not just selling you the pieces of equipment\nbut actually coming out training you on these processes, sitting there with the\npieces of equipment with you in order to get these processes integrated until\nyour business is up and running and on legs.\nSo in conclusion, a tremendous opportunity ,I hope

musicians uh that is our guest today charles patalino we're gonna hear from another musician right now uh from the artist my dead dog this is the weed song and then we'll talk music and weed with charles after that [Music] so let's go smoke some grass it's time to bust out this [Music] i always love talking uh with artists on this show artists of of any kind and you know not specifically always people in the cannabis industry but people that kind of use cannabis for their industry and really happy to welcome charles to the show from uh sea of carls charles panalino and first of all charles i guess how long have you been producing music what kind of genre do you guys uh have for the sea of cars um so as far as producing and writing uh sea cars actually only started a little more than five years ago um our first show was actually on my mom's birthday um in december uh happy birthday mom uh and it just kind of started as a solo project it was just something i was doing in a small studio that me and my dad had in in our house and um after writing our first ep and working on it um took it somewhere really recorded at a studio um and after that i i just really felt you know i wanted i want to start playing this is something i think i really want to do um and recruited my drummer and ever since uh the rest is history about yes about five years have been uh write music history cars nice all right so tell us a little bit about the genre who's in the band uh give us the details on that um very small uh outfit we're only a two piece we did originally start as a three um but unfortunately our bass player at the time he just had a lot of personal things going on and felt you know he needed to step away um so i didn't let that hinder us we just pretty much ever since continued as a two-piece um i would like to have a bass player but you know i'm not beat up by it because um kind of adding to what our genre is because of what i view our genre as i use my guitar tones and i build my tones around that to kind of compensate for that heavy bass i give my my guitar a little bit more of a bassy tone um so we kind of go along the lines of a like uh ambient um experimental post punk is what i like to say um but you know dean er genre is such a big thing at this point i feel like it's so hard to pinpoint and anytime someone comes up to me and asks i just like internally i feel bad to myself for picking jobs because i mean i just we're so much stuff that and that's why i put the experimental tag because i just i don't like to stick to one thing i like to because i like all different genres and i like to put that in the music to show that i listen to hey not just maybe you know punk music or indie music or alternative stoner rock or something like that and yeah so ultimately i'd say we're kind of just atmospheric experimental music all right i like it people can find the website as if they're watching you can see it seafcars.bandcamp.com and where else can they find your music um we are man pretty much on any any streaming service you can think of we got spotify we're up there on apple deezer pandora i literally i think uh the company we go through they just uh they get your stuff out on i think it's like 50 like 45 50 plus things so i'm sure you could type it in and it'll just pull up everything excellent all right let's talk a little bit about uh cannabis now uh you know we're gonna discuss more about music but let's talk a little bit about cannabis and you know when did cannabis become part of your personal life and why ah so as far as personal life uh about the age of 21 i met a group younger and uh they they were big users of cannabis so ever since then pretty much uh end of the line i've been a user ever since nine years all right let's talk a little bit about cannabis and music now do you have any rituals um when you're writing music that maybe involve cannabis or or any kind of uh combination for you and with cannabis and music yeah of course i mean pretty much almost any time um i go to sit down um and play on my guitar more so for the purpose of um creating music for sea of cards yeah i usually try to to smoke a little bit just because it usually will help um and i find with the sativas it's it really helps a lot um and even when if i just want to sit down and like play my drums and and goof off i'll i'll do but yeah definitely it helps me to to smoke and to really get into that creative niche most of the time do you have any kind of go-to crea cultivars that that you really feel help with uh creativity or do you kind of try to mix it up a little bit so maybe you don't are always depending on the one thing because you know the great thing about the the the plant is that we all react a little bit differently to it so what might uh stimulate creativity for me might not for you of course yeah they have that endocannabinoid system um you know i i found a strain recently from my dispensary called mr clean um and that has just i bought two eighths of it and i'm still and i i mean i bought it probably about like two and a half three months ago almost and i'm still sitting on about three grams a little less of it because i enjoy it so much that i don't want to use it right away because i want to use it for when i'm creative um so yeah mr clean has been a good one for me lately uh what about writing have you written any songs specifically about cannabis not yet um and i actually had an idea a while back when i was going to school and a buddy and i my uh mine we were smoking in my car and those little tree air fresheners that are in cars uh we kind of looked at that and we were smoking and we were we're looking at that and we're like you know we could kind of he's like you could make a little song you know about like the two of these kind of mixed together you could call it little trees so i have that actually as a note in my phone on so who knows that might that might turn into something i might do i might reference it on this next album because we're actually in the process of writing for our next album so maybe i'll throw that in there that's good seafcars.bandcamp.com what music uh and and this is probably a bit of a kind of an open-ended question but what music do you think goes well with cannabis and and try not to say every music but maybe give me something right specific uh maybe bands or something that you really think uh go well or songs for that matter um you know i'm gonna i'm gonna rep them again because i think i had said something about them in in one hitters but this uh shirt i'm actually wearing wilco they are a chicago band they've been around for for years though at this point um they're older than i am a lot older um but their music is just some of the most like laid-back just happy feeling upbeat and i i just i actually have a role in my car whenever i hear wilco come on shuffle i have to smoke because i just i just think they're the perfect band to smoke too um but yeah other than that i feel like i love metal music i used to play even in a mel band and all we did was smoke so um metal music for sure too yeah i enjoy it that's a good game to play with wilco provided you're not you're not the driver and yeah right pulling over a lot to uh to wait for the effect yeah exactly uh speaking of uh illinois and chicago in the area that you're in they legalized medical marijuana in 2013 and recreational use uh became able for you guys just this last year what has it been like sin since illinois is legalized um uh it's it seems it seems like they're doing pretty well here um i mean the dispensaries i go to everybody is always super informational super helpful um they've actually been talking with me about getting my medical card uh because i'm actually trying to get in you know the process of that going and um you know it's the recreational it seems a little laggy still compared to medical just because um like you said we're pretty fresh into it here um so we haven't reached that point where we're hanging out like denver or seattle and we got these nice you know let me go buy a half an ounce of shake for 20 bucks and some tax um we're still paying like you know 55 to 65 an eighth depending on you know your strain and the thc content that's in it but um i mean it's it's seems like it's just going up and up though i mean i see more and more people every time i go to a dispensary here um i mean i myself just recently i i mean i've gone here and there to our dispensaries and but you know this this is the way they got to do it and um you know this is going to help the bad and sometimes shady things that happen in the black market and that's kind of why i switched to going to the dispensary i figured i'd rather pay a little more and know what i'm getting than to go and buy the stuff that you know you might ask them hey what what is this an indica or sativa even and they don't even know that you know um and i think it's going to be these dispensaries really obviously being able to provide the information that's going to draw people away from the black market and it's only going to make um you know recreational and medical weed more prominent and grow no pun intended exactly well there's 86 episodes of education for them right here on the cannabis 101 podcast and that's what we try to provide for a lot of people i mean i mean i remember when legalized legalization happened in canada the lineups were so long uh there was one store in the city that i lived in and the lineups were crazy long was it was it like that in the beginning or has it kind of been like a slow rollout you know from what i've seen here in chicago it was pretty i think everybody was just at this point ready for it because i mean chicago's a you know top three sorry my cat um distracting me um the people were ready i mean we're one of the top three cities pretty much in in you know america here you got california with los angeles you know then new york new york and then it's chicago pretty much and you know i feel chicagoans were just they were at that point where they're like okay come on you know why did we we're we're eating past all these other states who have legalized already and you know we're chicago we haven't done so when it first rolled out here people were they were lined it was definitely not slow it was we were ready for here in chicago for that but that is good uh chicago's uh you know one of the best sports cities out there and i'm you know a lot of shows that i do are about sports and definitely on my bucket list to go to and now that there is legalization i will uh get to chicago at some point have you looked at working in the industry at all is this something that you know obviously you have a passion about music and cannabis do you think you'll look into working and i wonder you know how is the the job creation going do you think uh definitely i actually started looking not too long ago um and i've been applying for some um positions i did actually get two emails about positions but unfortunately just because i've recently become a father in the last year and um you know just other personal um things that are mixed into mine in my fiance's life it's just hard for me to get and get into certain schedules so unfortunately i just couldn't work the times that they were looking for which unfortunately they didn't list that within their listings so i didn't know what they were looking for exactly um but yeah i've been looking i would i would love to even if it's just as a picker so you know trimmer to bud tender i just i would love to work with cannabis at all but um i mean every time i look uh more and more positions it seems like it's just getting bigger here in illinois and we got a lot of space out here uh in fields especially down south so it seems to be where most of cultivation is done and that's kind of the other problem i'm towards pretty much the actual city of chicago and all that it's like two hours away so it it's going to be a bit difficult but if i can i would love to i'd love to welcome congratulations on becoming a father and you know family comes first and then uh work on things as you go up you kind of mentioned uh some of the cool cultivars that you've been been able to find when you go into those dispensaries i know the education is is going to get there and that takes time but you know what is the selection and then the quality like selection is actually pretty good um and not that i it would have really any correlation but for like the prices of what um you know you pay out here i i didn't imagine there would be such a big selection but um right to the left of me i actually have a a huge just stock because recently with um you know i got my tax refund so i decided to treat myself and um i've actually recently just been trying a lot of um like staple cultivars that most people you know go bonkers for i i got maui wowie here pineapple express actually and i feel like that when i told a couple of my friends they were shocked they're like you never tried pineapple express before i said no i just never had the chance to get it and you know i got i gotta say dopest dope i've ever smoked um but yeah they got definitely a huge huge selection out here very i love maui maui is uh is definitely one of my favorite uh you know blue dream is my jam but maui when i can find it uh i grab it whenever i can um well you know what about other areas in your life we talk about creativity and and helping with music is cannabis do you do you use it for any other parts of your life definitely uh you know almost almost every single part to be honest uh you know i it was about a year ago maybe maybe two that i've i started personally viewing it as medicine um and not just that you know drug that oh yo they're gonna smoke weed you know let's just smoke weed everybody let's get high um because and honestly uh your your podcast dean was a big a big push into that because i really when i heard your slogan for the first time it really it really hit home uh because it's not just about really getting high it is about getting healthy because you know this this plant has all these um components to it and all these properties that really are helpful and you know it's unfortunate to see what it was like for cannabis through time up until this point but it's great that people are coming around yeah because i use it for mental illness even um you know i struggle and i know from listening to your show you know you're no stranger to that world and um you know people need to not be worried or that's stupid pretty much what you guys talk about time the stigma needs to be gone got to get rid of that stigma um yeah i use it for everything yeah and it's important to to make sure people know that you know it i i don't smoke a joint and all of a sudden my depression is gone you know it's not it's not a cure-all for things it can help with a number of things you know but you know for people that that do have mental health issues you know do not just substitute do not stop taking your prescription medications do not stop going to therapy it can help with those things i go to therapy you know i i use other supplements that i use so important to know that it can help it's not a cure-all but it can be a big benefactor uh you know in you know as you know and as i know all right i want to ask you a couple more music questions before we wrap up who's a musician and combined with cannabis that you look up to is there is there somebody out there that that is kind of like a cannabis musician idol honestly kind of going back to um the story from my one-hitters uh that that that vocalist and guitarist that i had smoked with the one time they pretty much since the time that i i really even before i i smoked cannabis and i listened to them i knew they were partakers and um yeah yeah but it would it would really have to it would have to be uh that vocalist trevor stranada is his name from the black value murder i look up to him very much so we got a nice shot of um you guys jamming out here tell me how you came up with the name sea of cars oh man you're gonna be tired of hearing about this i actually got it from the band wilco um shout out to them um they have a song called in a future age off of an album called summer teeth and in that song um he says hi above the sea of cars and i just i'd i just it really resonated with me for some reason and i sometimes people kind of get a chuckle out of it because i'll tell them the name and they they don't they don't hear it correctly so i have to i usually then will have to use the example like oh you know how you're driving by a big parking lot and you're like wow look at that sea of cars and then they get it on but yeah that's i i took it from a wilco uh where because i love them and i just really liked it just sounded different nice tribute as well people can find uh sea of cars.bandcamp.com and listen to your music as well as all streaming platforms all right let's wrap up with this i always love to ask every one of my guests because it's an opinion and opinions can't be wrong what do you think is the next big thing in cannabis now you know here in canada you know we have a lot of things going on you guys are just dipping your toes in it uh in in a lot of different states you know you know i think there's only about 14 states uh that don't have some form of legalization in the united states but in your opinion what do you think will be the next big thing in cannabis uh you know hopefully we can take a page out of canada's book really and i i feel like i feel like them trying to do it locally and through state was not the best idea um but i mean what are you gonna do uh so i feel like the next biggest thing they can really do is just you know talk sit down get on a federal level like you guys are and i i feel like that's what's really gonna gonna be what helps america really get that okay everybody get behind cannabis like we need to do this so hopefully we could see that here but again like you said there's not a lot of states there's some that are lagging and i feel like it's going to be a long time for america to get there you know it's but it's interesting we talked on hour one with david wiley from uh the oz on this week in cannabis news is very quickly the united states is going to be sandwiched between two federally legalized countries we're already legal mexico is uh rolling it out and and they're they're going to legal be legal soon you look at countries in europe that are going to get the ball rolling you know it's just it's just putting more and more pressure on the united states to realize this is a plant and it's not it shouldn't be in the same schedule as heroin so the pressure's mounting and it's gonna happen yeah it's it's just ridiculous to see how how how wrong cannabis has done here in america and and how we have to be so pretty much self-centered on our own opinion of everything you know no offense to america but i mean that's essentially what you're doing when you're you know you have all these you know countries doing everything pretty much universally and you're just gonna be the odd man out like it's not how you make friends that's not how you have a good time uh playground etiquette playground etiquette hey exactly there you go yeah playground all right this has been a lot of fun my man uh i really enjoy getting to know you i appreciate the uh the the love that you uh give us on social media and the education that we've been able to give you that's the goal of this show is to educate

ianson our educator on know your buds how are things tonight my man uh things are going really good buddy it's uh it's been a pretty sweet day so far uh yeah i'm pumped to get this one going with you yeah i'm i'm excited about uh this one as well um you know i i ran into and and was able to meet uh the woman behind this company uh pre-covered when we were actually allowed to uh get out and celebrate and do some different things so excited about this one for sure we are doing blue topaz which is hurricane nine and it is an 80 to 20 indica and these are pre-rolls uh right here beautiful from the queen of bud so let's talk about queen of bud because this is a company uh that has been you know really really growing quite quickly and effectively haven't they chris yeah totally dean um they started up pretty much at legalization there october uh 2018 the founder ashley newman uh the queen herself uh started the brand off with uh with a retail shop in calgary alberta and it was a really kind of high-end shop really um really fancy looking all the decor all the you know displays in the store just had a really kind of fancy uh real pretty vibe to it uh yeah there you can see it there just just gorgeous uh and and the store there in calgary was a big hit uh big success and they went on to open up a second location in toronto uh ontario and uh with that the kind of retail brand was rolling and um she also had quite a quite a large uh social media uh following uh you know currently she has over 82 000 followers on her instagram so uh just a big presence on social media there uh and she kind of realized she wanted to make a more distinct role in the cannabis industry and a partnership was formed between the queen of bud and uh the kanjuri cannabis facility uh and they started growing queen of bud cannabis and uh so now we're seeing uh pre-rolls and eighths uh from them and it's uh it's awesome yeah this uh uh when we get to my experience and and your experience you'll find out how the uh the first pre-roll went for me last night and wouldn't you believe it my lighter has uh conked out in this one so anyway i'm gonna grab a lighter will you tell us a little bit about meeting ashley newman because she is a force when i met her i was at a alberta cannabis council event in calgary and she just kind of really captivated the room people kind of wanted to get in and talk to her and find out what she was thinking and things like that and she just kind of seems to be able to draw the room to her and you know really has some bright ideas i really enjoyed the conversation with her and some of her staff members yeah yeah totally dino uh i think that's that's well said about the the energy she's got a great energy to her uh and you know people want to uh you know be around her um for sure so i ended up running into her in a couple different plant life stores she was up here in edmonton uh checking in on some retail shops and uh had the pleasure to meet her with uh with uh plantlife's own vanessa brown there they were touring around together and uh i mean just uh very positive uh very intelligent very grateful too uh just super happy to to be in the cannabis space and and happy to be uh you know doing what she's doing um so it was very very awesome to um yeah get get to know her as well uh a wonder wonderful wonderful person uh hopefully we can get her on the on the podcast here uh later on dino that would be i think uh pretty awesome um and uh i've got a i've got a quote from her website here uh and it states uh you know ashley newman is a passionate entrepreneur and mother having worked in many different industries from construction to marketing and retail ashley was elated to finally end up in cannabis her devotion to cannabis began when she was looking for a natural alternative method to live her best life since then cannabis has been a major part of ashley's life and she hopes to break the stigma surrounding the use of the plant and educate consumers on the cannabis category as a whole so just truly awesome there i am 100 down with that message there um that whole stigma with cannabis is such a big thing for me um so i think yeah it's super important to be breaking that and uh yeah it's uh just a tremendous story uh with the queen of bud here yeah real uh becoming a real force in the uh the cannabis industry so let's talk about you know i love the transition from retail to growing let's talk about the facility that they are growing this wonderful bud at oh yes it's uh it's the kangaroo cannabis facility and it's uh it's located at the base of the rocky mountains in uh sundry alberta so just near olds there uh and the name of the facility the facility is called calyptra and it's a it's a state-of-the-art facility it's over 43 000 square feet they've got 12 different isolated roll rooms equipped with advanced control technology um i've been told i may be getting a tour of this facility in the near future so i'm super excited to uh go down there and check it out uh there's definitely some uh some really cool uh brands that we see in the wreck market that are being grown at this kandra facility as well uh joy botanicals rgb uh as well as violet tourists uh they're all coming out of kandra as well so a lot of a lot of fires coming out of that facility down south yeah and i i love we're gonna get into the uh the website here and um i love how they show you exactly what they are doing um and and the uh the work that they're doing um they they tell you exactly what is going on and uh as as i've often said and we've often talked about transparency transparency is so important in this industry because of that stigma so i dig the website queen of bud cannabis dot ca we showed that retail website uh earlier it was really really impressive but i like what they have going on at their uh their growing website yeah absolutely all the information um all the photos all the stages i think that's just great to have um and if you feel like the the websites are also aesthetically pleasing real easy on the eyes um but yeah all that information that's just that's great that's what we want to see on on everybody's website in my opinion i'm uh with you on that one okay let's talk a little bit about the history of this cultivar um you know we're blue topaz uh the uh the the previous names hurricane nine so tell us a little bit about the uh the lineage and and who created this yeah for sure do you know so it's uh hurricane the original hurricane descends from uh uh docido uh crossed with a purple punch and so dosie dough is uh kind of a classic uh super popular cultivar that's out there right now and it's an og kush breath uh crossed with the face off og bx1 and uh it's kind of kind of known for its like uh real kind of fruity fruity flavor uh and floralness to it uh and purple punch is the other uh parent there and that's a larry og crossed with the granddaddy purple one of my favorites one of my go-to's i just love the purples for sure purple punch is also one of my favorites uh it's it's right up there with granddaddy purpose as well um and it was created by the american breeders in-house genetics and uh and the slower k9 that um the queen of bud has as their cultivar is a combination of the phenotypes uh hurricane number 44 and hurricane number seven so uh when when in-house genetics were creating this hurricane uh clearly they had at least 44 uh different phenoes of it probably you know definitely more than that uh and you know those two kind of paired together just gave this really nice 80 80 20 ratio indica dominant hybrid that's super tasty it's so it certainly is i i i loved slurricane the first time i had it i'm so glad to be able to find something uh once again it's like my guest this week charles from chicago uh you know he loves the bruce banner and we you and i were so excited when we saw uh that uh that bruce come into the legal market as well so i'm really really excited about this and you know when we talk about the thc level this is at 15.4 percent i don't know if you heard that just now but that was a lot of people scoffing at how low the thc is and professor chris my educator is here to explain why it's not all about thc oh totally this is not the end-all be-all in cannabis for sure uh now now this uh this slur came from queen about it's it's i think their lowest thc offering to the market i mean they've got some like 26 percent uh garlic kush pre-rolls and uh and they're they're california's at 25 and and those are great uh i'm also a big big fan of this 15 now there's more to it uh we got to talk about you know the entourage effect um when we talk about cannabis so that's you know your cannabinoids your thc your cbd as well as your terpenes and uh i think for me just on on my own personal level uh i feel like the terpenes that are in purple punch and are in sluricane work well with my ecs my endocannabinoid system it just reacts really well and it's become one of my one of my go-to's for sure um yeah so a lot of people uh will scoff you know maybe make a recommendation in store and say you know you're looking for something heavy uh in the evening time you know try out the circuit oh buddy it's it's 15 that's not enough for me we hear that a lot um you know i wish those people just give it a shot because it's uh it's heavy and it's nice i'm with you man uh i am totally with you on that one and uh when you go back to their website you can find out a little bit more information about the uh the different cultivars they have and the blue topaz that we're doing now so you nailed it on the entourage effect and it's not all about thc as i've said many times you would not buy your wine probably based on alcohol percentage so look for other things when it comes to thc now i love this segment what's in a name because people can be really creative so tell us a little bit about some of the names with uh the cultivar and the lp yeah for sure so uh we'll start with uh queen of bud uh and you know they got their name from their founder ashley newman um i think it's great you know she kind of stepped up early in the game uh you know she's the queen and uh and she's kind of taking that that role in that throne um all of queen of bud cultivars they're named after crystals and uh and kind of with the crystals uh the effects with the crystals kind of have to do with what the the cannabis effects should be so uh the queen of blood marketing says with the blue topaz is that it's uh it's the crystal that unlocks direct access to your inner inner wisdom empowering us to make positive decisions and reveal our inner truths and gain the ability to forgive and move on helping us become our most authentic selves so that's kind of the blue topaz there i mean uh i i i think that's great uh it is super uh reflective i i i definitely think when i consume it um and the uh this hurricane name uh you know has to do with it hitting you like a hurricane um there's also a boozy term uh for for someone that's drank a hurricane beverage which is got i think bacardi 151 in it i think i had one in vegas a while ago um and and becoming a slurricane and slurring their words so uh there's just a take on that kind of it it hit you really hard uh so yeah the uh the slurrican name there for sure it does hit hard and every time i i have this i just have the dylan hurricane song running through about the denzel movie uh about the boxer who went to jail so man it's it's amazing the things that we associate it when we hear but it definitely hits hard as we will get to in the experience but let's talk about the look uh first of all the packaging uh comes in a a box as well and then uh just the uh the doob tube there holds two of the half grammers probably doesn't need a box but with all the labeling requirements i understand uh there are commitments that the lps have to make and hopefully in time all we're getting is just the tube with this but um pretty good uh the the roll job on this one phenomenal chris uh you know i think that this is one of the the tighter uh joints that i've had sometimes you get those ones that kind of bend at the the filter nothing like that for this one yeah no for sure uh they're they're all tight uh i feel like in in since queen and buds hit the market i've probably acquired smoked over 30 let's say 30 of their pre-rolls and they've all been good and they all haven't ran and they've all been a super good quality smoke so i feel like uh they definitely kind of uh you know took their time in deciding the route of going with like how to to get their pre-rolls and they picked the right option there because uh all the queen of blood pre-rolls that i've had have been amazing so uh kudos to the the queen of budden and their crew out there at uh at the cadre facility now uh what about the uh the the butt itself uh not in pre-roll form i know that you've uh got a peek at some of this totally yes uh i i've absolutely i've checked out uh the queen of bud uh this hurricane does come into 3.5 uh just couldn't track any down um it is a really nice looking bud though uh caked in crystals is kind of the first thing that comes to mind when you see it and the nugs are are a darker green with like some purple flecks in them but uh just the layer of crystals that kind of covers the butt is kind of what makes it so intense uh and attractive that's awesome and you know with something you know you mentioned earlier about i know i i know how big of a fan you are of gdp and uh the fact that there's purple punch i can only imagine what the colors must look like yeah absolutely there's uh for sure uh some good some good amounts of purple in there it's uh it's really nice and something to see all right let's uh go through the terpene list what are we looking at with this for sure so the dominant terpene in uh in this hurricane here is uh limonene is number one and that's kind of a citrus and fruity uh aroma and flavor uh periophylline is is number two and that's uh that's dino's favorite that's uh black pepper and kind of a spicy uh terpene uh and then we have mercy uh taking it up number three there and that's kind of a an earthier uh terpene it's also found in mangoes though uh but yeah those are kind of three common ones we we see quite a bit in our talks here so uh three of the more popular ones for sure yeah mercy and probably one of the most popular terpenes in every uh cannabis it seems to be uh in so many different cultivars now when we talk about the smell uh i always like to give nosy mcgee my wife trish the uh the first sniff when i open it and she went immediately to citrus the next sniff i get i went immediately to pepper and i wonder if we sometimes you know we recognize the ones we like so much more because i seem to be able to pick out the pepper smelling so much so we just decided that this smells like lemon pepper wings but what did you get for smell uh for me it was uh i i got a sweetness uh it's almost like a candy like for me i i definitely get notes of pepper though off the initial whiff uh for sure which is uh very noticeable so it's kind of like sweet pepper uh for me the sweetness i get in the taste um definitely what's uh what was your reaction when you taste this so for me it's it's like a sweet berry fruit uh with some spice on the inhale um and there's some nice kind of grape flavor notes to it um a little bit of vanilla in there and then uh kind of an earthy uh exhale coming out uh but super enjoyable also super smooth i find these pre-rolls are are kind of tasty down to the filter which is uh you know bonus points yeah indeed it is tasty man and it is smooth um i get i get some of the earthy taste as well um and uh definitely i get the uh the sweetness though uh kind of right off the top of it so uh it's enjoyable and that's the the main thing and then when it comes to the the effects and we should point out everybody is different when it comes to cannabis you talked about the endocannabinoid system so we all react differently but i can tell you my experience on this before i get to yours it knocked me out man i was i had one of these the first one last night and i was uh you know within like 25 minutes ready for bed it relaxed me i had a really good sleep although i do use some indica thc spray before i go to bed but man this really really uh you know kind of just got me and i was busy yesterday i was working right up until i almost went to bed had this relaxed usually after staring at a computer or something like that and talking for so much you're kind of wired this really really brought me to a relaxing situation so that's my experience what about yours chris yeah you know mine was kind of similar uh very very chill for me uh very introspective hi um i found it got a lot of thinking done uh you know just like sitting on the couch watching uh watching some netflix and just uh i would kind of like stop watching the show and just kind of get lost in my thoughts a little bit on you know whatever i was thinking about uh it's very uplifting and euphoric for me i think that's why i like it so much it just makes me smile a lot puts me in a really good mood um and i think i you know get pretty lazy so uh it's not really one to you know start a productive day if you've got stuff to do maybe you know plan to hit this hurricane uh after you've completed your list um i learned that the hard way and uh yeah definitely sedative i i find like it's it's couch lock city for me uh it's you know tough to move i i find the struggle of like maybe i'll go in a couple minutes i'll you know i'll just i'm so comfortable right now um and uh definitely a lot a lot of munchies associated with this one too i i definitely uh hit the fridge a couple times when i hit it yeah you know what i think this is going to be perfect for uh when i go camping or this you know this summer we've rented a cabin to go somewhere i'd like to have one day where i just sit around and sit in the campsite maybe do some reading listen to music just chill out around this is what that would be it's just you're in chilling out in nature you're you don't have any really thing to do so you can just relax maybe sit in a hammock for a while i'm definitely going to be picking up uh some of this blue topaz for that but what do you think the three w's are who what and when is this good for chris yeah you know so uh who it's good for i think uh you know we're talking that that intermediate that level two plus and up uh it's definitely um you know it's pretty hard it's it's pretty um relaxing there i mean we're not looking at the highest thc levels there um but uh i just think that uh someone new to cannabis uh you don't want to jump in with this hurricane right off the hall and that's a really good point that goes back to your earlier uh discussion about thc this is one that we would probably say punches above its weight it's 15 but it might rock you like some 26 is out there because of that entourage effect because of the terpenes because of the the quality so you might you might be looking at us saying hey it's only 15 why is that level 2 plus because of everything that goes with cannabis so i think that's a really good distinction to make yeah for sure buddy it's uh yeah it does not feel like a 15 percenter um what it's good for uh hitting the couch right after dinner that was i love uh this pre-roll for that for sure uh it's great for movies tv shows uh i've been watching a little bit of blown away on netflix i think i actually just finished it um it's all about blowing glass it's a like a reality uh series and it's not a lot of like bonds really actually at all on the show but man the uh the stuff they do uh i i had no idea and uh i think maybe the canvas made that a bit more enjoyable too um i think it's also good for like uh once things clear up with kobe i think being like social with pals in kind of a chill way uh i've got some homies that i uh used to see on the regular uh you know once a week where we just go and hang out in the backyard uh you know burn a couple doobies i think this would be great for that just to like really just chill uh but you know uh nothing too too heavy um i've also found it good for uh for graphic work too uh kind of worked out worked out for me too in a in a real kind of chill vibe so um big big fan of uh of the slurricane and uh and when it's good for dino i uh like i think any time of day um you know you can start you can start it off your day with it just be prepared to have a very relaxed day which i've done um i think mostly though evening time is kind of the best for me uh right after a meal too is a real nice treat kind of sounds like a good campfire cultivar man like a really good cultivar to sit around maybe everybody gets their own joint and you're gonna just have a chill conversation with some cool music in the background so i can't wait to uh bring this out with my friends when i'm allowed to get back and chill out with our friends again and i know you guys are excited at plant life i was talking with gage the other day he's like a kid in a candy store because you guys have a new store in albany that is very close to being opening yes it's uh it's going to be opening up next week uh yeah in albany there in the north uh north edmonton uh we're all super pumped the store uh is already kind of coming together starting to look great uh going to be there the day before it opens kind of getting those final touches so i'm excited to get in there and get my display uh you know my merch and display game on uh really make the store look pretty uh we're gonna have some crazy crazy door crasher deals too uh you know i can't really get into too much of the specifics but uh it's it's pretty stupid i feel like people aren't going to want to miss it um and actually speaking of the deals there uh we got that mold of march madness so currently uh until the remainder of march um the 2.5 milligram uh balanced uh micro dose molos uh the non-alcoholic beer uh they're on special plant life too it's also a really nice deal as well so um for anyone looking to like uh try beverage out i think that's kind of the perfect way to dip your toe in the water just to see uh it's only uh you know small amounts of uh cash so it's it's great so yeah uh come on down to the plant life

lemon cheese another bowl for me please [Music] marijuana [Music] i [Applause] [Music] my name is", "Iw431iUlq9k": "[Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplisik here back with another video like i promised i was going to do a video on ash rosin versus live rosin honestly i didn't know the difference i thought the two terms meant the same thing but i was dead wrong and i'd like to thank honey butter rosin once again for providing these rosins for me to make a video on don't ever think that your voice does not matter if you feel like you've been wronged by a dispensary or a brand you know what i'm saying like make a video because chances are that company are it's looking through youtube you know they're looking at their they're looking at their products through youtube seeing who's buying their products and i'm sure they're gonna come along your video and if you do you know feel like you've been wronged by the dispensary you know stuff like this could happen to you you know they could contact you and they could give you some free stuff you know like like i said honey butter it was never their fault for me buying one year old wax but they made it right even though they didn't have to and forever i am grateful for that you know shout out to rg handlers cannabis underscore footprints just [ __ ] uh really really dope company you know for them to just give back like that and like i'm not like here's the thing why i truly respect them i in that video did not say anything bad towards them i know that their product is great i believe p2 peeps shout out to p2 peeps but just the fact that they reached out to me and i mentioned in my other browsing video but i have to mention it again because it's [ __ ] important and i really for a company to go above and beyond to make sure that their customer is satisfied you know what i'm saying like i really just [ __ ] with that you know and you know i don't know i don't know what to say i it's just affordable rosin in itself is already uh like a company that really cares you know because brazil nowadays you're gonna get to your 7 10 labs and it's [ __ ] like a hundred dollars for a gram and it's like oh okay well there are other options there are other alternatives to get live rosin you know i have the classics i have the honey butter rosin you know 710 lens is not the end all be all they are probably the first ones to really popularize live rosin and ash rosin but you know there's there's other options you know you don't really have to break your wallet or break the bank just to get some dab you know what i'm saying but i digress i will film these but oh let's just show what you get i got so i did pick at these for a bit so i did try to save as much as i can for this video but let's just go right here from the left i mean from your left this is the lemon lava and this one is the jagua this one being the hash rosin this one being the live rosin as you can see um let me just go on my phone real quick sorry guys so we're gonna be taking the uh hits off the dip but let me show you guys what we're working with first okay so right here is the live rosin jagu get a close-up of that really really nice consistency and then this is the percentage of the live rosin and then we're going to move on to the hatch rosin which kind of looks similar i mean this one's a little bit lighter and if i had to be honest this one smells really really it's just smells stronger but this one tastes stronger if that makes sense then we got the full spectrum hash rosin so these are the percentages right here and then you can just go maybe a nice little thumbnail for the picture you know you to be loving them pictures all right so now that you've seen what we're working with we are going to be taking hits out of the dip vapor just get that right here so uh with rosin's i tend to leave it on a higher setting than i usually do i usually run it on green but we're gonna go up a a step to purple pink i don't know what it is but yes let me take a hit of each and uh yeah we're just gonna see so the price of the the live rosin i think in my area i did receive it for free you know i i got gifted it but i believe it's running about 60. this at my local dispensary for the hash rosin surprisingly was 30. so you know if you're in my area and they do still have some of this 11 lemon lava left i suggest you go try it you know but we're going to take a hit of the lemon lava a little booger sized hit a little more [ __ ] it okay and we're just gonna put it back in let me know if you tried rosin in your e-rigs they seem to like thicken up and uh and melt faster and like a thick boil to it i don't know how to explain it but it's pretty cool to just see it start bubbling right away when you put the dab in so before i did this video i did do individual videos on each of these but right off the bat with the lemon lime with the lemon lava you really do get a lemon lemony zest taste but it's not very very strong and then you get like a more fresh natural plant taste towards the end which is really it's like a refreshing like it's like if you just chug the v8 or some [ __ ] you know but yes the taste is there phenomenal rosin's very smooth compared to uh you know your live resins and all this other stuff the biggest difference i've i've seen from rosin and just like live resin is that it's a much more cleaner taste uh i would say you get more off of a dab off your rosin i feel like there's maybe more to dab or like rods more thicker i would say um based on my experience so you can kind of milk it more i don't know if that's true or not but in based off my experiences that's what it seems so i'm gonna run it again and finish off what's left of this lemon lava and then we're gonna take a hit of the jagua but right off the bat lemon lava is [ __ ] far and for 30 dollars like you really can't go there and not buy like three you know what i'm saying if they still have it whoo what i really like about the sit cup or the silicone carbide is that you really don't need to q-tip it that much because it kind of just burns it all i'm not saying you don't have to you still have to a little bit but like i said less so we're going to scoop the jagu i actually just got back from the vet i had to bring my dog for his checkup so i don't think i've had a real session till now so i'm definitely gonna get high off these couple of hits of this rosin right here um this isn't as fat as the other one so you can just put another little something all right but let me know if you've tried honey butter let me know if you've had what kind of experience you've had with them like i said this company will i will feel i will be forever grateful for them just because they they did something even though they didn't have to you know i never even blamed them you know so that to me this just shows uh initiative when it comes to a company and a company actually caring for their customers you know their fan base you know so cheers this one is more of a candy taste it's like a fruity candy taste i'm all smoking this doesn't even tell you the difference yet all right so if you made it this far and you're probably like well he hasn't even explained the difference yet so there's only one difference in between these and that's when the live comes in the live hash rosin or whatever it basically is fresh flash frozen butts and then they make into bubble hash or bubble melt or full melt bubble hash or whatever the [ __ ] you call it uh that's just one step that they add to make live rolls in but if they just have cured bud they make that into bubble hash or full melt bubble hash or whatever and then they squeeze it that's hash rosin but when you just harvest the plant you freeze it and then you make in the bubble hash which is weird because aren't you going to be throwing it in an ice bag anyways so you're going to freeze it before you put it in an ice bag i don't i don't know i don't know the scientifics between it but that's the only step that they add to make live rosin it's like when live resin came out it was like a whole new terp experience you know compared to the shatters and crumbles and all that [ __ ] and uh that's just about it you know finally you know in about two or three years there's gonna be another method of consuming some sort of dab and uh there's gonna be a live version of that two years after that comes out it's just you know it's just brand new techniques that come into play and uh these techniques actually take a long time a lot of man hours and that's probably why they cost so much and the yield is is less compared to the other so um but yeah that's it for the video i think i'm gonna run this one more time and finish this off with some hits in here because i'm pretty sure there's still something here yeah there is but yes that's the difference between live rosin and hash rosin just the fact that they freeze it's just one difference you know freezing the initial terps after you harvest and it keeps those terps instead of allowing them to cure and uh mature and basically gives off a whole new terpene profile but the initial harvested plants what i'm talking about you know what i'm talking about cheers all right that's about it for that but yes guys i hope you did enjoy this comparison video just a quick one you know i i really honestly for like the longest time talk to a honey butter's website told me uh i did not know the difference and now that i do i feel like i should share with you guys because you know i'm sure people don't know the difference between those two either you know and the more videos out on anything cannabis it just puts more information out into the world that you know people can learn from you know but yeah other than that hopefully you did enjoy this rosin video once again shout out to honey butter rosin shout out to p2p for showing me honey butter bronzing and yeah um not enough to say but peace out [Music] guys [Music] so [Music] [Music] like [Music] you", "Zw-YLiPKXIE": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 where we give you the most in-depth reviews as efficiently as possible we're checking out this live resin this Obama Kush live resin by once again Kush Valley and with that let's hop right into the numbers total thce down here is sixty nine point five four percent and I won't get into the rest of it except for the terpenes as you guys know I don't really buy my cannabis based off of these numbers they're all kind of like hit and miss at the current moment anyway so I use it as a guideline but really like that look is really what sold me over anything else the terpenes that are in here there's 6.2% terpenes as you can see so that's quite a bit of turps and they're broken down for you guys right there doesn't check them out now I'm gonna go ahead and open this for you guys and as you guys know I really do enjoy this brand this is one of my favorite like go to brands alright so I'm gonna go ahead and pop that open put this right here let you guys just check it out alright so this is what we got some nice crystal II live resin so this looks like some sugar honestly to be honest with you far as the smells concerned oh let me zoom in for you guys a little bit more so this is what we got you can see the pronounced granules there so this is a live resin but again I would consider this more of a Terp sugar let's see so this has a nice bright kind of like sweet skunk enos so you get a really strong hit of sweetness almost like a sugar like you're smelling sugar I know that's weird but oh no kind of like you're smelling honey and then you get an undertone of a light like skunk enos towards the end of it so this is should be some pretty flavorful stuff and with that I'm really excited to go check this out and I'll be back again with you guys in a couple of days to let you know how this went [Music] so I went ahead and tried that Obama push live resin and as far as the flavor is concerned it was really difficult to figure out in pinpoint so it took us a good two to three days to really like of trying the product and really trying to figure out how to describe the flavor because it was that unique and the words I'm gonna use I don't feel dude enough justice but this is the best that I could come up with and just understand that the flavor is so unique and it's so pronounced that I just I really really enjoyed it so as far as the flavor is concerned it has an earthiness with a faint skunk enos on the end on the exhale so on the inhale you're gonna get a tiny little bit of like a mentally earthy flavor that kind of like you know intensifies as you take that the smoke and once you exhale you get this really heavy like heavier skunky menthol type of mix that hangs out and builds out in the throat for a good you know I would say a good minute and a half to two minutes so that was really really enjoyable as far as the highs considered this thing's a knockout there's no and ifs or buts about that it hits as hard as it like tastes and the effects are very very much there so this is something that you know we've babied and we took very very good care of and we made sure that like we only have like two to three dabs at night of this thing for a while because it was that good and it was that intense we saved it for our last out of the night to hold us through you know through the night so really good product all around definitely recommended if you're a newbie take it easy just because this is going to be a little bit more of an intense high but still I wouldn't necessarily tell you to stay away from it so with all that if you guys are watching this on YouTube go ahead and hit that sub button if you're watching this on Facebook make sure you follow the page this has been recreational 420 and I'll be back again with you guys soon", "YfJBTU2eO5I": "[Music] oh snap they have select cards we're getting some live resin today [Music] select cartridges just arrived in florida and we are going to be one of the very first to try them so we're stopping at the cure leaf in st petersburg and this is actually my first time shopping at this location and they were nice enough to let me inside with the camera to show you guys what it's like in the dispensary i really like their concentrates and tinctures but today i really want to try out their new select elite live resin cartridges it's been a little while since i've had some decent lab resin so i'm excited to try it also i hear they have some new gummy edibles that i want to see if i can try and i'm probably going to get some flour as well too let's see what kind of fire we can get today so we've got your sublingual tablets we've got your afghani aides citrus farmer eighth and your select elite cartridge awesome so your total is gonna come out too [Music] so just got back from cara leaf i was able to pick up a couple different eights of flour we got some sublingual tablet gummies here which i'm excited to try and then i also was able to pick up the new select live resin cards i am super stoked on these i haven't had decent live resin since i lived in colorado there's not a lot of places that offer live resin around here and usually when you find it isn't a cart i'm excited to try these the bud tender was really hyping them up and i was able to get the purple sunset which is 82.8 thc i've had their purple sunset shattered before so i'm really excited to try this because even the shatter had good terps but let's eat a gummy and hit some live resin oh man that's a pretty good gummy there's not a ton of edibles in florida yet either so these sublingual tablets are really nice i actually haven't seen anybody else with gummies yet so this is cool all right let's hit this cart whoa we got the live resin in the dip here i've got it on the lowest temperature let's see how these terpenes hit [Music] damn that's really good [Music] well it's got those nose tingling turps this is really good stuff so i'm really stoked i can get something that flavorful i haven't had dabs as good in months we got an eighth of the af candy we got an eighth of the citrus farmer i've had both of these before which one should we try first [Music] all right you talked me into it we'll do both [Music] oh

at them independently you'd say that they were both sugar but when you look at them side by side you'd honestly say that they're kind of different looking concentrates [Music] today i'm dabbing on one of my personal favorite consistencies this is called sugar starting to sesh off with this live sugar from grassroots oh god that looks beautiful that sugar is such a pretty bright yellow color all right i'm just gonna dunk it right in there oh ah delicious man holy crap [ __ ] yeah that treyo g is a really dank earthy flavor that's [ __ ] fire got a little bit of sweetness on the back end too it's pretty nice there's a lot of different words that people use to describe cannabis concentrates some of the most popular are ones like shatter sugar butter wax sauce diamonds the list goes on and on these names are used to describe the consistency and the malleability of a concentrate not the actual quality so one isn't necessarily better than the other just based off of its consistency but today we're going to take a deeper look into sugar wax it's a pretty popular form of concentrate if you've been to a dispensary before you've probably seen it on the shelf at least it's created through a solvent extraction process just like shatter or wax but it's not necessarily better or worse than any other consistency it's just different everyone has their preference but personally i think this is one of the better consistencies all around i just think it usually has a nice terpene profile and it's easy to work on a dabber but i don't want to put too much emphasis on the importance of a consistency honestly i've had consistencies change on me before i finish smoking the concentrate honestly if you leave shatter sitting out in the open on a warm day it's not too rare to see it sugar up there's actually a lot of science that's involved when it comes to making concentrates it's a little overwhelming when you just look at it but sugar is really just a term used to describe any sort of cannabis consistency that kind of resembles like a wet sugar there's not just one way to get to the finish line here but no matter how you make it sugar typically has great effects a great smell and a great flavor but it's very sticky and crumbly i don't recommend using your hands on this concentrate i recommend getting a dab tool and scooping it up the stickiness really helps to stick to the tool usually let's just get a nice little chunk on here and get a little bit more than that oh yeah now we're talking i really like this little scooper dabbers i feel like you can get a decent amount of concentrate on them when i'm dabbing on a cloud banger with a turf pearl in it i usually wait about 90 95 seconds before i take my dab we're at 90 seconds right now so let's go for it oh yeah it's gonna be a good tent oh yeah it's perfect god damn i just love weed man it's the best i'm assuming that's something we can all agree on here dude just smoking and dabbing it's just incredible but anyway sugar wax is often found as either a cured or a live resin and the only real difference between live resin and cured resin sugar is that live resin sugar was made with fresh frozen material while cured sugar was made with fully cured cannabis but the main difference between the two is typically with live resin you're going to have a more noticeable terpene profile but it's usually around the same thc sugars usually tend to be around 70 to 90 percent thc sometimes with live resin sugars companies will just get little thc diamonds and sprinkle live resin terpenes on top of that until it's like a little sugary consistency and then they call that sugar there will be a saucy coating over the diamonds it'll look just like sauce just a little more dry it's called sugar as well but it's really not the same thing as sugar wax but sometimes these concentrate consistency names just cover up a couple different consistencies under one name i actually have two perfect examples here as you can see both of these are called live sugar you can see live sugar right there and live sugar right there however this is what was inside of each container as you can see this one on the left is what i was talking about where there's little thc diamonds just coated in a live resin sauce where this one over here is actually more of a waxy consistency but it still is a sugar when you look at them independently you'd say that they were both sugar but when you look at them side by side you'd honestly say that they're kind of different looking concentrates they're not even the same color the saucy consistency is much more of an amber color while this sugar is much more of a yellow color some might even consider this more of a sauce consistency but to me that's sugar you can leave it on one side for a little bit without any of the stuff pouring out of there and live resin sugar and live resin sauce often look very similar to each other the main difference between the two is the thc percentage and the terpene percentage sauce typically has a lower thc percentage and a higher terpene percentage than sugar while sugar typically has the higher thc percentage and the lower terpene percentage but still has a great flavor so that's why i typically like to go with sugar so i feel like you get that nice thc punch while still getting a nice flavor and like a delicious overall experience when it comes to the smell and the flavor but i'm about to take a dab of this saucy sugar now and see which one i like more this drain portlandia is absolutely fire it was actually recommended to me by one of you guys it has a super high mercy level this one it's actually only testing at 2.8 which is still pretty high but i've seen it testing it upwards of seven here's the stats for the portlandia sauce for anyone that wants to see it pretty high amount thc and thca while still having a great terpene profile and i'm actually impressed that the sugar wax had good flavor now that i'm looking at the stats it's over 90 thca but it's still a great terpene profile let me know in the comments whether you guys prefer when it's more of a sugar wax consistency or went into the little thc diamonds with the live resin sauce on top i don't really mind either way i like it both ways again it's hard for me to pick a consistency because really i don't look at the consistency i'm looking at the strain and the thc and the terpene percentages when i'm buying weed and the consistency of sugar is just not uniform in nature it even ranges from like a light yellow to a ambery color like this let's scoop out our dab i think it's almost time to dab too god [ __ ] not dabbing all that i'll drop that though all right wish me luck on this one [Music] huh oh my god [Music] oh yeah killed it oh my god that was a good hit oh my god holy [ __ ] that portlandia is [ __ ] amazing i'm not kidding i'm really glad that whoever recommended that recommended it shout out to you but honestly i just love sugar because of how easy it is to get on a dab tool and honestly i think that it has the dopest melt shots when i'm filming my snapchats however i do feel like it is much harder to do than other concentrates sometimes i think i'm just taking a normal sized dab and then once you drop it in there it just turns into this giant puddle and you're like holy [ __ ] i was not intending all this i feel like when i'm dabbing butter or shatter it's so much easier for me to have an idea for how much i'm taking but when it's those little diamonds and all of a sudden there's just a giant thca rock in there you don't really know how much that weighs and you're like all right well let's find out how high i'm gonna get but i still think that sugar has a pretty nice well-rounded high and flavor no matter what form you have it in and i love flavorful concentrates and sugar is not the terpest there is but i still think that it has a great flavor profile and i think the butter and sauce are probably the most terpy for those who are wondering and if you're new to dabbing do not get overwhelmed if you see all these different consistencies at the dispensary and don't know which one to pick honestly don't even look at the consistency if you ask me just look at the strain and like the thc and the terpenes whatever you're looking for if you're a thc shopper look for the thing that's the highest thc if you like a certain terpene look for the terpenes like when i'm looking for a concentrate i'm looking at the terpene percentages i want something that has a really nice terpene profile most of the time concentrate consistencies are all basically the same thing they're all just different concentrated forms of cannabis it's really the cannabis you want to focus on and depending on the concentrate sometimes it'll change consistencies by the time the company packages it up and it actually gets to you bho does not have the longest shelf life and especially if you're talking about something like shatter or butter they can change consistencies pretty quick so honestly i wouldn't even say that labeling at the dispensary is 100 accurate you really don't know until you see it but that's the video you guys let me know what consistency of concentrates you want me to do next i did this before on sauce and you guys seem to really like it so i'm gonna make it a series so let me know what consistency you want me to do next i can do shatter butter wax diamonds let me know make sure you click that like button and subscribe for more videos i

and this stuff looks fire man the rosin we've been getting our hands on has been super fire and it's a treat today we've got the doctor ladybug GMO flower to compare directly to one of the best representations of the concentrate that's a pretty rare that we get the chance to sometimes it's like we get a certain type of hats whether it be a particular strain and then we're able to try the flower sometime down the line or we may have tried it previously it's pretty rare to have a sample of some flour and some concentrate of the exact same cultivar for us you know lately but we have been smoking this GMO a lot we've been thinking about doing a review for you guys like we just haven't gotten around to do it yet we're good but we figured we kind of throw a little mini review of this in with this GMO rosin that was press Peron does it say what micron bubble hash this was I don't believe that I assume it's like nine here ones one or 73 so basically GMO the strain itself is a cross between chem dog and Girl Scout cookie as you guys know if you've been watching this channel for any length of time that we are huge chem dog fans this particular Cross Lanes super heavily on the chem dog side which is something I like hold on when you look at the smell the structure it's definitely super kendo Oh God that is crazy every time I dab GMO lately I'm just like what the hell it's like it's almost like it gives you a little heartburn it's so pungent I didn't think we could give you heartburn in a good way but it's just got that like back in the throat huh oh wait it's like a real really big it's not like a plunging like sour like fruity or like a diesel II smell it's very like dick and musk it almost like coffee you know coffee is like a really big yeah smell but this is more like a Sharpie turb kinda like I mean down there's a lot of hints of a lot of different kind of complex smells and flavors and Terps going on in here but I've been a huge fan of this weed since the first time I tried it and any time I can get my hands on a good batch like this dr. ladybug I usually do you got to try that robot really high but it's almost like that it's a little bit much a very high but it's not a bad jittery it's just like that I need to reduce them you know say like I need to go be active it's very cerebral in the head that it's also got a big body part it's almost yes it's definitely gonna lean heavier on the indica side in the normal sense of like what you think indica means as far as being relaxing superbee this strain is super good for pain relief but it's not like a knockout smoke it's not gonna you know make you super sleepy it's functional but it does have a lot of the good traits that we tend to think of as traditional yeah indica traits as far as the good pain relief appetite stimulant for me personally this has been a great like all-around daytime throughout the day any time of day textmode yeah honestly yeah again I hate the whole indica sativa thing kinda as far as from a marketing standpoint because I like like I said I like to judge everything as I hit it this one's honestly hit me like right in minute like you said it's a it's a everyday smoke morning noon or night to me it's pretty it resembles a hybrid to me I don't know what they're really calling it I realize it's kind of the best of both worlds yes it's the best of all worlds got me very creative but not too sleepy not too jittery so yeah I mean I love the high on it honestly it's really nice this stuff came to us as like a really tacky shatter almost and it buttered up from over 90 yeah those guys can see the close-ups it started off completely translucent thank you like you would see it pretty much right after it was pressed you know it stayed temperature controlled and you know they did a good job getting that from beginning processed the way they wanted to live it to the end consumer and then what we do with it on our end is on us yeah you know we kept it out we didn't put in the fridge or whatever it's completely buttered up now but when we took the close-ups yesterday a look incredible we goofed it guys we does n't matter literally this whole of joggers getting smoked in less than what 12 hours right you know so I'm not really too concerned with it but yeah I can already tell by smelling this it's an exaggerated version of that I'm expecting it to taste like an exaggerated version of that we'll find out yeah I'm gonna go out and I'm popping this jar on the dr. ladybug GMO so and I wanted to bring up that it smells very garlicky and I know that there's like garlic breath up there I know there's garlic cookies and others GMO cookies I'm not really quite sure they all smell they're very similar but this right here is the loudest and most garlic theme of them all this shit's got me super scrambled but this right here is the most garlicky all mo raw it doesn't just taste like that smells o3 airs I got even a smoke kind of smelled like that smoke smells amazing a little treat I couldn't hold back I'm gonna go home and we're going on longer for this right here so this is the kind of [ __ ] I don't care what the [ __ ] haters out there say this is the [ __ ] that deserves a little review oh so far this is so far the bug right here it's it's definitely you know I think it leaves more on the chem side it's definitely got that dirty feet funky fuelie fuming I don't know the best way to describe is just that funk that canvas where I got the word pom-pom when I yeah funky weed it usually has some Cameron this stuff this straight funky dirt I can we're getting the really good Kennedy from up north and then they kind of 91 chem over it's Ann Curry's the creme Buchanan for a while when we first got our medical carts back in the day that's definitely what I look for I'm looking for those nostalgic funky root Bewley crazy gassy Terps with the chemicals that takes me back to that a day you know and with this weed right here the reason we've been smoking this on us lately is because it's exactly what I want is this as far as the body smell it takes just the overall enjoyment when I smoke this yeah this is the exact same thing alright guys sorry gonna take a little halftime break there I guess this stuff the buzz on it is a little more strong than we were intending it's kind of like kind of like an OG it just kind of keeps going up and you don't know where the ceilings gonna be because I'm pretty high right now I take no more dad and then we're gonna rate this [ __ ] oh you're going in for that second Devon yeah I just got this so long I got a good one on a second one yeah it's a rarity for you these days I'd really like to take two in one video especially two bangers so that should tell you guys right there's something about this [ __ ] right here some day it's like the type of stuff were like you're already where you want to be but you end up I'm just smoking more just because you want to taste it I just need to flavor again and the flavors that's a real thing right sometimes you smoke because you want to smoke you want the field you know you want to feel I might as well let's just be honest yeah but then there's some times where you're already where you exactly where you want to be and I still want to smoke more it's because you just want to taste it I I'm stealing your gone I'm gonna take one of these blowing it up with two nice well my timers hitting this so we're just gonna race the music up in the window yeah this stuff is really smooth though it doesn't make it expands your arms and it makes you cop a little bit if you know what's on my first step there wasn't much of a cop this stuff is really smooth for some rosin so I'm digging feel like there's been a lot of tins being given out lately yes what do you think it's another one yeah goodness I don't do up the DJ Khaled oh no then another ten honestly there's some stiff competition on this string and I'm gonna say that I've had one representation that was a little bit better it was the Papa Berkeley it wasn't rosin but it was GMO it was full milk but it tasted just a little better than this I'm not gonna lie and there's some stiff competition so you know I feel like our ratings have to get a little bit stiffer I'm giving this one a nine point five everything's tens the flavor just to be a a bit more little more that stuff I remember that as some of the best bubble hat I've seen this year sure it's crazy it's crazy a time football mashup in this browser but I promise you if you tried both of them I think you would agree and yeah I don't know man I haven't find I would like to see someone make yeah I don't know if you could make better rosin from that bubble than this right here you know I'm saying yeah this to me is about you it's about as good as it gets because then the flavor on this is already crazy to me and the flavor on this was just like a slightly more exaggerated cleaner version of this and I like this dream because it it's one of those strains that tastes almost exactly the way it smells so like kind of gives you that he like ride the whole progress I've like smelling it breaking it down packing it is smoking it and it's like you get the smell and then you get the taste and there's like brings it full circle bias in there it's personal opinion all right for sure I tried that at cauliflower and it was the first time I actually dabbed GMO extract that could be playing on it could be the first time I just got that crazy GMO term and extract form but you know what this stuff is amazing I'm still giving this stuff a 95 percent rating so that's pretty good they built a and this stuff is awesome pickups in 710 labs now and they are killing it right Sutton standards definitely so I'm seeing from you know watching them out in Colorado when we were out there and you know seeing what they were doing out there and then watching what the way they've been able to transition out here and what they've done in the last like year and a half two years has been really cool to watch nothing up some 710 labs for sure yeah and we're far frozen they definitely smoke graves I think so I mean we're definitely going to have to get great be with them I love them linked up with smoked tons of curve GBP Swisher's all day do all the stuff down there that you're supposed to do right now like like comment subscribe turn on notifications hit the bill do that little thing yeah and let us know what your favorite purple strain of all time let's do it right now brilliant I'll be back next week with another one of these doing the same thing yeah same table same guys whatever different we though what's your name Shane mine Dan mm-hmm later see you know what just a plain row always give my day on all night but I'm the running back jet and you know I'm gonna run all know we have fun for the right price turning the Friday night we're going 18 dummy to the sunrise no wise from the dank smoke but I run a reserve with my tank for what we just trying to have some fun", "uz4hfUiGDY8": "[Music] hey it's mad at roughout studios now welcome to cannabase ecstatic oak shatter tabs and wax today we're going to look at several ways to smoke shatter wax and rosin along with the pros and cons of dab rigs and nails dab pins vaporizers emails and nectar collectors you can find all these products and more at the wizard puff com online head shop and you can save money with the code roughhouse I'd like to thank wizard puffs for sponsoring this video perhaps the og of ways to do dabs is the trusty dab or oil rig fitted with the titanium nail or quartz banger and is truly one of the most effective ways to do a dab you'll get a huge hit instantly and usually get the most out of your wax - as it's fully vaporized in seconds dab rigs might be one of the most effective ways of doing dabs but there are drawbacks such as needing a torch and gas to heat the nails and also a recovery time to reheat it now for the next tab also when you introduce open flame and exposed high heat into the process you also sacrifice safety to some degree dad pens on the other hand are probably one of the safest ways to do dabs these types of pens usually use quartz ceramic or metal coils to heat the wax enclosed inside of a sealed glass or metal cap these types of pens can be effective and give big hits but usually will take several puffs to smoke the same amount of wax as doing a single dab off of a nail another common drawbacks to wax pans is that the unvailed wax builds up and they require constant cleaning to keep functioning properly some vaporizers that are made for dry herb can also be used to vaporize wax to these devices usually provide a cup or pod that inserts into the dry herb heating chamber to vaporize the wax these types of devices can be very convenient but the cons are that they often do a mediocre job of vaporizing wax as they lack the heat that's required and the small pods can be cumbersome and leaky so it can be hard to keep the heating chamber clean for dry herb nectar collectors or vacuum systems could be considered the Dark Horse of DAB methods these types of devices use a heated tip on the end of a handheld device that you dip directly into the wax there are both electric collectors as well as those requiring external heat sources such as a torch one big advantage of the collector type rig is that you can get huge hits when you're dipping the tip directly into the wax but they can have a bit of a learning curve and a little bit awkward to use perhaps the biggest favourite among divers is the email emails are very similar to the standard titanium nail on an oil rig with one key difference the emails have an electronic control center to set a precise temperature and a heating element that will keep the nail continuously heated and ready for a dab the pros of emails are that it's ready for a DAB any time that it's on and you can set to precise temperatures and you also you can do back-to-back dabs without having to reheat the nail they may also arguably be safer than using open flames and are clearly more convenient than needing a secondary heating torch cons are that they usually require a power source to operate so it may not be as portable as the other methods and it's also very convenient to use so you might find yourself smoking through your wax very quickly and passing out on the couch very early whichever method you choose dabbing wax or rosin so long as it's free of impurities is actually healthier than smoking cannabis flowers by not smoking or vaporizing the plant materials you are clearly putting less unnecessary chemicals into your body and by taking concentrated doses you're required to smoke less frequently not to mention that the time it takes to do it to have is far quicker than the time it takes to smoke a joint bulb or especially a blunt but if you're an everyday diver like myself a nice email setup likely be the way to go but if you only occasionally dabber prefer to vaporize then a three-in-one vape pen that does wax too might be satisfactory or any or an inexpensive wax pen might be even better or perfect for the beginner just looking to dabble in wax shatters and rosin concentrates again I'd like to thank the guys at wizard puff for sponsoring this video you can save money on a lots of the products that you saw in this video with a code roughhouse and wizard puff comm I hope you enjoyed this video on how to smoke shatter

"hi my name is cue Pinson is Wednesday in Colorado Springs and Wednesday is important because it is one of the days we like to Rio now before I get started I want to say follow me on twitch TV slash coupons for more awesome live content now Wednesday it's one of the days of the week we get deals on concentrate Wednesday and Saturday are two of the bigger days wax Wednesday and Saturday as they call them not everybody has those deals but a lot of places to do so we always like to look on Wednesday and I always start in the comfort of my own home on weed naps calm want the best places to look they have plenty of deals they can look up everything in my area there's bounce deals there's grand bills there's plenty options there so we're gonna get a little bit of an idea of what's out there before we get started and hopefully we get some really bang stuff today we are in the car here headed to the ATM most dispensaries are cash businesses and it's a lot easier to tip and purchase things with cash oftentimes so we're headed to the ATM to pick up some cash and I'm looking here on my phone actually and signed up at a few dispensaries for their text message alerts and they'll text me with their daily or weekly deals or if they have kind of flash or fire sales as they call them so we're gonna look through a few more deals here on the phone I already have a few ideas from weed Maps so we're gonna maybe go to a few places today once we decide but right now we're headed to get some cash and the dispensaries we are leaving the bank now we pulled out $80 we found a few good deals from a few dispensaries we're gonna go check out the first one now but we're gonna see what we can get with $80 today now I've had some good luck in the past getting a low price grams but we're gonna see what today hold so if they don't have good stuff we're gonna move on but hopefully we can get a few really bang grams for about 80 bucks here okay we are at our first stop for today one of my favorite dispensaries we are at high hopes cannabis with a cause I just started shopping here recently and I haven't been disappointed they have excellent products they always have great prices and the staff here is really friendly so we're gonna go in here and see if we can get some excellent stuff for today okay we are just leaving high hopes now it seems as though the prices are so good today that they've been cleared out so we were able to pick up a couple of different grams that concentrate as well as a pre-roll joint so we've got a gram of blackberry head band sugar and a gram of Agent Orange live sugar and we got a pre-roll joint of that lemon diesel we're gonna enjoy later so excellent prices but the selection was a little light because they must have just got raided oh man the views are sick the trees are covered in frost there's plenty of plenty of cool things to see in Colorado Springs we are outside of our second dispensary shop for today as you can see the views here are insane worse not that Apothecary farms powered by apothecary extracts one of my favorite dispensaries you can get apothecary extracts all over Colorado but they have a few of their own dispensary locations where you can pick up directly so here we are at apothecary farms in the springs looking for some more concentrates what of you over here we are just leaving apothecary Farms had to stop for a moment to check out that gorgeous view it was too good to pass up but we picked up a couple more grams from apothecary we got a gram of axilla wax and we also got a gram of their jam band lime batter which I've been hearing a lot of great things about and they were recommending it there too so we definitely picked up a couple of good ones here and I'm excited to try these right so we've spent all the money we've pulled out for dabs today we got four different grams as well as a pre-roll joint we didn't spend everything we had we've got a little leftover so I'm gonna do a little bit of foresight here a foreshadowing and then we're gonna get some munchies for later I found some coupons in the mail today so we are just going to get our munchies now and we are going to enjoy the dabs later foam pepper on the tomato black olives cucumber and the spinach oh I see this business and what also I'll just go with a little bit of that yeah we'll go at the now thank you good eat just like these chips later bad there's one thing you never expect to see him it's a trenchcoat you never expected so I realized my car is super dirty so we've pulled into a car wash here it's getting clean now my card is getting a pound and it's gonna be a while so we're gonna get up oh yeah and we are on our way home to enjoy our spoils for today more amazing views Colorado Springs is beautiful okay so we just got back home and went to two different dispensaries today high hopes and apothecary farms we got two grams of concentrate from each and we also got a pre-roll joint from my host so let's see we got a few different concentrates different grams here and a pre-roll joint we're all joint one gram of the lemon bezel good stuff nice price on this usually pick these up we got the gram of blackberry headband sugar blackberry headband sugar this is the one that is not a live and let's take a look oh this one looks very nice blackberry had been sugar wax very good stuff this one is from high hopes let's take a look at the other one this is their Agent Orange live sugar so we got a gram of the Agent Orange live this one's a little bit more expensive looks like that one got a little bit mixed up in the bag there I had it sitting upright but maybe it was upside down and that one smells very good check that out check that out this one is really saucy this one has a very very strong smell to it okay and then we also got two other grams from apothecary right and I know we got to two different two kinds here here's the axilla wax this one is 73% th if I can get a difference I'll never focus focus anyway seventy three point nine percent THC this one looks great excellent concentrate in there and one last one we got was the jam band live better and this one is very popular the employees were raving about of this one is eighty two point nine percent THC this one is a really good really good strands got a very good smell right when I open it it smelled amazing so let's take a look here oh yeah this live better okay so let's invite my girlfriend in here near there to do some Deb here is one more look at our spoils for today we got the BlackBerry headband sugar we got some gaygent orange lime sugar we got that pre-roll joint of lemon diesel from high homes we got that axle wax and we also got some jam band live batter so we've got a couple of emails plugged in here into our high five vape and we are ready to death alright we are finally back home we got the emails fired up and we're going to try a few of these out here what do you got there jam band you got that jam band from apothecary and I've got some Agent Orange live sugar from high hopes that's a really tasty the jam ban that's the last one okay we got our last couple of dabs lined up here I've got some of that axilla wax what do you have the BlackBerry headband sugar let's see how these ones taste oh that one's smooth and sweet like that so everything passed the test we got some great concentrates today and we got a couple of live options we spent a little more on the live better in the live sugar but the taste is very good we spent I think just under $80 for four grams that concentrates in the pre-roll joint so I think was around 76 for everything not a bad price for today I hope you enjoyed hanging out with us today and please if you like the content go ahead and subscribe to our YouTube

guys today we're gonna talk to you about rosin not only are we gonna tell you what rosin is but we're gonna show you how to do it the right way so throw away those hair straighteners and let's get right into it rosin is a concentrate extracted from the cannabis plant using nothing more than heat and pressure the result a translucent sappy and sometimes shattered like product that is potent and flavorful enough to rival any of your favourite BHO products but what is the difference between rosin and other concentrates out there one word of solvents most concentrate extraction methods require the use of a solvent such as butane propane for co2 rosin however does not but how does the simplicity of heat and pressure transform cannabis into such an overwhelmingly great product the accumulation of trichomes trichomes are those small shiny bubbles that appear on marijuana believe it or not those microscopic bulbs actually contain most of the cannabis plants cannabinoids which provide most of the sense flavours and effects but can anyone easily make rosin themselves yes yes you can and will tell you how before you get started you will need a couple things a nug Smasher fresh flower micron extraction bags parchment paper and a dab tool grab everything you need aside from the canvas of course in a bundle at knucks master comm so now you're good to go let's jump straight into one very important factor starting product you may ask which nuts master gives the best results well the answer is all of them you get back what you put in it's as simple as that fire in

taste very good now how about a pizza it's gonna be the best thing you've ever tasted same goes for rosin if you put extremely potent trichome coated flowers into a nut Smasher mini well you're gonna

"[Music] p2p [Music] then [Music] what's good yoshi boy p2 peeps uh the hair is looking real bummy we don't get that fixed up though anyway real reason why y'all are here today we're going to be checking out some cold cure premium tier 1 hash rosin from punch extracts this is the white tahoe cookies review here is you know just the product itself we got right here percentage-wise we're going with uh 80 chc for those who are curious i don't really see too many uh other um you know things on the ten or ten the percentages but you know here's what we're working with and of course you know i will always include them lovely lovely close-ups and yeah so normally when we're you know dabbing out here i try to get different angles and things like that but we don't really have the other camera and the attachments i have for this camera are kind of on the wonky side today so you know that's just that's just how it goes but today we're going to be dabbing out of two things i got the little ursa rig and for those yes i know it's a dirty banger i just took a whole gram dab out of that last time around um and i don't feel i ain't gonna lie i don't feel like cleaning it just yet i want to take at least like a few more dabs out of it before i clean it because it's literally only seen one or two dabs so you know what i'm saying oh yeah and the we got the b4 with the sit cup for our other hit there but yeah i'm just going to go ahead and get this thing started up heat up this dab and yeah let's go we'll take our first rib i think that should be good there on the heat here we go for our first dab nice little slab like this hope that focuses in all right i think it's hot enough at least it's been i don't really dab too uh hot too often so cheers guys we got nice flavor off that but of course that is not that hot we're gonna fix that so yeah still getting used to the new banger um it's got an opaque bottom so i can't really see when it gets red oh yeah that's nice see we got most of the flavor in that first um rip the flavor here is definitely a little bit more toasted of course that's all that's on me but we're gonna get a really really deep deep flavor off the v4 so all right so i think yep that's all of it we got all of it out of that so okay so of course is cold here um so it's a lot smoother and of course it kind of has that you know really really cool uh taste to it because of that cold cure of course you know i'm just repeating myself now but yeah it's probably one of the smoothest things i've ever dabbed smoked whatever like even really really good indoor doesn't really get this smooth honestly and i've had a lot of good stuff before so yeah i think cold cure is definitely the wave if you're looking for what is the best you know most smooth most potent kind of uh concentrate to smoke or at least thc thing to smoke you're looking at it right here it's definitely some cold cure live frozen and uh yeah i'm not i'm not gonna say you know all other life rosin is bad or other rosin is all bad and all this stuff you know only smoke cold cure i'm definitely not like that uh you know smoke what you like and continue to smoke what you like type things but just saying you know for those who you know have this is expensive i will say that guys so if you don't this is not you're not gonna find this for anything less than like maybe 80 uh 80 if you're lucky honestly because this is normally like 90 dollars a gram so um you know what i mean it's definitely not really for the bargain shopper uh so you know only i would say only buy this if it's a special occasion or you know you can afford it or if this is just within your means type thing or uh you know i'm saying like for example you only smoke one gram and you'd like it to be the best gram you can get then you know you can go look for some cold cure live rosin you know i'd highly suggest but other than that you know what i'm saying this is definitely something that uh if you're looking to save money this is not really for you but it is really really good that flavor is super super deep like i was saying before um i don't think i touched on too many of those notes so let's touch on them a little bit shall we what else first you know it's a little sweet um not too too much though we got a lot of that gassy kind of taste there and yeah we should be able to get a little bit more of that figure profile down now that i've got that hit packed up um but yeah this is maybe my third live rosin premium or premium whatever it is uh their whole thing is premium live rosin or tier one sorry live rosin so that's the whole thing they like to say for it but i think it is really good it is really really really [ __ ] good all three of the grams i've had i think are definitely worth the price although i wouldn't really buy them weekly type thing you know i'm saying i bought them for review purposes i don't know when i'd buy another one maybe to celebrate something but uh we'll see yeah i'm gonna get this hit cooked up so i hope you guys can join me this once again out of the divine tribe v4 um and i got a little stick up attachment on there and we will be doing a video on the v4 soon i know i promised that a really long time ago and i've been really slacking on it but that video will be coming yeah opponency wise guys this is great even after just one dab i'm toasted this might even be the last dab of the video guys so i hope you guys can join me and if you've been watching up to this point please don't forget to leave that like drop a comment and subscribe you know help the homie out cheers everybody oh wow you guys like a garlicky taste to [Music] it not too garlicky though yeah let's show some cookies we got that the nice signature cookies taste in there yeah i'm pretty sure everyone knows what some good cookies taste like um strain wise i'm just cleaning this out a little bit but try to think of any other notes i can think of well you know you got y'all got me here um and honestly i can't really think of anything else right now to say because it's hitting me tough guys this thing rips once again if you're looking for something really really really smooth i would and you haven't tried cold cured live rosin not resin rosin then you should definitely give this a go bruh once again this is the punch extracts white tahoe cookies cold cured batter you know second coal gear we've had here on the channel and yeah cold here and at least in the rosin world this is definitely the future of you know everything i hope one day this becomes the standard and we get these for like you know 30 25 40 you know whatever whatever the price may be just lower than 90 that'd be great in the future um but for now you know i guess i i i guess it's worth the price you know uh i haven't had too many super expensive grams you know i've only i've only had uh you know i concentrate grams over like eighty dollars like on five occasions now so i wouldn't really be able to call myself a an expert in that kind of field where flower is concerned that i think i'm a little bit better off in knowing uh in terms of those kind of price points but this one yeah so if you guys know any other better live rosin than this you guys like you got to let me know so i can give that a go otherwise though this is super super satisfying loving the high it is i believe this is a indica dominant hybrid um so you know that's kind of my alley i kind of normally buy things like that and i kind of like being slumped like that kind of relaxed feel super kit laid back type thing i'm getting that here but i'm also feeling a little social i ain't gonna lie you know maybe it's a little a little bit of the tiny little bit of sativa that lies within the cookies you know cookies don't really have too much sativa in them but you know what i'm saying like they do kind of make you a little talkative sometimes like i mean maybe that's just me but hey um that's all i got for today's video guys i'm super baked so i probably won't get another rip in just yet you know what i'm saying i got a little i got some other things to do today so you know you guys can though catch a bunch of rips on stream if you want and i'll be streaming on youtube tuesdays fridays and then on the weekends it's just kind of whatever whenever saturday sunday whenever like that but yeah tune in

you're [ __ ] with that design you guys let me know down below but anyways that's all i have thanks for watching guys and i'll see you on the next one man peace out peace", "UsbmHm4Xw8s": "we got a wedding cake live resin strain review right now on the stream show [Music] what's up and welcome back to the strange show the adults-only marijuana channel where i teach you new fun facts about weed every week don't forget to subscribe and you can put some nuggets of knowledge into your stream brain today we're gonna be trying some of this wedding cake live sugar from natty realms extracts it's testing it seventy one point two seven percent THC let's see what we paid for this it's thirty dollars and forty nine cents for two grams of live sugar this was on sale for a forty percent off so I think I got a really good deal and I'm pretty stoked to try this wedding cake so let's open one of these up and see what she's looking like we've got the little natty rims logo oh you have a great endocannabinoid system sick come on mat here it's stronger than a child oh wow check it out nice and chunky alright let's scoop one of these guys out and see what it's talking about it smells good like oh it smells like a cush so hard sort of has that Girl Scout cookie smell but it's fresh out of the refrigerator so it's doesn't smell very strong yet but I assume when we dab this guy it's gonna be hella flavorful okay I have this step perfectly balanced on this stick and you see it sort of got ahead of myself oh don't fall don't fall okay and I got the right carb cap for these pearls this time this little spinning guy right here but it sucks it doesn't really spin the pearls very well it doesn't work for a carb cap very well either so we're just going to stick to this guy cuz it works really good but it doesn't spin the pearls very well so oh whoa wedding cake strange Oh [Music] oh yeah [Music] very nice very nice mMmmm no it's good got me I has a very indica taste very reminiscent of a cush or maybe a Kim dog so wedding cake is Girl Scout cookie crossed with cherry pie and I'm pretty sure that Girl Scout cookie is a Kim dog cross and I can really taste that Kim og kind of flavor in here real strong and it tastes real good I love in because I love pushes above Kim I love Girl Scout cookie I love wedding cake this is right up my alley it's a real strong kiss flavor with like citrusy hints some kind of hands it's got like a sweet also maybe that's the cookie coming through that sweet sweetness with the citrus so it's like the main flavor is boom funk funky og Kim and then it's like ooh sweet ooh a little citrus - yeah this is good I'm glad I got two grams of the same strain once I don't do a whole lot but I was like the wedding cake for the 40% off so grams was alive for 30 bucks um I'm about that all day all day and I wasn't sure about some budget hair so I good but then I looked at it and I was like I'm fine although and it did me right I'm glad I got this okay stranger who'd sometimes in slow Tim Tams go forever [Music] still so little pump left Oh still still straight phone what is that taste I would call it that super Citra Funkadelic oof yeah that tastes good quality hash indeed all right so we're gonna do the usual piece out for 20 minutes and then we'll come back and assess the high from this tasty tasty live sugar I will see you in 20 minutes and boom to the powers of multi-million dollar Hollywood special-effects 20 minutes has elapsed and I return so this high is very nice it's a really strong indica heavy hi and I'm just real chill right now super duper chill and if you like in because you will like this a lot this would probably be real good for nighttime too like for going to bed ebed my eyes feel super heavy I'm sure I look super stoned very pleased with this for 30 bucks for 32 bucks for two grams very pleased my live sugar that's what I wanted to look like and put some wedding cake that's what I want it to taste like so I'll give the wedding cake from natty rooms a nine out of 10 I want to give it a 10 out of 10 because I feel like that should be reserved for something spectacular which this was really good but I wouldn't say spectacular so let's give it a 9 out of 10 highly recommend but I am partial because I love live resin and I love indicus and I love wedding cake so you know who knows but I bet you would like this if you like it because if you like getting stoned do you like live resin give it a try thanks for watching buddy I'll see you in the next video", "Rff2iecMh2U": "so sit back and just roll up the perfect show for my smokers i really do like i i'm never going to buy i don't think ever again a distillate cart because you get that full taste in it and what in that compared to like some of the other ones like what what's your opinion i know you smoke concentrate more than me this is distillate right here right no that's live resin live resin distillate not just live resin what does that mean because well like because resin means like fresh frozen plant material yeah that's what this is but you can distill that and that's what you usually put in base and some people do that this is this is this is a hundred percent live resin vape same with this one but people do take live resin and dilute it but you can tell from the color like when you when you smoke a like a pure distillate vape it's like clear as [ __ ] like this is pure live resin because like you know being a bartender too but what's the extraction method the cold extraction method they i'm not a i need to see it firsthand but it's all they freeze dry it right away and then they use a super cold temp to extrude everything to get the whole terpene profile whereas with the distillate they're going to burn everything hot oil it down so when you're with a distillate it's like a whiskey it turns out clear and a lot of people don't realize that with whiskey that it's initially clear until they put it in oak barrels you know i was under the impression that like pretty much all these are just lit whether it's like rot live resin nug run you know but some of them they use rosin to put it because you have to like make it into that liquid [ __ ] you know and the only way to make like the main way they make those is through like chemical extraction through co2 or like butane or ethanol but even with the live resin you think because the livelihood doesn't just that just is the quality no but it's a different extraction method because the distillate is a hot method live resin i've understood is the the extra cold method at a certain temperature below the what i understand is live resin means you're using like fresh frozen materials whether you make it into distillate shatter you know they have like live resin shatter and that's made with butane you know yeah i mean but i guess maybe i guess no no no no well something because because i had because i have been and i think i guess i think where we might be like um maybe it's just a like a wordplay thing but i this i oh it is yeah it is you know but like the thing about these two i have here these live resin cards are legit i bought one the other day that was like watered down how much are those this [ __ ] was that's this [ __ ] this cart right here runs for well i didn't pay this much for it but this cart right here runs for 62 dollars for one gram oh okay i got this one for free too but they um my understanding was that it's always live resin no matter where it is it because this is not my my understanding was that a distillate has to go through the distillation process and live resin doesn't don't know yeah because that was my understanding but you're making me second guess myself well you should check it out because it might be different i know they do have some really fire rosin pens you know that's what they take the ice water extraction and they separate it and then they press it and they put it into there you know but look at the color of those compared to the other 1000 ones look more like yellow you know compared to other but that that's uh but that's rosin that's not resin right no rosin because it's pressed yeah so yeah yeah so this is different though resin is just that's like resin is what makes rosin you know so residence elaborate resins is like all the [ __ ] crystals and oils from the plant you know so but but i think i think no i think we're talking about three different processes we're talking about making a distillate we're talking about making a live resin and then we're talking about making a rosin i think that's well no they're they're all like live resin i'm just telling you that's just fresh frozen like material but no but it goes through it but you can try you can process live resin anyway no you can't though then it won't be yeah no but then but then it won't be 100 live resin because 100 live resin that's legit and i agree with you not all live resins made equal but like 100 live resin is not ever going to be heated up ever it can never be because that's not the process but they don't heat it they like they cool it yeah yeah yeah it's like a whole so that's why i'm saying so yeah so that's live resin but that's what i'm saying so that's live resin with the cool method but distillate is hot so it's they're not the same but people do die what if you have live resin just washed what's that because that's the best [ __ ] that's what's in these that this is 100 that [ __ ] doesn't come out like liquid that's what i'm doing but look look how thick this is like look at it like that shit's thick as [ __ ] dude no but on what i'm saying is like live resin isn't like goo you know it's like it's like cash you know it's like crystals it's like a so you're saying every so you're saying live resin this is interesting because i thought this is telling you that there's something else in there besides live resin extract to make it that liquid yeah yeah or else like because it's not going to be like liquid you know unless you're using like a chemical but this is like traction both of these look like something that you would press and just put in here though this one's a little more liquier but look like this [ __ ] doesn't even move like the shit's pretty solid yeah maybe well you'll have to check it out you know but i've never seen anything that's like a liquid like that that you can just press and then it's just like liquid i don't think they're pressing it they're not pressing it though but well then are they using co2 they're it's it's a whole method where it has to be below like negative 40 degrees so they're using like dry ice yeah they're using some crazy [ __ ] to push this [ __ ] out but like i mean i don't know it's just this is an interesting talk i'm just want to know if it's all natural you know but i don't i know this you know i know this one is for sure or that's what they've told me is that this one is for sure and i'm pretty sure this one is for sure and that's why like but can you do like i know you've smoked some distillate ones that i've gave you for sure like do you taste the difference does it feel more full do you feel um i don't know i don't i don't really you know it's pretty good it tastes good you know but i just want to know if it's like natural you know because if there's only certain ways you can extract i'm about to tour this facility and that's i guess that brings up a whole topic what what is natural what's like without any chemicals so using like heat ice water yeah so those are that's natural you know that's the [ __ ] you're paying a hundred dollars a grand for at the shops for like the [ __ ] paid that before i would never pay that i was like i've made that [ __ ] i've made my own live resident cash you know where you freeze your bud and you wash it in your bubble bags and it's like dabbable resin you know but it's hard to make in a hot environment because it likes to get super sticky you know this is a good conversation like it's the first time we've been on a podcast from what i know like for the most part all the like for most vapes have like chemical extraction in there unless it's like a live rosin or whatever you know but that's or it's like resin rosin just means heat and pressure but if it's with live resin that's going to like be like the highest for the best tasting and that's what this that's what this is supposed to be yeah i wish i had a different shittier cartridge because i had a couple shitty ones like and like i said i could i might even i had a pack over here that was a they said it was live resin but you look at it bro it was light as [ __ ] it didn't have this color and then after talking to some people they were telling me that a lot of people say it's live resin but it's diluted to your point with distillate so there so that's why i'm saying they're two different um things but distillate is like that's the process of making the [ __ ] out of weed they'd [ __ ] cut it with like vitamin k or something but that's where this is different though is because they don't do distillation but to your point well maybe they i'm curious how they make it because like i've seen the way they they do it with like liquid nitrogen and stuff like that where you you throw a bud in there and it like freezes off all the crystals and then you distill that down into like like a liquid like that yeah and that's where i wish that like i don't know i think that i and that's where i'm excited to tour a facility that does it so i can see and give a better answer and see what's going on but i am but to me i can taste the difference with these compared to other ones yeah there's like different there's definitely like levels of quality of those like if you go to like a legit shop and you pay like [ __ ] 60 bucks a gram you're gonna get a good one yeah you better it better be fine but it's like it's there's no guarantee that it's made with like no chemical extraction process you know because that's like i've seen the things it's like a bunch of [ __ ] metal [ __ ] tubes and pipes and you know it's not just all like water and i agree with you and you're right because it is a machine but i think that what they're trying to do but i think they're just injecting like something natural though like co2 compressed that's cold or something i don't know yeah you can do co2 extraction you know that's like one way to do it but i don't know well you'll have to you'll see you know what's crazy bro we're two dudes like [ __ ] deep in this game and we're still not a hundred percent sure yeah you know what i'm saying it's like some a newbie like [ __ ] dude what like yeah i i don't really buy those unless i'm like trying to be like super low-key and like well you got you got plans you got you got all your [ __ ] ready to go this is true buzz that mary jane i we ain't new to this for my stoners and for my cannabis enthusiasts never heard a show as good as this yeah number one it's the best bringing in many special guests in the industry of cannabis business owners to growers even artists you know of so sit back

going to review it's no surprise because of the title of this video some muv live rosin look they got new packaging i like it i do like the new packaging i will say that so you get this it comes in this box um this is live ice water or live ice water extract rosin thousand milligrams this is modified grapes this one was clocking in at 683.6 milligrams of thc for 1.6 milligrams of cbd does that make this like almost 70 percent i don't know sound off in the comments there's that but they did get new packaging it used to come in like a little bag i like the box a lot better i hope it's recyclable and this is the container i do like it it is a little bit harder to open up i will say that it's not the worst thing in the world but i will say this so that's what it looks like it's kind of dry um like a dry waxy texture right now but i will say when i first got it it was hard and some the last time i got the live browsing it wasn't cured i put it in my refrigerator the next day it cured it out um this one i did not put in the frigerator because it looked like it was cured but it really wasn't it just kind of looked like it was and it was like shatter i literally was digging in and it was breaking all over the place i dropped pieces all kinds of [ __ ] yesterday um it has started to change oh i don't know i don't know if they're keeping the fridge and it doesn't cure it and it magically cures when you get home i don't know but that's what's happened to me on two occasions love the way it smells oh absolute gas this is an indica i believe that's yep it's an indica now i'm not going to pretend like i haven't smoked some of this because we already know that i have obviously because there's some missing you know okay so let's run it let's do a dab yeah it's really crumbly not like crumble um wax crumbles like crumbly wax i guess it's the way it's not really soft it's it's breaking up it's brittle it's brittle it's a brittle boy i do like the new packaging i will say it's adorable it's small compact i like that i don't see i needed to turn my tea bucket i don't i need a new rig for my tea bucket so i can just switch them out cheers [Music] hmm that is some tasty stuff all right modified grape syndicate live water rosin from mub let's talk about it all right so okay i do really enjoy their live rosin the only issue i have is the price i know it's not always about percentages but 68 or 69 is kind of what i was assuming this was correct me if i'm wrong correct me if i'm wrong but if this seems kind of low for the price you know i mean i guess it's not always about percentages i do really like the effects of this stuff it's really nice it is a good indica the taste is amazing it does it seems it would be real clean that's what i really like about a real clean earthy gassy taste that typically i adore that's this is the kind of stuff that i like to the way it smells like it's like a gassy earthy in your face so [ __ ] good so could i get this again well let me start off by saying i did use i had my discount uh for my card so i got 25 off so i got this i also got some edibles we'll be doing a review on that soon so that being said uh i would probably get the rosin again probably just a different stream just so i could review it because i have a two more discounts coming up with them and they're both pretty nice so yeah 10 out of 10 i would get the live water rosin again i would like to get a different strain just to do that to review but i do like this i did like this modified grapes you're not so bad i was kind of um yeah so yeah um i know it's kind of a quick review today that's okay we're all good but i did like it so again thank you guys so much for everything supporting my channel i did lose a few subscribers as soon

[Music]", "emDXqTzS3-g": "well the Sun is going down and we are going to the Apothic let's go get some stuff this video is intended for a mature audience if you're not a mature audience this video is not for you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so we are just leaving the Apothic now I got a gram of Kraft concentrates and some harmony extracts and uh we got some good stuff and I can't wait to try these out these were really good prices today so I'm excited for these ok let's take a look at what I was able to pick up from the Apothic I got a couple of grams some live concentrates here I was able to get a rim of crafts lemon Jie I see live resin it's about 87% h-scenes and of course of the flower that looks really good that one's light in color it smells amazing I can't wait to try that one and then I also picked up a gram of harmony extracts and ghost OG live sugar and that one's about 75 just under 75 percent THC let's get a close look at the sugar there that one looks really good all right let's uh let's get a dab of both of these and see we like them okay let's try out these dams here the first one that we're gonna try is the craft lemon G hi-c lime present and that one was the high THC what was in the 87% let's check that one out [Music] oh that one's really good it's really smooth and it's really sweet tasting I'm gonna like a nice citrusy lemon flavor with that one oh it's good stuff okay the next one up is the harmony extracts the ghost OG live sugar and that one was just under 75 percent THC so let's give it a go here [Music] oh oh that one tastes really

today we're gonna be checking out his papaya punch number four let's get to it [Music] the papaya punch number four from olio is a cross between purple punch and papaya both heavily indica dominant strains the purple punch was giving me hints of grape candy and a sweet blueberry muffin fresh out of the oven while the papaya was was on the sweet candy side of things papaya candy maybe a little hint of mango in there and it's very surprising that it was an indica dominant strain because most of the effects I was getting were what you would attribute to a sativa dominant strain and I was getting a very energetic productive and uplifting high I tribute this to the high concentration of limonene found in the string and the limonene is really what was giving me that mood elevation in euphoria the second most concentrated terpene present and this strain was Lin Ahlul and I tribute that to the relaxation and stress relief that I was getting from this hey guys it's clip peer-pressure here welcome to the solvent ice review series this is episode number two we've got rosin ryan here with olio and we're gonna be reviewing the papaya punch number four this is our jam product this is been heat cured this is pretty much the most separated of all our consistencies as far as THC a and terpene content within the rosin and we believe it's probably the most shelf-stable even if you don't put it in the fridge or anything like that it keeps flavor for a long time and it's honestly my favorite consistency that I'm smoking right now so you can leave this out and it doesn't it doesn't you know decrease in terpene value it won't dry up which some people do like but this here let me show you here sure so what's this little dab tool here so every gram of ours has kind of comes with a personal dabber it's just a little extra thing we do just select emergency dabber in case of situations for sure very nice nice touch so what can you tell me about the the strain here so this is our papaya punch number four this is we have a few different fee knows we always Fino test a few different seeds that we get it's like the most exotic fruity and most punchy almost phyno it's got an exotic note it's um it's got a little bit of that artificial grape in it from the purple punch it's probably one of my favorite strains at the moment and this is from pony seeds papaya times purple punch very nice yep this is perfect for during the day I'll run some errands after dabbing some of this stuff it's very relaxing but its clear-headed yes it's a hybrid like most things are nowadays and for me personally I know it's different for everybody but I could dab some of this and still get a lot of stuff done during the day I don't feel too body locked or anything like that I still I'm ready to go you know do my stuff for the day so got that clarity stay exactly exactly and it's so flavorful that I almost don't expect to relax feeling I'm expecting some type of anxiety yes achieve a high but it's honestly perfect mellow high for the middle of the day definitely so how do you typically go about finding a good hash string it is many different steps so first of all to grow which ones grow nice we can't get any males obviously we take out the males whatever females are left it really is dependent on how well they grow their yield in the garden then once we wash them it's gonna be based on water hash yields it's gonna be the thing that plays the most role and if we keep it or not if it does yield well a nice hash and it presses well usually we'll keep it it all depends on flavors yields we all come together smoked them we all you know put in our opinions of you know which one do you think is a little bit tastier versus if the yield if it's really worth it sometimes we'll take a tastier one even if it yields a little bit lower just because it's got that little extra that we know people will will enjoy it so for sure so what do you thoughts on fresh frozen verse washing dried and cured flour so you can wash cured I've seen it done stuff 99% of our stuff is fresh frozen almost almost all we have our own in-house garden everything is harvested fresh frozen washed within usually one to two weeks so we try to wash it as quickly as possible really keeps that terpene profile just like it was when you were smelling the plant so when you're going around you got your fingers on the nose I want that to be what the rosin tastes like yeah I went down I really do think fresh frozen you know produces that a little bit better of a quality in the end for sure yeah so yeah you talked about doing BHO extraction in the past and you know when BHO first came out people were always looking for a light golden color but it seems now that things are kind of moving more towards an almost white color and I've even heard of people pulling their plants early to even get that color do you have any comment on like that is a huge trend right now in the in the grow world as people know you can pull your plants a little bit early but you're gonna sacrifice what I believe is a little bit taste and your potency the effects from you pulling early I believe are gonna be felt people really go for that visual yeah so when people see white hash they really they get excited yeah I think people really need to try the hash more side-by-sides sometimes a darker hash will blow the lighter hash out of the water with taste with potency affect how it makes you feel so I really think people should try stuff before you know everybody eats with their eyes so to speak but but uh you really gotta get smoking yeah so what can you tell us about the terpene profiles some of the flavors that you're getting up the papaya punch number four so this number four is probably our most like exotic fruity vino of this papaya punch it's mostly papaya notes it's that exotic fruit in there and it's got a little bit of artificial grape in there from that purple punch that's definitely that's it in there I think it's probably the most well balanced of our papaya punch he knows as far as flavor goes and that consistency is honestly my favorite I like when I see large chunks and they're swimming in Terps so definitely that Jam was just it's something else that is beautiful I seriously could smell it earlier just sitting back here when it was sitting over there so I liked what you did with it for sure well what about terpenes in general their medicinal benefits I mean how do you think that plays a role into the medicinal benefits the high and whether you classify it as an indica sativa I think everybody you know takes terpenes in a little bit differently obviously some of the ones like limonene stuff like that are just known to generally give people a little bit more uplifting effects like that but as far as terpenes go it's really about finding a flavor that you enjoy in an effect that doesn't hinder your day really yeah if you smoked something that you really like but it's giving you anxiety obviously that might not be the strain for you you should find something you know with similar profiles that don't actually have that same terpene you know within the plant so if you like something fruity but you're getting horrible anxiety from lemon let's maybe try like a citrus yeah or another a strawberry banana or something like that where you know hey this tastes really good but it's not gonna cause me to freak out yeah strawberry banana is one of my favorites - it's super relaxing probably the heaviest indica of the fruity stuff that I've tried so I know a lot of people that love it definitely definitely so one thing I love about following you on instagram is that you're just always dropping knowledge helping push the community further for those of you who aren't following him on Instagram he's at a troz and Ryan check him out lots of great content out there so I feel like the first time I ever heard the term rosin jam it was from following you on Instagram can you comment did did you coin that phrase is there anything there it was kind of more of the people speaking we did a little survey and stuff we just wanted a different our selves a little bit um there was a huge craze going on at the time of people putting rosin in jars and this whole new tech that's going on and I really wanted to create a name that people think Jam they think olio but honestly it's kind of taken off we've noticed other people you know using the rosin Jam name and we really don't seem to mind we've had people in Spain posting rosin jam so I think there's a really awesome to see and it's just it's just our version of rosin sauce or you know just a just a new just a new consistency we're just trying to cone so definitely yeah consistency is everything when I'm looking for a product if typically I lean more towards the jams you know if I see something that's a little more buttery that's just not usually my flavor lots of people like the butter does it is all of reference a lot of people love the butter just for ease of dabbing people like to just dig in some people grab it with their hands and just drop a bomb right in there and just its ease of dabbing it's a preference some people don't want the rosin heat it up some people want it straight off the press and put in the fridge so we like to offer a product for everybody yeah if you want your Ross and put in the fridge we have classic coins um if you want butter we have butter if you want your stuff lightly heated we have a batter and if you want a true separation and you want your rasam to look like BHO a live resin consistency and you don't want to leave it in the fridge then the jam is for you no down so I've got a bunch of homies they nerd out on temperatures as far as pressing goes dabbing goes do you have like a perfect temperature range usually fall in when it comes to pressing and dabbing yes I do if you know if something is pretty melty I use usually stick around 180 degrees that's a nice low temp of times and stuff really vary between how much you put in the bag and what you're squishing and all that but I like 180 degrees it just really is like a nice golden you know point for me for sure yeah so what about the your actual rig or the nail have you ever played around with temperatures I have and stuff it's been a while I'm usually just a time kind of guy kind of figure out what my new nail you know Davin is I'll heat it up and kind of do a test or at 45 seconds you know on minute 30 kind of see what my nails I like a low time dab it uh I'm gonna be dabbing I like a little bit extra on the bottom I'll leave a little puddle sometimes I don't mind you're sure we'll be sure to keep it on the blue setting oh yeah yeah so when you typically take a dab how long does it take for you to feel the effects usually I'm and this is just me I usually feel the effects pretty instantly honestly me too I uh I'll take a dab of this stuff and be ready to go yeah you know it's it's pretty instant behind the eyes yeah yep do you get that with other extracts or do you think rosin high gloss hooker I think rosin in general and solvent listen general I feel throughout my body a little bit more I noticed when I dabbed BHO it's it's more of a head high uhm BHO always you know it feels a little more floaty to me uh rosin solvent list is always a little bit more body I feel a little bit more relaxation from it instantly definite so tell me a little bit about the the bubble hash side of things how are you guys washing what's the trick to getting this so it all starts in the grow so most of our stuff is it's very well taken care of throughout all of its life the veg has to be very clean the early flowering stages at the environment is a huge factor so that's all before the wash is really the plant when we take when we're harvesting no no trimmers even touch the nose they're all hold it you know by the stem cut off the nose and take little golf ball sized pieces really trying to not disrupt any trike formation that we've you know work so hard to grow so washing we use our all RO water it's all hand washed pretty much as gentle as you can wash bud they do it multiple times will wash four or five times just to ensure that all the heads are taken off it's done in a cold room it's all ROI sorrow water it's as clean as can be in there so yeah that's how you make clean Rossum's clean hash and a clean girl so you mentioned washing by hand why do you prefer that over say and automate it where I can just hit the button and it's just uh really control over you know your whole process you can stir as gently as you want you can have a machine that stirs pretty gently but just having that control that hand on it and really seeing how much you're taking off each plant and stuff like that it's that extra care that really goes into it that really just makes it that much better for sure well let's let's get to it yes you want to about here guess we'll switch on over to the blue temp there it's the lowest temperature we've got I've got a little new little guide tool too they do come in handy [Music] man that's just what I was looking for you can definitely get that sweep of pile on the front and then on the backend you've got that like earthy grape soda candy like it was it's definitely what I'm looking for I'm glad you enjoyed it man yeah I always um I always enjoy papaya but that uh that little extra little grape really adds something to it it's got like a little almost a spiciness almost to it it's just really good for sure so what are you feeling like effects wise right now what do you think I I love the relaxed feeling I get from this the clear-headedness good vibe to some music right now to there so I just love the effects just great for chilling yeah you know I've got a real calm my body's real relaxed but in my brain I've got that little tingle to it but it's still real clear yep perfect biking it's quick behind the eyes and stuff quick acting I still feel like I could you know get up and go do some stuff right now so it's perfect and it is some strong stuff dum papaya punch generally tests around 80% for us so I mean that's a pretty high THC content so sure yep the rest of it's pretty much chirps we've been getting regularly 20% turps with the jam it's probably a 5 to 8 percent increase over just having it out you know just fresh press so wow it's quite a significant difference yeah so if somebody was looking to get some of this sweet papaya grape soda candy where could they find that so yeah you can find our product pretty much all over Colorado it's in recreational and medical shops dispensaries we have a flagship dispo it's higher grade they offer recreational and medical at two different locations you're probably gonna have our your best bet you know finding some jam there but we also you know post drops all over our Instagram page at dabble leo 7:10 you can give us a follow I also have my personal page at Ross and Ryan so I usually post the flavors as soon as I make them people get a little anxious and always ask me where it's at it's gonna be about a week or two before testing and all the packaging gets ready usually about a week and usually the olio page is where you can find all the information the drops what you know pretty much where everything's going that you're looking for thanks for stopping by man really enjoy the papaya punch number four it's definitely gonna be one of my goat cheese for this summer for anybody out there is not following them on Instagram be sure to check out at Roz and Ryan always dropping knowledge about solving this extraction trying to push the industry forward and dab olio 710 that's where we got the papaya punch number four from highly recommend it I really appreciate you guys having me I always love talking hash and thanks again so much come down so after sitting on the high for a while you know I really found it interesting that I was getting a lot of sativa dominant effects or what you would think would be sativa dominant effects because they're both in economists trains that we're working with here you know we've got the papaya on one side we've got the purple punch on the other like I said both indica dominant so you would expect a sedative effect but what I found was something really uplifting and that's why I think it's the perfect Brosnan for summertime vacation because it was relaxing mentally but still energetic got a little euphoria from that so an all-around great summertime high and perfect for like I said any vacation any trip to the beach or the lake definitely be my go-to and thanks for tuning in guys be sure to like and subscribe below follow us on our IG Facebook at go peer

forms of BHO or butane hash oil produced by our expert extraction team at the lab these include butter shatter and live resin batter let's take a closer look at these three forms of concentrated cannabis products butter is a form of BHO that has an opaque warm taffy light quality this concentrate is created by extracting the cannabinoids and terpenoids ride and cured it is an oleoresin which following extraction is agitated over low heat to allow the solvent to evaporate creating a wax like non transparent extract this agitation causes THC a which is solid at room temperature to precipitate from the rest of the oil and crystallize butter has a reasonably high terpene profile as it is processed using low temperatures to preserve these sensitive flavor compounds shatter is a clear glass light concentrate that contains no bubbles and snaps at room temperature it is difficult to make due to its low heat requirement and length of time required in a vacuum oven to purge it of its solvent in shatter the cannabinoids terpenes and waxes are all mixed together in one phase and in a way that allows light to pass through the molecular structure the terpene content is typically lower in shatter as heat and vacuum contribute to the evaporation of compounds however the visual appeal of the product tends to supersede its flavor life resin batter is a terpene rich concentrate created by freezing and extracting the whole cannabis flower immediately after harvest this process preserves all the cannabinoids and turpentine the plant because the cannabis has not been dried or cured prior to extraction fewer terpenes have a chance to evaporate or degrade as a result the end product has a much stronger flavor profile because live resin contains higher levels of these liquid terpenes the final extraction tends to be more viscous than butter or shatter if you're curious for more information on cannabis concentrates or which extraction might work well for your needs please talk to your friendly budtender at the clinic today", "kMVMw1vmOuU": "welcome back everybody to the dab dungeon right with the boy King smart back at it again what's good y'all welcome back in the cut

box look and peace", "TjA1NEGXif0": "hey it's mad at Rafal stereos and welcome to a special three-part episode of canna basics first we're going to make dry ice cave then we're going to press it into rosin and then we want to convert that to e juice this episode is brought to you by dayz screens glass screens quality reusable glass screens and cleaning supplies are available at parley car Matic calm and we'll talk more about them later now in this first episode we're going to be making our own dry ice Keefe and of course we're gonna start with cannabis flowers to do that so the amount that you use is up to you but we're using about 10 grams and if you're using less than an ounce you'll want a one gallon bucket more than an ounce at a time you'll want 5 gallon buckets and then micron screens I'll put links to where you can find these micron screens on Amazon but they're bubble bags bubble hash bags there's what they're generally called and you'll need at least one about 120 or 93 microns around there and then probably a larger one like 220 you'll also want to make sure that you have some good protective gloves for your hands when dealing with frozen co2 because it's very very cold colder than regular ice and also you'll need about 10 pounds or less you usually have to buy it at 10 pounds at a time and that should be enough to do a couple ounces ok the first thing we're going to do is to load our bucket for this demonstration just to make it easy math we're using 10 grams of cannabis flowers we're going to put that directly into the bucket and then on top of that we're going to add our dry ice the dry ice I broke it into little smaller chunks with the hammer a minute ago and I'm using about pound and a half or so with this 10 grams [Music] and once it in there you want to cover it with your bag and for demonstration I'm using this - 20 microns green bag but you'd want to start with your smallest micron screen probably around 93 or I'm using a 120 micron but then once you have it in there you can just toss it around for 30 seconds to a minute just to make sure that everything is nice and cold before you start actually doing the shaking process okay so now we're going to go with our first run and this one I'm using the 120 micron which are smaller screen so once you have everything cold and children ready you're going to turn it upside down so that the cannabis and the dry ice falls on top of the screen and then you start shaking it gently up and down like a pepper shaker and make sure you have a nice clean surface I have a stainless steel table that's very clean but you could also use parchment paper [Music] and then after you've sifted and you start not getting much the sift coming out when you shake the bag it's time to start collecting it you can use a credit card or just a business card or some sort of flat edged material and then just grape it up and then you can put that on a parchment or into a bag or whatever you wanted to use to store it in we weighed this and we had just about a grand about three-quarters of a gram there so now we're going to switch and we're going to do a second run and then just kind of show you a demonstration of what the difference green sizes will do now we've got a two 20 micron which is almost double not quite double the size holes and you're gonna see now when we're starting the same plant material that we use before we're gonna get a lot more through of course we're getting through a lot now of plant material but this is a good way to make sure you're getting all of it out of your out of your cannabis all your THC [Music] and you'll see on the second run we've got a lot more than we did the first time like about five times more yield but the potency of this is going to be a lot less because you're getting a lot more plant material so for our purposes moving forward we're going to use this for cooking and different things like that and then the first batch that we use before is what we'll be using to press for our EGS in the end we're just showing you what we were able to achieve there we had 3.2 grams there just over three-quarters of a grand there so we had just over four grams of Keef in general which was about a 40% yield [Music] before we move on I would like to talk a little bit more about Daisy screens and thank them for sponsoring this video but Daisy screens are like your classic glass screens I remember these from back in the day and the 90s we used to use these kind of glass screens quite a bit but one thing that's really cool about them is other than they keep your bong a lot cleaner and you know a better way to smoke by using a screen is that they're reusable unlike the mesh screens that just burn through and wear out over time these glass screens as long as you keep up with them you can always bring them back to new put them back into your poll and so you're good so one pack of these our last year a lifetime so again visit polychromatic comm to learn more about their products and cleaning supplies make sure you stay tuned to roughhouse studios because our next video or our next canopy 6 video is going to be pressing this into rosin and then we're going to convert that into EGS so be sure to visit ruffhouse studios.com for hundreds of cannabis culture videos made just for you this is matt from FL studios thank you for watching [Music] you", "CAdtEFU2oy0": "sup buddy welcome back you glad you found the place well I told y'all he's gonna give you a little how-to and what's up so that's what we're going to do in this one in the last video we showed you how to prep your material in your tubes so if you ain't watch that when you trying to do this you might want to go and check that out but now let's go ahead and get on with showing you how to how to do the rest of this so what you're gonna do we've told you in the last one go ahead and refreeze your tubes after you pack them that's them over there so we've real froze them for ya bout 12 hours get your tubes ready and you get your water boiling alright so you're gonna have your water boiling on the stove and then once that starts boiling here's where all the fun starts so we come out here always always always do this outside don't ever ever ever ever try to do this anywhere covered or under anything or yeah that's I mean I ain't go I usually you know you don't have any slick baggy clothes or none of that dumb  on you know what I mean like nothing that's gonna create sparks no flannels nothing like that rubber soled shoes try to keep to a minimum so what you're gonna do is you take your hot water you put it in your square big pyrex dish right so then we float the pan that we're blowing into onto the water alright so what you're gonna do is you just float your little pan in the hot water you get your tube alright so we got our tube here it's all frosty ready to go we got our rubber bands down just a little ways from the lip you know what I mean by our cap now for this fresh frozen stuff you're going to create a whole lot of pressure that's gonna build up and if you don't do it right you'll blow this filter in a hole bunch of material another out into your pan and you don't want that so what you do to prevent that is you take like a hose clamp all right and then take your bandana and you wrap it around the tube anyway and then you take your hose clamp and you put your hose clamp around where the rubber band is usually rubber band it's like a gasket to hold the in there all right and then you always want to take something them pop down in the hole I take a little tiny metal screwdriver and poke down in the hole and clean it out and that really helps but make sure you keep that hole cleaned out and then you just go ahead and you're in two cans to 300 milliliter cans of butane they're each one of these little tubes and then after you've ran your second can you just shake your tube out into that pan there like I said you'll have to change the hot water in here about every three tubes all right so after you get it ran out into the pan and you wait till they'll be you know probably just a couple minutes and then the liquid like the actual butane liquid that's in the pan will start to evaporate off because the butane starts to evaporate I like 32 degrees or boil off it like 32 degrees so it'll start bubbling real big and then once all of the liquid is out and you're just left with the jelly oil kind of then that's when you want to blow your next tube into there and I don't never blow more than you know in a box you get about six tubes there's 12 cans so I never put more than than 12 cans so six tubes in one one pan once you get more than that it just starts to kind of saturate and you're not really it's just too much to work with but don't just keep blowing and filling the pan up always run the the butane out let the butane purge off from the heat eat before you just fill the pan up that's how you have accidents always always always keep your fire extinguisher over there and keep your assistant decide so keep all your together all right so that'll be this one that's how to blow the the next one will go ahead and run you through a little bit about how to purge it come on back now stay safe", "7ToVjMC-FlU": "what's going on guys welcome back to my very first video and first review today we're going to be reviewing the new roach pocket vapes these are pretty new from my understanding these are pretty new to the market especially out here in california so i thought we might as well make a video about it um i went ahead and pulled up the page of these new pocket vapes these roach vapes now i have not tried them yet so it's gonna be a first for me designed by tma labs in california tma lapse is a full service vape cartridge manufacturer from concept to manufacturing we control the entire process and ensure results for every client now this is the world's smallest fully disposable vape cartridge as you guys can see now this thing should have a battery and everything i shouldn't mean nothing with this thing so let's go ahead and turn back on the camera here it seems we've got some hybrid sour cherry pie and my addition is up there as you guys can see is two thousand two thousand eight hundred fifty one out of four thousand eighty eight so these are exclusive to an extent there's only about a certain amount per stream that they'll produce so let's go ahead and figure out how to open this up okay it looks like we got a pamphlet here love it toke it fill it pass it plug it sneak it rip it hit it roach it then recycle it okay i'm liking it presentation is good now in california it's not a standard to have a whole box beautiful set up like this but for the disposables i believe they do require it you can't just throw these in a bag now let's go ahead and open this up so as we can see we're going to go ahead and slice that open let's use using a little nail for this all right it's a little difficult to open up i'll say that all right all right now i gotta say that the name kind of throwing me off a little bit you know what i mean like some raid roach sprayer type of vibram you know what i'm saying but wow this thing really is small wow jesus and i mean that is some dark juice right there now i am going to take pictures of this for you guys as well and i'll display them in the video all right that looks pretty cool as you guys can see it's not that dark but it is pretty dark let's see if we can add some light on there wow that is badass and i mean that's battery included okay so we put some light up to the juice yeah it's pretty dark it's not the clearest but that does not matter let's go ahead and give her a taste all right so i guess we just hit it this now you guys may have not seen the hit come out but it definitely felt it definitely felt the peak when they hit flavor wise i can taste the sheer cherry it does take tastes a bit dark though like like an indica kind of heavy which ain't bad but you definitely have that indica taste with it now it is a hybrid we will take another hit for the video's sake but you know give me a minute there boys wow so far i mean i packed a punch in that hit if i'm not mistaken okay yeah this is sour cherry pie all right all right let's get real here one more fire now you guys are probably asking yourself how much i paid for this now these do go for 40 and i believe says 380 milligrams so i think we're looking at a half honestly but who knows how much wax is in this it does seem like quite a bit i will post in the comments how long it lasted me i'm not gonna go ahead and straight smoke this for the next couple days because i mean i plan on doing a ton of reviews for you guys i got a bunch of new stuff i got some i haven't smoked this one yet either bloom imperial extracts i have tried one of their cards pretty damn fire um i got cure pods for days you know we'll give them bad boys a shot it's all right and i'm gonna be honest with you guys if i don't recommend something i'll let you know none of this stuff is sponsored i do get 25 discounts to most of the dispensaries i go to because that's because i have a chronic health issue but needless to say forty dollars this packed punch now is it worth 40 dollars half a gram i'd say yes you know you don't have to have a battery it is portable now i'm not sure if you guys can charge these that's the only reason i never buy these is because you can usually run in the chance of them dying out on you now it is not common but i've had bad luck before but yeah needless to say this is the roach cartridge i appreciate all of you for tuning in to this video leave it a like for me guys and leave a comment down below if you tried this or plan to try it and subscribe to channel if you haven't already um this channel is not all about reviews i mean we're going to be hanging out too so i have a lot of stuff in store for this channel and yeah i appreciate you guys now i will recommend this cart to you guys if you need something quick on the go if you don't have a battery pick up a roach cart i mean you ain't gonna lose 40 bucks half a gram that is a bit steep but then again you got you guys got to think about it it has its own battery and it's the smallest bit we vape cartridge in the world right now come on i mean i say it's worth it let me know what you guys think down in the comments below i appreciate you for checking out this video give me your time and i'll see you in the next one signing out",

Florida medical marijuana reviews coming at you with another hybrid rasen here from truly this hybrid is lemon OG Kush now this is a dandy little strain that seems perfectly nucleated from their process tied up with their Blue River rosin team this rosin truly carried over those lemon notes from the strains well the terpenes didn't seem to burn off though there was no separation so you didn't get any of your liquid Terps with your Roz and it was all nucleated perfectly together I have to say this was a great strain for anyone looking for an intense and medication thanks again for watching

yields using the directional flow method as well as show you how I butter the rosin after being pressed [Music] let's go over the items we're going to be using during this week's episode we're going to need parchment paper any brand will do I always go with the unbleached version pressing bags I ordered these online in a custom size to fit my pressing plates perfectly allowing me to maximize the amount that can be pressed at a single time as for micron science I go with the 37 micron because I mainly deal with ice water hash or teeth if you're going to be pressing flour but with ninety micron and I always remember to double bag your product a couple Dobb tools and a set of tweezers lastly obviously the material I'll be pressing you already know from the title we're going to be doing a single press of one ounce the material I'll be pressing is fresh frozen ice water hash this was from one of my previous grows it's a blend of green crack barber bud and Harley Quinn bx4 this is also material that's been freeze-dried I'll be doing a video shortly covering how I made the ice water hash and using my freeze dryer so be sure to hit that subscribe button you can notified when that gets posted as you can see the material is getting pretty sticky once it comes out of the fridge making it very difficult to talk the pressing baked properly [Music] using one of my job tools I packed though ice-water house down into the bag as evenly as possible my hand I give it a good pre-press evening out the material as best as I can at this point the ice water hash has already become warm and it's very sticky not allowing it to be moved around much in the bag [Music] for today's press we're going to be utilizing the directional flow method a benefit of using it is that it allows you to watch the flow during the press you can see the flow from start to finish allowing you to adjust the variables accordingly this becomes very helpful at all stages as you're about to see I forgot to double bag my material which resulted in my bag being unfolded squishing out the ice water hash out the one end this became noticeable immediately allowing me to stop the press right away unfortunately I forgot to record me collecting the material and just putting a second bag over the other [Music] [Music] I stopped the first pressed short not noticing the flow of the rosin still happening [Music] I then folded the pressing bag in half and did a second press giving additional amount of yield [Music] letting the freshly pressed live hash rasa sit for a few minutes allow it to cool carving the rosin eyelet cooler temperature helps with a collection of it using a long-handled dab tool makes the collection of the rosin very easy since the second press was very short I'm going to collect all the rosin together after collecting it all into one patty I like to put it into a glass jar it's process butters the rosin to texture I find more appealing [Music] I simply put the glass shard in between the two plates with the lid tightly screwed on and let it sit for about one hour at 150 degrees Fahrenheit then I open the jar stir the rose and whip it around mix it up place it back in between the plates I had a hundred degrees Fahrenheit for ten hours after the ten hours I collect the rosin out of the jar and place it into a storage container if you enjoyed this video

"dc9wL5oTNWE": "[Music] Cannabis itself has been has been consumed for thousands of years and ever since people have been consuming cannabis they've been making cannabis concentrates and typically how these concentrates are made or just beating the raw material to extract the trichome heads and make what's called hash and there's a lot of plant material mixed in with this concentrate hash needs to be smoked hash oil can be vaporized there's actually no plant material involved hi I'm Mike I work with Rosen technologies I helped develop the pneumatic rosin press [Music] [Music] typically what people do to produce oil these days is with the solvent they'll take a solvent and they'll run out and over the plant material to where it dissolves all of the essential oils the problem went that way is there's those people that take butane and they pour it through glass to very unsafe settings like in a garage and one of the reasons we're so excited about this method of extraction it gives people a way to be able to get these essential oils of the plan without solvents you take the cannabis you put it under the heat and the pressure the oil will run from the heat and now you have just the oil separated from the plant material this is a cannabis oil that is made from just heat and pressures hi I'm David with rasen technologies I'm the innovator of the pneumatic rosin French we designed this product around being able to control that extractions right here at the top you have the digital readout the temperature that the heat Playstore at top and bottom is both heated on the side over here you have the ability to adjust the pressure we also have the two-hand anti tie-down features that keeps the user from being able to have their hand caught in this machine when operating this is actually an OSHA certified design just in case anybody action only took a toke and isn't paying attention they're not gonna hurt themselves yes you could say I'm that type of person that just builds things out of necessity if I'm doing something on a daily and I want to make it better make it more convenient then I'll go out and make something that does that for me we're perfecting our art I feel like it's always interesting to me to see something go to the next extent I think it benefits everybody to see the cannabis industry have an evolution forward [Music]", "85BWqQdZ47Q": "[Music] how's everybody doing today welcome back to pines trees cannabis reviews a 21 and over cannabis review channel out of the state of pennsylvania today we got something exciting guys no bs drove pretty far to get this one um and was suggested it by by you guys honestly um drew has been hitting me up he's probably one of the people i talked to the most on the channel he uh he comments a lot and he's a really nice guy and drew this one is for you buddy today without any further ado we got some rhythm concentrates rhythm gti oh heck yeah buddy uh this is not a thing that is in my dispensary often so or ever if if at all that i have seen um so i drove quite a bit of a way uh to pick this up but i also haven't been able to get any of the new moxie stuff which is like driving me out of my mind because everybody says the new stuff is fire and they started dropping whole grams so when i went and got this i also got some moxie some of that new new uh i'm very excited to be reviewing what does what i would call my favorite company um until today maybe we'll see rhythm might steal that title but so yes to keep things fresh and to keep things uh you know progressing naturally is the way they should uh you know had to go out of the way had to get a little out of the comfort zone and drive quite a distance but we got it we got that rhythm gti and we got that new moxie drop so it's all for you guys i just need to i don't need to i just want to do the reviews of the new stuff anytime i see something new that i haven't ever seen before oh do i get excited so how's everybody doing how's everybody's long hair there's mine oh yeah look at that long hair don't care guys oh it's like a took a mix between james van der beek from dawson's creek sean hunter from boy meets world and butthead from beavis and butthead and a bit of a mullet thing because i keep trimming up the sideburns but i'm not cutting the whole thing because i wear a hat all the time so no need to butcher my own head so let's get into it what we have i hate doing this i do not like holding jars the wrong way but for the sake of the video what we have today is brownie scout brownie scout by rhythm gti brand new company brand new company for me to review haven't had any real gti offerings locally so this is exciting i'm gonna go ahead and crack into it because oh there you go check that out well find your rhythm on the inside of the box i like a nice packaging i feel like i'm paying for it i might as well enjoy it these jars are very nice uh kind of a rounded jar very cool i like the blue lid says rhythm in the top from the looks of the bottom we have fire but before we get into it let's get into the numbers rhythm relax live resin strain brownie scout this is an indica this is not a hybrid this is a straight up indica and from what i've read and heard about it it's a heavy hitter so let's get down to the cannabinoids we have thc coming in at zero percent thc a coming in at eighty point one percent cbd coming in at zero cbga coming in at 3.3 percent and cbg coming in at 0.1 for a total cannabinoid uh readout of 83.8 percent so 83.5 should be good but let's get on to the terps because that's where all our flavor comes from and honestly i'm hoping that this stuff is good medicine because i don't know if it's going to rain actually i know it's going to rain soon because my arthritis is flaring up my back hurts uh my hand is on fire this hand is terrible um so yeah guarantee you within within the week it will rain that is for sure and hopefully this helps me not feel like crap because of the change in barometric pressure so let's get into the terps limonene 2.6 mercene 2 percent beta car 1 pinin 0.5 percent tropinaline 0.4 humaline 0.4 percent for a total of 8.9 terps so this stuff is terpe it is going to be good and i bet that that's where the heavy hitter aspect comes from i bet this is a heavy hitter because of the total amount of turbines inside of it eight point nine percent that is that's a lot um yeah that's very exciting so the price on these these are expensive these are 80 bucks a gram um not the best but if what i've been hearing from my friends is true and this stuff is worth 80 bucks a gram all day long so we're gonna find out let's give it a smell oh goodness let's give it a look oh yeah oh wow that's different oh that lime comes through really really like a really sweet lime but oh there's something in there that smells amazing i don't know what it almost smells like a it almost has a cocoa smell but for that to be mixing with this smell of limonene it's very different very different i could sit here and smell this all day wow so it looks like straight fire let's see if i can get this to to do it no it's because it's not a cell phone there we go look at that that is some sugar oh mama look at the color on this i think we have a winner so the color is amazing um gold nothing but the nicest color gold it's not very wet looking let's try to get this closer right it's not wet but it's full of terps which is very odd makes me believe that the the fact that we all think that that sauce that our [ __ ] is sitting in is the terp sauce well this stuff is almost 10 terps and almost zero sauce i would say none at all so that's kind of strange um [Music] what are we at 6 26. we're going up to 650 i've really been enjoying taking hits at 6.50 they milk up very nicely 650 is like since the whole uh pandemic quarantine thing 650 has been the number i have been taking my dabs at just because i want it a little hot but not too hot all right man this stuff is crazy so as far as the price goes average for the quality as far as the the color the look of it i give it a 10 out of 10 for sure this stuff looks like it's amazing it's just some sugary diamondy like and the color the color is beautiful it's it's like a translucent gold it's weird because like it's very light in color but it's there but you could almost like you feel like you could almost see through it but yeah as far as smell 10 out of 10 i'm probably gonna sit around and smell this for after this video after i get nice and medicated i'll probably sit around and smell this jar and try to figure out exactly all the smells i smell in it but uh i get a lot of lime from that limonene but it's weird in the back of it like like a muted almost smell in the back of the profile i almost get like a cocoa which is weird almost like a chocolate so yeah definitely going to need to get into this a little more now let's let's get into the taste and the effects 650 nice and hot everything's nice and clean as it should be just gonna let that melt down nice and slow do a little around the world action let's get her [Music] whoa whoa that taste get the lime and then you get a like a real a punch of that that it's like earthy and like chocolatey almost all in the background wow wow i wonder what their extraction process is this is top notch [Music] [Music] wow okay so that one's weird um wow uh the flavors are amazingly unique i don't think i've tried anything that tastes quite like that yet um the best way i can describe it is like lime and then like something about it reminds me of like dark chocolate which is really weird i know it's coming from the that earthy end of the spectrum sorry about that uh it's definitely coming from the car and the murse like but it's very like it's enjoyable and unique and kind of amazing ah this is a surprise it's a very nice surprise i'm almost speechless so i'm already getting the effects it is absolutely an indica for sure kind of hit all at once um it's probably going to be the kind of thing that makes it hard to talk so you'll have to bear with me if i get all dumb in the mouth um that's because indicas make me a little slow make my brain work a little bit less so the best way to describe the effects of this i love indica i am a indica smoker i prefer it i like to mellow out normally i'm not as mellow of a person i probably on the outside as a person project is a very mellow person 99 percent of the time but if i'm not medicated i'm not mellow in my mind i just you know there's a lot going on up there and i prefer an indica because it kind of takes that away and this is that this is definitely uh you want to stop thinking about some stuff that's been bothering you this is the one like uh i don't like to admit it but since the whole pandemic coveted thing i've had a bit of stress about it and i just deal with it the way i deal with it i don't project on people i don't like i don't even talk to anybody about it really i just deal with it internally and you know work it out like people do but this stuff this is kind of stuff that's going to make you just not care you know like yeah this has got that special ingredient in it that i don't care so yeah be careful with this i don't recommend smoking this before work i'm glad that's not a thing right now because i'd be having an i don't care kind of day so this stuff is super heavy hitting um probably because of the terps and the fact that it's 84 but this stuff is this stuff is heavy medicine i probably shouldn't even be doing a second dab but i want to taste it i'm all about the flavor so we're going in foreign [Music] i had to put a lid on this this stuff is dangerous oh my goodness this stuff is so tasty in such a unique way oh my goodness so this stuff gets a 10 out of 10. now that doesn't happen often but i feel like i feel like my last two were both tens but you got to consider the facts um this stuff is super strong wow so if you're looking for some strong medicine and you have a lot of pain pick up rhythms brownie scout it's crazy um don't over medicate especially if you're the kind of person who that's a problem for i'm not the kind of person that could ever really say they've could reach the point of over medicating but i'll tell you what if you're kind of a lightweight i haven't been smoking for very long start small don't go big um yeah this stuff is good this stuff is like durr i'm gonna derp out and just stare at the tv for a couple hours yeah wow so this gets a 10 out of 10. this is this is good um i'm gonna have to make fun of myself in the edits probably because i'm gonna look real stoned i can already tell this is like some heavy eyes some smile because you can't control it this is yeah you can like feel it this it feels like somebody's giving your brain a nice warm hug you know it's like somebody reached into my head and just said i'm gonna give your brain a hug it's gonna feel amazing this is yeah why is wow why is rhythm not available near me why do i keep kicking my tripod why are words hard i'll tell you why brownie scout holy crap so i'm stoned i don't feel anything i bet i could i'm not gonna do anything stupid but i bet i could karate chop some [ __ ] not that i should or would or anything like that but yeah i bet i could do some work for hours without anything so if you get a chance pick up brownie scout gti two thumbs up pine stoned seal of approval uh yeah i don't have much to say after that if you like the videos subscribe hit the thumbs up hope you guys are getting stoned with me um leave comments in the comment section i guarantee you i'm gonna get some comments this time like bro you got way way higher than i've ever seen you get like no [ __ ] and the flavor oh man i'm telling you get that limonene but then something about it in the background it's kind of like like i guess the closest thing i could relate earthy to is tastes like dark chocolate kind of like bitter but like good you know how dark chocolate is so yeah sorry for rambling on i got real real stoned um probably won't make the probably won't make the review for the moxie till tomorrow because i feel like i'm going to ride this train for the rest of the day wake up fresh and then make a new one because this one's gonna this is gonna last a while i think so should be good hope you guys are having a great time i hope you enjoy the videos and i'll see in the next one peace you", "cHz4xTYET24": "howdy howdy there beautiful people guys are all having a amazing start to your day night whatever the hell you're watching this hope it's going great for you we've got a little video here I haven't really done many of these but a lot of other cannabis content creators do these videos and I think a lot of people enjoy it we've got some strain reviews coming up today and of course we're starting with the hottest hash on the alerting rec market happy cabbage farms so happy cabbage farms they came into camp in probably about four months ago I don't know exactly when they came on to the Oregon rec market but at the time it was a pretty Minzy era in the Oregon rec market here in Benton there was just a lot of the companies have really slipped towards the end of the summer and a lot of their stuff really wasn't tasting as good as it was towards the beginning of the summer then comes heavy cabbage farms with hash robison and we don't see hot rods in a lot in the rec market because it's such an expensive and kind of niche product there's not very many people that are searching to pay a lot of money for hash rasam but when you [ __ ] try this hash frozen you're just sucked right on back in guys it is ridiculous this stuff I will tell you I have tried tons of hot rods and a lot of the times I'm going to say that's my favorite hat rosin because I don't get to try it very often happy cabbage now has been around for about four months and they are a group in our circle it's just been around I've gotten to dab it a lot and I've gotten to dab a lot of other hash rosin because I don't have to pay for it other people have it and I will tell you guys there's a couple strands that I have not liked from them but these four right here that I have are so titties I would stick my face between all of them and motorboat myself to death this is hands-down the best half rosin I have ever smoked and it's on the wreck more kit if you are over 21 you can buy this you don't have to [ __ ] buy it black market you don't have to pay the $120 for black market six star hash rosin it gets it cannot expensive for a while there guys so to see a company coming out with stuff that's between sixty and seventy five dollars and medic maybe even cheaper than that that's super impressive and just such a breath of refreshing air so this guy I've got open right here first thing when I open it this is the purple starburst og six star like just what in there is just a bad thing to say let's take a look at what we going got going on in this jar alrighty here we have the purple starburst og 6 star you guys can see it's nice and flaky there's no real huge clumps partly because I dabbed a lot of them partly because it is 6 star and it is just gorgeous look at that color sorry for the shaking I'm filming on my phone they check that out just absolutely gorgeous I am completely enthralled with the look of this rosin I'm enthralled with the look as well as the smell a second you open up this up you get hit in the face with the real ocean groan oh gee smell and it's been a long time since we've gotten that we're getting more chem more gassy oh geez out here this is real ocean groan oh gee and then on the end of it is like this almost faint hint of like purple lavender not in a floral way at all but in a very very gassy way like I can't even begin to explain this we're gonna go ahead and take it yeah we got two rigs out today we first we're gonna start out with the prophecy glass and get a little function shot and I'll shop for you guys we don't have the cleanest rigs or bangers today just kind of caught me on an off cleaning day but maybe we should still be able to see that function right we're gonna start off with the purple starburst it guys this stuff is absolutely amazing I cannot tell you how much I recommend going and trying just the strain right here all of happy cabbage farm is fantastic this strain right here hands down my favorite let's go ahead and get her heat it up and get into some freakin turf skies I am excitement for this video you can not believe how hard it is to have four jars of happy cabbage sitting in a drawer knowing you can't smoke it because you have to come with it it's literally heartbreaking I also want to give them a huge shout out for sponsoring the 420 of it at the Pacific Circle that was absolutely amazing they set up a tab bar anybody that came by could have their stuff a company that produces this high a product of this high quality of product just allow anybody to come up and smoke it no no [ __ ] questions asked is just amazing huge shout out to them for that call that good set a timer for 45 seconds alright we're gonna go ahead get in here and scoop ourselves out a nice flaky dab of this gorgeous six star here we go guys first dab of the half cab farms Cheers [Music] oh good lordy that is so delicious straight to the head immediately my whole head warm fuzzy dice feels delicious but you just know media we have strongest it because it hits you momentarily after you take it down man is a good video to be filming guys yeah I also got to say this is mind-bending how good that flavor is and how much flavor there is usually with a lot of even really good tasting dabs only a small percentage of flavor this there is a large percentage of flavor in that [ __ ] strain it is amazing how much you get out of it I love it for our first thing to have in the morning like if you got one dab to set your whole day straight that's it right there that purple starburst og alright move on to the next string I believe this one was a collab width Oh pull on a stick and throw it into my house I rip the [ __ ] alright I threw the Box away in the heavy collab on it [ __ ] oh no without gaps in garden Gadsden Gardens okay this one is a collab with Gadsden garden and this is Tropicana punch now this one has a much much different look to it let me give you guys an initial smell test it was like pomegranate and man what is that that is a good [ __ ] smell right there it was like pomegranate and fish I'm not like just weed but the actual cush like when you're exhaling a cush strain it smells like that oh man that's delicious now this one has a much different look to it way more waxy was this one what was this one called no just Tropicana punch hash rosin not six-star not their batter or their jam just hash shots but still absolutely delicious looking kind of looks like peanut butter and this was not what I do what it looked like when they gave it to me when it was cold it was much much more pretty and hadn't like waxed up into this solid state yet still [ __ ] beautiful we're gonna switch it up we've got the DBE 503 slimeball rig all ready to go over here a dab of this junk ambush I believe this is the one that gave me a job on the night of 4/20 and I was just absolutely mind blown by how good the flavor of it was so much rudiness to it but still keeping a really nice base in the OG gas cushy that kind of a chem that kind of a taste so I'm keeping it sweet waste in there but still having some food on top I'm a big fan of fruity strains but when I have to smoke all day every day it's not my favorite I really really want the Kim gasps og scum push stuff like that all right that's all set a timer 45 seconds that's not that's not the right dance isn't it there was a dude I'm just gonna stop him all right if vijaya tease this one's a lot easier to load up I'm just gonna take this a nice big chunk here boom I am gonna be so blitzed by the end of this guy's four dabs of hatch rosin and that I haven't gotten into this yet but I'm sure you guys read the title we're taking out Widowmaker at the end but yeah let's do it [ __ ] drop the dead Cheers [Music] [Music] get right with that safe before really really fruity but it keeps its [ __ ] feet planted firmly in a nice little og tastes good very clean - I mean like of course there's no solvents in it but a lot of other people's half-frozen I get a a wheezing in my lungs and that's usually the reason I stay away from hats Rossum as you guys can hear [Music] there is some coffee but there's no wheeze and that is what I love about this stuff it just seems so clean so pure you're tasting exactly what this amazing weed was meant to taste like guys we're going nips out go the [ __ ] nips out Jesus Christ two tabs of hash rosin in we've got the purple starburst and oh wait no the Tropicana punch and the purple starburst yeah okay yes yes boom so we've got punch breath up next this is their jam and this one unfortunately has slowly disintegrated in a series of very unfortunate dabs that were completely unavoidable but I think a little bit left so we have something for this video right here I'm gonna zoom the camera in so you guys can see it's really really clear and very very light in color but it is so ganbei good I can't even begin to tell you guys how many Terps they've got packed into that gorgeous little [ __ ] doing GM glove there when you get in this one it immediately has like a purple smell I use that to describe a lot away I don't know what the purple smell is I don't know what I'm describing there I'm sure there's some people out there that are gonna be like yeah and there's some people are gonna be like what the [ __ ] he's that high already but it does it smells purple purple with a hint of fruit punch on the end that's exactly what I'm getting clenched breath and it's really really cool how true their flavors are guys like you can't even begin to tell you how many other hot rods and strings like taste we're like this one's strong in and you taste it that's great it's amazing how many people just they'll name their strains anything just because that's what's hype that's what's selling right now these guys they've just got some fire a sweet in fire ass hash on the way out switching it back up again to the prophecy glass for our punch breath dab here I'm gonna go ahead and heat this up man guys given that Widowmaker at the end it's gonna be so brutal I have already baked like a cupcake my gourd is gone stone to the bone I just [ __ ] rent I think you guys a good idea of how ripped I am I've taken two gaps and I already am starving I don't feel like I need a turf map two naps like I thank you I'm taking seven gram damage guys this we just took like maybe point one maybe and I'm already ready for a turf down at the end of this I'm going to pass out right here after I've ordered new greens call it good BAM wham Shazam set timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla alright let's go ahead scrape ourselves out some of this leaving just enough left to put into our Widowmaker jab guys we got we got some crazy stuff going with a maker jab this punch breath was definitely one of my favorites it was a lighter high than the six star starburst og but had just about the same percentage of flavor it's fan-fucking-tastic really allowed me to go about my day if I was smoking it in the morning before say a meeting or something it would be really good for that not if you were gonna go out and want a dad that was gonna last you three to four hours that would be the purple starburst six star that stuff is just [ __ ] tits it is so strong BAM Thank You Carla let's take this damn choose people it's tons tons and tons of flavor [Music] [Music] now we got the sweats going big time holy Jebus how is it is hot in here oh my god keeping you close holy [ __ ] this was a good fight hey promised the Widowmaker again oh [ __ ] turf sweats aren't [ __ ] real oh my god whoa next up we got some margarita punch six star don't let the nips cool off for a second here wow that overheated a needle is in the red Oh rubbie oh my god I completely forgot we have water over here not sponsored by but shout out the can event for carrying the happy cabbage four guys are in Central Oregon looking for a place to pick this stuff up get a man got it they got so many different strains oh yes we got one left guys we've got the margarita place six star same with the starburst og let's go ahead and take peak here in this jar very very flaky but it is all stuck together none of it is gonna fall out I don't believe ya all stuck in there when I first got it was flaky like if you sneezed it would go everywhere like a pile of blow it was pretty [ __ ] flaky oh man oh man this one probably actually I'm gonna have to take my my vote back for the smell this one has better smell than the purple starburst dojin form starburst oh gee I do believe tastes better but god damn margarita punch they're definitely a hint of that tropic punch in there but there is a kick what is that kick gasps that is straight gasp oh man yeah once you get past that punch just gassy oh that is good it doesn't have the og smell of the purple starburst I mean it is just Tropicana punch instead of deep purple starburst OG um but it does have a massive undertone of some gassy flavors go ahead keep the slime ball ring up last one and probably take a little two-minute walk around the house and then we're gonna dive into that way a but nothing's more currently done I am so big guy so I can feel my hind legs coming down [ __ ] just set a timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla thank you very much I can feel my eyelids coming down like heavy hard it is I'm gonna be in for a real long afternoon here we got a photo we got the Gus glass show circle tonight [ __ ] I'm gonna be licking windows all night long guys so yeah super flaky super super potent smell let's get some [ __ ] taste in here oh yes oh yes wants to scrape it all off the bottom it is super flaky again yep all right we got a margarita punch six star and hash browns and over here I bring a ball right up in clothes for you guys kitchens function off the first initial hit oh my god I need a new cord after this video it's not even baked out of it it's just oh [ __ ] cheers everyone a lot more gas when you smoke it less of the push flavor than the go wow they're really not my favorite in terms of flavor definitely not bad whatsoever it's still delicious I'm probably ranked this number three the Tropicana punch probably be my least favorite out of the four but honestly I would buy all four strains again thanks they say that they're that good all scraped up on a piece of paper see if we can get it um damn er and then we will take a lap mop it off a bit and take this [ __ ] Widowmaker all those cobbles alright we got our four grams right here I have completely forgotten which one goes to which cap so that will be interesting we're just going to go ahead and see if we can take this damper here and get some of each of these on here it's not going to be a monster dabbe but I mean big enough for some fun boom

everybody cupid's here and today we're going to talk about the three most common types of cod concentrate shatter crumble and butter or wax as it's sometimes called now the names of concentrates usually refer to either the extraction method or the consistency some people refer to all concentrates as wax but we'll try to get into the details because it can be confusing and there's no dictionary definition on some of these yet so you will hear people using one term for multiple things for multiple terms for one thing so when i first started buying legal concentrates in colorado in like 2014 like 95 of the concentrate options were shatter crumble and butter or wax as it's sometimes called and a lot of times all three of these would be called wax or having a sale on wax it would refer to any cured resin that they had so most of what i would get was bho but all this is ethanol extraction and they're still using these terms because we can still come out with these consistencies and it's interesting because this crumble in my opinion is uh more waxy or buttery than the wax and the wax looks a little more crumbly than the crumble it just goes to show you that the terms aren't exact not all crumble is a hundred percent the exact same consistency not all waxes it's just general terms to try to keep them categorized like shatter for example shatter usually refers to as the lighter clear stuff that you can feed through you can't really see through any of the other ones in this one i go to break off a piece it should snap off but there's different types of shatter i mean i've had glass like shatter where it doesn't bend at all it's not malleable in any way it snaps when you try to fold it there's shatter that's called pull and snap where it's a little bit stretchier you can kind of stretch pieces off and they snap off eventually it's still shattered but it's a little bit more malleable and then i've also seen really sappy shatters where it looks like this but just a slightly melted or a slightly warm version shatter is probably the most popular out of the three of these and most people would think that this is the best it can have higher thc percentages but sometimes that means lower terpene percentages now these these two the crumble and the wax are very similar consistency a lot of the crumble that i've been getting in florida is really really dry sometimes crumble ends up looking like that where it's just really dry kind of powdery this video is brought to you by boom head shop the loudest online head shop they carry all kinds of bongs dab rigs vaporizers accessories cleaning products and more check them out and you can save up to 20 off with the cupid's code that's boomheadshop.com when you're making shatter you usually spend a little more time purging out all the fats and lipids when you're making that butter consistency sometimes you'll whip it up while you're purging it so as far as differences goes they're all very similar they'll have similar tastes they'll vaporize basically about the same it's just how they're handled now i don't really like crumble and shatter that much they're my least favorite they're the hardest to handle concentrates in my opinion if you get a really hard shatter it'll break off when you try to go get a piece or crumble sometimes it's really hard to handle really hard to scoop it's super dry sometimes it just smears all over the container and you're trying to get it off and there's just a thin film of it on the inside so i'm hoping this video gives you a little insight on the consistencies the terms aren't too literal they can mean a variety of things there's a bunch of different things you could call shatter a wax or crumble that would fit the criteria or fill that category when i first got into dabbing shatter was my favorite i thought because it had the highest thc percentage that it was going to be the best one oh man biggest numbers in this one but then i learned after several incidents of handling it losing some it was my least favorite to deal with it's usually the least flavorful out of the three there so out of the three i would say butter is my absolute favorite crumble and shadow are [ __ ] i hate those consistencies they're the worst anyway if you like this video don't forget to subscribe to the channel for more content check out my twitch streams and twitch tv cupids i might be live right now", "ezRzBxPQpbI": "when you know that this is $75 and you're getting a big scoop of it I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there [ __ ] it this video is for mature audience if you're not a mature audience this video is not for you what's up everybody Cubans here and today we are going to get into some rather expensive concentrates I picked up a gram of some hash rosin today that was priced at $75 and it is one of the most expensive grams of concentrate I have ever purchased so let's take a close look at what we got I've had a gram of Summit connoisseurs genetic and concentrates Tiger's milk and this stuff looks like a nice little slab of peanut butter I'm pretty excited pretty excited abot both so you can get a look at the packaging here this is that Tiger's milk and it's testing at about seventy nine percent THC and then it does have a little bit of CBD a in there but you know what I am so excited for this let's just take it down where are my clothes at let's get a nice nice little scoop here out of the email all fresh and clean and I'm gonna see how it does does [Music] um yeah that was really good I'm gonna actually throw that on a courts now I'm gonna throw that around on a few nails and see if we like it but just to compare I picked up some cheap dabs this cost 75 a gram for some hash rasen 75 bucks for this it's pretty expensive most most of my concentrates I usually find deals and get a lot of good looking stuff like this this is some live batter I got for about 15 bucks a gram one-fifth of the price now sometimes I find live sugars live diamonds of batters around that 15 to 20 dollar price if I'm getting it on a deal it's not the everyday price so begin the deal you can get this stuff cheap so it's really interesting to pay five times as much for a single gram of concentrate I can't I can't believe I did it it's still interesting to me that this costs five times as much as this other gram of some delicious looking stuff but some hash rods and it's hard to come by especially here in Colorado Springs it's not super common to find rosin hash rosin so I guess you got to pay that top dollar because it's so rare but let's get some more dabs of this cone I'm not done with this yet let's see what I'm gonna do some cold starts when you know that this is $75 and you get in a big school but I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there okay [Music] it's throwing out a couple bucks in that [ __ ] it [ __ ] it and get a little bit more I need about three-fitty oh we got it okay okay just pricey tab right here damn it all right let's get a nice cold start here and see if it's super delicious on the court oh damn well damn okay okay that's good stuff so I just stabbed it a couple of times here and it's pretty good stuff but is it is it worth it is it worth paying five times as much as I do for some good live banner is it worth is it worth paying five times as much to get some solvent once that's basically the major difference is the fact that it's solvent list most concentrates are made with a solvent it's the easier method it's the most common method but with rosin they use heat and pressure to make it so they just basically squish the THC or they squish the extract out of the nugs or out of hash most of the time they'll make a hash and then they'll press the hash and that's what this is this is a this is hash rosin so it's a little bit more expensive and my understanding is the yield is a little bit lower it's it's a process to make the hash and then when you press the hash you wouldn't get the same type of yield as if you were doing like a butane or propane extraction so I think part of the process is it's a little bit harder to get high-quality product and you're typically going to get less with whatever amount of plant material you go into the process with so I think that affects the price it is pretty rare out here in Colorado Springs not a lot of people are pressing - I can find it in a few places some places have rosin and half chosen but it's not as common as BHO and pho and there's so many dispensaries that grow their own bud and they do their own in-house extractions so something like this I can I can pretty much get really cheap any day of the week if I'm looking around so for me to pay five times as much for this it's a little little far-fetched I honestly I'd rather have five grams of this and haven't done but yet and it's just I like volume I like to do a lot of dub so I'm gonna go back and forth on these we're gonna compare I just want to shave this I got this the same day I kick it costs literally one-fifth the price I'm just gonna see if it's if it's it if it's 20% it's good like it doesn't make oh god I just paid so much money but anyway anyway anyway yeah that's that's solid for the price that's sell it for $15 grand look um I I think it's good I think that that the rosin is good I'm gonna dab the rod let me have a bucket that was that was the I don't even know of the other strain is [Music] [Music] I mean it's definitely better [Music] the Robins better smoother and tastes a little better you can't really compare the highs because I'm better than both back for it but it's all about the taste for me and it is smoother is it pay five times the price smoother [Music] I don't think so because it's not it's not five times as good yeah I don't even know how you would get five times as give it something like this this isn't the best this isn't the best cheap batter that I've got but for something to be five times as good as this would be pretty impressive so this is not five times as good probably not worth five times the price if I see it on deals I may get it but I don't think it's worth anything that's worth three times the price two times the price even thirty forty five bucks I get why it costs so much it's a it's a little bit less common not as many people are making it and you get lower yields with it I get why it it costs more but it's not currently it's not at the price point where it's super worth it for me to only buy rosin maybe if I had a press and I could get amazing yields myself but I don't grow and I don't have any interest in growing so it's like I don't have to buy all my nugs anyway to smash it so kind of interesting I like finding deals so maybe I'll get excited about finding a deal in the future but yeah this isn't actually the most expensive gram of concentrate I've ever purchased a few years ago I remember purchasing a I purchased several grams actually a full melt bubble hash that I got remember the dispensary but I got some full melt bubble I think it was about eighty eight bucks a gram I think I remember paying just under ninety a gram it was really really good stuff it was like some of the craziest stuff I ever spent I I gotta go back and look for some pictures of it cuz it was a few years ago those full mount bubble hash grams I got were like pretty good but after I got a mouse this isn't worth eighty eight bucks a gram what the [ __ ] did I just do so I kind of feel that way here what the [ __ ] that I just do but we made a video that's what the [ __ ] we just did so let's do a few more dabs of this [ __ ] might as well I've only taken out several dollars off of it I don't see if we can take several more I'm interested in the cold start here so let's do that [Music] here's a few dollars [Music] yeah this is good stuff still I wish I could afford you dabs well this was actually pretty fun and I'm pretty blessed after all those naps and I'm glad I finally got to try this rosin up and see it in a bunch of dispensaries even if I did pay money for it but if you liked this video be sure to subscribe for more content in the future and check out my other social media I'll have links in the description below and for my live streams tune in to twitch at twitch.tv slash Cubans if you tune in at night I'm probably live right now getting high dabbing some much cheaper than than $75 a gram rosin unless you tuned in very shortly after this is made that I might have some of this left but uh come hang out and we'll see you next time [Music] I would say perfect balance but I'm going [Music] [Music] [Music]", "O9VAKwttZD0": "a YouTube Alex here back again with

never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge what is going on you guys my name is Jeff also known as popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe I got a lot of lip videos on the way like today I'm gonna be showing you when I picked up from silver stem cannabis in my last video if you missed that video I got to tour their entire dispensary bring you guys with me show you what it's actually like inside of there it's [ __ ] sick make sure you check out that video a link to it will be in the description but right now I'm going to show you guys what I actually bought and what it looks like because there's some fire ass products there when you buy weed legally it comes with a receipt I spent two hundred and seventy seven dollars it would have been two twenty before tax but there's some hefty taxes in Colorado but it's worth it because hey I can [ __ ] buy the [ __ ] in the store I don't need to have a plug I don't need to fly with my own it's nice just being able to go into a store and pick out some [ __ ] and even with the tax it's so much cheaper than it is in Pennsylvania like you don't pay taxes when you buy weed in Pennsylvania but the growers and the processors and the stores are definitely paying a lot in taxes and that goes down to you so you might not pay a tax but you're being taxed alright let's start with these I picked up these little tablets just cuz I've never seen these before they're called pressies they have desired effects on them like sleep energy focus they only have like five or ten milligrams of THC in them so they're not very potent but they come with some other stuff that are supposed to actually help increase the desired effects that are labeled on the package I try out the focus ones just see what it's like it's literally like a little tablet and says a little THC mark on it's pretty cool I know if you're supposed to chew it or pop it I'm really glad I read that it says right on the bottom swallow don't you alright guys I'll see if that 10 miligrams does anything to me but I'm gonna be smoking a lot on top of it so I probably won't even really feel it you know I get high as [ __ ] all day and I get distracted so much stuff this could actually like help me focus real a little like that'd be kind of cool now let's get to the live rosin you guys picked up some olio I picked up the strain tropic sunset its a mix between slur Akane number 4 and papaya punch number 3 I didn't even smell it honestly like the name just sold me if you watched the video yesterday though you saw him open up a package of oleo they have such beautiful packaging man it's really [ __ ] cool they definitely take the extra step to make sure there's a great presentation with the product and the products really good so you really can't go wrong with them and just like the homie said it comes a little dab tool I didn't let it sit flat last night so you can see a little bit dripped onto the side but that's not the end of the world oh my god you guys this [ __ ] looks so good I was sure you're gonna close up for this if you guys can see that like it's just a beautiful yellow has a very nice consistency to it it's like a liquidy sugar and that's what's so cool about rosin man there's so many different consistencies that it ends up being just loaded up the puff coke peak I hope you guys are smoking with me let me know in the comments what you guys are smoking on every go you guys man I just like flew away and went to heaven that tastes so good [Music] my god you guys even when I look on this you guys truly [ __ ] beautiful job if you guys are ever in Colorado pick up some holy Arase Jim I really like this dispensary you guys they have some top-shelf concentrates there flowers amazing that's what I'm about to show you next but just like with over 300 dispensaries in Denver it's hard to find like all the good ones so as soon as you find one that has like great prices and great products like I just wanted to keep going to it damn I picked up two strains I picked up at indica and sativa flower this is the mimosa this is one of my favorite sativa strains I love smoking joints in mimosa if you've had mimosa before you already know but if you haven't you got to try it man it's some great [ __ ] weed and this is a shame that the budtender sold Deon he was very helpful this [ __ ] like I usually don't for whatever reason strains that have the word silver in it I don't like I don't even not like them I just like tend to just like not look at it because I'm like in my head I'm like gold is the best of silver my aunt but this is called silver OG and like I don't know if we get much better than this like it is a heavy indica it is like that deep green with like bright white trichome still so it looks like it has like snow on it this little it looks like the Tegrity farms Christmas snow weed and like if that was true that would be very concerning I don't know how good the shots do it for the weed but oh my god you guys it is a fire I honestly think I'm gonna go back to silver stuff before I go home and get some more flour because they had some great strains out there I just started with one indica and one sativa preheating the peak right now cheers you guys that was a nice reheat what I really like about the earrings is you can put a decent amount of wax in there and like if you take a big dab it's not all wasted like you can just reheat it and keep smoking it but this you guys is what I'm most excited to show you I've never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge I paid too much money for this but I had to do it I said I wanted to try some cool cartridges while I was out here and I mean it happened this is from olio I don't want to skip over how great their packaging is they do such a good job on it that I feel like it deserves a little second I love you can kind of tell it has a little bit more of a foggy hue to it than a normal cartridge it's really cool how it says the strain on it too because sometimes you forget what strain you're smoking or if you have a lot of cartridges you can get them confused again using my cloud products rio+ different color but I just love these batteries they're one of my favorites cheers you guys wow that is one of the best AC cartridges I've ever had it's papaya punch that's gonna taste [ __ ] awesome but if being rosin versus actual distillate holy [ __ ] and like I can feel it like I'm getting really high off this like I can feel it on the face in the eyes this is not your normal cartridge this is crazy holy [ __ ] this is like one hit and you're high and it literally tastes like a rosin dab this isn't saying you guys the future man they can work on the price a little bit it would be way more feasible but what a great experience like I'm [ __ ] ripped I am so happy I got this this is the last thing we got through the liquid live resin cartridge I picked it off the name and the package honestly the [ __ ] is really cool and having a garlicy cartridge I've never had that before and it sounds pretty interesting chum the company Green Dot it's a [ __ ] [ __ ] to open here's the inside packaging cartridge is sitting on the side to push right through here to get the cartridge out then it gives you the stats on the back just peel here and don't use this if you're pregnant okay that this cartridge has a little adjustable air flow filter I don't really like these what it does is give you either more or less airflow I'd rather you just like tell me what's good and stick to it I'm gonna try minimal air flow and see how that goes Devlin gives you a hard hat doesn't Asus goes the rosin cart but still a good tasting cartridge well it's actually like kind of bad to the place garlicky it's not like sweet like that's why I prefer but it's like a very dank weed eat aced it's very heavy on the garlic I'll tell you that it's not even really a GMO taste it's definitely just more straight garlic it's a garlic explosion definitely prefer the rosin cart over this I'm going back to the rosin cart I need something with a better taste [Music] much better I think that's what we're gonna wrap the video you guys super pumped to try this for the first time way too expensive but definitely a cool experience that is so amazing this is probably the coolest thing I picked up in my opinion click like if you enjoyed the video let me know what you thought the coolest thing I got was subscribe for more videos I appreciate you watching my name is Jeff beaks", "SQVogwcVStc": "hi it's Matt my ruff our studios and welcome to cat Abay 6 today we're going to be making fresh homemade dabs with the t-rex rosin press [Music] we're going to be using the t-rex rosin press today along with some 5 inch raw parchment papers and about an eighth of cannabis but you can press whatever amount of cannabis that you have the first step that we're going to do is to actually set up and turn on the heat the rosin press machine now the t-rex rosin press is like a clamshell lid that's got too heated plates inside of it that's gonna let us create a lot of pressure and heat to press the rosin if you don't have one of these you can pick one up at wizard puff calm save 10% off of anything there with the code Kadett basics and what you turned the device on is gonna flash so that you can set the temperature and we're using a Celsius device here so our all of our temperatures are in Celsius and we're doing our first one at 135 degrees Celsius and once you set the temperature you press the button one time and light will be solid and it'll heat up [Music] and while that's heating up we're gonna go ahead and prepare our parchment papers now in order to do that all you really need to do is just to fold it in half now you can ultimately you could also use some the micron screen bags along with the parchment paper but we found it's not really necessary when you're pressing this small amount but if you do use them it will keep some of the plant materials that you might end up with and also you want to make sure you take out any stems you can see we put about a quarter to a half a gram butt in there but they had a big stem and I so want to take that butt out I mean that stem out of the bud and it is best to keep the buds and intact nugs if possible but if you have stems you didn't want to take those out okay once you have it inside the pouch and you're ready to press it and make sure that your machine is up to heat but be careful because it is hot and then keep this cannabis as close to the center of the press as you can and then apply pressure and I'm using just a thumb pressure at the beginning here and you can feel it a heating and melting and kind of flattening out as you do that and then you're gonna feel the device kind of hit bottom and once you get to that point you could not take the heel of your hands and I start applying more and more pressure and we are trying to squeeze out the rosin or the THC and the terpenes and the oils out of that cannabis so for about 30 seconds I've been applying pressure here have time-lapsed a little bit and now after about 30 seconds of putting force also you want to make sure you have a very strong table do not do this on a glass coffee table or anything that might break you could do it on the ground or a really strong table okay but this you could open up and you see that the oils have squirted out all around them can nice little piles of resin all around the bud [Music] ok so now we're going to continue on pressing out our cannabis and through how this we're going to vary the amount of cannabis the way we put it in there we're going to vary the temperatures that we use and we're also going to vary the pressing time that we use from twenty to thirty seconds at this point we've put the temperature down to 125 degrees we're going to go a little bit lower the first time and this press we did for about 30 seconds and we noticed on these lower temperatures the 135 and then 125 and then we're going on a third one all the way down to 115 degrees that we notice on these lower temperature presses that we got not as much yield but we got a lot clearer we're not a lot clear but there was a little bit difference in the clarity it was a most transparent the wax down at this level and although the yield wasn't as high as we'll get to here in a second it was still a very clear very pure and in the end and also very tasty okay so now on this last couple of we've raised the Machine up to 150 degrees so we're our highest setting here and we used a smaller nug this time and we pressed it for about 25 seconds and I think that we got a little bit better yield off of using the smaller nugs and also the higher temperature and the one difference in the wax from the higher press or the higher temperature pressings was that it seemed to be just a tiny bit darker and a little more noticeable on the paper and also as I said I think we got our highest yields even not even the fact that we used the smaller nugs but in still it was the most amount of wax on these two smaller but hotter pressings and so now we have pressed everything we've got everything labeled and the next step is going to be to scrape it and see what we have [Music] now when it comes to scraping you want to be really careful and I've got a rounded AB tool now if you have a tool that's got a sharp edge you might find that you end up cutting your paper and kind of making a mess so I've got kind of a smooth rounded AB tool and I'm just gently go scraping along the top of the paper collecting the wax and as you collect the wax you'll notice that the wax itself will help you collect it and I'm doing this one parchment at a time starting with the lowest temperature and so this is the hundred and fifteen degree tab right here and you can see it's a really nice looking wax it's not a lot of Wax but it was it was really nice clear and kind of pure looking and we didn't use the microns grain back so we do have occasional little specks of of plant material in here but these are juniors homemade dabs to do right away if you were using the commercial use you would make sure you filter those out but there are two lower temperature dabs there you can see or a very clear golden just the kind of wax that you would want to get when you bought it from the store and also had a nice smell to and then we're moving on now we've got to our to the smaller dabs that we pressed but the the hotter temperature and you can see they actually turned out bigger and here's the biggest dab of all right here that last pressing of that one small nug at 150 Celsius for about 20 seconds maybe 25 seconds and it yielded our our best dab of all of them and so now here's the findings that I found today with the italic press is that one-quarter to one-third the smaller nugs worked best the highest setting 150\u00b0 produced the the most but slightly darker yields twenty to thirty second time was good and you could use the screen backs but I really don't think it's necessary when you're just gonna do the dabs or just right away like we are here and you're not making them primer surely but they're delicious I really like doing dabs this way you can be certain that you're not getting any kind of chemicals or butane or any kind of processing other than a little bit of heat and pressure and time and you may find that you know if you're a commercial wax maker or something you could get better yields and other methods but for a homemade wax making I think this is just a fun simple and sort of safe way to do it and I really highly recommend it if you don't have one and like I said you could also use a hair press for this if you don't have a rosin press machine you can check out some of our previous videos and see how you do that but also you could get one of these rosin press at wizard puff and other places if you get it wizard puff please use the code canna basics there and you can save 10% off of everything I'll put some links in the description

up next enjoy the show hey you welcome to my quiz review a juvenile spells this is what i do smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now instead of show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles is coming at you with death bubba live resin vape pen so let's open this up and check it out and give it a nice review so as you can see it has a very nice looking box and if you can't tell by taking a quick look at my channel my thing is kind of skulls i love skulls i got a big old collection of skulls here's just a couple of them but so you know i had to so you know i had to get myself the death bubba fate pen to try out sorry so instead of my ass talking all day let's open this up and take a nice look at it so it is a very nice classy looking vape pen it has a very nice design on it and if you take a look it says unicorn hunter certified so after this we might have to go up and get some unicorns you know what i mean just playing obviously of course nobody call peta or anything like that i'm just playing we're good so let's take a nice puff of this and see how good it tastes so i can give it a little bit of a reviewing so it has like a very nice sweet taste i'm sorry we had a little bit of a glitch there so it does have a very nice sweet taste and it does have a very nice like it's not like rough on the throat it's kind of like a nice like smooth hit and it does look like a pretty nice account nice gram inside so i paid like i think it was like 55 50 or 55 for this so it's not really a bad deal when you usually pay about 35 to about 40 or so for like live resin chatter stuff like that anyway so i'd say it's definitely worth it and i noticed that there's this little hole and if you push that you get like a harder hit quicker than without it it like stops the air from going in it to like i don't know kind of like like takes the air away so you get more smoke i guess so and i didn't mention that it has at the bottom a plug to charge it up if the battery dies on you and you can unscrew the top to unplug it so those are some really good quality features about it as well and it says that it's 93 to 98 percent thc so that's pretty good you can't get much higher than 93 to 98 unless you go to the one something percents just just joke no no so i know my humor is a little lame a little dry sometimes so i hope you all get it just trying to keep you on your toes you know what i mean so what we'll do is i'll give a rating of i'll give a rating of 4.5 for the taste and for design and packaging i'll give a rating of an overall five because i mean come on the packaging can't get much cooler very nice box to store it away when you're not using it so the kids don't get at it or something it's easy to put away without losing the pin itself so i guess i'll just give an overall rating of 4.5 to 5 out of 5 to the death bubba fate pin that is a very good choice and it does taste very good so if you ever get a chance to try it out i definitely recommend it it gives you a nice buzz too i'm already feeling pretty good so i definitely recommend it so if you ever get yourself a chance to try it out go get that and i hope you all have some good [ __ ] to smoke at home and i hope you all doing good and i appreciate everybody that comes and spends time spends time

peace", "zbAY763zt4M": "[Music] hi there this is ally hi times concentrate correspondence over the last few years concentrates have become the biggest thing to happen to pop culture since well pot but as the popularity of Deb's continues to grow so the questions about the many forms these concentrates can take all concentrates are made through a process called extraction where marijuana's main ingredients are concentrated into an essential oil the main three solvents used to create Deb's are butane co2 and ISO isopropyl alcohol after extraction the resulting Deb's can look very different today we're taking a closer look at the three main types of concentrates shatter butter and oil oil is a gooey sticky liquid that can be kind of hard to handle while butter has a creamier consistency from being whipped finely shatter is smooth clear and solid all three can be used in vape pens and oil rigs but finding the right concentrate for you is a matter of preference shatter is the purest and most potent form because it involves a second extraction process that removes fats lipids and waxes this can result in over 80 percent THC however it also means that some of those tasty terpenes are removed therapies are responsible for marijuana's unique smell combined with THC terpenes create the flavor of the pot or concentrate your smoking butter retains more terpenes so it tends to be more flavorful but less potent with THC percentages in the 70s oil tends to be the least refined of the three this form also known as honey oil or butane hash oil can retain a full flavor profile however THC levels are generally less consistent unfortunately availability often determines what type of concentrate you smoke but hopefully this little guide helps those lucky enough to have a choice thanks for watching and stay tuned to hi x comm for more Deb related content including how to select a nail and the rig you [Music]", "f4ORZ7O16_I": "what's up YouTube it's your three boys here Tyler Issac and Josh your number one channel for main cannabis content and product reviews for medical marijuana patients and adults 21 years in order alright today guys we got a little treat graciously donated from our guys at cmf this is some of their new green crack live resin just at the menu our boy Logan was telling us about this he said he just checked it out in the lab and so we're excited to check it out price point 50 dollars a gram on some very good life resin let's get right into it I want to get the camera up on in this for the crack open nice I notice there's new packaging there new packaging this comes from Maine cannabis exchange I like the logo it's got a nice little bird maybe a chickadee probably um oh and there we go looks amazing oh yeah how's it smell me very nice very smooth flow nice notes to it very clean let's get right into it guys now up to temp yep go on 650 here alright oh sorry now on the tsunami a darn recycler yeah are you your favorites and nice squab with that green crack cheers guys well sure you guys got something good alright here we go Green crack now I love green fact I've been really waiting for this one of my favorite sativa yes I was always telling me on a green crack crack flower one of his favorites great all day smoke you see if we cannot but today for production there yeah it's pretty mean guys what would you say on flavor what is home and there's a little smack right off a little bit of mango notes in there okay definitely very uplifting on this immediately you can tell to do some real nice it's all good cheers guys it happens that's my dad here we go smooth vacuum mm-hmm immediately I know the flavor yeah this mmm great serve off now it's all good it's all good mmm ain't the first time I'm drop some wax right yeah it does Tyler did you get that smack from that oh yeah right up on most of the tours guys almost like that urge to sneeze yeah Tyler said hi label production on the street I feel like a grid behind the eyes almost immediately yep mm-hmm clear on that liquor Pro yeah it's pretty for real oh my god take a minute to enjoy that josh is getting this is a great day time a time smoke it's extremely uplifting stops good Tyler like Josh the same smokes a lot of this one here it's for like a wake and bake or like oh wow - might be familiar there I guess some people don't like the name of green crack so they also call it green closure green crush I've heard of that of those - yeah I've heard of the name can definitely scare people away from it but it's it's almost the opposite of that it's pretty smooth doesn't that bite like I said but it's pretty smooth and pretty easygoing very good for you though don't you guys get a CSI get down there and pick some up if you're in the area oh yeah now that the pressure my chest is kind of relaxed a little instant we feel those effects kind of like Tyler and Isaac assay in an instant we noticed that uplifting sativa settling in very fast kind of like it's uh let's go get ready kinda you know yeah in Italy it makes you wait in the pants I'm all definitely admit that it does um they haven't um I haven't taken any medicine for a few hours today so I kind of have a clear clear head on this revealing just that first gap I'm already feeling it and that's kind of say in a lot because I'm pretty heavy into the concentrates and it usually takes me a few just to get going but one already and I'm I'm starting to feel this screen crack white resin taste is amazing I'm worth it alone just over you know I mean just look at that stuff yeah very great consistency easy to work with it's like a caviar kind of desk from material definitely comparable to that ok so right now guys it's it's sitting right around 6:45 I have not smoked today I knew that we were gonna be smoking the green crock so I wanted to get like a you know total silver hit of this ship and excellent very you know if this was gonna be the first smoked they would definitely kick you in the butt wake you up agree with a cup of coffee very clear very I love it great chillin with you boys yep Wow 19 cannabis exchange right on check them all overall flavor I'm gonna say for me kind of like Isaac said I kind of see where he's coming went from with the mango notes a little fruity yeah I would say yeah definitely got a little gaseous come in well there's something coming in there so a little bit of a little skunky gas eNOS if you like that but not overpowering it's that perfect smooth mellow oh I'm gonna say so yeah for me I'm taste I'm gonna give it a solid eight and a half and you know leaning towards the nine because what's let's face it guys it's it's live resin no matter what you get unless it's a strain you particularly don't like the taste is gonna be incredible I think this is our first time trying Maine cannabis exchange unless we've had it in the past I'm not sure either I don't know if we were smoking some of their stuff and we did not recognize the label but this is brand new for us um talk to your after - dabs I am really feeling it I was another kind of okay I should say yeah honestly um yeah so flavor like I said I would myself eight and a half nine what do you guys think probably a a good solid eight okay it's nice I like the flavor it doesn't really stand out as anything mellow smooth like a great flavor wait I couldn't smoke this stuff every day and never get tired with it it's that it's that kind of flavor yeah it's it's a tear either way it's phenomenal smoke but like they're saying there's nothing like ridiculous about this it's not musky it's not not today it has its crew Venus it has its nice notes it gets you everything you want realism a good exciting thing is more the strain profiles just I love the marine drag yes as we keep the video going I'm definitely noticed some heavy focus I'm in the head to the heads getting clear and very focused definitely that's the Teva aspects kicking in for me where I can I can really get into something if I wanted to I'm for golfing say we were out on the disc golf course Exeter totally tuned in exactly exactly Tyler draws I could really get into the guitar right now I feel like I say quit any other why I'm noticing the same thing so I'm very focused in kind of determination correct absolutely I do not I do not feel lazy that's for sure which is I do like once in a while like a nice relaxing I would say I would say we boys are pretty sativa or sativa guys I've been toured I like trying to find that balance of doesn't really make me you know sleepy and down and tired and chill relax and because sometimes I feel like sativas have those effect on me personally my best experience and with this it definitely does have that sativa hi like that it does actually like I said kick in the van my best pain go grab from for yourself yeah a try yeah once again yeah just in stock I don't know how long it's gonna last but it got it from central Maine flower yeah I'm sure showed up other guys there again and yeah I mean you say overall like I said flavor um smell that's not really something I get in too much with oils cuz that's kind of you know comes and goes but I will I will touch on the smell at a very good probably say eight another solid eight just overall this overall just this is one of the things that never really be disappointed if it was always on the menu though you guys but the high and overall effects I would give the highest attended the high is the same rate so so where you might be whacking and say it's not crazy exotic on flavor or something like you like it ain't gonna let you down on effects that's why I'm gonna buy it every time it's on the menu if they you know that's that sort of thing and the the effects trade-off is outweighs anything else you might be looking for what am i I would say top three favors the demos to smoke there you go time a lot crackin yeah I know Isaac always talks about I haven't had a whole lot of it but what I have had I love it you know I like probably and probably one out three months now for the first time agree crack-smoking it and I fell in love with event that the bud itself I'm totally enjoying this alright so overall guys what do you what do you say on this honest opinion what's the little throwdown I'm fresh off first off guys price range would you would you would you throw down your fifty on that yes I would definitely feel like I got what I paid for paying $50 dude me too me too absolutely because like I said to Dabbs in and I'm feeling like a shove everything else you know I mean the look we're all they're great that robe was there yeah good night after that third taste their meter real it's phenomenal alright so overall for your three boys on the green crack live resin I mean I'm gonna give it a 9 cuz I don't know if I could ever get anything 10 I'm gonna bump up my overall like I said though the 10 for the high in the nursery effects it is bumping my eight and a half and stuff on my flavor bring it it up to that saw with 9 would Tyler Isaac yeah I'm gonna go with that 10 I am gonna give it a bad you're gonna I like this stuff it's very fun to smoke so I would say that probably rounds up if you guys give it a try give us your opinion in the comments below yeah leave feedbacks we want to hear from you guys more we were starting to really get into this do some more cool reviews product reviews so I would appreciate if you talk to us a little we want to hear from you what do you guys want to see some of that stuff in and always remember like and subscribe share with a friend yeah so probably Green crack why present your oh it's 9 and a half out of 10 right on time guys see babies", "SoVy7emFQOk": "you're smokin man growin and watch it fall down [Music] DGC Scottie real hanging out and doing something very interesting thank you for Jason from dialed in Terps for coming in I am really interested in trying to learn what do they call this they have to make these high-end extracts and now I always thought they made them with BHO and whatnot now Jason comes over and says no you can actually make them using real high-end water hash and pressing that into rosin and then you jar it up is that this jar tech is that what they call this yes jar tech it's um it's fresh frozen material that's then turn into bubble hash exactly like you said and depressed in the rosin and at some point you know you have to decide what you want to do with is our consistency goes right why is it look so different what's it start out so it starts out as rosin right yeah it's really suffered rosin okay we got a picture of that Ross and that [ __ ] is so bright why the hell is that rosin so bright white well you know quality in quality out you know you want to start with the best material possible when you're starting with the fresh products and you've matured a trichome to its full maturity right and still hold a nice color but I've seen things that are yellow I've seen things that are a dark almost like a tan brown and by the way it can be dankus [ __ ] but I seem like the 710 labs they do that real white five-star water hash sure and you're saying five stars kind of this five star material yeah I think 710 would probably be doing more if they're selling it they're gonna be doing a six star but the [ __ ] the difference help a brother out man all right six stars as good as it gets six stars as good as it gets no cars both wash goes all right that's the bright whites they all really light do you holo bright whites a full milk bubble hash okay put it on a bowl there's not gonna be any residue left got it and that's what's gonna burn clean right that's really what they're looking for for a full bubble hash by the way that 6r that's just expensive man I don't even know I bought that a little bit $75 a gram and I had like no second thoughts after I went through it or like 10 15 bucks it's just you want to do a few it is delicious I agree so is that what that way you end up with here or that's what we start with most stuff you're president of rosin would be a five star hash and what the difference is starting material yes the starting material is gonna leave a little bit of residue if you put a five star hash and a puff go peak it's still gonna taste delicious right you're gonna really enjoy it it's just gonna leave a little residue at the bottom of the bowl when you clean it you ever smoked bubble hash and you see that that's gonna be a five star hash or a four star hash and again I'm just trying to understood the difference is the quality of the material going in right so six star hash this is gonna be no residue it's gonna burn totally clean Wow just like you know when you smoke a full mil okay so what does this start out as this is five star what do you what do you call this this is five star material for that okay with I work really hard in house to peruse really nice flowers that I've fries fresh beautiful right beautiful you've been here about ten years right no I think we both heard the calling and yeah left our homes to come and be growers be growers out in public I love it I really enjoyed my 10 years in Colorado it's I'm home now yeah you're relieved oh yeah you're right he's right by the mountains absolutely beautiful beautiful up there I'll come visit you can't visit me I'll come visit you next time man all right all right let's get into these jars guru's got beautiful pictures of the jars over there yeah what what are we starting Wesley this jar tech I totally don't actually get to start material over here it's mousey absolutely yeah we got everybody in the shop hey that's I think it's secure I meant to do an AB you take that live you know fresh frozen bubble hash it goes into a freeze dryer okay so this is definitely freeze dryer right huge how beautiful beautiful that's what happens when my friends come over you all right so I've took 56 grams yesterday or this morning actually I woke up early at 6 a.m. right and press 56 grams of bubble hash okay and that's important you didn't press flour you're pressing 56 grams of bubble hash gotcha and that's how you really get the old dry quality Cessna and the bubble has just been dried in the freeze dryer okay and now what's in a freezer until I pressed it so to help me out I understand why everybody wants a freeze dryer why why that's like the key to super high quality okay a pretty dryer really is gonna preserve all the terpenes all the cannabinoids and it's gonna preserve its freshness and make it absolutely just perfect right so what so and your freeze drying the buds the flowers before you or your freeze drying the hash here freeze rather than bullish she's got imperious drying the bullish beautiful without losing any of terpenes right you're drying it at an extremely cold temperature wow what a trip all right I get it now I get it all right so now we got we pony that was a tad a process something like that this came up rest us this morning and if I were to pressed it and immediately it would have not started waxing up I've got it we came up to the show it's starting to wax up a little which is fine it's just a little bit harder to collect right so we're I'm in here and that's gorgeous it is warm by the way the air conditioning broke they're fixing it up we just fell right yeah we had this in the freezer and I already pulled it apart and the cold temperatures a key to this know right even everything cold right yeah so it started tearing the wax of him that is impressive that's the starting material okay yeah so now what do we do it now that to me I'd be dabbing the [ __ ] out of that as a matter of fact so is that dabble yeah you want to try it yes yeah you know we've got these these are called a puff coke peak is that what this is yeah absolutely yeah awesome you showed up with one and guru showed up with one the beginning in a week and they really do hit beautifully I think so yeah it's my preferred way to smoke I was a double uh double press here Yeah right Yeah right see he already turned it on so oh no what your right hand I'll turn it off because these are cold start tabs always for you now I just changed it to you take this more damaged how you didn't even started up so you're doing alright beautiful I forgot it's the right temperature I like to do it on green I think if you have a high quality product if it should burn really well and hey yeah I'll shout out to Stony scholar who was teaching me about this at the last dvc cup and he was probably the first time I heard about cold start dabs Yeah right great once ready deal alright I'll get mine going to this I haven't tried this yet this is star dog I did a full spectrum start up here ok beautiful star dog is it's JJ from top dog is that right really so yeah alright so back from bubble hashes is gonna be the 45 of you for me 45 of you all the way to the 160 you I don't even know how what say you what do you you have it's the micron size of the bubble bag say use it oh sure I know about that sorry so both bags coming about half that you get half a dozen bubble bags they go anywhere from what about 30 or something like that 30 microns 25 micron yeah 20 yep right usually or 220 or 190 or contaminate bags and then your your 160 bag you have some really nice head to start in and get in there yeah what he means by that so that's ones you keep your ear material and your starting material bubble bags all right hang on excuse me let me date with the puff coke peak oh yes let me turn my own give me some small talk here so we're starting off with this and then what that goes in a jar tell me how we get to these I don't understand the jar we smoke the [ __ ] out by the way this is amazing hang on a second smells good I haven't tried it yet this is my new harvest I do everything in-house and you know in Colorado you're only allowed to do 12 plants so it's really hard to have material all the time yeah absolutely you can put air quotes around your 12 plants your church things very interesting know if I did it right I still got some left oh oh I better q-tip it is this gurus you could double click it if you didn't want oh I guess going yeah that should have done that and sometimes you could get sugar done the double click oh good thanks pretty interesting best tastes pretty pretty delicious [ __ ] great it's pretty much cold Karen right here that's what you have here so yeah so what I have no idea what's going on here so let's go for it we got what I would smoke right there what are we trying to make we're trying to make diamonds and sauce with it we're trying to that's one of the that's one of the consistencies you can make what are they tell me tell me what are their Jesus movie it's almost offensive right so this is grease monkey and I took a little cookie pucker from camerado and mixed it in with the grease monkey from exotic genetics okay kind of spiced up the Terps a little and made it a little Wow yeah it's interesting smell yeah Jesus it is weird man that's an interesting smell so okay so that starts with this yeah it starts with this and you have your option of collecting into a ball right you know you're gonna take all these and collect it into a big ball Drazen that's easy I done that yeah exactly and you're gonna put it in a jar and seal it okay you could have options you could go into an oven at a temperature around 220 degrees okay 45 minutes an hour and we'll go over that later just a simple of them like a toaster oven or some convection oven yeah perfection oven okay I used my oven in my kitchen when I first started here thousands of dollars of equipment so I guess you got a couple G's in the freezer freeze dryer yeah so freeze right in a bubble bags the good bubble bags are getting up there and prints really and I love those bubble bags I spent my last dime I was on vacation found out those existed and spent my last dime on them it's like I got this right all right so we got we get it uh like this now what we put a leg ball it up put it in a jar how the hell is a ball of that gonna make that that doesn't make no sense to me it's like I said oh okay they'll go into the oven right 20 degrees got it or about 45 minutes this jar is gonna melt up and it's gonna foam up and it's gonna start 2d carved in the jar essentially what you're doing is separating your using solvent as a using terpenes as a solvent you're separating THC and the terpenes got it terpenes will go to the top THC will settle the bottom that will go on a heat map and that will sit on a heat man anywhere from 12 hours to 24 hours and so far none of this is specialty equipment I've got a seed heating mat right there I used to sprout seeds and and make clones with yeah that's what you need yeah kitchen the kitchen of an oven and a seed mat is all you really need I mean if you know this is all very high-end product you're working with medical medical instruments as much as possible right if you have a nice clean Breville convection oven that you could get at Best Buy or bad bad thing yeah all right yeah but aside from the freeze dryer which you'll make a lot of friends with that at least no yeah a lot of folks come into the house oh yeah and so how long does something like this have to sit after so you you bake it and it's it's ready or you sit what you're gonna do is you're gonna take that jar and you're going to essentially turn it into a liquid and though though it's gonna foam up and the bottom will turn into a liquid the bubbles will start to rise up the jar kind of like a beer okay when is three-quarters of the way up the jar is all liquid on the bottom and the top are bubbles it'll look like a beard when it was freshly poured exactly right that's when it's ready to pull out of the oven you're gonna take that jar out of the oven and put it on a heat mat like that and it'll sit on that heat mat anywhere if I can set from 12 to 24 hours and it'll the crystals will start to collect and form and that's it and how long so after 24 hours it's good like that that's only a process I would think it would take weeks for yeah I remember making rock candy as a kid that shook took weeks man it could take anywhere from 12 hours to 4 days five days goddess I've ever seen a jar takers been six days and does it matter about the quality if there's not enough terpenes and in the material or it always work I've seen some jars not work absolutely right not every strain does work but for the most part if you have a good quality starting material you do your process right right you're gonna you're gonna have good results did you see this is [ __ ] cool cuz you can do it with a convection oven and just go over to nosies house man he just bought a kid you didn't you just buy your a freeze dryer brother yes loving it I'll be right over absolutely okay so what other consistencies do we have man you know the most popular consistency in my world right now and I think a lot of people are really digging on is a cold here which hold you here come on get us get us up to speed I told you I gotta go to the 7:10 cup the concentration celebration in a month maybe get my [ __ ] together man this is the cold care dude so show that to the camera man that is if they had that in the store I might run out with it I have to I'd have to think I have to conscience man that thing is uh insane how many grams is this first of all so that's one ounce 28 grams okay yeah that's fun that's fun to have in my hand so has it been whipped yet this I'm still caring okay how long is the Cure on something like that so this the first stop is there a cure on that you said one to four days is that what you're calling it cure so what I'm calling on that is the separation okay yeah you're separating the terpenes or the THC and forming crystals is that after the cure this is so Karen so this has been this foot into a ball right and put into a jar right that's it all I've done is take that collected and put it in the showcase I love it how long's that after how long does that cure so this has been in a jar now for two days okay I'm gonna let this sit in a jar for a few more weeks God okay that's what I was thinking I thought there was some stuff he did for a few weeks and that's room for 60 degrees for a few weeks the sweat get terpenes will start to rise to the top they'll get softer where do you keep a room sixty degrees if we're trying to be practical and helped a DGC actually do this so you just take a cold basement like a dresser drawer got it and it's in the 60s clothes or it has to be dialed in 60 degrees I would consider a six a cold Kyra's 60 degree room okay you could also do a room temperature here is just just fine and it goes quicker it works just fine okay no reason to not do a room temperature here I'm still obsessed over it why not brother yeah if I cure something up it'll be just a pocket cure yeah I call it yeah yeah a pocket cure pocket cure that sounds like something I would do and when you're ready when it's when it's secured and you feel you feel it it's good where you like it right it's sweating terpenes it looks delicious sweating to smoke yeah yeah you take care take your tool and you go ahead and whip it like mashed potatoes essentially what's that can you do that what's that look like right we'll do it to this one all right so this one is the same material that this was the second press material so we'll show that material first of all all right that's the second pressing it's [ __ ] impressive normally when I would do the second pressings or at least a second run with my bubble bags it was much it was a lot less quality can you say a lot less quality much lower quality that's limit to say manthe books I didn't mean it's kicking it I've never been known for the best grammar myself you can make great concentrates nobody gives a [ __ ] about your grammar yeah all right so this one thing about this is an ounce that's announcer there's 14 grams okay half an ounce an ounce looks like yeah beautiful I put this in the oven okay yeah so in order to speed this process up you could put it in the oven as well and do cake batters what a lot of people are called so that's when I goes I get that a batter sometimes yeah okay so my batter out of the oven is gonna come out dry like this it's this is unlit so what about this moist you do there's plenty of terpenes in there and it's delicious and you can smell it it just needs to be kind of whipped okay that's not a fast profile yeah you know I'm more of like a no-till guy man so this is kind of I don't know man right I know it's actually the same idea though you know you get everything exposed to a more surface area get it exposed Wow okay that's looking like something to get it at a dispensary yeah then you start smashing it down kind of potatoes that looks good you know misty all looks getting wet and delicious already and you know right look at that so Leo is soft and gooey beautiful show that to guru man yeah come on you really get a nice good mash on that you're welcome to stop by the bakery any time so so what consistencies is coming like I said this is the end this is a second press and I did put it in the oven just to speed up the process of the cold appear for the show oven will loosen terpenes I don't know I think you could bring out some terpenes well it depends on the strain you know some the oven will bring out terpenes on some strains of them will destroy starting really fragile terpenes and some strands as well huh yeah absolutely I like to do a little bit of both I wish that's my tournament entry so I'm just kind of like oh yeah they're like that I can't smell it yeah you know the press of that so you know you so the quality is there it's delicious you want to try it yes yeah you probably don't ask me that any other man let me see that let me see the whole jar I got that cheese man right I'm happy today it's a good day in the bakery nice limit limit let me hold let me know yes Jesus what strain is this what do you think hate the nausea will you put this all back in the fridge it's totally waxed up it's gonna be really hard to click now but yeah the key thing is cold cold is the key yeah it is colder the better you're working at home if you could turn on the air-conditioner or open up some windows if I live at elevation so I keep everything really cool does that make a difference oh yeah damn I try to keep miles at 60 you know like I'll let you handle it yeah you know I just I start making pizzas and I'll be damned you got a really a just [ __ ] for elevation I'm sure making that stuff that's way sensitive man you really got to adjust you're a mile high up makes a [ __ ] huge difference especially with water absorption I so dry yeah it's almost impossible to keep up yeah is there any difference if people are trying to do this in you know up in Portland where it's more humid or anything is there any kind of special precautions they would have to take well Portland's humid yes what I'm wondering is such a different client man yes so the probably was something somebody that actually lives in Portland to ask wouldn't it yeah I mean you want to keep bubble high school most people professionally love make pilaster live and work and walk-in coolers so this is all about a walk-in cooler this would never hit this temperature as a professional matchmaker yeah yeah so this for the show it would have never made it this long and started to wax up already right I would have collected that immediately put it in a jar you put it in the oven for Jam put it in a jar put in a cold room for a cold cure and now what's a jam what's a jam so the jam would be you know the the crackles that's why we call it jhanas okay okay I believe olio cause a jam 710 calls it premium rosin and I believe gotcha you know there's different companies call it different things so help me out with these pro companies it's because they're able to do things like by walk-in freezers I think I forgot must have forgotten to turn mine on I'm still trying to help you with that Scotty I'm still trying to get this thing what am I doing wrong it's gross I see him that's I'm on it yeah so you want to click it once I'll get once all right and then click it twice to get it going and concert vibrates you're ready to go all right I like it I like it it's pretty cool man let's see a couple of these at the at the 710 concentration celebration I'm gonna bring mine yeah I think it'd be a good way to hit them I mean how torches are cool but yeah this is a safe little bit and a little bit yeah couple hundred stoners with torches sounds cool that's then I hit my sword on my place yesterday I heard a lady I was reaching around trying to fold the back up of a piece of paper I'm sure and sure hit my plate my will templates not so low-temp what they're doing that dude I use a toaster for like five minutes a week and I burnt myself man all right so did you get yours yet uh not yeah I don't think it's ever vibrate uh I mean I was actually making small talks ah there we go man there we go that just turned off double-click that again it it sways boom boom there you go now good now you're I like this thing but what stop at the learning curve how come I'm the only wall to learning curve it's bold school job school study all these gadgets I took me a while to I got laughed at for not having a filter on my joint last week the filter gets in the way honestly kind of taste taste bad throws in anyway hey okay it's a double quick hit that's what it is all right cool man I think we actually did pretty good man I think we uh I think I learned some [ __ ] man you run out I want to see this guy definitely but I'm pretty stoked that you if you invest in a freeze dryer that's kind of you're good to go you can all sudden start making super high-quality extracts like this as long as you're growing super high quality weed y'all I think so I think the learning curve here would be a lot a lot less than making butane hash co2 hash any of those types of hash it's illegal as a [ __ ] is illegal but you know there's a lot to learn yeah there's a legal and then there's a legal yeah yeah you know in a legal lab it's a lot to learn isn't very what's your brand called again I know you got a hangout dialed in Terps man died on turbulent turkey diving terpenes and ER yeah this is some pretty cool [ __ ] you got Instagram yeah I'm an Instagram that's about interest on Instagram other than terpenes on Instagram all right we gotta hang out a little more man this is [ __ ] cool I learned to hold this is like opening up a new world to me I had no idea actually I didn't know this existed because I would see the six star hashes and all these all these crazy concoctions at the dispensary but I really didn't know what went into him or how they were made I love the fact that there's there's no external solvents into it this is just what the terpenes act as a solvent right yeah absolutely it's cool it's awesome so that's yeah you know making bubble hash water solvent carrying agent you using water and ice to break off the trichomes just the very heads of the little live flower and it's bad acid into this yeah it's badass I still think I'm doing this wrong but Jason thanks so much for hanging out man thanks for making the trek and extra show me how to use this thing well though it doesn't even seem like I put the carbon cap on at this point that in terms out intervenes over on Instagram [ __ ] with a match take it easy brother Thanks crack take it easy oh yeah [Music] little break [Music] [Music] yeah [Music] medicine [Music] [Music] today [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "2reXTNFWmd4": "all right in this tobacco university video we're going to be investigating marijuana and the history of the og kush a very famous variety you might have heard of before so while marijuana is high in thc content that is important to know and while this channel does focus more on the hemp it's important to understand that while marijuana is associated with that recreational use in general following and understanding the history of the famous og kush strain can provide great insight into the marijuana culture in general and a lot of the information is spread through oral history and kind of explanations of things so this just kind of serves as an example of that also the og kush has become a worldwide staple used for numerous famous trains like girl scout cookies and there's also many different phenotypes of the og kush that exist the following that i'm going to present here is the history of the og kush is based on an interview with matt bubba berger who found a bag of seed in florida that would later become known as the og kush the original interview came on the adam dunn show as you can see right over here adam dunn right there and i was been very fortunate to meet him both in denver colorado and also on the east coast if you want to hear the interview for yourself i have a link to the youtube uh description there as far as how to look it up and the link to provide if you want to look at the original interview but here i'm going to provide a kind of summarized version so the history of the og kush just in general looking at its original this originated in orlando florida and the seed came from an unknown bag of wheat in miami in 1991. we just was called crippy which was really just a generic term for good weed and it's the start of the generation that started naming and breeding around this time frame only one plant was kept and propagated from the limited amount of seeds that were present in the once original weed and it was just called kush since the first batch was said to look like cushberries that's an important note to make that there's really no such thing as a cushberry but they like the name so it stuck and it became a popular popular in the cannabis industry in 1996 it's made its way to los angeles so while a lot of people think the og kush is a west coast california-based strain the original seed did come from orlando florida in 1991. now become how would become the og kush here well in 1988 star to actually be called the og kush in an attempt to identify it as the original strain grown in los angeles ground in la there in general it tends to be a viny morphology and can have homogenic tendencies as well originally to prevent the strain from being lost seeds were the main form of distribution and this is how the og kush got spread across the united states now looking at the og kush it's a quality over quantity example here so the cush is generally a poor yielder in quantity it's not going to give you like an example of the tomatoes over here it's not going to be a ton of tomatoes but it's going to give you high quality um end results there so the quality was above average in shops in amsterdam i did not want to pay any more for originally since it was not well known it's hard to get a premium price even though the quality was higher in amsterdam however during 1997 to 1999 in los angeles california it was getting top dollar for the cush due to the great demand and limited supply to give you an idea of what the price is going for around that time frame you're looking at 500 plus dollars per ounce and it was sold even before it was grown that's his shows you how high in demand it was now cush is very much a west coast strain sour diesel was dominant on the east coast so these kind of develop the west coast as more og kush east coast more that sour diesel strain now limited starting materials mentioned so the kush strain can be traced back to an original literally few seeds that were found in an ounce of weed way back in the early 90s very rare for this limited starting material to become such a successful strain but remember it is possible if you think about developing your own there are some people who have feminized it and generated their own versions of it but original uh has been kept for these special unique terpene profile that it does um possess here to find that true and original og kush now past the present and i gave you that kind of like just quick summary matt bubba berger has been growing the same plant propagated via clones for about 18 years up to this up to the publication of this video overall the end product is unchanged but the leaf morphal morphology has gone from more of the traditional kind of five-fingered leaves to more funky random morphology over that many years of propagation yield has dropped a little bit but over this time however the chemical profiles remain like the original so that's the importance of kind of clones or maintaining a strain over a long period of time at the point of he interviewed here he was growing up for 18 continuous years and like i said it's a slight difference in plant morphology but the key part is that chemical and terpene profile remain the same giving that og kush the reason for why it's still around to this day is it's for its unique terpene profile and uniqueness to the market and that's why it's still respected and known to the present day", "bUrHtTqRGhI": "[Music] it yeah

don't watch this video unless you're over 18 don't smoke marijuana unless you're in a legal state or you have a medical marijuana card like i actually do myself uh i don't want to show you my personal information all right yo what's up guys ronnie ray back at you so before this video starts i want to say um yeah i apologize i've been slacking on making videos a little bit just with the whole kovit thing going on and everything else i just been kind of insanely busy outside of youtube but um from here on out you can expect me to get back at my grind i'm gonna be posting videos as much as i can again i'm gonna start making more reactions more weed strain videos um just a whole bunch of different types of videos and if you guys have any suggestions or videos you want to see just let me know down below in the comments and definitely get those out for you guys um but yeah in this video i got a new weed stream review for you guys um this [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire this is a hidden pastry that's the strain name by growth science i did get some money shots for you guys so i'll throw those up on the screen in a minute but yeah you see that big beautiful nug in there this [ __ ] was um 90 bucks for a quad normally they sell this [ __ ] like 50 to 68 um i think it's like 100 and something for a quad but they had a deal going on this day where it was 90 bucks for a quad out the door so i had to scoop one up and pick it up you know what i mean and supposedly this [ __ ] is tested 34 thc and 38 total cannabinoids so it's tested really [ __ ] high so supposedly this is [ __ ] i don't know this shit's supposed to be really [ __ ] dang so yeah so let's hop into those money shots i got for you guys and then we'll go over the strain a little bit and then we'll finish off this review so purchase your tracks today [Music] [Music] [Music] all right yeah so as you can see that [ __ ] looks [ __ ] crazy fire i'm excited to smoke on this uh yeah so i pulled um so i looked up on leafly the about the hidden pastry strand so i can like tell you guys a little bit about it um yeah so here's a little bit about the strain i'll deal with picture right here if you want to read along with me but it says um hidden pastry is an indica dominant strain with a cross between secret cookies and the popular cushions this drain most prominent terpenes are oh all that [ __ ] i don't know how to say those words so sorry for that but giving this flower a fresh citric slightly spicy aroma and a zesty citrus but slightly herbal flavor hidden pastry has very colorful buds with sage green and light purple leaves which are covered in cloudy white trichomes and clutters of light orange hairs the nugs are big leafy and slightly dense hidden pastry has a common relaxing effect with a high with a heavy body and a happier forecast so uh that [ __ ] sounds fire as [ __ ] to me i love indicas i prefer indicas over sativas honestly everyone has their own preference let me know what you guys like down below in the comments but yeah this [ __ ] slip on fire i already showed you the money shots um i think what we're gonna do first is i'm gonna load a ball real fast out of my little bong right here and then after that i'll probably roll up the joint or something so um i guess we'll do like a little high test so yeah out of the bong first i'm a little bowl right now um it'll be like a little like like taste test um you know i mean like a taste test a high test i don't know all that [ __ ] now i'll sprout but jordan i'll go up back and smoke that jordan and that'll be more like the actual high test since i'll be smoking a little bit more if you know what i mean so give me a second to load this bowl up and then we'll get into this this nug right here though and i already showed you guys in the in the close-ups but this snug right here is so [ __ ] beautiful like it's probably not showing up on the camera that best because the lighting right now is kind of shitty i apologize for that but this is a beautiful [ __ ] nug so so one thing that i forgot to mention is the [ __ ] the smell on this like the nose on this bud it definitely has like what the what that um like the leafly said it definitely has like a fresh citrus slightly like spicy aroma but like a zesty citrus like it said i don't know it's really hard to like explain the smell but it's so it smells amazing it's no so [ __ ] fire so we got the bowl loaded up here as you can see pretty decent sized bowl you know what i mean not a fancy bong but it gets the [ __ ] job done so yeah let's get into this um you guys are smoking along hope you guys are smoking something dank if you guys are cheers let's [ __ ] get it so hidden pastry indica dominant 34 thc 38 total cannabinoids and yeah let's get it cheers super tasty super flavorful it has like it tastes a little bit different than it smells to be honest but it tastes amazing it smells amazing um [Music] also yeah by the way um this [ __ ] was grown by growth science like i said growth science is like probably one of the one of the top companies out here in arizona right now that like make concentrates maybe grow their own flower you know they're like they're killing the game out here right now um i'll throw up their instagram like right here if you guys want to go check them out and um yeah their information will be down in the description too as well if you want to go check them out so shout out girl science that shit's fire but yeah this [ __ ] is dank as [ __ ] like i was saying um i'm already kind of stoned out those two hits which is kind of like a for me it's like a i have a high tolerance because i mainly smoke wax i mainly smoke concentrates and um so like when i smoke a bowl of flour i mean like it gets me kind of just chilled out you know i mean like more chilling than like stoned but the fact that i'm already feeling a little bit high off these two hits is like i can tell this shit's potent as [ __ ] you know what i mean so um again if you guys are smoking along cheers i'm gonna try to kill this last like half a bowl in one hit so cheers [Music] i pretty much cashed it there's like a little small hit left in there but you know what i mean for the most part that shit's pretty much cash um so yeah honestly i'm already [ __ ] stoned not this [ __ ] um i was thinking about rolling up a joint in this video too but to be honest i don't want this video to be too long honestly i think i might just end the video here instead of rolling up a joint um if you guys would prefer these videos to be longer like you want to see me smoke a bowl and then also go smoke a joint make the videos like a little bit longer maybe a little bit more entertaining let me know if you guys want to see that down below in the comments if you put um or if you prefer them being a little bit shorter like this just getting like everything that just you know i mean just getting everything out there and just having the videos be as short as possible let me know if you prefer that either way whatever way works for me i guess it's just your preference because i'm making these videos for your entertainment so let me know down below in the comments which way you prefer but um the taste five out of five the taste on this [ __ ] is amazing the smell the way that it smells another five out of five this [ __ ] is [ __ ] crazy um yeah this [ __ ] stink as [ __ ] so taste and smell five out of five the high like i said i only smoked one bowl but i'm already [ __ ] kind of kind of high like if i went outside and smoked that joint i'll be cashed and it's only like 12 o'clock right now 12 p.m i don't want to be like two cash all day so you know what i mean you gotta gotta limit yourself but yeah um the high is like a 5 out of 5 38 total cannabinoids that's [ __ ] high as [ __ ] it's probably like some of the highest tested weed i've ever had lowkey but um the high the taste the smell um like an overall score i think don't the price on this [ __ ] is the one thing that's a little bit too expensive i mean the price on this is a little bit expensive in my opinion but i mean if you're bougie and you want the top shelf [ __ ] this is probably some of the best [ __ ] you can get but like 90 bucks for a quad is [ __ ] really expensive in my opinion but it's worth the price um i'll give it a 5 out of 5 overall score definitely 5 out of 5. um the only complaint i have about it is that the price is like 90 bucks a quad i mean that's not too bad but it's up there you know what i mean but for the it's like it's worth it i don't know for the quality of it it's definitely worth it you got it like you pay for what you get you know what i mean so um yeah if you see hidden pastry definitely pick it up definitely try it out um if you see growth sciences hidden pastry 100 pick it up and try it out and let me know what you guys think of it down below in the comments or if you guys ever tried it let me know what you guys thought of

subscribe to this channel turn those notifications on and that way you can get up-to-date information on what I have new posts out for reviews or tutorials also give me a big thumbs up if you like what you see and leave a comment down below so that I can give you guys the content you would like to see on this channel ok today's review it's a live resin from Empire Wellness this runs 70 dollars a gram and it comes in at 55 point five percent CBD per 1 gram container this is a great product that ships very discreetly and quickly and when you open up that package you'll see a glass container that has your live resin inside of it it has a screw on plastic top with the branding for empire wellness and extracts on there also the information about this product it says 55 milligrams of CBD and this this live resin is actually extracted from two different strains and that is the ACDC and Charlotte's Web strain both of these are well known for helping with epilepsy the seizures that are associated with that pain discomfort and inflammation now when you open up that size-appropriate container you will see a yellow buttery type of consistency for this live resin it's not sticky and gooey as I was expecting it it's actually a little more moist than a crumble so it's easy to just carve off a chunk of this for putting in your nail putting on a nail putting in your vape pen or whatever you choose to vaporize this with I suggest you grab a glop of this and you throw it on those vaporizers or rigs and you start vaping this stuff now the flavor the flavor I got was mixed but the majority of the flavor I got had a very nice lemons move flavor to it although there was a sweetness in there when I hit this on an electric nail and it had almost like a bubblegum type flavor but I only got that sensation just one time the nice thing about this is even though you use a small amount you can still get enormous clouds so a lot of density a lot of volume with a small amount of material I set my vaporizer pen to the medium setting and it work just fine it is very smooth the exhale also has reminiscent flavors of lemon but it doesn't stay on your tongue that long so it kind of dissipates quite quite quickly now the effects within about a minute I could feel that characteristic heaviness behind my eyes the relaxation in my neck my back my shoulders I just felt at ease and very peaceful and that sensation lasted for me maybe an hour an hour and a half I came back I took some more puffs of this from my vape pen and I was set for another couple hours I really like the product it's a relatively high priced product but I think that might be because you're taking it from two separate strains and with the co2 extraction you're just paying for the processing and where it's derived I have to give this 5 out of 5 on my dabber scale it did what I was expecting it to do the flavor was good it was smooth there was no irritation on the back of my throat no matter what and I just really liked the effects so 5 out of 5 on my dad or skill for this this is the live resin wax from Empire Wellness I will provide a link down below so you can pick some of that up coming up I have some more reviews from Empire Wellness including a 99% CBD isolate with Grape Ape turps and their auto CBD flower this doesn't have any THC but it provides quite a nice feeling when combusted alright guys thanks for viewing again subscribe if you can and stay tuned I'll see you soon", "HjVnvEy-IkA": "what is going on welcome back to the I smoke Channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today we're going to be covering diamonds and sauce versus shatter two forms of cannabis extract but what is the difference and how in fact are they similar those are the questions that we are going to be answering in today's video remember to hit that like and subscribe button if you are feeling these videos that helps us grow rich even more people and get our message out there so without further adieu let's talk diamonds and shatter I've got my Chuck B glass piece originating in the USA for today's video it's getting out of the Pelle case so I can show you what it looks like oh yes and we are gonna fill it with water you ready and here we go we are ready to kick off the video let's put this pillowcase away the old one 120 Pelle case what you need if you're traveling with your glass let's talk about the difference between shatter and diamonds and sauce we're gonna start with the most familiar form of extract that you've probably come across for ready it is shatter and this has been on the market since at least a few years ago but all the way people have been extracting cannabis going back to the last century recently shatter has become a much bigger thing lead partially due to the advent of medical legalization and recreational legalization in the States that is where this was first super popular and now extracts come in this form so what does she look like shatter can have different coloration but is generally gonna look a bit more stable than other forms of cannabis extract when you get shatter you will know it is shatter because it will literally shatter when you break it you can see from the way that it breaks although some of it may potentially be a little bit more sticky but basically shatter looks like this this is some lovely mimosa shatter we got beer 710 this is what shatter should look like if it is clean it might come in a different color look at the consistency look at the sort of golden hue and just just look at it guys you can see that that is some nice-looking chatter if it's tiny or if it has got too much chlorophyll or aged plant material eg trimming it it might be darker and you might see shatter that's like really dark almost black looking I wouldn't really want to dab that anymore but have done in the past how does it differ to diamonds and sauce well let's take you through what diamonds and silks of Diamonds themselves are almost pure THC a crystals basically 99 point something percent tetrahydrocannabinol where is the source is a mixture of Turks some cannabinoids and the flavonoids giving it this lovely rich flavor profile not being an extractor I don't know too much about the process of creating diamonds in source but the source is a really Turkey volatile cannabis extract that is on the other side of the spectrum to something like shatter shatter has a really nice stability to it although it may degrade into a more waxy like substance over time particularly when not refrigerated as those turps cannabinoids flavonoids begin to break down into a delicious extract soup that's when you'll see shatter waxing up diamonds and sauce basically is like honey sort of looking liquid the diamonds are the crystallization of that so that could happen when the extract has been left in a pressurized compartment over time it begins to crystallize and over the last few years the process has been honed and developed until we start seeing big thca crystals that look like rocks basically and that is diamonds and source I really like the flavor profile you get on this I think it's very hard to replicate the diamonds and sauce flavor profile in shatter or even in fact in other forms of cannabis extracts the more stable something is the less in my experience is the flavor some exploded in my mouth you know a lot whether it's with the Diamonds and sauces so volatile goes turps something which is unparalleled so this is some lemon skittles diamonds and sauce you might be familiar with the skittles strain skittles with that is a really popular Cali import strain lemon skills in their skills cross and this is the diamonds and source of that straight away I can tell you that out the to extract this one smells really nice this one smells about ten times nicer you get a little bit of the aroma with the shatter but with the diamonds and sauce it is really really stinky in a really lovely way for the lemon citrus the skills sweetness you know that fruity pebbles types or a sweetness I've got both of them in front of me I can smell this one and I can't smell this one diamonds and sauce is going to smell a bit stronger because of the volatile nature of the extract you know it's lighter pea sauce shatters a little bit more stable than that stability means that you can pick it up with your hand as you see with this shutter I can just pick it up and hold it and that is because it is nice and stable allowing me to do that without it breaking down I couldn't pick this up and hold it I'd get it sauce all over my hands and that would be a waste we need Abdul for that so that's a comparison between shatter and diamonds and source hopefully I haven't missed much out do feel free to add your input your insights in the comments section I think that people will be wondering what the difference is between the different forms of cannabis extract and Shatter versus diamonds and sauce is an interesting comparison should we dab some first of all we're gonna start with these shatter this is mimosa another really popular cannabis strain that I'm sure some of you would have heard of so you can say this is Shattuck is as I'm digging my dad's hole into it it's literally splintering off into little portions you need to be careful with shatter particularly when cold that you don't accidentally flick it off of your your parchment paper and onto the floor sometimes it can be harder to pick up with a dab tool than than with your fingers as this is proving because it's just not sticky we are ready to go live with this dab of mimosa shatter and I'll see you guys on the other side wow that mimosa flavor is delicious but I do find with shatter he's sort of got a very slight chattery taste to it so you sort of can taste the form of cannabis extract it is now a wonder whether that is actually the lack of volatile Terps meaning that it's not as flavorsome as other forms now there is also something to say about open-loop blasting versus closed-loop distilled butane both of these forms of extract are extracted using a solvent it looks like this it is called butane and it is the same gas as goes into your blow torches your clipper lighters etc obviously handling this stuff in an enclosed environment is dangerous it is extremely flammable that is why it is recommended that if you don't know what you're doing do not try this at home I've spoke to more than one extractor that has told me that they've had an accident in the past and it's not really a little accident when it involves things like explosions and fire so stay safe people there are safer ways to make your own extracts at home just look at rosin all right should we do a dab of the diamonds and sauce and see how it compares to that in the motor shaft that we just tried I think we should it isn't the best shape to dad till family in diamonds and source actually but I think we're gonna be able to to get your nights tab allows a these looks great guys we're about to do this tab right now and I'll see you on the other side tears folks [Music] wowsa oh man all the flavor got me that dad makes your eyes forward sometimes that was intense that was expansive that actually gave me the sweats guys been a long time since I got the sweats doing a DAB the flavor of the lemon skills diamonds and sauce is absolutely incredible through the coffin I was able to get that delicious sweetness you know just as it smells it tastes and I've been dabbing that all yesterday I'm really loving that flavor so which is my favorite out of diamonds and sauce and shatter it has gotta be the diamonds and source guys and girls it is a delicious form of cannabis extracts able to give me the sweat after all this dabbing that's pretty impressive and it is certainly particularly that version of it a winning flavor and dabbing experience shutter is nice but it's got that shattering flavor but I think with the Diamonds and sauce you get this like magical level of flavor that you don't really experience anywhere else saying that though with diamonds and sauce you definitely don't need a big dab those crystals of THC a are expansive and very very strong and I just experienced that from a normal-sized dad got me quite a bit high up and giving me the sweats which I don't mind it's been a while since a DAB has done that to me but what do you think of this video folks what is your favorite form of extract have you tried dabbing it they leave your comments below this has run on to 24 minutes of filming supposed to be in a three minute video that has been the video comparing the diamonds and sauce and the shutter that's it for the moment as always thanks

how to make infused coconut oil with live resin you're going to need 1/2 cup of coconut oil 1/4 gram of your concentrate a mug I'm using this one and parchment paper now you can preheat your oven to 220 degrees now with the parchment paper I am just folding it multiple times so that way in the middle I can get like this dense so that way the wax you can just sit in there and not spread once I put it into the oven so this is what I meant the little dent in the middle just so that way the wax can sit in the middle [Music] now with your wax before you put it in the middle I recommend to spray some Pam or Coke I have Pam coconut oil just a little bit so that way it does not get stuck to the paper and it's easy to just scrape it off so just rubbing it with my fingers and then I'm just gonna place the wax in the middle I actually ended up cutting the paper so it fits exactly into the tray just so that way I can actually wrap the aluminum foil on top without it touching the wax so I'm being very careful making sure it's just straightforward and just securing the outsides now you're gonna place it in the oven for 30 minutes and once it's done I actually let it sit out for about five minutes before I put it in the freezer now this is how it's gonna look like when it's fully de carved then place into the freezer for five minutes now [Music] with a half cup of coconut oil you're gonna pour it into the coffee mug or any microwave-safe mug and you're gonna place it into the oven for one minute you want to make sure the coconut oil is hot so that way the wax can dissolve easily and now here comes the fun and easy part of infusing your coconut oil so all you have to do is scrape off your wax your concentrate your shatter whatever you're using and just stir it into the hot coconut oil make sure you stir it thoroughly so that way the wax dissolves fully [Music] [Music] okay so now I'm almost done just scraping off the less bits that I can get off the live resin to put it into the coconut oil now you're gonna grab your container I like to use mason jars and just pour your infused coconut oil in there now you can either store it in the fridge just like this or you can just pour it into your food or you can just freeze it so that way you can last longer and that's how you get your infused coconut oil with wax with shattered light resin or whatever concentrate way easier you don't have to strain it like when you're using flour so yeah as you can see I didn't stir it evenly so make sure you really stir consistently while the coconut oil is hot so that way you can get a really good batch but yeah let me know what you guys think I'm actually gonna see what I'm gonna be making with this one I'm not sure I'm gonna make the kick pops or try out some methods I have to make some Mexican candies so the heart is kind of hard so I don't see a lot of edible Mexican candy but yeah let me know what you guys think make sure to hit the like button make sure to share

my favorite extracts when I'm here in Colorado so what's so special about your lab in the extra so one thing that's unique about apothecary extracts is we're vertically integrated we grow all of our cannabis here in-house and most of it is actually sold out of our dispensary locations we have three locations in Colorado Pueblo Colorado Springs and Denver awesome yeah I went to the Broadway one last night and got some fire yeah let's go check it out so we have how many plants we got the building here James this is one of three cultivation sites that we operate we're gonna go check out the bedroom so this is the badging room right here wow this is nicely set up yeah one thing you'll notice is the environment here it feels really it's almost almost a perfect environment oh yeah perfect each room changes its own hair so you can see three different scales of production all the plants that you see over there on the left are getting ready to flip over into flower here within the next week so that's how high we it's awesome some unique strains that we grow here the Tropicana cookies the jam band our in-house project the raspberry lychee who we also have blackberry banana Kush lemon GE one of my favorite new strains classic we grab the star dog Death Valley cheese the blue lemon tie among a few other streams you got it going on right now well I was I did a live feed on the way here and I talked about I could see that you you and your team really care about the product what you present to the people his highest standards you know absolutely you know one thing that you will find is all of our you know the higher ups at apothecary are true connoisseurs and passionate about the product really passionate about cannabis concentrates and we do everything in our power to put out a really clean Heitor bean extract awesome let's check out some more stuff they extracted out sorry it's funny this is the starter he runs the squash op this is our solving this extractor awesome so maybe we can get him on policy got a nice little present yeah yeah peer pressure but he's getting ready to do some pressure you get some bottle and I can show so what happened looks almost empty now we actually just moved into a new facility Friday is our new Pueblo map this will it will still be an operation that we may end up doing something at this facility but really all of our operations will be down look at this but now this is a bubble ash well boats training to look around for all got to get my nose on this we all need are these looking out beautiful but my quantity - one is 777 he said he might come yeah it said and then when they press this oh my gosh fire and then when they put it into one of these in the back oh you get some diamonds from this diners philosophy but you can actually die map dot - that's how fine it is we got some stuff here right now what's the average time you leave stuff in the back depends on like if you want to make really nice diamonds oh so like if you would make really large diamonds you know three weeks plus but for just a basic crystallization I mean these guys can crash on a jar overnight I want to show you this is some of us it's that pressure still no some raspberry cheek batter ooh what was some rosin look at this rosin here that's the and you know as saltless is becoming more and more in demand that's all the Salinger's one thing flower refreshment work one thing I really like about someone's fashion you can't line up supplements okay witness hydrocarbons don't even really clean up an extract that's absolutely you know poisons and sprays you know just a really deficient plant and and you can clean it up so nobody knows that is the diffusion length with rosin you can't you know you don't have a great product you're not going to make your awesome or it's going to be something that's so undesirable nobody wants to smell bad it tells me that it takes my bark to speak of looking at on the right point nine percent THC a 99.999 point but 99.99999 point THC a right there that's a big jar guys I'll nobody can see how much is in there because it's so white but there's what so now which one are you getting ready right now what is this Sarah diesel so the sour do you said that we just looked at those 25 25 micron well it's different Mike but now can you explain the difference on Mike grunts real quick the smaller size is what you learned yet and why are you different sizes that sometimes each side smell is broken down to a different granules and holes usually secondly is the most impressed I was working is we're really just going to go weekend and now you want to even write you do you don't want no gaps or anything why is it that you don't want to gaps in there so that way whenever you squish it out it's all messed up even so everything awesome thank you it's free to go with us yeah oh man look at all this stuff working yes it this is all bubble hash in your people what else we got here you have anything besides these are a raspberry Gucci right more raspberry lychee that's a East Coast sour D cross at the blackberry cush Wow grown and bred in house a type object it's a real angel oh wow that does that mean Wow and that's the things like you know watch it took me a newt it even creates tips up to absolutely different Turkey yeah in mind you don't get that true expression until it gets pressed yep you know what I mean you know the strain could have very little smell in bubble hash form and then when it's finally pressed out it's just as loud as ever so much repressed sometimes or it's high in goes I are right because that truther people we're going to move on to the production facility where everything gets packaged graham set out so here we are in the packaging area of apothecary extract so this is some jamman that we are getting ready to draw at the various facilities oh that is so means this Jamaican skunk crossed with the headband yeah all saw the was nice she's got a very very unique oh so that's actually so that's the higher micron yeah so check that out yeah rosin is just getting turf here and better to love the science behind it I just you know what I was I said I've been in two decades I dreamed it you go like this but I never dreamed that it would go yeah so yes so all of our all of our saltless is in this essentially woodgrain lid just as a way to differentiate between our Soliman hydrocarbon your high quality stuff ended up absolutely laughs the shadow games rings laughs a shot yeah it's getting ready to you like it looks like you're like a kitchen actually I can't kitchen kitchen cooking but it's not you all chatter yeah let me show you what we got here all proper and I Turkey everything we do is about preserving the Turks there's our bubble hash makers right there 15:28 packagers know what does the average pakistani do - how many do pack a day ground on a lot and they needed 600 40s live version last month I think we grabbed out just medically it was like 53 thousand grams and then in inch on average a you guys back all the coastal up for house was full of other your batter is is on point even your dogs are your batter by that batter is like oh my god and that's a cat see Bubba purple punch across a new strain that we have here at apothecary", "vgjaAHTDCEw": "[Music] [Music] [Music] what's up everyone welcome back to the thc spot where we review concentrates flowers a little bit of edibles and anything to see related so thank you for all your support today i'm bringing you guys some of that mr bees extracts yep they did a collaboration with the cannabis brothers a lot of you are familiar with them they grow very good flowers pretty dope packaging so far um tells you their terpene profile all the test lab results of course this is the triangle mints indica and it's dope because it tells you the cross of the flowers and this one is triangle kush and animal mints so um therefore we're in for a treat on that and uh this was made with indoor flour this is a sugar consistency i believe it doesn't really look saucy as you can tell right here um kind of like slushy consistency smells super terpy right off the bat i'm not gonna lie i've already tried it because i got two grams they had a special going on but this is the fresh new one and right off the bat when i went through that one gram like each dab was flavorful everything was terpe terpenes are bomb and definitely it's cool how it tells you your cannabinoids profile and the terpenes like i said earlier so that's a good thing um i went ahead and loaded up a good dab in the carta at the lowest setting because it's live resin you don't want to burn the terpenes and i also have it in the titanium bucket which is the metal bucket you know so yeah it's clean there's no residue no other flavors in there so that we can try it all out right here so mr b's extracts big shout out to you guys because uh they seem to have some bombs so damn slice a little weird okay oops my bad anyways here we go mr bees extracts indica triangle mints triangle kush with animal mints let's go here we go we're going to try to get some milky clouds on the lowest setting a lot of people wonder how you get milky clouds off the carta i recommend just hitting it real slow just mellow don't get too crazy on it here it is it's ready [Music] very tasty very tasty terpenes are on point citrusy flavor tins of lime lemon so that was the lowest setting we wanted to try the terpenes and uh they are fully there very good it has a very uh unique flavor i'm getting those little dab sweats already um let me go ahead and load one more so we can go ahead and give you one last description on it and uh i'll let you know my final opinion right so here we go we got it loaded up we're going to go ahead and um turn up the temperature to the second setting which is 600 degrees all right second setting here we go and the carta as you see it was a little bit milkier on the cloud still terpy i'm freaking blown from the first dab wow met my expectations very terpy um like i said it has a very very uh strong kind of lemon citrus flavor definitely not artificial straight plant you can get these brands from 35 to 45 bucks i got mine at the catalyst in the east side of long beach um all the info is there total thc is 71 1.50 cbd total 85 cannabinoids i definitely approve the product check them out i'll put the instagram below hope you guys felt the music in the background and um yeah feeling great definitely improve have a great day peace", "PG88Ezyr8cc": "hey guys youtube's been real awesome about the community guidelines so if you are over the age of 18 you're cool but if you're not please don't watch this [Music] oh [Music] [Music] my last harvest was just over a month ago and it was a pretty good bounty [Music] i had all the jars full of some big chunkers but i was also left with a bunch of small buds and shake [Music] now i'm not into eating edibles i'm more of a joint or dab kind of guy and i don't mess around with chemicals so that means bh no thank you i keep things solventless not just for health reasons but honestly it's it's for the terp reasons i do it for the terps sullivanless is is the bee's knees now that does leave me with two options nice water hash extraction aka good old-fashioned bubble hash or that's a good one using gravity in these dry sift screens aka dry sifting [Music] [Applause] so in the past i've had my share of bubble runs okay the bubble wrap itself always goes smooth especially since i always work with fresh material that wasn't too old for harvest [Music] the yields and the color was it was on point all good signs of some decent quality bubble hash but when it came time to the drying process that's where i noticed a lot of that nice color being lost i was drawing the bubble hash in these boxes and leaving them by an ac unit and dehumidifier [Music] just like that grind it down microplane it i even started to microplane the bubble first just to see if that would help the process but i still noticed the hash go from amazing top shelf color to looking like well looking like some dark moroccan ash once it was all dried and i noticed this happening on every run i would pull great color but dry the hash into dark chocolate and if i press that bubble into rosin i would just end up with some bad color hash rosin ultimately it wasn't working but i didn't know where the kink was and it was the drying phase [Music] i was told i needed a dry freezer so you know i went online to see what that was all about and uh it was all about five thousand dollars for one which is very expensive piece of equipment and i'm not sure i have the balls to commit to a purchase like that at this point i would almost want to have an entire room dedicated to hash for that to be viable and i simply don't have the room and i'm certainly not sacrificing my gym space [Music] despite my lack of quality when it came to drying bubble i did have another option these dry sift screens [Music] this method uses gravity and agitation and since i was working with material that was already dry i didn't have to sacrifice any loss when it came to quality [Music] and of course this quality would spew out on the rosin press i'm happy oh look at the color that's fresh off the press color bro yeah that's really nice now on all my hash videos i always get a few comments from someone who like doesn't really dab and and they will comment why press the dry sift into rosin seems like a big waste i just smoke it in bowls and joints that's completely fine makes sense if you're not into dabbing but the reason why i like to press it into hash rosin is because it creates a more concentrated version of hash after all i am starting with trim which isn't very strong [Music] just for the heck of it let's just say between 10 i don't know maybe 20 in thc and then of course when we break that down through the dry sift screens we are left with obviously less weight but also a stronger product that could be i don't know once again just for example 50 [Music] thc and if we grab that tricep and press it into rosin we are once again creating a more concentrated version upwards of 70 thc for example once again i'm making these numbers up but this is kind of how it goes [Music] and since i do keep things solving this right from the beginning the hash horizon not only packs an incredible punch but it also has a starburst of terps when it comes to the taste and by the way that does not mean i'm not going to keep some of the dry sift for supercharging joints so i'm about to start my first run aka the quick bounce method i'm just using the one screen the 110 mesh count aka 149 micron i'm pretty sure honestly the conversions can sometimes get confusing but i'm pretty sure that's right now to make this entire process as efficient as can be i'm grabbing my dry material directly from the freezer and quickly dropping it onto the screen the material needs to be bone dry and frozen two key factors in increasing the dry sift yields this first run is supposed to be quick with minimum agitation i don't want to overwork the material break it down too much causing contaminants to go through creating a less melty first run dry sift quick clean and i'm removing all the material off the screen before i place more down now i do want to mention that this is in no way advice on how to dry sift guys i'm simply just showing you what i do with my leftovers from harvest take from it what you will if you really want to do a deep dive into the dry sifting world there is a lot more to learn from static dry sifting to different karting tech i'm honestly just showing what i do in honestly the least technical way possible i guess this is just how i quickly clean and collect some heads from my trim if you're one of those crazy [ __ ] that want to know more about dry sifting just check out channels like mark the bubble man or even john berfello there's a few of them out there that go pretty deep into all the different styles of dry sifting a lot more deeper into what i'm doing the first run is always a rewarding one the fact that i can spend as short as 10 minutes dropping shake onto screens and have such a pretty pile of some first run almost full melt sift it's pretty [ __ ] a-okay with me so today i am doing a second run now for this second run i haven't always used the four screens sometimes i just use the one screen only the 110 mesh and i just work the material longer however there is a nice little extra filtering effect when rocking all four dry sift screens the very top screen is called the working screen and it's 60 mesh count aka 250 micron the second screen is 90 mesh count which is 190 micron the third screen is 110 mesh count which is 149 micron in the bottom yellow screen is 200 mesh cal which is 74 micron so on the second run i will work the material on the top screen for anywhere between one and three minutes before discarding into my trim bin now this is something i wish i could say i thought of myself but it was a friend actually he came over one night and was like dude pull the bin out this is another way to catch some additional heads which other words would be lost if you know i discard it into a bin like i used to i've ran all my material through the top working screen and now i'm down to the 90 mesh count aka 190 micron [Music] into the naked eye this big pile of dry sift looks pretty clean but looks can be deceiving after a few minutes of lightly carting back and forth a lot of the heads fall through to the bottom screen and was left on top of the 190 micron screen is dirty [Music] contaminants [Music] and finally getting down to the bottom 200 mesh count aka 74 micron screen where i have myself a pretty darn clean pile of heads [Applause] drop a like if you uh if you like rick and morty hopefully there's a billion likes on this video because of that for this second dry sift run um i spent 30 to 40 minutes probably in totality working the material and what was left on the very bottom 74 micron screen aka 200 mesh count for anyone who's keeping track uh was a pile of dry sift that totaled 30 something grams roughly like 31 grams and i would call this dry sift half melt status this is not full melty melt amazing dry sift this is just amazing dry sift that's half melt that was a bad analogy you can take that polish and implement other cleaning strategies like static dry sifting and or the carting tech you can use those two as options to clean up a dirty palace sift so if you are like me and you do want to press some of the dry sift that you managed to collect into rosin well cool over the years i've done double begging tech where i would grab the 25 micron bag from rosin evolution and stuff that inside a 160 micron bag and the only reason why i was doing double bagging tech was just to avoid or reduce my chances of actually having a blowout honestly it freaking sucks when you have a blowout when you're pressing your hash it's like it's not really something you can salvage if you have a blowout the hash will literally spew out of the rosin press like it's taking a [ __ ] gnarly [ __ ] and it's just unfortunate because it's like ruined and it was something that happened a lot when i was uh rosin pressing earlier on that's why i used to use a double banking tech and it would reduce the chances kind of of having a blow up but what i also noticed was i was still having blowouts bro because i was just coming down too quick too fast when i take so much time off and then come back to pressing rosin you kind of have to like relearn the the nuances of everything so as of recently i have just been using the 125 micron bag for pressing my hash and when i do get it into the press i just take i don't want to say take my sweet time coming down with the pressure because the longer it's in the press the more degraded the hash can end up so there is like a sweet spot when it comes to pressing the hash super low time too no blowout i'm happy oh look at the color that's fresh off the press color bruh that's right what i've noticed is i come down too quick and i end up with a blowout so that's kind of why i take my sweet time uh increasing the pressure it's just to avoid the huge hiccup of having that [ __ ] blowout man [Music] now on instagram i've seen a few people like they are yielding like 80 return off the bubble they are pressing into rosin and i've never been close to 80 returns i've done 50 and 60 returns but never more [Music] and i've done this a few times i've never had anything spew 80 percent return something something was in my mouth that was weird i just had a bunch of chickens jesus christ swear to god my [ __ ] tits are getting too big for this shirt one thing i do regret about the sif screens that i purchased is the overall size these are 12 by 24 inches and honestly when i bought them i thought this was the right decision i'm just a home gardener i'm not some commercial op but that was a mistake it honestly was a mistake i should have opted for at least the one size up if not just should have got just shoulda woulda but coulda but didn't i should have got the two by three feet size screens which are [ __ ] mammoth but honestly worth it should have done it didn't you can um still make work of the larger screens even in a smaller scale operation that's what i'm trying to get at took me an entire [ __ ] paragraph to okay episode two of the closet series will be coming out next i'm going to basically start working on the video the second this one's done i am sorry for the massive delays i have not just one grow up i have actually multiple grows right now all going which are all being documented heavily from seed to harvest and i've been trying to keep them under wrap however i'm not doing a good job at that because i'm telling you guys about them right now oh my rick and morty poster fell down perfect so we are at the correct height for optimal dabbing just want to say if you're still watching this video to like the video because you know it's a pretty long video and if you're still watching it that means you like me [ __ ] also subscribe for better wheat this rig i think is called decline recycler i think i'm not gonna lie i'm not too sure so if you know exactly what kind of rig this is to drop it down below i have not taken a dab from this particular rig in probably a hot year hot year why do i say things so weird it's been over a year since taking a dab off this rig my go-to rigs as of recently have been um bottle rigs for some reason i just really like the way they chug and um also probably because they are the newest you know pieces to my collection so i've been you know going ham on those bottle rigs but they do chug like a [ __ ] [Music] first dab of the day okay that first dab was [ __ ] so we're gonna do another dab here um [ __ ] [Music] oh [Music] that was a little hot it [ __ ] still had a lot of flavor it wasn't too too hot it's just a little hot i am [ __ ] high right now holy [ __ ] hey guys thank you so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it um please don't forget to like subscribe and of course what else [Music] i'm really stoned and like i can see some dust on my lens and i'm i just i can't help but think that you can see the dust freckle you", "oQhItiXuOJ0": "[Music] parents look closely at this picture it looks like regular coughs syrup if you saw it in your childhood room would you think twice about it it's called cush the drug got a Miami Dolphins player arrested in Collier County this week and then he was cut from the team we sent NBC to investigator David Hodges to find out what it is and you know if these illegal drugs are hidden in plain sight being a big issue for parents and Peter the biggest danger is that they're far more pwned than anything parents may have seen or even tried when they were young so to help your kids we're gonna help you spot them at a quick glance you might not recognize it what does this look like to you ketchup pills that looks like marijuana syrup the final answer is correct Kush syrup found in the car of Miami Dolphins player and Collier County sold in a medical marijuana dispensary in California but not untouchable for kids in South West Florida pretty much everything through online channels you can figure out a way together Steven hill helps kids with substance abuse at Sal's care he says teens will try something like Co syrup just because it's new but I just think it's a different way to do it different and possibly more dangerous syrup has a thousand milligrams of THC the active principle of marijuana per bottle and if taken all at once 10 to 20 times what you're typically going against smoking a joy the side effects would be palpable a lot of times very erratic hallucinations and you can also get psychosis on a temporary basis so the the judgment and your behaviors are definitely impacted grown-ups don't know Lesley Robinson is founder of Street chicks and recovery which runs a marijuana adolescent prevention program in Lee County middle schools she also produces videos helping educate kids about some of the side effects of marijuana in products like Co syrup and it's so potent you're gonna be able to tell your child is high she says the best way for parents to spot these drugs is to pay attention to the new products on the market educate yourself on the other forms besides the bag and the smell the Collier County Sheriff's Office told us they don't recall ever making any arrests where this kind of syrup was down before but many of these drugs come and wave so the best advice for parents be on the lookout if you didn't buy it or authorize it question it for the NBC to investigators I'm David Hodges call email or download the NBC 2 news app and submit your tip now", "goRyqKC9Tjo": "yo what's good youtube hope everyone sunday is going well today i've got a nice video for you guys i got a trip review of some budget oil this is some crc ran oil right here um it's all by altered alchemy this is some budget stuff here in oregon going from uh 13 to 15 to g on saturday 15 to 17 on a normal day i'm here at the dysport i go to this one's a little bit drier this one's one of the 13 ones and those are those other ones are the 15. now let me like get into crc just for a quick second before i start dabbing these crc is color remediation for those of you who don't know it basically strips some of the color out of your oil but it also strips some of the terps so it does make it kind of a more bland terpene profile a very light crc will strip some of the color but also leave enough of your terps intact where it tastes different a heavy crc is going to taste like in my opinion kind of tastes like dog [ __ ] it's it's a very bad taste to me um i'm just going to be straight up this one right here i'm probably not even gonna dab during this video i just got one gram of this to try it and we took two dabs yesterday and it is just i'm not gonna lie it's not very pleasant it just tastes like straight crc which i'm trying to explain the flavor in the smell when you smell a gram of straight crc it's almost a lemony smell like an artificial lemon um almost like a capri sun you know where it's slightly orangey but it just like has this this like i can't put my nose on exactly what that smell is it's it almost smells like a tiny bit artificial to me but it's not it's not um that's just the smell that it gives right so on the heavy side of crc you get everything tasting exactly like that having a crazy clear color like this guava skunk right here but then on the lighter side the lighter side you get stuff that maybe it slightly takes out a bit of color and leaves enough terps to where you have a difference in flavor profile that being said even when it is a light crc as some of these kind of are a little bit lighter you know maybe the color didn't go crazy to light you're left with some of the terps but then you also have some of the crc flavors so it goes both ways so for a budget line like altered is doing this is anthology's budget line pretty damn good deals how can you beat 15 and gram out the door right well let's try them let's see how they taste and uh let's go from there and i'll review each one of these i'll tell you which one's worth it which one's not worth it and how i feel they compared to what i've been buying recently which is viola which is 24g here in oregon 22 a g on saturday so um speaking this is 50 less being 17 a g on a normal day 15 a g on saturday that's seven dollars less which is pretty much fifty percent so it's significant so now i'm going to try to tackle in this review is it worth paying 50 more for viola or is this budget more worth it for your buck we'll see um i guess i'll just start it by heating up the first [ __ ] damn let's go all right we got it heated up and ready for the first dab here some guava skunk this one's the lightest out of the four and choose everyone [Music] yeah i mean that was a really nice uh nice size dab it was rather large oh no i got a glob of reclaim on my finger let's see if okay so let's get to the review it's not harsh at all actually it's very very smooth um yesterday when i took my first dab of it i was like is it slightly harsher than the other stuff i've been dabbing i think my answer for that is no it's not it's actually very smooth that one especially it's really nice smooth the flavor though it doesn't like smack you in the face with terps or anything you know sometimes you get sometimes you get a gram of oil and you're just like damn the terps on this one are just so good they just make your cheeks pucker and they just really just give you that feeling we're just like oh terps um i don't get that feeling here i'm not gonna lie that being said from one that oh [ __ ] me oh [ __ ] okay sorry everyone i dropped my uh my insert on the ground which you really don't want to do they're hot do i have carpet burn to this now i don't want a dab carpet bro [ __ ] i might be able to get it off let's [Music] yeah i think i'll be able to get most of it yeah here we go i got it we'll get the fuzzies out of there all right give me a second we'll tune back in once i finish this", "xLuO9hF25fA": "yah what's going on people it's time for new video in this one we'll be teaching you how to dab without a know this was gonna be directed to the people that wanna Tory dabbing that want to press out their own roles in but don't have either add a break or a nail that they can put onto a bong and dab with that but we get into this or do you need to see these videos were intended for people they're 18 years and older and they're made for educational and entertainment purposes only now it's gonna be quite a short one today is it gonna be anything too crazy there's one method that I do want to go over there are a couple other methods that you can use however I feel that this is probably the easiest and the most foolproof one because if you've got some oil you know and if you're used to smoke an oil you know how precious the stuff is you don't get much of it and wasting some of it is a [ __ ] nightmare so what we're going to be doing is known as a cherry bomb now if don't know what cherry bomb is it's where you get a bowl of weed in a bomb you torture up and then you dab on the cherry okay it sounds a little bit weird but when you go through it name so I've got my daily driver bong here and I've got my bowl now when you're doing this you want to be prepared do not fumbling about trying to get things ready while you're hitting the ball first thing you want to do is pack a bowl of weed nice and tight make sure you get that really nice and compact you're probably gonna need a torch or a form of jet lighter in order to get this going hot enough to be able to dab off of it properly I'll tell you why you would doing everything this specific way as we go but basically when it comes to packing the ball you want it to be as dense as possible because you want it to stay in the bowl for as long as possible because your focus isn't gonna be hitting the bong your focus is going to be vaporize in your oil and you're gonna just be using the weed as a tool to do so so having a bit of weed in with there here is a bonus but it's not what you're focused on so make sure it's nice and packed and you've got a lighter that will get it hot as [ __ ] that we just got your bong ready make sure you get yourself a nice little dab ready we've pressed actual rolls and earlier I hope you can see that that's gonna be our dab for today now my recommendation with a dab some people like to get a nice little glob on the they're dubba regardless of how you want to do it make sure that you've got it nice and stringy you don't want it to be dense pieces of oil but they'll take a lot longer to vaporize off of the cherry so the thin area is and the less that's all bunched together the easier this is gonna melt and burn and you're not going to end up wasting any because at some point or another that weed is gonna pull through and if you haven't finished all your oil and it hasn't completely vaporized you're just wasting your dab I'm gonna show you what that looks like does a [ __ ] up doing this video as you can see the oil just wasn't melt in it was staying in one big glob and then you end up getting all the ash just attached to the oil itself so you can't even dab it after so it is literally just a waste of it so like I said make sure is straight so soon this is a completely [ __ ] it the first time we're gonna do it again properly I've made a couple changes I've change the bond so it's an easier angle also got myself a different daddy this one is a lot prettier it's definitely smaller but this is purely just for an example so you can see exactly what you're doing where is it there we go so as you can see we've kept the dab a lot stringier than the last one did the problem with the last one was we left it too long it was just chilling on the side of because it's hot where I might name it just sort of collapsed on itself so we've managed to keep this one nice and space tight waiting the wasted of all time we ain't gonna [ __ ] up any more [ __ ] we're just gonna crack on and do this oh Jesus well I say throughout the making of this video I have set a trend I've just [ __ ] everything up that's no different for the last clip the video that recorded basically forgot to zoom I so literally it was just this part of my face on the screen and that was it [ __ ] stupid software I just come back and basically say what I said but in a better version though the whole thing that I wanted to get across is the fact that this is a legit way to dub it does work and after I'd hit those I did not feel like I just smoked balls I definitely could tell that I've had oil so if you do want to dab either on a budget or if you just haven't got a rig you haven't gotten there or something that you can dab off of this is definitely a good alternative so not quite the same as hitting off of of course bang on or something but it's a good middle ground and it is the best way to experience your first stab should you not have the right tools also I do want to say one thing it's not only to this video but we are approaching 420 subs now I wasn't gonna do a celebration video and 10,000 subscribers but then I finally realized well I've got in for 420 I know it's a wee Channel so that's what we're gonna be doing I ain't gonna give too much away just though it's gonna involve edibles should be quite good video so if you're new to the channel and you haven't already subscribed please do subscribe if you want to see that video anyway but that being said I'm gonna wrap this video up when I finish editing I can upload a few guys hopefully I'll see in the next one soon", "O1YIto4Xq34": "definitely love having strains like this on deck everyone loves to see it everybody loves to smoke it [Music] today i'm gonna be smoking on some gelato from gti got a fresh bowl packed up ready to go choose you guys oh yeah tastes phenomenal it's a super smooth hit gelato is a cross between sunset sherbet and thin mint girl scout cookies it originated in california in the bay area but somehow it made its way all the way to the east coast this strain is super popular mainly because of its looks it's definitely considered some rapper weed if you listen to rap at all i'm sure you've heard somebody mention smoking on some gelato at some point i mean these buds truly are gorgeous like when i look at weed this is exactly what i look for they're extremely dense and sticky buds mainly on the smaller side i picked up four different eighths so a couple of the eighths had some big nugs in it but for the most part they're pretty small buds the total thc percentage is coming in just over 24 the most prominent terpenes are karyophiline and limonene so it really has a lemony peppery smell at the same time it's super unique honestly and what's even more weird is as you grind it up it becomes more of like an earthy hoppy smell so like the set is really all over the place on this strain it's hard to really pinpoint just one cent for it [Music] the high's really nice it comes on pretty quick like just those two rips and i'm already feeling some pretty nice effects and this stuff [ __ ] reeks man i know i might sound stupid saying that because like obviously all weed smells but this weed smells like stronger and like much more noticeable and it lingers so if you're trying to like hide the smell from somebody i would really stray away from gelato because it definitely like sticks onto something i'll smoke a bowl of this and go out for a few hours and come back and i'm like oh wow my house still [ __ ] reeks of gelato i ain't bitching but hey if you live at your parents place or something and they don't like the smell of weed i would stray away from gelato at least if you're smoking in the house all right is there any life left in this bowl maybe a little it's weird it's not really fruity when you smoke it it has a couple fruity undertones but more or less you really feel like the earthiness to it all right let's take another bomb grip that was nice it does have like a little bit of a creamy taste to it on the exhale but it's definitely not fruity definitely notice more like earthy creamy taste which is why i really like gelato because it's [ __ ] unique it's definitely not your run-of-the-mill strain you're just gonna find anywhere and it's not an overwhelming high it comes on quick it stays for a while but it's not at any point where you're like [ __ ] i can't think straight like what the [ __ ] am i doing no it's like a very clear high and it's one of those strains i just [ __ ] love to look at it's bright green with patches of dark purple all around it and it just has these bright orange hairs it looks like they're just cheetos bursting out of the nug while at the same time just being drenched in terracones the more you break it up the more trichomes you'll find goddamn i love gelato dude it's a great body high i feel super mellow and relaxed but not like that like stuck on the couch feeling where you just can't do anything it's just like a really nice all-around high it's definitely one of my favorite strains but not my number one it's a little more stemmy than i'd like it to be it's a real hassle to pick out all the stems when you're smoking it and i mean this depends on the ground in the grower but this run honestly wasn't trimmed amazingly in my opinion which is annoying because honestly gti is like one of the best growers in pennsylvania but with this run at least each one of my jars had a decent amount of trim in there let's get another rip [Applause] in but this strain is great to smoke day or night it's really not going to put you to sleep it's great for the everyday smoker super euphoric you just really feel good not just like kai obviously you're gonna feel good but you just like feel good about yourself it doesn't give you any anxiety like i have anxiety as it is so sometimes when i smoke like my anxiety really amplifies but when i smoke this i don't really feel that anxious feeling at all i can be out in public i can speak to people and i feel totally normal it's not like that like oh my god what am i saying how am i gonna wear this oh my god sometimes i just totally freeze up when i'm super high in public and i really don't feel like you get that way with gelato like let's just take a moment and appreciate how beautiful this weed is great bud structure if youtube had smell vision you'd be [ __ ] yourself i definitely recommend picking this strain up if you ever see it at the dispenser i wouldn't consider it exotic which is for whatever reason the term everyone uses for like the best of the best weed which i honestly hate because like you think about the word exotic like this isn't exotic this was grown in someone's [ __ ] grove facility this wasn't grown in like the back woods of the amazons like i don't know what people think is like exotic about it like the term exotic i don't know it's just kind of silly to me but if there's like a term under that i guess would be like top shelf like i would definitely consider this top shelf weed but not the like exotic best of the best which everyone like always has to lose their [ __ ] over if i had to rate this out of 10 and give it like a solid 8 out of 10. my only complaint is it's a little stemmy it's really not dry at all which is really rare for pennsylvania so hats off to gti for growing some weed that's not dry i feel like i haven't really shown gti off much on my page but i actually really do like them i really have never been disappointed with any of their flower strains so if you're in pennsylvania and you see it it has my stamp of approval [Music] damn dude it really is smooth it's a great all-around strain super euphoric high super unique smell great taste definitely love having strains like this on deck everyone loves to see it everybody loves to smoke it let me know if you've ever had gelato and what you thought of it it's a pretty popular strain so it doesn't just have to be from gti but if you've seen it before let me know what you think about it but click like if you enjoyed this strain review and leave a comment let me know if you want me to do more and don't forget to subscribe i got a lot more videos on the way but if you need more popcorn in your life you can basically follow me everywhere else on the internet i'm pot underscore porn on snapchat i'm pop porn on instagram and popcorn tv on twitter let's kill this bowl real quick [Music] thank you guys so much for watching my name is jeff peace", "eTxaseIvnnA": "[Music] [Music] what guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane on Danny and we are back for a very special strain review today we are checking out the 91 Malibu pure Kush mm-hmm and we got a Blanc rolled I know this is not the best way to get your flavor from a strain but that's the only thing we got honestly we weren't prepared today no [ __ ] papers in the whole house it's honestly kind of cool because we've smoked this weed a ton of times we always get the question what is our favorite weed of all time you guys see us review all these different strains back when we review this I think the last video we did was like August 2012 the last time we reviewed the Malibu pure Kush long that long ago yeah and that video was me and Toph I think you and me might have done one of the Hollywood for like an episode or something one of those times Wow but we've been smoking on this now for [ __ ] seven eight years something like that because that we had you know smoked it a couple of times before that the - yeah I would say about 2011 seven years almost they definitely great OG unknown lineage I know they call it pure curse but it's definitely categorized as an OG in my opinion what is it that sets this one apart because obviously you guys anyone who's been watching this show for a while knows that we love our oh geez we always have what is it that makes this one different why is this the one we always come back to this one is different honestly I feel like this is where them I don't know why we say it but it's marshmallow og right this is where that just marshmallows sweet gassy aroma just comes through in my opinion you know I'm saying right that's not what you get just that though it's the smell if we had to break it down and say one thing about that just makes it different and you know the main reason why we always keep coming back to it it's gotta be for the [ __ ] smell when you crack that jar it's just a little bit different than anything else that you're you know used to seeing yeah as soon as the nut cracks you just get that [ __ ] you know it's not like straight [ __ ] gas though it's not like a sour D or even a cam or really gassy og it's more just like how do you explain it's that's sweet there definitely is some of that regular og funk in there but it's much much sweeter and it's thick it's the in its run G and it's I think to this day the best way we've come up to describe this particular smell not so much the taste but the smell yeah it's just you know Lucky Charms cereal milk totally like that that's a little bit of milk that's left over after you have a bowl of Lucky Charms so far it tastes and smells like that yeah as you look at the close-ups here guys sorry we couldn't get that good close-ups this week well honestly this stuff just got us so pride and we were so excited to smoke it that once we got down to get in the closest we kind of just half-assed it but we did the best recruit while we were down our main close-up camera - so we got lag fixed we'll have that going next week but that kind of held us back a little bit nonetheless fire ass-fucking we great high I would guess that it's somewhere by the effect I would say it's somewhere in like a 70/30 range as far as the ratio right wouldn't you say yeah I was gonna say this strain as far as how it hits you it is heavy for sure like this it packs the punch yeah that you're hoping that it does when you crack the jar and you smell it it does come through with that Mike Tyson punch so you got to give it that Chris bass it's just a really good overall strain but speaking on the bus specifically it does pack a punch it does hit you kind of right in the face right right away but it's also kind of a clear it's different high than your typical indica it's a little bit more clear upstairs with all the same body effect all we're looking for yeah I would say my favorite attribute of this flower though is definitely the taste I mean Eve through a Dutch I know there's a lot of haters out there and go ahead and hate on that but even through a Dutch man this stuff tastes [ __ ] amazing it really does so and for that I feel like weed is really good when you can taste it through like a Dutch or a backwoods you know like if you can still taste it trade me if you can still taste it through you know that's good yeah I I definitely could taste it through this but that is a little bit different back when we were smoking this stuff really really heavy back in like 2010 to 2012 2012 into the talk off this [ __ ] back in that time period we were on the bomb super heavy yeah that was before we got really into joints blunts rollin doing that type of thing back then it was almost exclusively just bong rips and I remember this always being the best tasting lead over one that didn't disappoint totally hey like this video if you ever get your fingers so sticky and then you gotta you know use the hair tech let me know if anybody uses that technique you get the fro - yeah you get the sticky fingers you've run it through your hair no more sticky fingers yeah this is definitely I'd say that's probably one of our most frequently asked questions what is your guys all-time favourite strain this has been my go-to answer for that for the past five or six years yeah we didn't I did not try this weed for the whole three year period that we lived in Colorado every time I came back I was kept saying I was gonna be like is that right there is it urban grab some I never was able to do it so this particular batch that I tried here is the first one I picked up in three or four years yeah no me too I actually I had it one time last year my buddy up in Richmond right above Oakland [ __ ] had some when we were making some beats one time smoked a couple more couple Jeffrey's up it was fired definitely don't get our hands on it enough for how much money boast about it how much we say it's our favorite string we probably have only got it really a handful of times probably about 10 times yeah they smoke this at this shop that stuff that has this cut was in NorCal it would be in the you know it'd be in the rotation toll at a time I'm just so far away from where we are you know and usually by the time like whenever something is this good and has been around for this long it makes it into more hands than this particular strain back in the day they used to be called MMRC I think they might have gone through a couple different name changes now it's green angel like I said we don't even know what the what the actual genetics are of that string it's not known unknown og lineage would be my guess somewhere along that family obviously but yeah it's it's it's unknown we're not sure where the Malibu came from or the 91 I'm guessing that has to do with you know who bred it and when and where possibly it's definitely just a super-sweet oh gee fino i mean i don't think there's any other crazy [ __ ] thrown in there with it it definitely is oh gee through-and-through but it's it's got an extra kick - it's got a little something extra going I'm [ __ ] with it right now I'm like it gets me so in dick it out in the head that's the way this is the way I can describe it I feel like I'm getting a little bit a little scrambled having a hard time producing that thought you know a hard time getting it out yeah I hoped I'm getting it out it definitely happens to me a lot yes videos so how would you rate this batch against previous batches that we've seen like like I said it's been a while since we've seen so we don't have anything really you know super recent to compare it to you know put it up against the best batches of either Malibu or Hollywood or any other peers that you've seen in the past I mean this is honestly a great batch is it gonna be the best I'm gonna say no just because for some reason the way I remember it when we first got at that first sack it was it was pretty unbeatable could I be biased because that was just like so long ago and he was the first time he tried it I know yes I could be biased but I'm gonna go out there and say like first batch was better this is definitely an amazing batch and you know I'm not even gonna waste really anybody's time to be honest rating this stuff it's a ten smell taste looks this particular batch might not be a ten but the strain overall is a 10 you know what I will say about this strain and if I just saw it on camera this goes for almost every batch of this I've ever seen if I just saw it on camera and a lineup of a bunch of other good oh geez I probably wouldn't think it was gonna be the best one yeah it doesn't always look the best no no that's a saying they've kind of sometimes is a little bit looser nut seriously for what I'm looking for free oh gee and it kind of this one the Malibu especially but also the Hollywood sometimes kind of just has like a different color to it yes it's almost like the like lime green the strawberry diesel we used to get back in the day that had the white hairs but it was like it kind of just stayed like that probably could have gone a little bit longer does this signature but this stuff always kind of looks that way - it looks like it could be a little bit immature for emoji but you smoke it and it's not dude I know that's just the only way to explain it you know like some of the viewers might even be saying right now like yeah it doesn't look that great I mean the close-ups aren't that great and like honestly the flower might not look that great but when you smoke it you're like oh okay it isn't always the weed that looks the best oh that looks the best yeah we gotta say it's like I said it's a 10 on the show you know this particular batch might not look like a 10 but I'm baked and it tastes like it's in and it hits like it's in yeah I'd say Jill I kind of like he's saying in general for me this strain is a 10 out of 10 this particular batch I have seen a little bit better yeah maybe a little bit smaller I probably should have just jarred this up in a mason jar you know right oh my gosh it's been sitting in this thing for about a week you know I got a walls down south' had to get it back up here save as much as I could for the review and so when it sits in these jars for a week or so it does lose a little oh yeah oh man I love this stuff man that one just gotten whoa all right guys well I think that just about wraps it up for this stream review what do you think I think that I think that does it I'm curious to see what you guys think of this strain if you guys have tried it before let us know what other strains you would like us to review on future wake-and-bake sore future strain reviews fall down I don't know what the [ __ ] we're doing anymore no mic comment doing [ __ ] back hit all the buttons wait and we'll be back next time for another one he's Dan I'm Shane hey where the [ __ ] out of here peace small silly joke man are just lady smoking better than most we smoking better than you know who's wrong", "WheOc80F8Wo": "so let's start on the left we're gonna make diamonds out of your on the right right now is we are reducing there are extract or BHO extract we like to put it inside of we got this bucket you seen the last picture it's got a little bit of warm water it is not hot water it's just warm water we're gonna reduce it down to for the diamonds we want it to become the consistency of a boat syrup before we're gonna cap it and put it somewhere warm and pretty much forget about it for a few weeks and then for adds or shatter if you don't know how to make shatter we're gonna reduce that down to about syrup then pour it into our back oven onto our patch of parchment paper and then we're gonna let it bubble away and then pull it back on it full30 an inch of warm water and on hot water just warm water in there gonna take a little while through these it's what we want - I'll be 20 minutes half an hour there like that probably have to change the water a couple times keep it warm as the extract is really cold the process to walk you through it oh yeah we can make diamond can make diamond - all right you can see how much we reduced it down your way up here before it was quite a bit lighter we still got some bubbles just good because to make time as you need pressure also need a supersaturated solution which is this butane and THC and yeah time just go wait time so we're gonna we're gonna do is when it's a little cap on this we're gonna stick it up on our clone seedling rack because it's got a it's a warm base which will help with the pressure build up because as the gas or as the liquid turns into gas it builds up enough pressure in here and helps the process take place good no it's not quite at syrup consistency yet which is okay we can just let the pressure build up give it a little burp we do that over a period of a couple days until we get it tell it's like a little run here than syrup and then we're just gonna leave the cap on it and we're not gonna touch it again till we get diamonds you can see now that I burped it there's bubbles from the gases escaping from the supersaturated solution back into gas which pressurizes this back back up again okay so it reduced a little bit more this one here we weren't working with see how runny that is I mean it's still just like water make snake water this is the death Bubba here and see it doesn't splash like that when you shake it it's thicker hard to tell you definitely a sticky substance yeah shake it doesn't splash up the sides a whole lot that's how we like it see the little bubbles coming up pressure up we're gonna leave it at that we're just gonna set it and set it forget it turn it off in the back corner here and we'll come check it in a couple weeks and we've got diamonds in the bottom there it kind of look like little air bubbles when they first start forming but their

guys", "3wwsIHmHHE4": "[Music] in the beginning there wasn't very many hydro stores the growers didn't have access to information so it was a real like under the radar I guess you would call it a hobby at the time the lack of the proper machinery and the lack of someone who can produce it sometimes with our industry it's one of those things if you want the right thing you got to make it yourself [Music] the first tumble I try really hard not to beat up the material because it's lead to key Keef to rosin looking through the side of the machine and as soon as you start to see the hairs and a lot of green then you got a cut it [Music] I can look at it if the heads are big and they're shiny they're like diamonds they'll reflects light even if it has these big green specks if it's still shiny then it'll press better than like something that's super blond with no colored contaminant because the oil in the big heads is what we're going after it's been a really integral part of my life my entire life since like sixth grade back then it was like you got to take it into your own hands if you're doing it yourself and you can't go to a store and buy what you need we make Matic heat presses that are designed around the process of extracting rosin most of the plant matter has been taken out of the active component of the plant and so the smoke is a lot cleaner and a lot stronger the overall focus of our system is just to make sure that the end product is the highest quality possible-- [Music] [Music] Rasen compared to some of the other products as far as concentrates on the shelf I would say has an advantage one because it's it's a completely solvent less technique 2 because it gets a good snapshot as far as the terpene profile of the original genetics that it came from the overall quality of the product has just gotten much better [Music] [Music]", "qJVAbZlGvWc": "this is what i do i smoke hash and shatter too go and check them out i'll try them off for you by the time i'm done we'll be on the moon now let's start the show thank you for the view what's up world welcome to sorry about that welcome to juvenile styles today i'm coming at you with alien og check it out so i got this nice joint roll of it we're going to light it up and give this strain and these buds a nice thorough review and of course i got the bomb to try it out and that as well so let's light this up and give it a nice review so it has a very nice taste actually it's like i taste a lot of crystal but i also kind of taste like kind of a seasoning type of taste maybe kind of like peppery a little bit it does have a nice taste and this was 28 percent thc so it's not too bad it's pretty high up there definitely at higher but it is up there with the strains and this is three grams of it minus the joint that i rolled so i think that was a pretty good account for the three grams so let's give it a little sniff test i kind of through the bag i kind of smell a bit of vanilla in it although i do kind of smell the like spice seasoning type of taste or type of smell like i taste in the joint smell very nice though so i'll give you the close-up here now if you've never seen my show now you know we get so high that we fly [Music] but i know it will all [Music] [Music] let's take another look at one of these other buds this is a nice sized one here it's not a bad looking strain as you can see it's kind of frosty nice crystals on it and i've had this strain this bag for about a week or so i think so it's a little dried out but that was my fault i should have took better care of it and stored it a little better but i can't blame that on the strain so i'm not going to leave that in the rating so the texture because i remember when i did get it it wasn't quite as dry so i'll still give the texture a nice writing for a texture of these buds but i'm going to give i'm going to take a bomb head first before we write the flavor because it's not fair so i'm going to throw this down for a second and we'll take a hit from the bomb well i got a little bit in there from the last strings one second let's throw a nice little piece in here at least it's dry like i said so it breaks right apart there we go got a nice little bowl up there let's light it up um that's pretty good oh that gave me a nice hit so i'll say give me a second all right i'll say i'm gonna give the flavor i'll give the flavor a 3.5 to a 4 out of 5. it's pretty good tasted nice nice tasting straight so i'll give you a 3.5 to a 4 out of 5 for the rating for the flavor it's not too bad i'll give the same for the texture of the bun because it's pretty nice buds a little dryer now but it wasn't so bad when i first got it so i count i can't breathe no i'm just joking i can't stop choking now i'm just playing but yeah i'll give the account so it's nice ass three so i'll give it minus to join so i'll give it a nice i'll give it a 4.5 per account because that's a really nice thing and i think this alien ochi deserves an overall four out of five it's really good i definitely recommend it and this one was just three a's so it wasn't four but still a really good joint a really good strain i definitely recommend it if you get a chance to try it out try it out and i'll show you guys the plants that i cut down early what i got out of them you could definitely tell that they're way too early some of them ain't the buds ain't too bad like one of the plants i think was pretty close so it's not too too bad but the rest of them likes it not it's just so i think i'm going to use it to make a little bit of hash or something like that so that's what i'll use that [ __ ] for and i'll show you guys the plants now and i want you to let me know in the comments how long do you think left i don't think there's not much left because the main ones that are closer closest there's a couple that needs a little longer but i think the closest ones are about at least 50 percent brown hair so it said to make sure they're around 75 to 90 percent and the trichromes are bulbed up and everything so um yeah if you have any advice how long you think they're going to take you can let me know i appreciate it and yeah i hope you guys are all having a good night and hope y'all got some good [ __ ] to smoke i'm gonna leave it there you'll have a good one peace hundred thousand views really more to go this the show hundreds of different strains of smoke there's no joke breaking up the big puff and choke if you've never seen my show now you know we get so high that we fly the globe puffing up the clouds and the clouds gone with the wind let's get stoned then there's no dough now i'm broke just for now take a toll this is marijuana hoe but i know it will all pay off because my lines are doping i won't stop until i'm at the top of my mountain and i'm not gonna [ __ ] go hundred thousand views really more to go this the show hundreds of different strains of smoke there's no joke flicking up the pig

"[Music] [Applause] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another honey butter rosin video if you guys didn't see my video where i i made a video where i said i bought a year old rosin and uh i decided to give him a second chance but i would like to say that there's in no way honey butter's fault that i bought that year old rosin it is the dispensary for selling me and partly my fault for not checking but sometimes when i get excited that they have a product i i don't check the manufacture date and the packaging thing is it just completely slips my mind but i encourage everyone to do that like learn from my mistakes but like i said this is in no way honey butter's fault or any way in any way and i like to mention that they actually contacted me from the uh for that video and they said that they're gonna send something my way so expect another video on honey butter to uh be on this channel but this one i personally bought myself at authentic uh this one is only three months old so it's not bad and uh i believe the last one i bought was flower rosin this is hash rosin for some reason i thought live rosin and hash rosin were made the same way or were the similar they're just named different i mean like uh live rosin and hash rosin i thought were the same thing but apparently there's there's levels to this [ __ ] right uh i don't know too much i don't know if i described on my live bronzing video how to make live rosin or hash rosin but i know that they have to like shake off the trichomes in the ice bag do micron bags and just press that afterwards with heat and pressure i know that stuff this is a collab from lit house i've heard many good things about their flower and as you can see right here it says full spectrum hash rosin lemon lava this is running at about 60 thc with about three point three seven percent cbd manufacture date of november 13 2020 uh best buy you know 11 13 20 20 all that stuff uh we'll see lemon lava hash rosin mendocino coast lit house uh they do come with this where they recommend what you uh okay so they say cold start okay i'll definitely try and oh wait this is for their bang okay i mean i'll do a cold start for this if i can most of the time it's hard for me but this looks like a freaking little puck right here right off the bat really smells like i mean i smell this light lemonness on it but it's more more of a plant very plant and buttery smell but we are gonna do this turn that on but we're gonna cold start this okay people have been asking for the cold starts for a while now you know so get them a cult start so this is interesting it's like a little puck very uh it's like a tootsie roll kind of consistency hopefully you can see it guys oh my god the ball got stuck all right we're good hold on so i want to do maybe a little little something some of the show let's do the flash too yeah bubbles what's it guys street bubbling up in there oh smells pretty good cheers guys wow very reminiscent of that that 710 labs i had slight ginger gingerness towards it it's weird wow that's a different taste very clean taste this was thirty dollars wow i would say that that live rosin that i had recently probably tastes a little bit better than this but this is pretty enjoyable let's let this warm up a little bit i don't get off i don't get rosin often guys but when i do it's cool you know what i'm saying but what i don't like is the certain type of people that think they're like better than everyone just because they smoke rosin it's like bro just stop like everyone's gonna smoke what they want regardless you know what i'm saying like if they want to smoke fake cartridges at the end of the day you really can't stop them if they smoke live resin or if they smoke hash rosin or whatever the [ __ ] you know you really shouldn't get mad at someone or think you're better than someone just because you're smoking more expensive stuff that's a very douchebag way of thinking and i know most of you guys aren't like that but there's some people in here that just like you gotta go hashtag i call them righteous rosin smokers and uh yeah we can we can deal without that like if you can get rosin like that every day or dab every day like more power to you but when you start stuffing it into people's face like i smoke rosie and i'm only rising weird get over it all right all right cheers maybe i should put more a little bit more a little something but damn authentic's coming in with the fire for cheap though not too much i'm just going to add a little bit to what's already in there be careful with rosin too i feel like it's dangerous stuff even more your bowls and stuff because there's a lot more of that stuff that usually is out of the live resin um but it stays in with the rosin you know that very that plant material with all that darkness you can see it we're gonna run this a little bit higher because i was told that rosin specifically has like a lot of fats and lipids that usually doesn't burn off with low temps so we're gonna run this again on the higher temp and we're going to end the video here but honey butter definitely a cop for 30 dollars it's definitely a steal like i know p2 peeps uh he lives in the bay shout out to p2ps by the way uh he pays like 50 for this and that's cheap for him 30 dollars is pretty cheap for rosin over here so um hopefully i can get some more but if not i'm glad that i was able to try it and you know for those of you who haven't tried rosin you should definitely pick it up i don't i think this is the only string they have that's dirty though oh yeah tastes like chocolate towards the end it's weird but yeah that is it for this hash rosin video uh let me know the difference between hash rosin and live rosin i thought they were the same thing but if you guys are know more about it let me know in the comments below but other than that honey butter appreciate the [ __ ] out of you guys for having such affordable rosin and yeah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] you", "jFdb1aECPxA": "banning then wrong smoking

it um the buds like a dance that's got this like it's weird almost got like this broccoli smell to it it sounds to me like a vegetable a fresh vegetable now that you're walking like a farmer's you garden then you should get this scent like it's weird like lima beans or something where it's this craziest smells real 13 like vegetable II it smells great oh really good okay so check these mojo

how much you need to do is buzz BC push that's the BC Kush good smell of it you should only need to spoil anybody's like two buds or something to test it no don't yeah I'll get back with you once they give me some results or something and Shana show you those new t-shirts we got I know you guys from Canada I don't like the runners shirts for the rides and I do it seemed to Jade's [Music] hey Joe we meet again my friends yeah um I got one for you today ever this old school maybe BC bud we did make test hi you'll be the judge of it but for me on my palate really good okay so mature better you know looks can be deceiving absolutely not all that great looking either when I can tell it's got a little bit of back here a filing off side over there to it that your us typically might not smell like much when you break it up got that on cheap guns now I guess we won't really know until we pass the 100% right let's get it started look who showed up we've got on a stream in a this is some high fee this is environmentally cause mold basically it means that their stuff was a little bit too wet either during the drying process or during the end of the flowering process and because of that humidity in the air yeah cuz their sample to mold I never seen that before how to purchase this away and they can take a look at here got some VC crush it's like if I can a chrome by candy in Michigan I did I would say that the gland heads are probably about average in every respect there may be small to medium in size average amount of them there's a few of them in year that are stunted which means they didn't fully developed some kind of stress may have caused that most people don't have enough air condition in their girl to make up for the high intensity discharge lights better create so much heat you want let me finish up the bio analysis here and cool I'll get out of your way did you let you get to work man thanks again Hey Joe came back for results on that JDBC bud I was expecting you well it's a clean sample no mold no pests fortunately it's not quite the 20% [Music] it's a clean sample did Toby he didn't think this was his best harvest wondering about it you know this is good to let him know at least for next time you know what he can do baby could be something different than he didn't do this time yeah a little more safe there's no personal I appreciate all your help man Macey push a 7525 indica hybrids that mixes BC grapefruit and cush can be used to treat pain ADHD migraines arthritis and eating disorders THC content of 13.5% results brother alright alright are we doing presenter 1 how we looking I can't say this man cannot know sir people I mean not not everything has to be really really strong percentage-wise I mean there's a lot of elderly people that I know that don't want 20 percent 23 percent they don't want to be blown out right you know they want something run it use their in the day so you got to work on your next girl bit today yeah no can only get better right just like your hockey team here we go thanks again man no properly [ __ ] let's go burn one anyway check it out man let's go yeah we didn't even know TC existed until the 70s we are wanted back they only have about 10% it back now the stuff of a this is just ridiculous so this is Mike hey Mike almost reaching my friend so what are we smoking on today hey we have the BC cush not quite the 20% I find it you know with my patients they might not like you know the ultimate blown out super high percent THC especially if you're like an older guy like me I can't handle some of those things you know like old bangers huh yeah you want to consider something with this at all that might not be one of those highly potent strains might be something more in your Narain common collective I would really like to take a look at the terpenes to be honest - I think he's house trained like this 13.5% usually pretty indica dominant hybrid tons of terpenes and you get a lot of secondary benefits from some of those turf games like baby care filings stronger cannabinoids in CBD cannabidiol sometimes so terpenes well they're actually the flavor and aroma of marijuana and the loudness yeah but they're in all sorts of damage for presidents all around us in nature and we don't often realize how much effect that these aromas and sent to have on our health or well-being yeah marijuana's a bunch of BC Canada huh that is correct are you from Canada I am from Canada check it out I don't know if you can see that at a recent least I stand right in there one of these days you know I'm gonna go back home when I return the Stanley Cup [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music]", "XVXM4oNUoHo": "oh they do look like no those are my brothers why because there's no [ __ ] watercress there's no watermark that's fair on the blue strip on the front no it might be ocbs if you look at the because it has a water it has its own design but it's not the same as the raws oh yeah i see see the raws actually have a distinct pattern yeah okay mean i don't know if that makes a difference or not yeah well freebies can't beat two picks of free papers i can i'll just grab a 300 pack out of my cupboard yeah i'm going to try these because they look like ross that's how i feel with my dutch masters i buy them by the case by the box we're on we're on hell yeah all right folks so today we are going to do uh all right i think we're live i heard my phone yeah we live baby i'm on my phone you got four viewers sir all right oh really okay so we're gonna do a special episode today we're gonna not special just something we're gonna start doing from now on because people asked us to do some concentrates so i brought uh birdbath or josh or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call them purple barney the other a couple months ago and call me whatever you want don't matter he's a pretty good uh judge of the concentrates the kind of sewer of the concentrates i guess you would say yeah you out there me i'm not gonna lie you out there let me see if i can give you there's not many without that means pretty golden golden we're trying red bud roots red snoop dogg yeah is that the dog the rest in there the butter it's the resin resin resin okay okay so you all have your rigs collected right you all got some well del scorchos here i can give you because i can preload mine so oh that's a little baby i heard y'all wanted to listen to torches there you go oh yeah actually loaded up oh yeah trying to light a torch outside that's quarantined baby i got the easy way [ __ ] you just all right while they're doing that i guess i'll do my work press the button twice all they can hear is [ __ ] gorgeous right now i guarantee you i often wonder if my neighbors think that i have corona or if they can hear my torch oh no no they definitely think i've thrown it through the window through like an open window you know it's called cough cough yeah why don't let's say like five in the morning the way we're gonna do these do your dab cough do what you gotta do and then we'll do another dab before we actually say anything same flavor same flavor there's a balloon on that wire oh that's white god damn it oh see you later i didn't go make what i already got my second dab on my tool you don't want any opinions yet until i have decided um no because let's talk about how we're going to come up with our opinion all right so so it's harder to concentrate it is harder not really hold on hold on hold on flavor profiles real quick tony wants to know yeah laugh all you want [ __ ] tony wants to know you guys like hot dirty or smooth and cool i like dabs i i like hot and smooth and cool smooth and cool doesn't usually get me where i'm trying to be honest like i'm trying to i'm trying to catch a hard buzz real [ __ ] quick like smooth and hurt or smooth and cool this is like if i'm gonna be sipping on a good beer well for me it depends on the quality of the wax okay there you go that's that's another thing the worse the wax is the more hot i'm going to do it so i want it to go away quicker but if it tastes good i'll do it a little bit cooler so i at least get four or five pulls through my mouth and out my nose or whatever i agree with that so no how do we develop this scale because what me and cut did one the other day and we kind of figured it was i thought because i do the smoker circle with the joints which is a little bit harder now because you're not actually passing the joint so it's not a true circle yeah you know what i'm saying because that actually makes a difference sitting there and puffing on a joint for a half hour you get enough time that's it really 69 uh of total thc that's that's the wrestling right yeah the library is it which one snooper no snoop dogg live that's snoop is this actually no it's not because it's pronounced dog on here it's not bad no it's a strain there's a strain out there called snoop dogg and it's basically one of i think it's one strange cross with uh chem dog so just like a heads up for where they go new sander because i always got a new standard uh they they had like a cool little event thing that was just wrapping up outside that's where they got the free hat and free papers and stuff okay and they were doing like super discount on edibles and do it up [ __ ] if you're ready do it up but uh ended up going in and they were packed in your waiting line first time i'd had the weight in the vestibule do you know which [ __ ] thc people are smoking during covet it's insane because they have the money but the money and the time but my thing is the money because most people can't do their normal day [ __ ] and smoke the way we spend how how can you be any means how can you do the job yeah we're only letting whatever it is they didn't say how many but let's say six to eight people i didn't see more than that in there but you got 12 employees in there and i'm just like um first owners too given their time i guess i get your point of view and that's one of the things like someone asked me about gage and gage i just called and they brought it out to the car and they're super friendly i got the same i looked i looked if i find it i already got a connection two cookies um for it but uh this one over here they got it in it sold out immediately but it didn't even come with the run the jewels packaging and i gotta be honest that's that's the biggest point did you preheat to pre-order his shirt oh yeah i got a hoodie in the album coming it's no no no the one he just made killer mic no coming out september oh i got the rtg he's got a solo album no he's got a [ __ ] shirt coming out and it says it's a it's a dollar bill on it and it's all decked up like the video and it says slave master across the list i can't i'm probably not gonna wear that i already have one of my favorite shirts i don't feel comfortable wearing usually because i i went out in the public once and i go oh this could be considered wrong because it's my buddy uh it's actually one of my best buddies brothers he's 248 studio and he he's got a shop in uh okay that was a big one and uh rust belt and he does all uh also at the russell but it's just the the picture that's on the outside of the rough spell is called waiting for kong and he's sitting on top of the truck wearing a pair of uh jordans that are tiger's theme and i'm just like man i anymore it's just too controversial of a shirt now when i got it i was like your second dab it's okay so when i did that printing in high school oh my gosh oh it's a crafts class and i was in like 9th or 10th grade we did screen printing and i cut out george w bush junior's uh face like silhouette they put got oil in the gut milk fountain underneath it that's good and they let me do this oh i wonder no no it's not illegal to do this it's controversial huh it's controversial the controversy isn't right but you can't did you sell it no that's you couldn't sell it oh okay i only made one and i technically did sell it now i think about it i know but if you try to go into production it had issues maybe not i think i should have dropped the temp on that one a little bit i did it all right so i'm gonna go first go for it to kind of explain my thoughts on this oh so judging the cup the cannabis cup you had five categories didn't we do it one two five yeah it's one through five uh-huh and when you're judging it you actually say in the in the letter they give you or the email reserve fives for the best stuff you've ever had in the same regard reserved ones for the worst [ __ ] you've ever dabbed ever had oh man that's a big spectrum no no no so in my mind when i judged i went three it was either so it was two three or four two minutes just it's not good it's no it's not good too it's not good i'm not gonna give anything a one because to be honest with you it could be just my palette okay reclaims the one to me which is why my scale is [ __ ] let me give you let me trust me when i tell you i didn't smoke any [ __ ] reclaim we're talking about the cannabis cup so in that sense there's no one but i've bought reclaimed it essentially reclaimed from a disco that's fine but no one's putting the [ __ ] reclaim in the [ __ ] cannabis cup that's the truth yeah i mean i'll send my regret under the candidates that's a nice one i give that i give that's four on the color on it goes you have foreign smell oh i don't even know uh color look taste hi and uh would you buy it in the store um so that's your five categories all right hold on let's what about the price we would pay in the store that's what i was just gonna ask again considering it's such a reward would you buy it in a store you have to assume that everything that you're paying for when you're in a cannabis cup but that's still based on value when you're in a [ __ ] cannabis cup everything that's in there is selling for i guarantee you 60 bucks a gram yeah if not more yeah so you just assume that it's 60 bucks a gram would you pay 60 bucks a grand for that don't assume it's cheaper don't ever assume it's cheaper because it's not yeah it's never cheaper it's never cheap okay so it's always six gigabytes i'll get throwing money out of your years ago you have to throw the money out okay you're buying you you're at the store am i going to buy this one okay well go ahead go down your list so uh let me smell it i didn't smell it give it a a three it's pretty average on the smell it hasn't taste now i get why the taste tastes the way it does it's just really sharp and a lot of sting there's no actual flavor in there so it tastes more like an actual dab than it did actual live resin live resin should be more less of the pepper and more of the other flavors like lemon and the lime and the other stuff to come through so i didn't get any of that to come through when i hit it now i got high don't get me wrong and i cough like a [ __ ] but when it comes to dabs if i cough like a [ __ ] i'm probably gonna get high and i hit it again so i'm gonna go three it's average on the smell the look is probably a four because it's nice and grainy it's got a nice color it's bright bright three four you know i wouldn't really say i'm gonna say three because it's pretty average on the color that's what you want but that's what everything in the cup was yeah it there was no dark cinder clear yeah then you're like no or when i think of aesthetic remember the stuff that won its consistency it's the same throughout the block yeah it was a baby poop consistency like you that right there to me is a four because it's different you know what i'm saying or if it's like a super bright like brighter than you've ever seen type right oh yeah yeah i know what you're talking about that's something you need or sugary or yeah usually there's gotta be some uniqueness to it and there's it's just a three to me so taste wise i give it a three two because it's average it's not bad i hit it again obviously i'll smoke the [ __ ] out of that [ __ ] but it's going to be one of those ones where i know that i'm going to smoke it when i want to cough yeah i'm not cause even in my [ __ ] puffco i was still dying and normally i can control myself and not die but it's all cough so if you like cough that's it so would i buy it again no i do because i don't buy it for the cough that's very funny so uh i would consider this so we last time we did beers i don't know much about beers i just know how much they cost okay and i would consider this a heineken you're comparing it to a beer yeah so it's not it's not a solid it's a salad for you yeah three three yeah it's a solid average it's a solid three it's not bad a bud light to two all right uh it's a [ __ ] one to me again i don't know beer so beers beer it all tastes like [ __ ] to me so but you i know that if i drink a [ __ ] guinness i'm gonna get flavors that i don't get in the bud light so that's a four to me you know what i'm saying okay and then i don't i've never had a five in beer so we wanted to go there and i didn't find any fives in [ __ ] weed either so all right let's go cut first okay so this is kind of loaded all right first of all i give it a three i give it a three because it's nothing special this is the same stuff that if i was lucky two years ago i could get in a shitty ass paper wax paper for 25 to 30 dollars a gram so knowing now that what it's inflated to with this nice little glass container i'm like okay yeah it's solid it's consistent i'm cool with it it's a three all the way through like it's almost a four like but i can't give it more i can't give it a four because it's not complex i've had so much more unique yes complexity and in waxes that this doesn't have it yeah and uh just saying everything there was either 60 or 65. so yeah they they only had maybe seven brands all 60 to 60 well i mean there's a there's a runner so yeah it makes sense again it's all boxed up just like this so you can't even see what's in it now the other company said they were fixing that so i don't think these guys there was one element uh it was an element but one was on a saucer and you could actually see it and it was a nice creamy butter but you couldn't see what the price was and it didn't have a tag so that was like the bummer i was like am i supposed to ask the guy but i've already had this bud tender and to be honest he's kind of like the weak link there he's a young kid and he's strapping young left he goes i gotta go use the boy sir i'm sorry i'll be back and i'm just like what are you doing there's 12 people here well i did if you got to go to the bathroom why didn't you pass me out like go go yo wow all right whatever sorry okay um so yeah look it's got a three honestly i kind of like the bright yellow because you don't see it often anymore everyone's trying to get that white or that clear wax out there or whatever they're soluble maybe if you're buying it from a dispensary it's about that colorado average i'm telling you if you're buying a depot at 60 bucks a gram i dig that perspective well you're right though because again you're talking about the the natural market in the natural market you're correct anything below 60 bucks a gram you're gonna get darker you start paying 40 bucks a gram you got more darkness i've had red wax before the red cheddar like like i've had the weirdest colors of wax yeah honestly so i my first dab i did of it it was what you loaded up and i did actually super low temp and it it took a solid like 40 seconds of pulling and actually get it through i got some really strong fruity like almost sour flavors and that's where the bite came from was actually the sour but literally the first thing that popped in my head was juicy fruit for some reason even though it really wasn't that it was more of like like a harsh sour lemon lime so i actually really like the flavor i give the flavor a four would i pay that much no no uh the price i'd give it a three so i'm still not gonna buy it probably uh it's just it's middle ground it's just super middle ground yeah flavor was good though in that low temp yeah and the harshness on my second dab was that was crushed yeah it crushes you it's hard the end pulls what as i was chiefing on it were were way nicer and i thought it had more interest yeah i get what you're saying about the bite yeah that's just the sour part to me yeah okay i get make sense all right we'll end this one going to the next one", "peo4Cxb8gFo": "[Music] what is going on YouTube it's a boy every time with it a quick review on this one just got home from work been up since [ __ ] 3 o'clock this morning been a long day and this dis review

looks pretty so my wife said that the smell cam is stupid and I shouldn't do the smell can and it stupid that I do the smell cam in every video so but that said leave it leave a comment below and tell me what you guys think should I continue with the smell cam or should I stop smoking I like to smell game because it gives a close-up personal smoke cam type type deal you don't I mean I like it you know it's it's a little thing that I've been doing since day one so why not continue to do it alright I don't know that's just and it's just smells good all right you guys now how I do it I always

been dabbing like good in a minute so I got it like literally find this you think that would have found that before I start my video right yeah maybe I can just this part out mmm [ __ ] is my torch this guy so who's this guy hmm well you don't worry I guarantee my dog got it and do something with it what happened oh I just don't misplace [ __ ] got my carb cap so I put a ball in here a ball in there right baby I just seen it I mean [ __ ] did it go cheers ladies and gentlemen so it took a minute for me to find a [ __ ] torch not this time Cheers hmmm I think one of my one of my first oils was guerrilla greasemonkey you know it is a one of my first grease monkeys was a cartridge and I remember it tasting there's either greasemonkey or or or a space monkey I don't know if when it tastes so fruity it was so good and like I kept trying to find that one cartridge at canvas and Fredrik him and I could not [ __ ] find it that's always fun in it I know you suck it back too hard and get a [ __ ] mouth full [ __ ] nasty we're not really nasty but fruity [ __ ] rigged water rather have rigged water in Bangla right BOM are just disgusting so I want to tell you about the taste here it's got a earthy cushy kind of you only want to say diesel fuel leaked on a date to it I guess that would be the acrylic glue number four but I don't know if it's from the dab me already starting get little dabs right or if it's just starting to get hot in my room already hasn't even been ten minutes since I turned a [ __ ] AC off but uh no thought burned out my cat had a nice little little tickle in the nose they're almost almost had me sneeze was just one of those terpenes I have it like leave my finger on it what you want what's a terpene does it to me but I will find it when these days I'm gonna do a hot start to this grill igloo and hop off cuz just get warm up in the room until a hot start real quick or I guess a normal dad all right an app I hope everybody's having a great week tomorrow's

"1cv-dxjfbHE": "[Music] [Music] what guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny we're back again for another string review today we are checking out another one of the most heavily requested strains on this show definitely the most heavily requested Oh gene this is the Billy Kimber Oh G from garrison life this [ __ ] is gaster when you think of gasps this is what comes to mind right yeah I feel like this there's a million oh geez out there right and we're always trying to think about like what makes one different than the other right there's a lot of oh geez like the old school oh geez they used to have subtle differences that you used to be able to tell like every time you saw Tahoe you could pick it out between OG back and right right nowadays it's [ __ ] Tommy so jeans you know Bobby's OG and everybody's got their own [ __ ] og right out of it it's just names thrown on a different [ __ ] when I look at OG I feel like there's three different main types right yeah and I go on taste when it comes to that it's mainly you got that kind of more fuel II pine saw lemon you're gassy if you will side of the spectrum right and then in the middle you've got more earthy that earthy earthy which is honestly my least favorite in the middle you got I would agree you know this is the CCC official OG breakdown by the way you know there's opinions everywhere this is our OG breakdown three different kinds you got your super gassy lemony like he was talking about and then you got your earthy right in the middle right and then on the other spectrum what do we got we get that kind of more sweet Marshall oh yeah almost say like marshmallow light like if you guys have watched our pure Kush review obviously I think we've done a couple of them now you guys know we love that strain but we love it so much because it's that rare end of the spectrum where it's that cush that super far on that sweet cereal milk and marshmallow we type turf that's what makes that one different from all the rest of these oh geez that we see more typically this one right here I would say is really really heavy on that first side of the spectrum right gassy lemony pungent fuelie but it does have a little bit of that sweet thing in it too right so I'm gonna describe it as being right in them so we got three different sections in the middle we got this time I got this side earthy being in the middle I'm gonna put this one about right in the middle or even a little farther from the middle of earthy and straight gas cuz this is kind of like Sour Diesel II almost like it has the smell a little bit of that gassy rotten sour smell but it also has the OG it also has the structure of a beautiful OG bigot blown out nose but they're not too blown out they still got their density to him but my zip just was filled with donkey dick all [ __ ] huge herbs we have been smoking on this for about a week we've smoked garrison let this is probably my favorite OG to smoke in the last year we got a note down down this stuff I'm just gonna do right now cuz that just stuck in my finger look at this I'll take test on 1 million out outside of the nug we didn't even have to break it up dude that's outside the nug if you break it up and stick your finger on the inside of the nug this stuff is the stickiest weed I think I've smoked in a minute so it's definitely hitting on that cylinder right there 10 out of 10 on the stick factor for sure for once your boy forgot scissors and this is probably the last like a weed that I would want to forget my scissors for or a grinder or something yeah as you can see it kind of just gets stuck to your hands just oh you're gonna end up with a lot of weed and green bump on your hands if you definitely you know if I try to break this up and you got to do this little maneuver and then the hair who out there knows the hair I know I did it another string review with that boom all the oils gone smooth as a baby's ass pretty tight this one when you hit it ooh as you can see it's kind of got a delayed punch you know it's it doesn't feel super expansive as far as the smoke going down but when you exhale it it kind of settles in and it'll kind of come back and just give you a little reminder you know as the buzz kind of settles in coach good but the flavor is there right away right you're fresh up for it let me know what your palates be like oh it's honestly straight sour OG funk which is my favorite kind of OG you know like I said I love sour but it doesn't grow that good honestly it's not that pretty there's a few sour cuts out going back in the day there was something elemental like the yogi or something like that that was pretty but honestly I feel like that resembles this almost I'm just you know obviously these nugs are a lot bigger but fresh off a rip straight sour OG just funk a lot of people sometimes get mad I see people in the comments when we compare sours to oh geez and Kent or kind of refer to that all as like the same family or whatever there are certain wheat nerds out there who have a point and I get a little bit annoyed with that you know but I think what we're talking about gonna make those comparisons is all about the aroma and the flavor and like the terpenes present in that strain I would like to see the actual breakdown of you know 10 different oh geez and 10 different sours by 10 different growers and see what are those common turbines that are overlapping in large quantity yeah yeah definitely I I don't pay too much attention to the terpenes we should probably get studied up on that it's something I would like to demo our more about obviously there's so much progress being made with lab testing and being able to test not only for THC but for you know molds pesticides and then being able to test the actual you know different cannabinoids and just the different aspects of cannabis that go into making that one string rather than things that you're gonna find an OG crisper example that you're not gonna find in other strains which brings me to my next point whatever it is that's in OG just gets me higher than anything else yeah to this day that way true five years ago yeah ten years ago I'm so hot and it's true today just off one bomber guys like we don't have test results on this stuff not that it really matters like I always say but this stuff slaps you in the face man I'm thinking this is definitely 25% plus and like he said a cannabinoid ratio in combination and OG it just hits every time man like every time even the earthy stuff and even the marshmallow is stuff it's all fire this is just our favorite one right here honestly it lives up to the hype the Billy Kimber has been making some buzz lately yeah I feel like it's really blown up in the last year right like different strains have come and had their waves the og wave has really faded out over the last couple years obviously there's people like us a lot of the people that we hang out with that I'll wet too whether it's a grower they always keep the og in the rotate rotation or if it's a smoker they just always you know like to keep a little bit of OG it's one of those strains for me that for some reason I never get tired of I feel like there's a lot of really good new hype out there now but it's hard to find something that checks all the boxes ya know it's like yeah oh gee tastes good it smells good right it looks good as far as like there's when I break these nubs up there's no stem that I have to take no it's all bud very meaty very sticky and most importantly it gives me the desired effect it tracks the punch and I like the type of high that I need below G we've been giving out a ton of nines and tens but you know good weed just deserves a good score and you know we like that we'll stay there till the end of the episode if you think if I let it you know I can walk around with this on my finger all day that's that's the level of stickiness yeah particularly this is just good [ __ ] Weed Man I mean Billy Kimber oh gee by garrison Lane we've been hearing the height we finally got our hands on it and I'm loving it I'm glad we were able to keep a little bit to [ __ ] do for this review because we were mad busy this week and we each got an ounce of this and this is all I have left I can own I could you know this all day you just tweak this number ones like it's just like squirt not gas man just like leaking it out the gas is definitely the main focus right but like you're saying the more you can't smell it all day because I get little hints of different little things yeah it kind of reminds me of the rude boy that we grew in Colorado kind of it's got that real okay honky okay well that I love the Roubaix archive seedbank if you haven't tried another structure too similar look this is this is what I want really good Oh gene to look like some of the nugs as you guys can see in the close-ups were absolutely huge that first glance I was like okay I would have probably you know there's some times where it's an ugly this with a side bud and the side bud and if there's a little bit of space particular I always cut up here some of the nodes weren't I would say maybe broken down great as much as I would want but once I started actually breaking the weed down to smoke it and saw how there's no stem weight in it at all and you know you can't be mad at that at first like I said going off bag appeal I was like this looks great this smells great good trim job obviously OG is usually a pretty damn baby trim job one of the easiest strains to turn up there is but overall I was like yeah might be if I have to knock grants for one thing it might be the bud on the cake factory oh yeah but I don't even think I can hate on that after breaking down look how skinny these stems are I mean honestly I was gonna adopt it for that too but I'm not it's cuz you know these stems are so damn skinny which is great I love low stem weight in my sacks and like you said their word was a little space between you know the main cola and like maybe a shoulder bud right here but at the end of the day this is such good way and we may be lost at the most 1/2 gram instant weight due to that so it's like and that's like being generous yeah exactly after I mean I sub when I got the odds of my gosh by 3 grams of stems in there after smoking it down to this last eighth right here and seeing how many stems I've actually had this workout is that way it's less than a gram it's super crazy node to stem size ratio right you get you probably won't be able to pick it up on the camera if you look at that one so maybe that none of takes up 1% of the fun in circumference of the nuts dance to men it's hidden on everything honestly I'm gonna go right into written it this is a nice bud we're describing weed in a whole bunch of different ways that we don't normally do that screen reviews I feel like that's indicative of where this buzz kind of takes you yeah we've been smoking this for like I said the last week and I have gotten more creative [ __ ] done this last four days then any time maybe in my entire life as far as videos ideas music for sure we have been crushing it the last four days and it's all been fuel off of this garrison land og I guess it's sparked in some old rituals from the old cush lineage of the CCC for twizzle but like I said I'm gonna go into raking this stuff you know we waited til we got down to at least mine well is my last nug of my own so I'm glad we got to this review it's like he said on effect 10 out of 10 we got more creative [ __ ] done this week than I think we've done in five years at least very cerebral very cerebral very creative very giggly very just all-around like the great buzz double-fisted oh really we look for OG aren't it could be you know obviously overall as a bud it could be more frosty okay you guys see me in these [ __ ] videos I see a lot of people in the comments she never the time what the [ __ ] yeah I'm high today yeah what was I even saying oh yeah the looks so open all has just weed as a whole it could be frost year but og doesn't typically get that frosty so I'm giving this a town of 10 on look for OG because it's got a frosty it's pretty frosty and it's got that lime green and to wrap it up flavor is just tank 10 straight gastrique funky fuel [ __ ] whatever you want to call it Oh G funky funky funky fmk 10/10 anything yeah I really don't think I need to go into too much detail about this one this is the guy blue guys you guys know how much we [ __ ] love oh gee we had a one on this show we our anthem song is about is called OG this right here is everything I'm looking for in an OG the reason why this is a 1000 is because if I was trying to explain oh gee cut to someone who had never seen it smoked it heard about it before and I was trying to explain yeah this is just the best train that has been consistent for the last 15 years it's the one that has stood the test of time right and it's for a good reason this right here is a perfect example of a batch that I would want to show them this really exemplifies all of the main traits that make you special yeah and another quick point to make is that for the most part overall OG has become watered down over the last I'd say five to seven years especially it's more difficult to find a really really good quality OG at this than it was in the past but you also got to realize that Oh G is also in everything today oh jeez in cookies oh jeez in [ __ ] all these new genetics it's in gelato some way some way or another it's an I feel in here if you go far back enough to cookies or whatever you know like I feel like it's used more than anything in print give it to give you the desired effect to really add some kick to some of these other strings that may be more flavorful but just don't pack the punch that you're looking for and exactly so yeah garrison Lane OG Kush garrison Lane Billy Kimber Oh G cush right here Wham definitely check this out if you are in California if you are in SoCal shouldn't be too hard to find yes let us know down there in the comments what strain you guys would like to see reviewed next make sure you smash that like white and turn on notifications you don't miss the next string review which will be next week that's right when we return for more that's right two twins and I call on both Jasmine's no but what they calling me Kat okay boy pegs been smoking on Krypto fat daddy chest like a missile [Music]", "dVElnFyT_cU": "buddy back at it another update video looking at the tropicana cookies f2 only seed co set day 45 so what's that coming up on seven weeks starting to fade just a little bit we started the sugar feed two tablespoons of a mix of sugar and brown sugar per gallon two tablespoons per gallon and we give it that last two weeks roughly see what we got so she's doing her thing look at this top nuggie so yeah she'll be here another another week or two for a couple weeks what's this plum classical cookie i think this was on day 25 some day 25 or 26 something like that just shy of four weeks got the fuzz going a little happier this time around than last run so i upped the craft blend in the soil mix i was just doing one cup per container and they recommend one to two cups per cubic foot so these are about one at least one and a half to two cubic feet containers that i get in here so i went up to two two cups you know per mix so that probably helped i was keeping the feed kind of light so they'd fade out but uh feeding that sugar they really don't have uh too much an issue this trap here is a week behind that other one so somewhere in the five six week range instead of the six seven week range and this one here is a week behind that one there we go let me back up a little bit let's go look from this side so yeah you can see i moved that one over there under the other light i had this four pack under this light but i had the space here i took down the um what came down fruity pebbles og and the east coast tower diesel um both of them so it's got a little more room but i should have put them side by side so you can kind of see i wish i knew exactly this is probably coming up on four weeks something like that compared to that one over there it's probably a better comparison right here actually yeah she's a good hasher leafy son of a [ __ ] but she hashes it out this one too is a leafy one body uh purple kush sunshine daydream great smoke though love smoking joints of the stuff see if i can hold still enough i did a video with my gopro i thought it'd be better but it actually came out shittier i got that oh hitting plants over here i got that wand thing or whatever you call them the gimbal for it and i don't know kind of screws me up more than anything so we're back to the iphone um i planned on getting the new new iphone and i just haven't got around to getting that with that fruity pubs over there praying so we'll get the new iphone pretty soon so that'll be a little bit of an upgrade on the camera this one's a 10 10 something look at this tropicana here this one's probably about six weeks along nice little color yeah i like how this fruity pebbles grows nice little gap between the buds get that airflow put out golf balls you know a lot of people they like the donkey dicks growing throwing swords and [ __ ] but i kind of like it like this easier to easier to manage too when they're done this string here i'm knocking the [ __ ] out she's a beauty though so yeah i think the uh extra craft blend helped in this one too so if you remember this one always like to have the purple stems like it kind of had when it was younger but shooting straight greenies now probably too much jumping in and out in and out zoom back up zoom back up this guy needs to settle the [ __ ] down with his camera i watch a video back i'm like jesus stay still quit moving it i don't know how you guys watch this [ __ ] when i'm filming it though it seems like i'm holding it there for a while it's weird so i'll try to slow down i probably say that every time and never do it yeah i think this is coming up on seven weeks too something around the 45 day range i got a sour diesel s1 that'll be rolling in here soon yeah i [ __ ] hit that i got to move that planer i crashed it in we got a little crash here i can slam that into there so yeah and we'll go out and film the vipar spectra tent i got two where's my bikes in there with the one cotton candy crunch so we'll see how that goes but

I'm going to be reviewing this pristiq batter I bought this gram of concentrate from maniac sesh a cool little event that happens every Saturday in Los Angeles this company was there they had a booth and I thought it was pretty cheap so I decided to try some out I'm gonna open it smell it okay so what it looks like [Music] they put the little peepee on the bottom side the purple punch and you get like a berry smell a sweet smell a little bit of a purple smell the strain is purple punch or punch is a sweet and sedating in the cut dominant hybrid the genetics are Larry og and granddaddy purple and it's known for smelling like grape candy or kool-aid the healthy dab from this with that pretty big guy very huge all right here's to sampling it if you're under 18 years old please click out of this video this video is only intended for viewers who are 18 plus years old I live in a legal medical state so I'm a lot to do this I do not condone illegal activities don't do anything illegal Cheers I'm gonna taste this [Music] guys an ant happened to stumbled and landed on the tip of my dapper and somehow he was able to ruin my giant as that another dad no ants Cheers pristiq purple punch you're gonna be trying this let's see what it tastes like [Music] [Music] some of the berry flavor comes through I also get a lot of pine flavors overall flavor-wise I'll probably give this a 3 out of 5 the price is five out of five being at $15 [Music] the cool thing about the strain is it gives you a two punch effect both to the cerebral and to the body this is a perfect strain paired with desserts or as a dessert the effects may help with nausea stress body aches sleeplessness the main flavors that I smell from this is the berry and the sweet I get hence maybe Hensel flickery but doesn't come through very well on this batch and that's the purple punch by pristiq they're better thank you guys so much for watching this video this channel is all about educating and uniting the

here and this is gonna be my official review on chronic elixir but y'all know me first things first I got to put some smoke in there get the mood right and yeah cheers in much love y'all that's how you start a video booth week all right chronic elixir chronic elixir is THC syrup that also has CBD in it so it's five parts TAC one part CBD so yeah it's really good I've tried a lot of the the THC syrups and there's not too many that have CBD in it now have CBD to stray CBD that has 200 milligrams or they have the 1500 milligram that has five parts TAC one part CBD this is the one that I prefer it's real clean when you mix it there's no floating particles or anything like that there's one thing to it it has a little CBD kick at the back end of it little medicine kick but if you've had CBD you know what that is and it is a medicine so me I don't mind the taste of a little medicine if that's what you're ingesting and CBD has medicinal purposes so I got apple soda from Jamaica and I'm gonna pour some strawberry and liquid strawberry chronic elixir in there it one tablespoon is sixty three milligrams I go about 2 tablespoons it has a nice plastic seal on it and then foil seal also beautiful labeling really professional all right so that's why I take a combo to set the mood give me nice and toasted so watch the pour up on this it's really clean mixes really well don't really bubble up too much it will bubble up but not too much that was a little over tablespoon we'll put a little bit more in there I like to go about like I said two servings it did spew over just a little bit but it's fine that's what paper towels are for all right so now that we're ready take that give it a nice little mix and as you can see there's no floating particles it all mixes nice and well and then I always pour it over ice makes it nice and cool ready to go Cheers very good strawberry taste it's all organic and the owner has Crohn's and can't digest dairy products and that's the reason why he created this is because he likes edibles and things like that so there you go all right let me see what else all right the effects of this usually within about 30 minutes I start feeling a little bit of the effect Nelo a little bit of body thus you feel the CBD and then you also feel the THC kick in it mellows you out and this is also great for appetite every time I drink a dose of this it increases my appetite makes me hungry and I tear the kitchen up but yeah they have several flavors I think for four or five flavors they have a CBD and the THC you know the pure CBD so you can have in the morning without having any hand high and then you can have the CBD and the THC after a long day's work to get that mellow body relaxation and you know it feel right in the hand get a little bit relaxed there as well Machat other than that you need to check into it I'll leave the link down below chronic elixir you can read all about it how everything's tested and it's clean yeah like I said there is a little bit of a sea wheedies taste at the back end of it which i think is good because if you don't want it too sweet you want to know it's a medicine that's my that's my opinion you don't want a kid to grab your drink if you like no this is good you want to have you want it to be good but you want to have a little bit of a something just so you know that's my opinion and I'll stand by that Cheers all right I'm gonna take one more dab one more ball grip to close it out I call that a combo as you all know I hope y'all enjoyed the video I hope it was as in formidable as possible with my limited knowledge as far as all the specs and everything on that of the product but I know it's a great product I've been using it for about a year and I have no complaints everybody that I introduce it to say it's a wonderful thing and it's a man it's it's for medical purposes so no it's a medicine all right and it works so with that being said I'll leave the link down below check in to email them email me ask me questions about it I will be a little bit more informative if I can and I will ask the right people the right questions and get you the right information cheers a much love y'all hope y'all have a wonderful day this dab and ball rip it's for you guys cheers in much love have a great day peace", "VkWO2BFFJy0": "how's everybody doing this is John let's see sors and we've got a good one for you today alright well today we're going to be discussing one of the most recent of eight bands the one here in Washington State and some ways to get around it if you do vape THC concentrates well we have here in front of us this is like it says this is distillate this is THC distillate this is watermelon flavored champagne Kush this is one gram we're looking at a THC of abrupt 78% the total of cannabinoids of 84% all right now what we have here is 1 2 3 4 5 5 grams of concentrates this is all dis little strawberry lemon-aid pineapple watermelon pineapple watermelon now what we're going to do is we're going to show you some of the workarounds seeing as how you can no longer buy a flavored cartridge in Washington State now you used to be able to just buy a cartridge much like this that is already filled with distillate at the local shop now this particular cartridge is a si sell by Jupiter research very high quality cartridge you could normally go down to the store buy one of these full of concentrate and and you'd be set well recently our governor decided that due to children vaping and some of the deaths related to vitamin E additives and THC cartridges he's removing all flavored THC distillate cartridges from the market well seeing as how he's done that we no longer have access to high quality cartridges with good quality distillate in them I feel that is not a positive thing well it also opens up the market for black markets products to enter and people to try using them instead of the much more safe legal methods as such I decided to come up and show you a couple of the methods that I'm going to use to stay safe whenever I vape now this distillate is still available it will not be marketed as a vape distillate it will be marketed I do believe as an edible that is the way they can get around this it is watermelon flavored distillate nowhere on it doesn't say that you should smoke it or that you should vape it it is technically watermelon flavored distillate and as such should be eaten okay that makes sense very nice the same can be said for the pineapple the strawberry lemonade all the different flavors so you can go down to the store and you can buy these one thing they will not come with this nifty little green tip because this is specifically used to fill up a cartridge so you will not have access to one of these that's fine now if you have any of these old cartridges that you got when they were full if you got a high quality C cell cartridge much as this one and it does not have the metal band across the top here then you should be able to unscrew the top and refill the cartridge with distillate I will show you how to do that as option number one now that will be option number one refilling a standard C cell cartridge I do not recommend filling them more than three times one two three that means you get it and it's full you refill it and you smoke it you refill it and you smoke it that should be it if you do it again it's on you that's the way I say it that is one gram we will refill in a C cell cartridge this is a company called unite vape where then is the email address that is their website that is their phone number unite vape where makes a a couple of different vape products this is one of them this is the all-in-one Evie one vape in this specific pin has a battery and a cartridge attached to it it's very nice it's one use disposable it's metal very high quality you unscrew this mouthpiece you fill it up with one half gram of oil much the same as you would do with that that's our second method now the third method we are going to use this is a pod system this is from eye crusher this particular pod system is called the Zen what this does is this is utilizes a battery with a different pod to refill to utilize to smoke with here is the pin with no cartridge in it here is the cartridge before it is filled now this is a one-gram cartridge I will be filling it up placing the lid on it and showing you how this operates now the fourth method that I will be utilizing is from a company called transferring transferring vapes transferring vapes manufactures a very different multitude of cartridges we believe will be utilizing some of their 810 cartridges this has its AIT's right here this is an 810 half milliliter with 2 millimeter inlet holes 1.6 ohm coil as you can see the size of those holes on that are very large for a thick distillate now I will be pairing that up with one of their batteries this one's pretty neat it operates on touch one two three four five one two three one two three one two three four five so that's kind of neat well without any further ado let's get right into it first things first this is the Zen cartridge or pod right here this particular unit utilizes a data cable I forget the name of the particular data cable comes in a very nice box my cursor VAP different this is the cord that they are utilizing for charging this particular unit [Music] now first things first you pick a distillate I'm going to pick watermelon open up your distillate now you want to get a dispensing tip apply it to your syringe because you definitely want to be able to accurately dispense your product now [Music] [Music] [Music] now I'm not overly showing you the full way to fill this up yeah I've got that on some of my other videos what I'm doing here as I'm just trying to show you some of the different methods that you can use to still vape after this vape ban all right now that is not the cleanest method that I've ever used to fill one of these sons of [ __ ] up but as you can see the hole in the middle is clear my above the outside edge is just like that put that plug right in there this is the top it squeezes right down and then clicks just like that that is one gram of watermelon flavored distillate in these in I don't know if you can hear that or not but is this is magnetically operated and when it connects there is a vibration allow you to know you have successfully connected it all right well there we go that is one done right there that method right there works quite well you should be like I said you should be able to order some of these I crusher Tom I crusher dot-com they different if this seems like something that you like this method right here these pods are purchasable we'll let that sit for just a little bit and we'll see how that turns out after after a bit we'll we'll give that a hit next up this one here is always a very popular method reusing an old cartridge okay there is definitely 100% nothing wrong with reusing an old cartridge as long as the cartridge is a high quality cartridge and it's one that you think works well now as such we're going to take some pineapple and we're going to fill up this C cell with it this already has some oil in it but not very much so shouldn't be too much of an issue filling this thing up alright let's open this thing up and we will get right on it all right so here it is now I would like everyone to know just so there's no confusion I uh I warm up all of my distillate before you see it hit the screen so I just turned the camera back on after warming up this distillate and that's why that bubble moves right like that because I'm about to refill a cart with it and I don't want to be here for a half an hour I never put additives in my distillate I don't use this lip that has additives in it distant need additives put into it and that's about all I can fit down in that son of a [ __ ] because it needs to uh just settle down in there which it will slowly over time in order to see it starting to so we'll set that sit there for just a minute that's number two refilling a standard cartridge this is the all-in-one I'm extremely happy with the all-in-one so far they work really good in my opinion these two here are both half grammars I'm going to be filling them up with some strawberry lemonade here so like I said the strawberry lemonade I'll be utilizing it to fill it up with and let's get this ready all right here we go once again we have this strawberry lemonade right here put the tip on tine there down take the lid off of this would be the transferring a ten cartridge with the two millimeter holes and that sumbitch is cracked right there he sits of it he just cracked that glass cartridge just [ __ ] cracked right there so [Music] that's uses his [ __ ] tits right there very very nice high quality you can tell why that shafts that big I have no idea as you can see it clearly does not have to be [Music] [Music] [Music] now we let that settle down in there a little bit all right [Music] put that lid way back on there [Music] [Music] let that sit there for a little bit so here we go this is the transferring cartridge a 10 all right they have a trans brain all right well now let's let this settle on down in there see what we got all right so here we are back first things first what we have here is four different methods for vaping THC distillate now whenever you get THC distillate and you put it in one of these pens you need to understand you probably won't be getting it back so if you put it in a bad cartridge you may lose that distillate and that stuff's not cheap it's one of the reasons I do this now first things first if you have a C cell cartridge that already had oil in it and the top screws off and you can just put more oil into it well I got to tell you that method does work all right now you will be tasting whatever flavor you had in here before and you will never really get a good clean flavor out of this because you already used it plus the coil has already burnt up a lot of oil that may have a burnt flavor to it it is what it is this one right here this is from the United Way of this is the Evie all-in-one pen very very nice here is their contact information now this is a quite quite nice pen I like this quite a bit it would like I says 400 million power battery ceramic coil very nice now this one right here you put your oil into it you screw the lid onto it and then you hit it that's it cut-and-dried very easy 1/2 gram capacity you buy it you fill it you smoke it you're done just like that very very nice all right this right here is the eye crushers in this takes a full gram just drop it right on in there the vibrates let you know what's working has variable voltage functions on the bottom of this button very nice but this is also just a hit and go [Music] this one actually has very nice flavor it's very user friendly the mouthpiece is long and cinder I haven't had a single problem with this one yet and I have used it quite a bit I would definitely say if you do like the square boxy style pod systems this one is a full gram and it is it isn't too bad so last but not least we have the trans spring right here this is another company that does different cartridges and this one right here I've hit this pin a couple different times then it works it works just fine this one that's a little harsh this one's actually quite a bit harsh I'm not sure why I looked at the voltages online and it says the Green is the lowest and as you can see right there it is green so I'm not really sure why it is as harsh as it is but there you have it Tran spring like I said transferring makes many different sized cartridges one grams half grams a couple different style batteries but I've never really honestly had very good luck with the transferring brand the C sell brand cartridges a big fan of those there is a link in the description if you would like to buy brand new C sell cartridges and utilize those that is what I recommend above all else these right here they are a half gram they are more expensive than a cartridge but they do have the battery they do taste very nice the flavors very good they are designed specifically for the cartridge that they are combined with so they work quite well these are just a couple of the options seeing as how you will still be able to buy the distillate in the syringe and you can add it to any one of these products to have yourself a nice thing that being said you guys have an absolutely beautiful day thank you so much for tuning in this is John with C&C connoisseurs we'll talk to you guys next time peace", "RLLbt-01NZo": "all right we're gonna do an eighth extraction of jungle cake we're gonna use the nug Smasher three and a half gram one 8 bags 160 micron we're gonna go and do the extraction on the next mushroom alright here we go you have the press we have a three and a half gram bag we got a big three and a half gram nug of jungle cake god damn the shit's gnarly so we're getting ready to put that into this bottle textile we do have a good helper here needs bullet what's up boo boo yeah hey we folded the bottom of the corners of the bag and you can see the excess of the bag was cut off it's another thing great about our bags is they're 100% handmade in the USA and they're double back stitch you can cut the excess off which just steals yield obviously and here's what we have ready for the plates slide a little piece of parchment in you know alright so we have the bed of the bag loaded in the mini or 223 degrees probably fine here what's great about this press is it doesn't over press it's very hard over press she's a video of the one-handed here so she's in one hand you gonna do it slow let it let it transfer and then we got pressure on the product you can see how the plates are filling up premium stuff at this point we just let it run we let it extract as you can see it's coming out we're really mess with it the mini does a real even extraction all the way around the plate so this was a little bit more towards the front so it's coming out a little bit more towards the Frog you can see it starting to run beautiful product bullet has this toy which is a full tap paddle tire get the tyre bullet get it weighs about 35 pounds matching that dog ripping on your arm or something take this off you can see the extraction all the way around it they're gonna be really nice shield here release slow so the puck doesn't run into into our extraction oh my gosh and the key there the bottleneck is or the bottle tech packing the bags is that round puck at the end all right so let's gather it up and see what kind of yield we got I expect about a gram or a little less probably three point three two grams or something like that was put right here stir all the haters always DM me and say I never show any results and it's all [ __ ] blah blah where's the paper that store here's the rosin going on the paper see the papers tore off the scale put it on it's 1.0 to one gram of jungle cake rosin that I got out of 3.36 to get the benefit", "YhmvdlmtYwU": "only 53 minutes yo check these out i made these yesterday now they'll see why i need to kill them but i'm gonna dang it you see that crack right there that's why i need to count right

need some i need somebody this is this is turned into like a nice like uh my it's not gonna because of my face stupid face but yeah trust me it's dope what are you doing okay ah dude see what happened when you don't do a dab and you're not like properly medicated it's like everything's in the way somebody's at my front door all right okay these are good these are aired out enough i'm going to use 90 micron 90 we're going to do we're going to do this one first today and then tomorrow we'll do alera's banana all right all right let's get a little a little ros and dab real quick [Applause] all right cheers i love raza by the way always cold start with rosin you going hot right going higher [ __ ] jack your banger up oh man yeah tickles tickles it stings right stings and nostrils oh that is a really strawberry skunky yeah that's nice nice so yeah that's what we're gonna do today we're gonna get ready to go over here and smash it um the press is already on it's already heated up we just gotta fill it's gonna fill the bag up which i just want to get the uh just get the majority of this up this is what 90 micron looks like all right you know a lot of people say a lot of crazy [ __ ] but i'm telling you right now if you use a 90 micron bag do you really want to get crazy do i have any more damn i'm almost at a 90 micron these are 160 let's go up here what the [ __ ] are my 90 micron bags oh there they are i really like these 90s sorry really like 90 micron bags the rosin you get back is is crazy it's insane all right so what we're gonna do is we're gonna take this okay this is an eighth if you guys want you check out the um check out the review i did on this when i first opened it but take it take a look at these nugs one last time they are frosty all right this is banana kush um ghost og cross with skunk haze and phenomenal absolutely phenomenal flavors on this um what i'm doing is i'm i'm definitely i'm still tucking i do tuck the corners on this all right just gonna show everybody what this tuck the corners okay and then what i do is try to evenly because it's 90 microns so like you can get it let me show you so i just want to kind of get it even but not right i'll show you just give me a second let me just all right that's all i do make sure you get all this stuff out of here though we want all well all medicine right so really make sure you take something and get in there um all that is rosin it will turn into rosin so make sure shout out to pharmaceutical rx for having some pretty dope um jars you know the price point on these i'm not going to lie i see companies have them at 60 and i see companies having a 75. um this was 60 you know i dig it we're about to have some of the cleanest rosin right here ever made right because the way they grow their stuff so if you get if you get crazy you know i just like to do this um if you can if you can make it an even cut on top right and then get a good press so we got a little excess i'll cut the excess off right i'm just gonna i just give it a quick smash any excess i have i just cut it all right let's go over to the press let's take a shot of coffee first right i need a shot of coffee oh yeah yeah all right i don't think i'm making it through this nope put too much [ __ ] down here now [ __ ] the cat food [ __ ] all right here's the press right here [ __ ] we're not getting food for you buddy you eat all your sister's food already already out of control all right what is it we're pressing at right at 200 degrees and 12 sorry 212 degrees fahrenheit one eighth well let's go well now further i do i'm just gonna push this back oh hey stay right there that's the perfect spot right there so what i'm doing is i'm just getting this warmed up all right all right [Music] oh yeah like i said we're just heating it up hey all right all right there you go now start pressing started pressing like this at 12 and a half right now so i've got 17 and a half i usually just go until i can't crank anymore and that's good let's sit there all right oh we're getting huh you getting any in the side action there no now this is a i press we might have a blowout right here might be a blah right there it looks a little dark but right here we're looking we'll see what happens sometimes again sometimes you don't but i don't think we will um so yeah so this is a um this press right here let me just show you guys this press i built this myself it's a 20-ton from harbor freight and then it's controller i got off amazon and it reads out in celsius and i had to actually put the controller together but check us out we're getting right pretty good stuff [Music] just check it yeah we're pretty much maxed out on the pressure sorry for moving the camera around so much trying to get this thing stable here for you so basic guys go for right around five minutes i like to get a good minute or two warm up and then give it give it the um give it the press so like i said this is twenty thousand 20 ton 40 000 psi you don't need that much but it makes for a great first press really does you guys are about second and third [Music] so like i said we started we're at we're at two minutes right now and it's starting starting to slow down all right up on three minutes like i said it's only an eighth it's not the crazy runs like you've seen some of the ones where i've done you know quarter half ounce three quarters of an ounce an ounce but yeah it's um it's looking pretty good [Music] so yeah uh see the plates like i said you can get the plates on amazon and they were right around 300. um there's there's some it's not perfect um you know having to stick all this stuff in here and set all this stuff together and build all this stuff so there was that all right we're right at four minutes and we're just we're just the movement's starting to slow up so we could probably yeah we're getting close yep close to that five minute mark five minutes is a good indicator you know you don't have to keep it there but it's just one of those things where if you look at it like all right pretty much it's not moving anymore you know you're maxed out on your pressure so you just move these these are hematite just magnetic rocks so yeah like i said right at five minutes to penny give or take [Music] give or take you know it's nothing turn this dude off all right let's check this out let's see what this looks like all right i can see there's many blowouts [Applause] [Applause] now the front obviously because i leave it open but this stuff right here wow yeah it's got the nose of a funky banana all right so it comes up in one piece but you see the blowout right there and then there's some minor in the bottom um we didn't have too much retention though and that's good so this is gonna go right inside here now this whole thing in here there's almost a pound of already pressed stuff um and i promise you we're to rehydrate that dude and we're going to press it all again all right so check this out good looking stuff here oh yeah hear the poppers upstairs really good looking stuff i mean that's you see if i can't right all right we'll be out here see if i can get through the gun gauntlet i gotta clean this [ __ ] up cat hair everywhere dude i i [ __ ] sweep this place once a week and it's just not enough and you start down twice and then there's this this is all packing looks like the straight [ __ ] hoarder down over this [ __ ] geez now let's see i need to get a good i have all these little pendies i have laying around just and then score all right let's see now there's my rosin collector these make the best little slow scoops all right little turned up so first what i'm going to do is this i'm gonna get any of these leftover flakes there's not too many you just don't want it in your rosin it dirties up your banger [ __ ] your [ __ ] up [ __ ] your [ __ ] up so yeah you hear my voice right here the uh my eddies man i made some eddies out of some um some of that gti the [ __ ] was that island skunk or lime haze whatever the [ __ ] it was some good [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah good [ __ ] all right start just [ __ ] collecting the [ __ ] i can't believe it i must have 10 years man there's like when i first got booked and i was sitting there and i was like like legit thought about killing myself because it's just like if anybody knows you know you just get that point or you're just like i'm done you're done but you know i [ __ ] pick myself up like all right [ __ ] let's figure this out look at that stuff dude get up in there come on come on meow i don't know why [Music] dude i hate i hate hate hate not having somebody that can just film me and i can't i can afford to pay them and i do everything on my own i guess [ __ ] it all right we need to get a piece of parchment paper right here i got one see what we ended up getting here was my microwave so yeah i love making rising somebody remember 0.26 12.3 just for shits and games all right so yeah uh some some of these are reaching out uh you know with the uh the scuttle scuttlebutt of of getting the 1200 from trump about getting a press or building a press listen i will absolutely if you're in pennsylvania i will drive in my [ __ ] to your house and i will set that [ __ ] up i will build it for you um save yourself the money save it and i was talking to a buddy the other day and talking about spending you know 1200 on a press it's like dude i literally built mine for i don't know five six hundred bucks so half the price and i have a bigger press with bigger plates so it's like and i do understand i don't need that much all right well then why buy one to begin with yeah look at this you know what i mean like why even buy one then i don't need one that big yeah you do might not today might not today but you will if you're gonna if you're gonna continue like if you're just doing this because i just want this i'm just gonna do this or like literally you're gonna buy this and do this every single i don't know at least once a week twice a week depending on your you know your needs for me there was i was pressing yeah i was present every single day that's all i was doing press just pressing rising you got to learn you got to get into it especially if you're gonna try to you know put those hours in put that time in get in that press get in that glass get in whatever it is you gotta put that time in man i mean they say 10 000 hours whatever i don't whoever they are you just figure it out when you figure it out some stuff's taking me longer than whatever some stuff i figure out right away right like i don't know preston rosin i picked it up pretty quick people hated on me right away blowing glass that's another one told me that i can never get color to stay on um anything and be able to drop it and it not break that's me baby just my point is this you can do a lot more than you think you can or you can just reach out and ask for help and i get it that's our society is literally based off the fact that most people can't are not self-sufficient most people cannot do things for themselves need help from other humans that's fine needing help cool manipulating somebody not cool so like i get it i get it everybody's yeah i don't know stuff since i started talking i started thinking about like what are you saying dude you're saying crazy [ __ ] yeah well [ __ ] it because people get people get their feelings here really easy it's just like i don't know if i want to see you succeed wouldn't you rather have if you're gonna get let's see here if i'm gonna get 1200 free bucks in my head which i think it's free we know it's not free but if i think it's just free money [ __ ] yeah wouldn't you want to yeah sure build a press because yeah that makes sense but then spent half the money to build a press or whatever and then you know what's your fee bro i don't know like 50 000 bucks i'm not not expensive right couple grams so i need a couple grams of oil you know but that's why i say 100 bucks because for me 100 bucks i get a couple grams of oil i literally work for oil that's like literally what i did work for cannabis doesn't anybody else am i just the only one all right so let's see what we get now there's still probably a good amount on here um i'm gonna go back over it one more time uh the 90 micron i i really suggest everybody you know at least get 120. you're gonna get better quality rosin now listen everybody's gonna tell you you might get more with the 160. you might i don't i don't like them um but you know i don't like the taste of the rosin at 160 is what i'm saying myself personally i do not enjoy the taste of the rosin at 160. not to say that 160 won't work it will absolutely 160 is good for like if you're trying to make like eddies for like rso or some type of all right so here we go we're all cleaned up okay i feel like it's pretty it has like a like a like a rotten banana like a dank banana smell to it almost um and we can just clean this off one last time you give use the uh final view we have point three right here let me just give this a good solid fold over all right and this is point three right so not bad it was actually um what was that like two point when i say 2.23 we got back eight tenths ooh ooh eight tenths so i honestly i get an average of uh of right around seven tenths it's like my average some of the flour um like um alera i get more back agri i get more back g leaf makes really good rosin they make really good rosin so let's do a dab of this let me show you what it looks like after cure it up actually i might not i'm like yeah i'm like i'll probably cold cure this just makes for a better so that's pharmaceutical rx's version of banana kush tomorrow tomorrow we'll do alera's banana cushion we'll see what we get back um i'm actually pretty intrigued to see what we end up getting back let's do let's get this we just had 1.5 right let's see what this weight 1.5 what's up buddy over there famished poor guy huh huh bud mm-hmm you like dude feed me [ __ ] i never get to eat ah yeah right dude you ate your sister's food upstairs you [ __ ] nut eating everybody's [ __ ] running around i don't eat all right so that dab right there weighs one half of a tenth weighs a 20th of a gram cheers [Applause] cheers oh yeah oh yeah straight up banana yo that's crazy that's [ __ ] crazy that's how life should be right there yes yes taste it i always get to read i read absolutely outstanding good stuff [Music] [ __ ] yeah all right so i paid that was 60 bucks shot okay terp wipes if you don't know that was 60 bucks i'm not gonna cry about that 60 bucks for a point eight now if you're looking at it you're looking at like i saw a g leaf g leaf had rosin um there's like orange tropicana or some [ __ ] like that they had that um i want to see straw nana because i know straw nana i have a buddy that presses roz and he was like dude it made the best rosin i've ever made in my life so i was like okay i'm pretty intrigued by that it's all about the terp profile if you want my personal opinion it's like the terp profile how it's grown and you know uh the purity of the flower obviously um and and like i said the process in which it's grown so the um pharmaceutical rx they grow in a living live soil it's all organic you should check it out check out how they do it it's pretty pretty dope grow um you know at the end of the day we want the best medicine we do who doesn't i mean who's like i don't see anybody here like man i want the shittiest i want stuff that's going to make me feel like ass caleb there's no food in there bro you go upstairs poor guy you'll figure it out huh upstairs go eat your sister's food because that's what you've been doing and you don't need to eat down here [ __ ] guy eats all the [ __ ] food all right so yeah turp wipes clean everything out even rosin right we know rosin can [ __ ] your banger up if you're going too hot but i just want to stop and do that because i haven't made any videos i haven't done any rosin in a while um for a video um and like i said that really ends up being nice looking stuff let's get a great shine to it it's clean it's [ __ ] the taste on this listen the taste both of these look at this you want to see something crazy looking if i can get it to catch the light there it goes my face was in the way look at that look at that shine on that ran ran around right so oh um i did check i've been checking the website looks like 67 days to the festival and i'm getting ramped up man i'm making as much glass products as it possibly can hopefully by then i'll have the kiln and hopefully by then i'll be able to at least have some rigs for use um so i really hope that's you know a thing but um yeah thanks for everybody's love and support really i can't i can't [ __ ] about it you guys really kick ass man everybody so let me see her farm i can't help but not say it see look here's what we got so far for this giveaway uh we're getting it's getting bigger it's growing it's growing damn looking vapor cloud over here all right so let's think about this it's probably goofy i'm not gonna do this the ten dollars like is cool the money but like at the end of the day i i'm paying for the ship and so like man whatever [ __ ] that's what we get so far then we can't dude ounce one whole ounce from kilowatts part two in that drawer just like that all right everybody have a blessed day man stand by glass for that ass", "O43TwCZyOUc": "how's everybody doing this job with C&C connoisseurs and I got a good one for you today all right so I picked up a gram of summed abstract live resin this is some Hawaiian golden pineapple libraries and gems and juice there's some of the numbers there the Terps teetsi you guys already saw this whenever I did a review all I'm doing right now is I'm gonna try to play with this stone that's in here so you guys get a good look at that diamond community digger another drop it right on the old mat there [Music] you know you can see this is one faceted stone there [Applause] [Music] I can smell this this is just it's a very piney super um spicy [Music] kind of a smell it's um it's very solid as you can see it is one solid piece and this has a lot of Terps on it and my dumb ass has dropped it not to worry like I said it is just one solid chunk [Music] all right well that's been John with CNC connoisseurs playing with a diamond that I got in a grandma dabs you guys have a good one and as always tune in for

marijuana purposes only have a licensed cuddle and if you're not i don't know try to get to become one i guess if you're supposed to be um all right guys so i'm [ __ ] ready to get medicated it's right around midnight and uh friday night i have the weekend off must be locked in the [ __ ] house until monday morning boy does that sound great to me i can't [ __ ] wait lots of [ __ ] stress all kinds of ball up crazy ridiculousness is what it is but we're in medicaid right now and i'm going to feel a lot better so what i got in this bag right here is a strain from ct pharma it's the seattle sour cush seattle sauerkrauch on which i'm pretty sure is just um well it's called the um tetradid i think it's hatched in it's coming at 30 thc i don't even know if i've had this strain before but i i i think it's going to be some fire um i just want to get even kind of you know bring it up a notch in my head you know kick up that kick off that you know [ __ ] and uh with this yellow sound questions is i'm pretty sure it's just a cut of sour diesel across the og kush because what sources but i don't exactly know maybe seattle cut off sour diesel doji kush i'm not really sure playing the [ __ ] out i guess we won't but we'll see anyways let me get [ __ ] medicated yeah so it's it's called the tattooed attachment and uh i'm excited about the strength so let's just do it oh that stinks a little bit wow that's definitely stinking a little bit alright really um yeah i think i'm showing some cushion i think i'm throwing some sour diesel i think that's what it smelled like it was combined wow it smells potent and it's been musty and funky wow these buds look nice all right card your hand hitting the table um all right so yeah there's definitely some i won't see look at these buds they're just nice you'll see so here's the overall eighth and uh it's all right but these buds they're pretty like they used to hear like this guy just looks chiseled like maybe from distance in but i'm gonna get up close he's just like he's solid he's chunky he's me and he looks real satia-like he's nice um it's got that real soury smell to it so i'm assuming definitely get some srds on there um let's see lsl recursive this part means why you place the bet there's some cushion there and the butts themselves just look nice it's got that really unique smell to it it was stating it's camera described it's nice it smells real good all right so that's that i have so many fancy [ __ ] i'm gonna go with this guy up here i found this one dude i think like that'll be two walls yeah oh i might not need all that work like that and that what that and that i think that's the smartest i'm gonna try to make two walls yeah there's my med session right here these two guys are here you feel better all right word not that i don't feel bad good right now but all right so supposed to be a nor'easter tomorrow that's exciting we haven't had one of those yet this year so we'll see what happens with that my work life's been crazy there's been so many [ __ ] up funny things that i'd like to talk about i'm just not allowed to um so yeah all my been crazy also things i'm not allowed to talk about and uh this weed smells [ __ ] wow [ __ ] really really kind of burns your nostrils almost when you [ __ ] break it up i like that and i probably honestly should use that other butt yeah i honestly think i'm probably gonna need we'll see it's kind of sticky too all right so yeah i can kind of make two bowls out of this sure oh wow that's [ __ ] stinking all right so let's make that evil one maybe we'll do smaller balls like they'll do the trick my words i'm touching them i also grabbed myself i didn't go pick it up because it's [ __ ] you know like kind of way i got a quarter of the uh dynex the gorilla bomb which is the gorilla glue across the thc bomb um i've been sticking a lot of the ct final flowers lately just because just because the shit's really been [ __ ] great for medicating reasons for me they really do the trick they taste clean and i don't know i just like them i've been digging them so [Music] uh zoned off for their second sorry and i actually break up real nice a lot of expansion but you can hold that wow all right so wow all right that's actually pretty i'm actually pretty impressed i'm not really much of a student person normally but i actually really felt that like the endings i could feel immediately take over my body that i actually felt really changed my whole mood in my head i actually felt to go up there i was like ding okay i feel different that was um pretty fast acting this is a 30 thc cut of this so it is one of more potent cuts of it i think but that was a that was that was very fast acting so i'm assuming if you're looking for a strain it's like a depression strain that you really want to snap out of some cord this would be good for that just really well um i still feel a lot of it in my body too i'll be honest here there's definitely a a somewhat of a it must be like close because the coach's indica you can feel it in your body too relaxing a little bit but it really it'll do good to kind of just put a smile on your face quickly nice strain i'm happy with this this would be a great way to make straight for tomorrow i'm excited about that [ __ ] fantastic so all right that burns up nice yeah super high power stiva for sure nelly will change the whole day around especially if you get one of those people it's really stevias you tell us it's definitely a part one all right guys i'm out safe weekend everybody

to dan's buddha bodega where today we're going to review cushmits so let's just get right to it [Music] cushman's is an evenly balanced hybrid from ozone that crosses animal mints with bubba kush now bubba kush is a very famous strain and actually one of my favorite strains to have in rosin and now i've never had animal mints so now that that's out of the way let's take a quick peek now the odor of this flower is actually really faint but what is there is very earthy with just a little hint of of mint or berry on the end it's really nice and as far as looks go this actually looks a lot better than i was expecting it had real nice greens purples the orange hairs and lots and lots of keith okay we saw we smelled it let's go smoke it all right well here we go mastrovia slanted cheers salud okay so kind of an earthy herbal flavor right up front not too harsh on the exhale there's an oily mint taste it's not bad it's just unique actually actually it's not that bad i'm starting to get a little bit of of a head rush here what do you say we go ahead and give it a little bit of time for the effects to fully take hold they should have named this six flags mints because it is a roller coaster now let me explain in the beginning it starts with a very cerebral energy boost and about 20 minutes after that you peek and once you peek the sedating effects of the flowers start to kick in so from an energy boost to calming and euphoric to sleep actually i found myself many times reaching for this at bedtime making it perfect for people that are smoking to fight insomnia but if you're smoking to fight anxiety i would say steer clear from this one it has the potential to cause some serious panic but if you're a veteran smoker and looking for a wild ride please go out and try cushmance alright guys well that just about does it for me here i'd like to thank all my friends family subscribers viewers lovers haters uh commenters everybody that makes this so special thank you

checking in respectmyregion.com here today with a quick west coast video tour review featuring special guests justin cures what's good what's good what's good uh he's you know justin's a dabber so we're going to do a quick uh dabbing review we've got calgary extracts we've got sun cake and a sweet and sour today's review is going to be the sweet and sour so first episode out of two we're going to dive in i know nothing about this extract other than what's on the packaging so it's an ice water extract we're working with rosin here then some fire rosin really tasty very you know talked about all over california from oakland um from the bay area so please recycle i like that enjoy using your favorite cannabis extract paper device keep cool to preserve flavors ingredients fresh frozen cannabis um oh this is the sun cake oh it's backwards uh sweet and sour rosin manufactured by zinganic incorporated uh what are we looking at here seventy two point six two percent on the thc eighty one point five one on the tfca point one nine percent on the cbd cbs 88.5 one percent that must just be total cannabinoids yeah the total cannabinoids equals cbs no not the show i was thinking oh my gosh [Music] i know right new new oh 70 u to 120 u bro oh wow sweet and sour smells like stanky stanky sprite stinky funk stanky funky sprite i kinda like it i'm excited to check the way we do the the west coast we tour review y'all we're gonna take one dab each and then we'll talk about it we're gonna take a second dab and then we will give you a final score out of ten um from there the score will be translated over to a hundred point review on our website respect my region.com so make sure you guys go check out the site we post reviews and music and [ __ ] every day so that's justin's dab i will not be dabbing something that large and just to give a little context there you go bro dip into the pie uh just to give a little context i love calia in terms of like how this [ __ ] always looks the same whenever you get it it's always the set how it says 70 u um to 120 and if you put it up to the sun it's that nice color nice bubbles going through it and then you wait a couple days and you get this really nice um what i call like that butter up right and then it's nice and cakey as they say and it's just a little bit easier to work with to get the dab on the tool and i feel you get a much nicer much nicer dad like a more flavorful batch so my my thing is is i like the quality of it smells really good i'm sitting here thinking to myself what else do i want to know right now and sweet and sour obviously isn't the genetic unless they're naming that and still so i want to know what kind of high i'm about to do i want to know i want some of that excitement to hit me and so sun cake i'm sure is like some kind of wedding cake across let's what does what is sweet and sour over here sweet and sour i want to say it has some cake in there as well like the sun cake um where are you at 900 nice but sweet and sour um i believe it's i want to say cake gelato one of those in there but you know we'll really be able to tell tell really what it is after the taste test all right you guys it's coming in we're using a terp timer to make sure we don't scorch the dabs super important to make sure you guys are taking low temp properly tent properly timed out dabs we don't want you guys getting burning yourselves yeah is this actually shout out to octave that is accurate my brother go ahead you're bringing me to it so you don't let me know how it is i'm still around like 900 degrees felt like it wasn't that good let's see was it hot did it feel like it was a hot dog it's crazy because it definitely it definitely said you saw it but did you you gotta leave it like this let it sit right there and let it be underneath the laser see there was hot dab on camera i don't know because now now it's saying 500. it's all good you used to have the laser all the way on it go ahead now go ahead now you try it yeah dip again bro you're still looking you're still beating me because i'm still it is at four seven it's not six hundred all right well first job roasted everything's gone go that's at four 470 470 degrees that should be a nice much better melt and i'm there oh i'm still got 100 degrees away properly attempt properly properly temp the second time yeah because when you have it you know properly aligned oh yeah not moving the trip timer is incredibly accurate incredibly accurate mine just hit by a hundred i let it go down to 480. cheers y'all i like it down a little bit lower at the 440 460. oh yeah tastes like a little [ __ ] a sundae from mcdonald's mcflurry i'll give it to him first down hot dab total technological difficulties between your torch and my goddamn turn timer over here but we're an embarrassment argument now when it comes to the second dab low temp perfectly timed mine was perfectly time i'm coming in i'm coming into the next 27.5 bro three point seven i'm coming in at 8.75 we're going to have no technical difficulties in the sun cake but for the flavor the strain how i feel right now i've i really enjoyed the taste of that but we don't know what strain that is you don't know what kind of high we're even supposed to feel i mean i really like if you look at the nail i mean the color is the color is really nice on the melt the flavors there um i i have to agree with you it's definitely up there you know above 8.5 for me definitely hitting a nine hitting the nine club you think it's a nine i think it's a solid nine cause cause i only give hash like a 9.5 and up if i am a smack and i'm not smack down the string i'm not very smack it's more of a flavorful it's very calm this is that this is that rosin dab that you take it wasn't a tsunami wave it was just a nice little it's that roswell taking the morning before you go to work it's that dab you take to improve your day whether it's 15 minutes before work or in the middle of the day the quick break or yeah you know for sure evening you improve your mood get you an extra hour of energy et cetera um nice hybrid right yeah i'm coming in final score for me is going to be that 8.75 i'd like to see the genetics and the terpene information i think that stuff is super important i agree um give us to me the packaging is also a little bland the white and black it doesn't necessarily pop from me but i do feel there are some super positives in terms of the quality of the flower the quality of the oil the quality of like the smell the nose right um i i would assume what's the price point on this roughly this is um out the door eighty dollars a gram so and that's giving you the average on like is it the most cost uh cost conscious product out there no it is definitely up there in terms of it needs to perform at the best the best in terms of quality so great work to tell you let me know what you guys think below please utilize the comments like follow

flower I can smell it from here I'm gonna take out some of these nugs so you can get a look at them this smells like this smells like the first harvest from him worldwide it smells amazing if you can see that man that is just burrow right let's get you in there this thing is huge in dense it's like holding a pinecone look at this pretty one man it almost looks purple look how raw see that thing is look at that this is greenhouse cush I've broken up three nugs like this and I haven't found one seed not one seed I'll be good not one seed fantastic this is a fantastic Kush I didn't check the website to see how much it was you'll just have to look it up I guess maybe I'll look it up and tell you but I can tell you will break one down so you it has that phone texture like like a like a really nice indoor would have that that really nice foam texture give it to me just breaks off nice and easy I mean it's got an amazing texture to it it breaks down very well it's tight nugs but it breaks down very very well this is a high quality high quality top shelf cush tastes fantastic alright onto these two I put them both in here one is a shatter one is a live resin let me tell you look you'd be laughing at me if you was sitting in the room with me the first time I fooled with this stuff because how can never fooled with this stuff before this [ __ ] is sticky as [ __ ] okay like I was like fourth grade pancakes with extra syrup sticky son like oh my god and no one told me don't put that [ __ ] in your mouth right so my hands were [ __ ] sticky as [ __ ] I scraped it on my tooth jeez and Pete's it tasted like a whole [ __ ] pinecone tree the whole tree was in my mouth for three hours and it was just wow I couldn't get it off it was just incredible yeah don't be around anything don't touch anything don't touch this I'm sure there are people who are just like been doing this favor and they're just like bro you don't supposed to touch it it looked like I could touch it the way it sits on here it's very it doesn't look like it's gonna get you but let me tell you this stuff is sticky sticky sticky stays I would say that I much prefer the lod resin over the shatter the live resin was so cool tasting I did a little bit of research on it and so a live resin is when the plant is freshly harvested they dry freeze it and then extract it with low temperature so that all like a whole bunch of flavors are preserved and whatnot it was awesome I mean it really tasted good now I don't have a dad rig or anything like that all I did was got it inside the joint and you could definitely taste it it tasted fantastic it was hard to explain it had like a natural plant like cannabis plant like it tasted like the plant would have smelled fresh not cured in a sense hard to explain I will say that the shatter is incredibly piney incredibly piney if you're into that heavy heavy heavy pine taste the shatter was incredibly piney both of them tasted excellent yeah all I can really say is I definitely recommend it I definitely recommend this coach man this stuff is freaking amazing really really beautiful alright man well y'all have a good night [Music]", "1lpM_9qJya8": "what's up YouTube oil derrick coming to you with another shatter review this is some godfather ghost OG Kush made by 7/10 lives I got it at Nature's Way in Colorado Springs look at the color on the stuff guys this stuff is real golden and real thick it actually looks real like the consistency looks real good on it let me grab a club for a quick putting hands on my meds most about size smoking you'll notice off whatever I dunk a dab or something I'll take a piece off and then I'll dunk you as you guys spin extra that's pretty sick let's check it out it's like an average size down yeah this stuff is real pliable you see I'm just squishing it with my fingers it's very stable see I'll take my tab move it to the side I'm a slam dunk this is nice I'm gonna grab it right off my tool and just straight to the dome sometimes these titanium nose you get them really hot sometimes it runs up your tools so sometimes it's better just to slam dunk it oh excuse me gosh I gotta quit doing this bad habit all my videos I'm burping alright guys it's getting hot I'm gonna use my honeycomb bubbler piece with the titanium nail as usual hearing a little bit I'll bust out the big one yeah I'm sorry let's do it dabs up I always dig your dome off watts on it that one has the real cushy flavor has like the tangy the Tang flavor not limiting more live more like of a lime flavor that's the sweet - I hate it earlier I didn't taste it as much as I do now it's excited it's a really clean taste I'm gonna give that one the four out of five goods it's pretty good but the flavor is not that unique awesome flavor like you like like that biotin I had or that bio fruit crush that biologist all got flavor was amazing this stuff it's not bad this have a bad flavor it has as great as a grape flavor it's real clean like I said real it's a real head high though it's not like a really and acai my feeling to me doesn't feel like a body huh more of a head heart alright guys check me out next time use some thumbs up comments maybe you guys got some ideas some strains do you want to check out some edibles you want me to check out maybe a certain type of pipe or anything let me know I'll do it anyway till next time later", "iAzrXtagR54": "[Music] you - what's up with it son because my girl you see him your homie mr. big Dookie and we're back for yet another harvest video focus back there there it is and this time we're back for a harvest of Beyond dream number two this is my second phyno of Beyond dream by North genetics and this is the last time I'm gonna be running this Fino although it is an incredibly beautiful plant so let's get talking about it I pulled it out of my tent on day 62 I harvested just a couple of these these ones right here on day 63 and it was pretty late at night I just wanted to get a jumpstart on it and day 64 I did the majority of it I did all of this up until like right here and back and then just today to finish it out I did these last couple little stalks so and it's day 65 so let's get into it and take some close-ups to this Beyond dream so this Beyond dream compared to my other one has a much different structure to it definitely it grows bigger cone-shaped buds that then foxtail out kind of knuckle II in the last couple weeks of flower as an incredible not a frost to it just like the other strip other Fino but it has smaller calyxes more errors and a little different structure to it so there's one of them that's been drying for two days now focus overall looking pretty good should be a nice happy harvest see if I can get in a little closer seeing via the trichomes a little better beautiful blood so yeah this one I grew out in the tomato cage and I think I got a pretty good harvest on it for what I did it wasn't at all number seven pot right there so I believe number seven pots are somewhere right around five and a half gallons of volume worth of soil in that so it's kind of how it works and over here's my trim you see I got about half the bag worth the trim I'm gonna throw in my freezer realistically if it didn't partially dry it probably would have been closer to a full bag so there's a good amount of trichomes in here and definitely like most of you guys have seen before if you've been watching my channel I don't slouch on my sugar trim make sure I only grab things with sugar and that's how you can make good extract out of it so don't just be throwing to any trim in there if it doesn't have trichomes on it don't use it you're just adding more contaminants than you are quality cannabinoids so these bugs though beautiful I love beyond dream has a wonderful like very you know soft very sweetness to it like wild berries so let's look at the structure structures big thick dense you know decent-sized stalk they're 3/4 inch wide diameter not bad at all pull it out take a look at some roots Oh all right it's starting to dry a little bit because it they're not here for the last couple minutes to focus overall it looks pretty decent though I mean fairly even webbing throughout it's not incredibly dense and thick of roots but it was definitely enough to fill out the structure and pull even evenly from the soil mass in here so I can't complain like I said this has been somewhat drying out for the last couple days it hasn't been offending water and two and a half days now three days almost but overall pretty nice structure decent root mass and pretty good harvest so really can't complain about that so for now you see the homie big do so by then because of my throwing mr. big Dookie and this is the last shot you'll see beyond dream number two he's yeah [Music]", "YVAa20j5CRU": "ayyyy YouTube Alex here back again with another quick video had to hit a prize this morning Friday January 3rd I hit a prize Irie boom boom boom grab a few things today but only one that I'm doing a review of right now I grabbed sour banana sherbert cartridge at liquid live present cartridge sour banana sherbert right there I also grabbed brownie Scout this is called brownie Scout by rhythm 34 percent THC I'm not doing that either and I grabbed another blueberry headband and I also grabbed this is what I'm doing the review up by oh Jesus butter by Cresco right there it's the bio Jesus butter by Cresco you see those stats to kind of small right there yeah let me get you open this up here not let you get a look at the what the wax looks like and I'll do a dab of it to different lens if I seem like I'm a little bit further back it's because I have the 50 millimeter 1.8 lens on my camera I wanted to try it out see how it looked different perspective you know I like doing different perspectives and stuff so this is back in my original spot in my chair in the living room and let me do a dab of this buy of Jesus I paid it I paid 65 bucks for the gram of the spy oh jesus not too bad for the gram of the Bible Jesus for 65 paid 70 for that blueberry headband again that stuff was good for 70 it's worth it nice bye oh Jesus that's looking real nice that's the bye oh Jesus butter live butter by Cresco very nice-looking very nice smell it smells amazing this is the bye oh Jesus let me do a dab of this you know what you know what I think of the bio Jesus of butter by Cresco don't some in two puffs go to throw a little in the puffs go also the first I want to bang a dab at this with you guys let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comment section this bio Jesus is coming in at 81 percent THC eighty one point four five nine and then THC is like one point zero five three so it's like 82 percent probably right around there THC not bad for bio Jesus now I have had violent Jesus and a cartridge before co2 cartridge but I've never had bio Jesus and abs and I did have bio Jesus and flour before which was pretty good it was okay didn't have much of a taste to it dull and lack of terpene profile the reason I bought this one here was this was only 65 bucks and the but tender pointed it out that they just got it in last night he said hey man you know we got five of Jesus in for $65 a gram I say hey man let me get one I was gonna grab jet fuel by rhythm but that was 84 the gram so when I saw up ahead by of Jesus for 65 that just came in they just brought it out this morning I was like let me get one of those instead about jet fuel but then I grabbed another because this is only 70 for the cured resin 93.2% cured resin for the blueberry headband and this flower here which is going to be pretty good that brownie Scout in that cartridge that sour banana sherbert cartridge which I paid for yeah I dropped about he see it was 235 I think I had $10 worth of credits so spent 235 the eighth was 55 this grand was 70 the cartridge was 55 and that Graham was 65 for the buy of Jesus yeah 235 bucks hopefully I can make this last me for a couple couple weeks I'll try to ration it out but I be smoking some stuff up and to had to leave so I really gotta ration this out so it's not set my timer I'm probably gonna have to go in a little early cuz I just a couple seconds there because of that little delay I did I was reading a text message yeah let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comment section let me know what you think about this new 50 millimeter lens they said I am a little bit away from the camera now the camera is probably 2 or 3 feet from me normally the camera would be really close and I would have the wide-angle view but the cameras like real close to me with this way it's not so much of a wide angle but the picture quality should be a lot better on this video than the other ones alright Cheers bye oh Jesus that's nice it's got a nice um earthy floral kind of flavor with a little bit of a sweetness to it very pleasant very pleasant I like that a lot bye oh Jesus by Cresco yeah smells fantastic I am going to throw a little bit up in the puff go got to clean it out though darn it so I'm not gonna throw it in puff coat just yet I'll do another dab real quick oh yeah man that's nice this is an indica yeah I bought I bought hype this is a hybrid cartridge this is a hybrid this but a blueberry headband this is an indica to buy oh Jesus I know it's first thing in the morning it's uh what is it almost ten o'clock quarter to 10:00 and I'm doing dabs of buy of Jesus like I told you before if you're a veteran smoker and you've been smoking for a long time now you know it depends on what you want I want to relax so by Allah Jesus is good but if I wanted to be uplifted and uplifting then I would get a sativa like I said I was gonna grab the sativa the jet fuel the only reason I grabbed the bio Jesus is because it was $15 cheaper for the bio of Jesus and the THC content was exactly the same eighty one percent so 15 bucks is 15 bucks you know I mean this brownie scale was 55 cuz it's the rough cut they have rough cut and premium but the brownie Scout this was thirty four point eight percent THC love you'll be able to see it on the box this is real small 34 point zero seven nine yeah powerful stuff I don't know if I'm gonna do a review on that now I got all this stuff but the blueberry headband I'm not has already did a review I might do a review on that cartridge yeah very tasty Jesus mm-hmm mr. bio Jesus the box there's the stats see the stats there there we go I had a touch on it to focus right there yeah Cresco live butter by oh Jesus oh you guys have a great day peace I'm out", "kNvjNul9qyg": "ah YouTube YouTube what's going on on turbine time subscribers and and and loyal

different strains of painkiller XL okay three different types so you got this type painkiller exhale this type into the exhale and that's a pain killer exhale three different strains so this could be multiple different strains I mean so um but that said let's get into these numbers okay and see THC 0.68 teetsi a thirty point five thirty CBC 0.23 CBD okay two point six nine CBD a 65 point 75 C P DV 0.24 CBG 0.51 CBG a 0.93 CB and a zero point 18 and then you got the terpene analysis I'll show you guys a turkey analysis I'm not going to read them you guys can pause the video and do what you do to

von three so uh yeah I got my fam right onto if you guys can hear it but if not yeah it is what it is but look look at this black label painkiller exhale I like this I like guitar I like everything about this so far boys this is let me just I'm a speechless it's going for a nose test here oh my god there's nothing on the lid Wow straight cushy man it's so beautiful now you know what this consistency is reminding me of right here smack cam first was good this smoke came over with look at dad's gonna be a dumb now shot right there anyway this is reminding me of the concept dick consistency is reminding me of Cresco member renard get the Cresco what was a cookies and that's kind of what it smells like the crash coke cookies definitely cushy man definitely pushing him alright like this well first I'm going to take a little hit out of a crack crack straw here now it's a nectar collector white rhino glass nectar collector whatever [ __ ] call it alright and then I'm gonna do dab and probably a DAB it deep in and then I gotta wake the wife and kid up oh yeah it's definitely that that nice consistency like the Cresco sugar add the cookies [Music] tip number one guys whenever you're done scooping out to concentrate make sure you put the lids on right away please don't want no dust cat hair dog hair or [ __ ] run a virus [ __ ] flying into it you know what I mean just saying little tip for Mom took it down here right man the house we moved in yesterday up in Delaware was of amazing beautiful house one of the freest the most beautiful house I've ever seen in my life knew that everything was just perfect I had like [ __ ] aw I'm gonna say marble floors there at the home [ __ ] house but yeah pretty much it's very nice very nice Cheers Wow that's some tasty stuff err gassy cushy candy it's reminding me of some kind of like fruity kind of some kind of fruity candy oh by the way this this strain does help out with nausea vomiting anxiety chronic pain inflammation PTSD all that good stuff guys so this is the main reason why I got this stuff it's for the pain obviously named Pinker right and then painkiller exhale I'm a big guy and I'm not a sister a little [ __ ] right there oh I do know that that this this painkiller did win like top ten streams in like 2013 or some [ __ ] like that so it's pretty cool right so as you see these things do we're good and it's trick to the [ __ ] head to are starting to feel a little looser that has a very very good taste like I said it reminds me of some kind of some kind of candy like a fruity fruity kind of candy that I can't I can't put my [ __ ] finger on anybody let's do a hit out of my Jeep and connect and I'm going to end this video go wake the wife and get up my wife and son look a little crazy here boys not too crazy just like I said I gotta make this [ __ ] last me good they're going good we're gonna get you're gonna get ourselves a nice chunk er up in there boys all right yeah that's a nice that's a nice piece get in there painkiller but right in the middle Bing thank you Black Label now I mean let me be honest honest when I first bought this I didn't realize that it said 0.5 of a gram the 50 bucks I was like I did it again [ __ ] but I actually got it and as you see I got lucky and it is not it is not a half a Rams I I can't stand but when that happens like they worded that the way you think you're getting a [ __ ] full gram or some [ __ ] and you get it in is not like I'm not paying [ __ ] 50 $60 $80 for [ __ ] half ounce ever again I will tell them that [ __ ] shove it up your ass shove it up their ass so one two three four five after net baton you know how we do it always take the thing off before you attach the bow because you don't want that [ __ ] to snap break anything special just two hundred dollar bond I inhabit it I ain't got the money replace that [ __ ] I've said two clicks cheers boys I'm gonna do alexxa fight closer to the Sun Cheers goddamn those good with [Music] I uh I am not getting that real good head but I guess because of the CBD it's more of like a kind of mellow I definitely feel like more looser and everything um so the effects are definitely there for the [ __ ] the pain in the muscles and and all that good stuff which if you guys know I'm in this program mainly for chronic pain so that's why I take it I don't have PTSD or anything like that you know I mean it's mainly pain for me if I've radiated this arthritis but carpal tunnel waters hit my hand you know I mean my back [ __ ] up like yeah so moving furniture for [ __ ] sixteen years is really hooking a toll on me um my dad said I do got a nice little buzz on I'm not gonna lie this is a nice show I like this not not too bad not too intense not too you know nothing

ur batons out peace where your mass to people starting today", "UAOHJpECGEE": "what's up and so today we're going to be laven on some Scott Sochi which is a mix of triangle Kush and rare darkness cut number one some super kill live resin it's kind of and as like a like a vanilla berry taste to it it's pretty good definitely try it out", "3dveln8jDMg": "- get a lot of requests on how to four bottle textile extractions so my purpose is to go through that and start to finish so everybody kind of knows what I look for in selecting a back micron and then how to properly fold and load the bag bottle textile and some of the reasons that we do that so I'm gonna go and extract 3.5 grams of fresh flour and we'll open the flour to determine what micron a bag that I'm gonna use now these are our three different microns that we offer in the three and a half round bags the 160 micron which we'll use for fresher flour spongy flour that doesn't flake or crumble as the flour starts to dry out we'll start to use a smaller micron so we don't get any of the plant material flowing in with the rosin 120 and then we go all the way down to a 90 the difference in yield between 160 and and a 90 micron is maybe a half a percent so it's not a huge difference in yield my experience tells me but there is a small difference but when that half a percent extracts all the plant material out of it it's well worth it so that's why we go down at micron on bag so we're gonna open this this 8 and see what what condition it is in smells great and at state roll it's pretty moist I'll pull out an UGG and I'll just determine where it's at it's still nice and moist so I'm gonna go ahead and use a one sixty I don't think I'll get much in it it's right on the edge of a 120 and 160 but it's if it's between 69 70 percent all the way up to 73 percent humidity it should be about at 160 between sixty nine sixty six sixty five ish 120 anything below the 65 ish they use 90 or you can breathe some more life into the two with a Babita pack or something of that nature so anyway now that we've decided what bag we're gonna use I'm gonna take the three and a half gram hundred sixty micron bag out this one I'll get rid of the rest of these now of course we offer these in three and a half rounds seven grams and fourteen grams and if you're using any of our bags the bottle textile that we'll show you here is all the same just more material and those aren't that those ram size ratings aren't a must if you do much more than three and a half grams and a three and a half gram bag you have risk blowouts at lower than thirteen hundred and fifty psi on the actual material so the key to bottle tech now that we've determined that we're going to use 160 micron bag we have I think three and a half grams here supposed to be exactly what we got three and a half grams scale the first step to it is we'll take the actual bag that we're gonna use this one and we're gonna invert the bottom corners that's the first step to bottle textiles so I'm just gonna lift them inside out with my thumb it takes something somewhat sharp like a pair of scissors and I'll poke the corners in so they're completely inverted just like that when I put my thumb's in the pockets and I'll peel them back just a little bit so it looks like that and the corners overlap each other and what this will help with is it'll lock the cylinder in the coin like puck in at the end so it'll when it extracts you'll know the exact surface area size to be able to determine the exact pressure on the material to get a consistent result and you can multiply that result by multiplying bags in a press thus having the same pressure on material so having the corners overlapped like that now we'll start adding material to it bring our material over from here and what we do is remember it's gonna extract straight down so we'll one of the base in it put some of the smaller pieces I'll just drop them in kind of let them settle where they want to settle remember we're making a round coin like shape so once we get a base in there we'll go ahead and just kind of lightly press down so they'll be start filling the gaps and we start forming the bottom portion of the bag against the surface which folds the corners in like that drop the rest down here I don't want to at this point be too rough with the material I'm not trying to put the plant you know plant material and oils together I'd like to pull pressure to happen under heat that'll allow the extraction to happen properly so once I get the bag loaded like that and the bottom looks like that you can see how the corners overlap each other this will help hold them together when the extractions happening I'll take and cut the bag off about half an inch above the material line here one of the differences with Knux master bags is that they're double back stitched every stitch so that material that you cut it won't unravel on the bag you do experience blowouts with these bags you're probably um extracting under too much pressure these bags blow out at about thirteen hundred and fifty psi on the actual material so once we get it just like that we look at the bottom real simple the top we cut off half inch above the material line we fold it up like a little present on all four sides now the last side that we fold in is the side that we're gonna put between the plates that'll hold it all together so that very last fold of the present is the one that we're gonna slide in the plates this way now once you have see I'll fold it once again so once you have that all done you'll want to raise the press just about the height of the bag apart by doing that it holds the parchment real nice and what you'll see is we'll start to get an accordion effect when this comes down it's not putting outward pressure on the natural bag and that's why the keys to bottle textile if it holds the surface area and it allows you to have a consistent surface area that you're extracting with each time let's see how it has that accordion in effect on itself but that's pretty much the key to the bottle textile is packing your bags that way and that'll give you a consistent extraction result every time so when you start to work with a particular strain you can know what to expect at the end and I've got about 14 hour psi on the factual material I put too much actually so we'll see what the back good so that bottle textile extraction key is to have at the end the puck just like that that all your product separates wrong it'll be that same size every single time and with that reason for results like that thanks for choosing next measure", "y-euSNlMtZY": "but there's no yet yeah why don't you do more expensive weed well I got to show you guys some budget strains I say budget strains and I really only mean the difference of ten dollars so far air rise has taken that place as the hey I'm going into an Illinois dispensary and I don't want to spend sixty to sixty-five dollars on an eighth izes there with that being said I've noticed some of their strains have a lower THC percentage I think that we can see the math there they're not exactly going to offer that 35% you know punch you in the nose make you [ __ ] your pants buds oh no oh oh no no no I don't want I'm so sick [ __ ] there Jesus Christ fine I'll get on the [ __ ] ground ah this is this is what it takes Tropicana cookies by air rise I've seen y'all post about this all over Instagram waitin to get my piece well it's finally here I I'm really excited for this one this is a fifty dollar eight this is not one of the usual top-shelf ones I grabbed from Verano I think it might start storming out here I'll hit you guys with the genetics on this one because to be honest on have no idea but with the name maybe it's cookies crossed with Florida orange that would be really funny if I got that exactly right it's time for the first sniff you already knew that with a name like Tropicana I'm hoping for some really nice orange Terps let's check it out [Laughter] it's even better than the mimosa Oh enough talking you just got it I can't hide this little secret in here from y'all any longer before I grind down these nubs of Tropicana cookies into a first taste I wanted to point out look at this guy holy [ __ ] now I don't know anything about Tropicana's lineage or genetics at all but it's got to be mostly sativa with how these buds are formed very loose but oh my goodness they are so so incredibly frosty pushpop Flintstones pushpop is the smell I'm getting off of this I really wish you all could be here well it's absolutely pouring rain over here in Chicago we've got some plans to go out tonight and there's no way leaving this house without trying the Tropicana cookies I can't be smelling these insane citrus and fruity chirps and not get a little bit of a taste so I'm very lucky to have the MJ Arsenal cache as my smallest piece and thankfully the one that I can really use as a taster man so he'll Bonet and try this out what you think about that bag hmm oh man that's that's the Terps I'm looking for in smoke to God let me go ahead and tell y'all worth it absolutely worth it the Oh little musky little gassy almost little fermented fruit and a lot of similar terpene profile to the forbidden fruit Tropicana cookies air eyes let's go wait last thing I'll say the Tropicana cookies is so aromatic that just being over the bomb right now really all I can smell is that like Flintstones pushpop orange guava GRA penis coming off of the buds seriously some of the most flavorful buds I've had gun fruit gum dude oh love it went ahead and grabbed that round two of the Tropicana cookies by air rise look what I'm greeted way it's gang those are some yeah that's a real fruit salad right there that's a real fruit salad of colors textures shades but I mean it's been a wild ride it's been a ride with this air rise Tropicana cookies who doesn't want to see such beautiful colors in there bud but more importantly this stuff is pure jelly it's absolute fruit on the musk coming off of this right now is heavy fruit punch heavy orange I mean come on yeah that's about what I thought we would be a fool to not notice those beautiful hairs that are joining out of the top of that gosh look at that that is crazy I'm getting real Mac vibes off of this with how dusty is we I've been [ __ ] recording man dog threw up in the second bedroom like in the bed but I moved into a two-bedroom one-bath place and my family never comes to visit me and it's for my dog I essentially got a bedroom for my dog all right so uh Tropicana cookies well as we saw it's been a while since I've hit that beaker and especially anything gosh I'm confusing the beaker with this beautiful son of a [ __ ] the Voyager so switched over cuz throw it's a little raw after screwing up that hit let's see that triple percolation of this can help me out no not even a cough that is why I [ __ ] bought this here from me to you just to let you see how [ __ ] stoned I am offer this Tropicana cookies taking these two hits come on that ruined me hey THC is [ __ ] no it's not [ __ ] but when it comes to quality cannabis to make a large assumption of a sub 20% strain can leave ya looking like me I didn't think the 17% would really affect me at all dang this stuff is awesome I'm so relaxed I cannot wait to eat some lunch even though this is a sativa dominant", "SLQPg6MNviE": "boy cushy here and we're chilling went to good old saliva today i don't know why it's so dark in here

you the plants and then we're going to check out the harvest that i did one of the plants and just let you guys know the ts2000s are coming super soon and i'm excited as hell to start the next project gonna be like season two so i can't wait that's all coming soon let's get into these points this [Music] now start the show so check it out this one's extremely close to being done too that's one big rock button so i think that one's actually going to be the best plant out of all the ones that we had it's small it's not that big pogo two feet two and a half feet but on the street that butt is right like it's pretty big too like a bit right in the sides of my hand like that's a nice big bug i think i'll update you guys with it as well and then this big one here is going to be done in a couple days too so i don't think this one's going to be the best and whatever it is what it is so i'm just letting it go this one's going to be the best one of these last ones i'm sure so don't let them finish doing their thing i don't know so let's get into what i have this is i want to do the same thing as last video i'm gonna cut all the buds off trim the leaves off get them all nice and smoked look at that we'll see what we get but they both seem to be pretty but this is well this is the third one completion earlier on but you know it's all good this is what we got this one a little bit better but it's good enough for now so there's the pile of leaves and so that's not too bad i'd say there's a lobby boat i don't know at least an ounce there i'd say something like that it's not too bad of a fall so i'm gonna do the other one up and i'll come at you with little reviews trying them out too the after process of one plant now it's time for the next and this is the step this is the stuff here that i did the other day i didn't fully trim those leaves off and [ __ ] yet but i'll do those and try them out too [Music] [Music] that we fly the globe [Music] because my lines are doping i won't stop until i'm at the top of my mountain and i'm not gonna [ __ ] go hundred thousand views really more to go this is the show hundreds of different strains of smoke there's no joke flicking up the big now you know we get so high that we fly the globe puffing around in a cloud this is my own then i pop up like high i'm homeless get stoned open", "wb6PiI5y5Co": "hey what up youtube alex here back again with a really quick impromptu video i just opened this up and it is absolutely fire the taste the smell oh smells like some cheesy it's called golden cobra by moxie this is a sativa coming in at 86 percent thc we'll see this here let's get a look at that stats there there's the stats there i'll let you get a look at the wax sugar golden cobra it is really funky got an amazing taste to it so i just wanted to shoot a quick video to let you guys see the golden cobra i'll do a dab of it i just did one dab and the taste was so good that i said let me do a video of the golden cobra sugar by moxie very pungent taste it reminds me of like a cheese like a blue cheese or a uk cheese kind of it's got a real cheesy feet type smell but it is absolutely the smell is good it's really good like some white cheddar cheetos or something so let's uh do a dab of this it is thirsty thursday here let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comment section heat this up real quick and do a dab another dab i also grabbed today while i was there which i'll do a review probably tomorrow for you guys i'm not gonna even open it up today is orange cookies by g leaf i'll do a video of that probably tomorrow and post that tomorrow but i also grabbed this golden cobra today and i had to open it up and i wasn't going to do a video of the golden cobra review or nothing but i thought it tasted so good to let me do a quick video on the golden cobra just because it tasted so so good and smelled so freaking good guys i can't tell you how funky good that smells mmm smells it smells like a cheese like some white cheddar cheese or something funky though the taste is phenomenal golden cobra by moxie cheers cheers going in the hatch um very tasty very good you didn't really get to see the smoke because i got my ceiling fan going that was a decent dab very good golden cobra is a sativa like i said uh 86 thc this is a live resin butter by moxie yeah like i said let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comments section this is what i'm dabbing on today probably tomorrow i probably i'm not going to hit up rise tomorrow i got a little bit left of this and that's it all right guys i'm gonna wrap it up peace i'm out", "3KRuhc9R5FI": "damn i really wish i had some weed is that really there it is hey you welcome to my course review a juvenile stuff this is what i do i smoke crush hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them all for you by the time i'm done we'll be on the moon now let's start the show thank you for the view yo what up world welcome to juvenile styles today i got mirage so i got a gram of it here i'm going to open it up right now in front of you to show you exactly what comes in a grim and then i'm going to roll up a nice joint pack a bomb take a nice hit of the bun and we'll give it a nice thorough review like we usually do so i want to pull it out take a nice look at it like usual roll it up get high that's what we do so it's not a bad grip i'll show you the close-up and then by the time i'm back after the close-up we'll have this joint rolled hundreds of different strands of smoke there's no joke breaking up the big puff and choke if you've never seen my show now you know we get so high that we fly the globe told you i'll be back in a jiffy with a spliffy but now i got it let's light it up and give the mirage plus a review so it didn't look like the biggest account for a grim but it's not that bad of a count it seems to be pretty sticky we'll take a look at it here in a second just trying to get a nice taste of the flavor before i rate it but i'm going to throw it in the bong too before i give it the rating so but the taste so far it has like a nice sweet taste to it but i kind of taste like maybe like a bit of vanilla it tastes nice and crystally though it does have a very nice taste it's not the strongest flavor i've had but it is nice and smooth so that is a nice smooth puff so let's take a look at the buds jesus christies must be child proof i'm just playing just playing so this one ain't a bad size one let's hold this one up as you see it's a nice color green it kind of got like a bit of like a darker like brownish kind of tent to it because it's got a lot of hair on it but it has a strong smell to it it has a stronger smell than it does a flavor but this smells really nice i can actually smell like the vanilla to it quite a bit more and the smell but the flavor is really nice i like that it is smooth you'll be able to smoke a nice big hit in the bun so we'll pack a nice bowl up here in one second we'll take another look at another one that's just another little bug it didn't come in that bigger bud but what do you expect it's only a gram you know so it's not bad the gram was 12.50 i think it wasn't at the nslc which it ain't too bad if you didn't notice check it out i hadn't worn in a while i decided to wear it for another video do you guys if anybody's around from back in them days when i first made this let me know in the comments here i'm going to show you a little side by side i got a little bit bigger since than a tune this is a gram of moon rock so came in two nice hard like pieces so what i'm gonna do is break some off and try it in the bond for you not trying to flex or nothing but when i first started i was just recently getting clean off of our drugs and alcohol so i am a little proud about how i look now because definitely a lot healthier looking now than i was then but yeah i made that i think it was my for 100 sub special i think it was and i don't know if i made this one for special but i had to go with it so i'll give this a rating for taste right after the bomb just one second my dumb ass forgot to grab it before we started so yeah let's pack a bowl up take a nice taupe we'll take this bud and throw it in got to get high so high we got to get high so high taking hits from the bomb you know save yourself back in the day you gotta love that song all right let's light this up and try it out in the bone pretty good pretty good so i can taste it a little bit more in the bone but it tastes pretty good either way so i'll give it i'll give it a nice i give it a 3.5 for flavor it's not that bad definitely had a lot worse so i have a 3.5 this is definitely not the one of the best i've smoked either but it is pretty good so for flavor i'll give it a 3.5 for a count i mean can't be too judgmental on a gram but for account i'll give it i'll give it the same and i didn't mention this is 24 thc and it has 0.79 milligrams of ocb or cbd my bad not the papers cbd but a total cbd is 1.35 milligrams so it is an indica and it's from skoshka it's from that one scotia scotia anyways it's from it's from that [Laughter] i'm going to give the mirage plus an overall 3.5 i think it's a pretty fair rating and i hope you all got some good [ __ ] to smoke i got some ak-47 white widow and cherry blast fast grow are supposed to be coming from bulk seeds i'll put a link to their website in the description of this video so you can go check them out they got all kinds of different scenes [ __ ] like in like all kinds of different

smoke session make sure you tune it's 8 o'clock nova scotia time so make sure you check for your time zone to make sure you're there at the correct time but yeah we're going to have a nice time it's going to be to celebrate the 500 subs and thank you all for helping me get there so i hope you enjoy the review start the show hey you welcome to my course review a juvenile style this is what i do i smoke push and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you by the time i'm done we'll be on the moon now let's start the show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with bow pink diabolo cushtrain so this one's an indica and it looks very nice and it has a very strong smell to it so i rolled up a nice joint of it so we can give it a nice thorough review and in the meantime i'm also going to take a nice look at the jackfruit cush strain it's a nice big bud so i thought we would break it open and take a nice look at that and give it a little bit of a reviewing as well so let's light up this joint of the pink diabolo and then take a nice look at these buds so let's light it up first so that's actually a very nice taste that's a very tasty but it has a really nice like a crystalline taste to it but it also has like a fruity taste it tastes very nice kind of like i'd say almost a berry taste that is a very delightful taste so let's check out these buds here we'll pull out a nice big one see check that one out that's a very nice big bud so i hope you can see it good has a very nice look to it so it has a very nice light green color to it with the dark kind of brown orangish hairs and i hope you can see because it has a very nice layer of crystals on it it's a very nice hard compressed bud so let's bust this in half and take a nice look right in the middle so you can see that that's a lot of crystal that looks very nice so and it has such a strong smell it's a beautiful smell it's a kind of a citrusy smell but it's a very strong sweet very strong sweet smell it has a bit of an earthy smell to it too but it's mostly like a strong sweet smell so that's a very nice string so this here is three grams of it because besides the joint that i rolled up over here it is a very nice account i could definitely get a nice amount out of that for three grams and this one as long as well as the jackfruit they are both um ten dollars a gram or i think it's um or it's seven for five and yeah it's 10 a gram or 25 for three or seven with five for seven five fifty for 70. sorry i got a little messed up there but that's the price of it and that's the same with the jackfruit at the misa miku place there that i go to i put the link in the description if you want to go check out what else they got and let's take a nice look at this jackfruit string because that's a very nice big bud so let's bust this in half and see how it looks on the inside oh yeah that looks very delicious so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna give it a quick review right here and right now and smell it and test it and then i'm going to roll a nice joint of it and then i'll throw it on the end of this so you'll have a little update about how the flavor tasted in that too it has a very strong smell to it and this one has a very very fruity smell to it actually it smells very fruity it smells kind of like um i would say kind of like a mango smells kind of like mango-ish it smells very tasty so i'll definitely roll a joint of this and update with the flavor and throw it on the end of this video so i don't have to waste your guys's time by rolling another one and stuff you know so we'll finish this one off a little bit and we'll catch up and then i'm gonna roll this up real quick and then jump back on with the update of how that tastes so the jack i mean the pink diabolo i will give it a nice i'll give it a four point i'll just give it a four out of a five for uh flavor it's very delicious but i've definitely tasted some stuff to taste a little better for a count i'll give it a 4.5 because that's a really nice three grams especially with the joint out of it taken already so i'll give it a four point four out of five for all around writing it's a very delicious string and we ain't even halfway through the joint and i feel very good so that's what i do i'll give it a nice for out of five it's a very delicious strain and if you ever tried it let me know in the comments let me know what your favorite strain is to i know i say it all time but it interests me so maybe i'll see them and i'll get them myself and if you didn't watch the last couple videos i'm going to be posting up some of my pictures soon on my twitter i'm going to leave a link to that in the description too if you're an artist either digital art or either painting or drawing i'd love to see what you could do for the channel too maybe do a picture throw it up on my twitter or whatever and i'll add that into the contest i would love for people to vote to see which one we're gonna add to my intro so i'm gonna roll up the jackfruit real quick and then i'm gonna throw it up and then we're gonna do a plan update as well so don't leave yet we'll be back what's up welcome back at you with the jackfruit so let's light this up and review it i could have thought of something wrong with that i probably should have i probably wouldn't want to call it anyway so let's finish this up so this has a very strong taste so it actually has kind of a similar taste to the pink diablo but it actually has a stronger flavor and it's more of like i don't know kind of like i said mango-ish kind of a taste it is a very delicious taste see i'll pull the the jackfruit out here for a quick second so we could take another quick look at it and there we go so it is a very delicious strain and this one was two grams straight all in one bud so that's why i didn't want to bust the part off first i wanted to show the bud before we rip the part off so that is a very good so i'll give this one a 4.5 for flavor because it's just a tiny bit stronger flavor a little bit tiny nicer but they're both very delicious don't get me wrong this one's just a little bit stronger tasting so i'll give it one up so 4.5 out of 5 and for a count we'll give it a nice we'll give it a nice at 4.5 for a count because that's a pretty fat 2 grams as well especially where we get this joint out of it so make sure that you stay in a few minutes i'm going to do a little plant progress update because i think we got 21 plants coming out now and i got a few more of the random ones i still got to plant so make sure you stay for that it's going to be super dope i can't wait until they are fully done and i'm going to record the whole process until we get done and even record and show you guys how much yield we get so make sure you sub and you don't miss all that because it's going to be super dope super excited too to see how much we get so with that i'll leave it there and give an overall rating of the jackfruit i'll give it overall 4.5 out of 5. very delicious definitely recommend it and i hope you all get some good [ __ ] at home to smoke and i thank you all for stopping by and spending time with me here at juvenile stills you have a good night peace time for the plant update time for the plant update so let's check it out we're on the fourth day and pretty much all of them are popped out the strap look very nice there's only like one that hasn't quite popped out yet but as you can see they're looking all nice and healthy and they're gonna start blooming nice and big soon so it's pretty much just the slow part here and from here they're going to go up quick and then we're going to transplant them but like i say we're going to record the whole process until bud so make sure to stay for the whole process because it's going to be a good time and then at the end we're going to do a nice review of each of the buds on each plant and we'll do it all one video a nice sit down so with that thanks to myers hydro this is all possible make sure you stay to see what they sent me next it's coming up soon and i hope y'all have a good night thanks now it's time to end the show i'll be back but i have to go now that we're already stoned but i got lots more videos so you can't stay for shows so bust up some more crystal and watch another show", "RQppj42jV7M": "what is up it's your boy chronic i don't know how much of this you guys are going to be able to see in my face i'm going to try to angle it just right um it's your boy chronic we're back with another how-to so this time we are doing dry ice hash so as you can see i have dry ice in here um i've got my trim this is just just all the excess trim that was uh from hera so this is jack herrera trim we're going to be using one of the this is the 220 micron bag i have a set of bubble bags that i use and basically what i do is i go ahead and make sure all of this is in here and it doesn't slide out i make sure that i've got it all in this container sitting on this dry ice make sure it's uh really getting cold and then from here i go ahead and i give this a nice tie and now there are easier setups this is just my setup this is what works for me um you know this is just how i do it it's easiest for me you guys will see here in a second now another important thing i'm going to bring you guys over here hopefully you guys see this is this collection tray you definitely want a collection tray of some sort that's like a stainless steel or medical grade stainless steel or something uh you can collect with and uh the last thing you'll need is hey would you be able to grab me one of my business cards can you have a second okay last thing you'll need is a card to collect with i use a business card uh they're clean it's easy so let's uh start the process so basically i'm gonna scoot over towards you guys bring you guys a little bit closer and angle this down hopefully that stays there basically you just uh flip this over as you can see i mean all of that already and you wow and you basically just shake it up you just give it some tumbles thank you sweetheart business card keep it close to the tray uh basically guys you're gonna do this dry ice hash sifting for about 30 to 45 seconds maybe a minute until the color starts to change once the color starts to change that's when you're going to go ahead and collect you know do your first collection move it off and then do your second collection um basically as uh wow there's so much here as there as a it collects and breaks down with this dry ice more plant matter is going to come out so it's going to be more uncured so i usually do about 30 seconds um to 45 seconds minute tops for my first run because this is all trim and i know a lot of this is actually pretty quality i'm gonna go ahead and just do a minute so we're going to keep shaking just for a little bit longer i'm going to do my first collection and show you guys what we got so i generally also go based on the color tone so i am not only watching uh or counting in my head just like you know how i i am at i'm watching the color of the hash that's actually coming out so we're gonna go ahead and stop so i generally set this off to the side just like that take our collection card and we start collecting and we just have mounds and mounds and bounds of hash so this is uh the way to collect dry dry ice hatch guys so you're gonna watch me a few more times basically uh do this and i'm gonna do the rest with uh the rest of hera and i'll come back after i uh you know you guys will see the time lapse and everything of that but this is basically the general concept um 30 to 45 second intervals one minute max you really want to watch your color color is everything your nice golden tones are where you want to be sitting for your first run your your mid golden tones with a little green is where you want to be sitting your second run more green towards your third and fourth runs fairly green on your fifth and sixth run uh the seventh run i usually just don't even do i put the the material uh to use by doing edibles or putting it in my magic butter machine so that's how i make use of the last little bit of material that has trichomes on it so there's that so that is what we just collected um we're going to go ahead and do a second run don't do that guys do not do that barely got any out so we're going to scoot this over generally i don't like mixing these so i do actually press these separately these are my different press runs they all taste different they all have different quality for sure i press at about 190 degrees to 200 degrees for about 100 seconds and uh right now i'm using 90 micron i usually do 35 micron for hash but i have to use what i have to use uh so yeah that's what i'm using you guys will see that in the next video this one's just going to be uh the dry ice hash extraction so we're going to go for round two and it's looking mighty golden and nice still so that's a good sign lots and lots and lots and lots of heat so guys another key thing um you want to freeze your product before you actually use it this trim has been sitting in the freezer since i actually trimmed her um it was dried and cured everything was dried in here not cured sorry everything was dry so it was all dry product proper humidity um i didn't trap any moisture any unwanted anything unwanted but i definitely uh i definitely froze on my product the next bit of run we're going to be using is actually sitting in the freezer now i always suggest freezing it um you know the colder the bud the easier the trichomes are going to fall off you don't want to make it too too cold um you know you don't want to keep in the freezer for prolonged periods of time you can damage the trichomes you know a lot of people think crypto freezing is actually like really good to store your butt there's actually studies that show it it reduces the potency over time so you know there's generally if i'm gonna process um right away you know within that first three to five days i will go ahead and put my stuff straight to the freezer from um you know trimming however if i'm not going to process i go ahead and cure my bud or cure whatever i want to cure and um once it's you know cured i'm ready the day before i'll throw it in the freezer you know that way it has 24 hours to sit so we're gonna go ahead and stop this is gonna be our second collection i'm gonna kind of scoot it away from this edge here so i can set this down man just loads and loads and loads of thc guys just insane set that down right there you know what i actually have a tool for this let me grab it i don't even know why i'm not using it alrighty so now that i got my actual scraper that uh is designated for this because i'm a dingus i forgot i had it um oh my god look how easy that is the card was i was struggling with the card all right guys so there's our second run looking nice and uh pretty still gold still fairly golden brown golden still fairly tan like a sandy color with a little bit of green that's what i want so we're gonna go for our third one here in a second and i'll show you guys what it looks like and then i'm gonna get to doing uh more more dry sift hash here's the third one we're gonna same thing 30 to 45 seconds maybe a minute max looks like at this point it actually is coming to a halt on how much is in there so yep this will be the last run that i do for the trim and i'm going to trim with the used rest all righty she's getting pretty green so it's a good sign that more material is coming out than actual trichomes so we're going to go ahead and call that the last run for the trim and i'll go get actual hair bugs next which you guys will see some time lapse footage of so what the hell little fuzzies came falling down alrighty so then from here i take this out there's going to be dry ice in here and i'm going to want to as quick as possible get this stuff out guys don't touch dry ice with your bare hands it's bad it can hurt you but uh basically i take all the dry ice out because it's not done it's definitely still good all right guys we're back all right so i got my little collections and i need a sharpie alrighty so here's what i do here's third run of anything so all my third ones are going to go into this one this is how i stay organized keep myself clean and not contaminate my product it's important guys if you're going to do your own stuff at home damn it shut some of these lids don't shut whatever that's good enough um okay we're gonna be pressing today i don't give a [ __ ] about these lids so there's three there's two [Music] uh all right then let's take our product so we take the excess stuff that we did we're going to be using for the edibles go ahead and dump it all perfect so here it was seeded out so i'm just going through here and picking out any uh last seeds i see and we'll find they're healthy because you know here s ones are always awesome alrighty let me show you the last little bit of this before i go uh ocd picking through here with seeds which i'll be doing before i uh probably sift it before i put it in the stuff that's amazing so i'll show you how to prep this if when it's not already prepped and then that'll be the video guys so uh with product you definitely want to take it all off the stem so make sure that you take all the stems out um break your product up that works as well as just like you know chunking it off it is going to get broken up but i prefer to not have stem in my uh dry sift just makes it easier that again guys over top shake shake shake and you know what's up i want to say thanks for tuning in uh be sure to

we've got another cannabis katrik and another one from arise i was uh stoked to find some more bud from them uh after the last batch it was very very good and their stuff sells out super quick in my dispensary but i got up early and i went to the dispensary at 7am just for you guys to get our hands on some jenny kush as i said this one is from arize it comes in at 30 thc and as we mentioned in the last video arise from anna illinois and the story on jenny kush is it's named after jenny monson who was a cannabis activist uh in the early 2000s in the colorado area she founded the group moms for marijuana and was big on myspace back when uh everyone was on myspace actually i can remember those days but let's get into the cannabis critique on the jenny kush the look of this one was outstanding this is the best stuff that i've gotten from a dispensary in the terms of looks especially here in illinois i was just amazing frosty nugs nice and dense they weren't too hard nice and soft had tons of hairs all over them looked like a christmas tree whenever you spun it around in the light i mean these spuds just glimmered they were beautiful i give it a 9.8 out of 10 for the looks like i said i don't know how you get much better than this but i i gave him a 9.8 i'm not going to give everyone anyone a 10 i don't think but we'll see 9.8 out of 10 for the looks uh the smell the vanilla icing is what i got from this one overwhelmingly i popped to the top and it was just like whoo sweetness like i was in a bakery smelled like vanilla icing to me very very sweet smelling bud i gave it a nine point or a 9 9.0 9 out of 10 for the smell the break up of this stuff was again very very good very very frosty frosty uh this that you can see uh when you broke up the nugs so it was it was good impressive looking stuff in your grinder i gave it a 9.2 out of 10 for the breakup uh the high of this one was dominated by its de-stressing properties it was a very relaxing relaxing high great for de-stressing put you in like a zen type of mood to where just stuff doesn't bother you it's a very positive high in that aspect i gave it an 8.8 out of 10 uh for the high the taste of this one uh it's it tasted just like it smelled uh very sweet you get kind of a tropical note from it maybe remind you a little bit of coconut i'd say a 9 out of 10 for the taste it is very very good stuff so overall i'd say this is a an absolutely top shelf bud uh in terms of cure and trim uh in this batch it's great stuff it's in a it's an amazing uh de-stressor this strain the jenny kush great for de-stressing great for relaxing after a hard day at work and it won't overwhelm new users because the high isn't like super super in your face it'd be great for a beginner or a veteran uh smoker so i gave this one a 9.1 out of 10 overall that is a new high here on the channel so congrats to arise on getting the latest high score here on cannabis critique and if you enjoyed this critique be sure to

there's diamond too but this is just as good as diamond if you ask me okay that's it this is the brand smells fantastic pick it up", "C7C7oItGLdE": "welcome to juvenile styles orange push pop cannabis cush review enjoy the show hey you welcome to my push review a juvenile spells this is what i do smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now instead of show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with orange push pop kush string so we're going to do a nice review of the orange push pop string so if you've seen my videos before you know that i've done orange crush that was pretty good i mean it had a nice orange taste to it but i found it kind of had like a strong like kind of orange peel taste but it did taste all right so this one has like a really strong orange smell to it just like that one did but it doesn't have like kind of like the peel has like a bit of a smell this one don't really have that smell to it so it smells really nice and strong like a really orange citrus smell to it though it does smell really strong really nice too so check these buds out it does look very nice it's a nice light colored green and it looks to have like a lot of crystal on it looks very nice so let's light this nice joint up and review the taste as well [Music] so it does have like a really strong orange taste to it but it is a nice actually really nice sweet taste it tastes very nice like the orange crush i found kind of had like a bit of the sweet but sour taste to it that's what i was trying to explain like the peel taste but this one is just like really sweet [Music] i don't really taste much sourness to this one but it is a very strong flavor it is really sweet so let's take another look at the buds and the account and see how good account this came in this was 2 grams so it does look like it is a really good account nice packed hard buds they look very good it was a little pricey i paid 35 i think for three of this one but it is really good tasting and really good account seems like it's worth it because if you throw that extra couple dollars in usually it is worth it sometimes you don't really get that good of a deal whatever when you expect it when you buy the expensive stuff but usually it is pretty freaking good if you pay that extra a couple dollars but this one i'll tell you right now i'll give it a at least a four to a four and a half out of five for flavor because it is a nice strong taste it tastes very good and the account looks very nice too even the buds themselves they do seem like they were well taken care of like trimmed really nice [Music] it is overall good strain i'm liking it so fat [Music] so what i'm going to do next i'm going to be coming at you with captain american og shatter so keep your eyes open that and i got cookies and cream strain and sour taggy too those are going to be coming up soon plus i got a few more but i'm not going to keep going on what's coming up soon just keep an eye out i got lots of good stuff coming up so [Music] like i said for flavor i'll give it like a four to four and a half at least because it is a very very good flavor i do enjoy it's nice tastes really nice like [Music] and it's really high thc i'm pretty sure it's like at least 25 to 30 percent thc it is a really strong strain and it does taste very good so i definitely recommend it i'll give the account rating i'll give it about a four as well it was pricey like i said but it came in a nice account i got this nice join out of it and there's still a nice few buds to roll a couple nice ones so i'll give it at least a four for a count as well because it is pretty good [Music] so overall i think i'll give the orange push pop an overall rating of four to four and a half because it is a really good strain i'd definitely recommend it if you get a chance to try it out i say do so if you like more of a sweet strength try the orange push pop if you like a bit of the sour kind that is sweet too but not as sweet just a bit of sour try that orange crush because that was a pretty good strain too but i didn't care too much for the sour i mean i do like the sour strains but a little mixture was a little different for me but i do recommend both for different people like depends on what you enjoy but they are very nice buds i'll hold it up again for you to take a little better look this is the biggest one that came with them they're all nice buds but this is the biggest one it came with um four nice size buds like that that's what i i took about the size of this one to roll this joint with so it was a really really good account [Music] and buds are really really nice so like i said definitely recommend it and i want to take a quick second to say thank you all for coming and spending time watching my videos i appreciate everybody that comes out here spends time over here with juveniles does i really do i hope you all are doing good and having a good time in your own lives have some good [ __ ] to smoke [Music] until the next one y'all have a good day peace [Music] now it's time to end

juvenile stuff this is what i do i smoke crush hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them all for you by the time i'm done we'll be on the moon now let's start the show thank you for the view by the way you should sub to juvenile styles this channel is really dope now enjoy the video what's up world i got edison limelight ultra sour cush strain from nslc so i'm going to do a little review of it i've done it before but back when i was uh i always say i guess a little cringy and less uh experienced i guess we'll say so now that i'm a little better a little less stiff and i thought i'd give another few so i'm going to give you guys a nice close-up of this and then when i get when the close-up's finished i'll be back with the joint rolled up so check this out because we're down we light this up and light this up in a cup i can't stand up be a cyber monkey like the end of the part i get twist up keep your lips shut [Music] don't [Music] [Music] so i'm back i got the bat let's light it up and get high as my hat but it might not be that high but anyways let's light this [ __ ] up it does have the nice sour taste to it that i was expecting i mean how can you not limelight ultra sour so i'm wondering if because when i went and bought it it actually just said limelight so if it's the limelight must be part of the i don't know part of the company edison limelight ultra sour because i know ultra sour is a strain i've had before too so is it limelight or ultra sour it's a little confusing either way it is a sativa and it's 22 percent thc and it's not a bad grab as you can see it's a very nice like light green color it has some really nice colored hair on it has a lot of crystal too so and that's not a bad account for a gram so we still got this after having the joint so that's definitely not a bad gram from the liquor store and it was nine 9.78 or something like that so that's not a bad price for a gram so what i'll do is i'll throw a nice little piece up into the bong we'll taste it in the bun and then we'll rate the taste and then the smell in account everything else so let me pat a little bowl there we go as you can see we've got a nice little bit up in there let's take a hit hold on the hole's clogged a little bit i should have poked it through first oh god i'm gonna have to poke this first my bad there we should be good now maybe a little too good oh that was a nice day i wasn't expecting that you can see those little birds floating around my head [Music] i'm just playing but it tasted nice so that's all it counted besides it made me feel nice so yeah um i'll give the rating for the taste i'll give it a four oh no i'll give it a 3.5 i give it a 4 if you really like this sour strains but i have a 3.5 for flavor it's pretty nice flavor for rating for a pound for the gram it's not a bad gram at all especially from the liquor store they can look a little stingy sometimes so i say i'll give the account i give the account a three and a half as well it's not a bad account looks like a decent amount for a gram maybe i should start weighing them up for you guys on the reviews i might start doing that the next couple reviews weighing it and seeing how much it weighs compared to what it's supposed to be i might start doing that so i think that we'll give the limelight or the ultra sour the limelight ultra sour will give it an overall rating of 3.5 pretty good we pretty good ground but it's obviously just mediocre it's not top-notch but for the price it's a pretty good ground so that's where this one's from the liquor store it's the nslc here and i've had a few other strains from the edison cannabis co they're not too bad at all they have some pretty good strains so yeah i'll give an overall rating 3.5 to that and if you watch my videos i want to start intro and true interviewing like pop photographers and different kind of like weed influencers any kind of weak content creator so if you puff and record stuff hit me up and maybe we can set up an interview be pretty dope so with that i guess i'll leave it there i still got the stickers for juvenile styles if you want one hit me up in the comments or at me on

weather so much boys look at this i can't even see the mountains raining nothing but beaut beautiful weather man all right yo what is going on youtube welcome to another video by your boy sabi g guys so today we are going to be making some moon rocks yes you have sebby g's very own moon rocks i've seen so many people doing it i have like i'm like dude i've never actually done that luckily my girl gave me the idea and i'm gonna be doing that today but the only thing is i don't have buds so we have to go pick some up but before that i'm gonna be showing you guys what we're gonna be putting on the outside of our bud all right we got some fire today i got a lot of fire so to start off we got some crumble from left coast extracts this one's sitting at a total 88 cannabinoids and this is called jolly white crumble hopefully that's focused in and then that's gonna be the first one the second one we're to be putting on is train wreck batter sitting at a 80 thc right there and we also got the syringe right here gelato syringe so we could cover the outside with it but that's not even the best part guys that's not even the best part right i got literally this monstrosity right here left coast extracts diamonds and look at the thc percentage on that right 99 thc so sunday driver i'm literally amazed by this percentage this is legal compliance so you know this is legit and i'm literally i'm gonna get so blasted today dude i'm like not even ready so let's go out and i showed you guys this let's go out and go get some bud now all right boys so here we are to my all-time favorite dispenser you guys already know man strains over here in paris california so i'm about to show you guys real quick what i got i already got my [ __ ] i'm gonna show you guys real quick so it's a new strain that they just came out with apparently as they said it's called kobe 24 and the reason that's called kobe is because it's actually really really purple and orangey so you know that's representing the kobe colors so this is sitting at a 27 thc so i'm ready to go home and make some other moon rocks with this [ __ ] boys all right guys so we're back home and we got the flower right here like i said we got two eighths of the kobe number 24 sitting nice and pretty we're going to show you guys all the product pretty much starting off with the batter right your boy might have already picked off of it a little bit to take some dabs you know with some fire this is the batter train wreck one is the 99 thc diamonds from left coast extracts the sunday driver here you have the crumble this is the jolly white left coast extracts but not least you have the left coast extracts gelato syringe this right here boys can be dabbed or you could just put it straight into one of your pods here is the bud like i was telling you could see the or the purpleness and the orangeness and this thing's looks so freaking good i'm actually really happy that i was able to cup two ace instead of just one because i'm only going to use one nug for a moon rock you know so other than that i'm gonna be smoking big joints let me know if you want a strain review on this kobe 24 because it's pretty fire so i'm gonna choose this nugget right here to do the moon rock on because it just looks the most beautiful i mean look at the purpleness in this the hairs you can tell this one is going to be the most potent one out of the whole eighth right there so first things first you're going to want to grab your syringe all right boys so here's the bud and i'm just going to go ahead and drench this all in the gelato and just get it nice and moist this is about half a gram if anything more than half a gram so it should coat just about everything hopefully if not we do have some batter to you know make up for it but for the most part i think this is going to be perfect i feel like all you really need is a really really thin coat up top that way you can since i don't have any keep guys um i'm going to be putting the diamonds all right i'm going to be crushing up the diamonds and then coating the diamonds in that and once we're done with the diamonds we're just going to go ahead and cut top it with some batter and just make this thing super good i just realized that i was out that i was out of focus for a little bit but it's all good all right you see that look at that it looks literally looks like honey all over the freaking nug that's what i'm going to be doing is since the their oil literally left coast extracts to make some of the thickest oil i'm just gonna go ahead and just cover the nug with a little pick right here and just try to get all the little edges that it wasn't able to get with the syringe but for the most part as you guys can see right here it looks like it's getting covered almost all of it just missing a little bit right here at the end but this thing literally looks like it has a bunch of snot all over it bro it looks fire though i can't wait to really try this out so pretty much what i did right was just crush up all the 99 thc diamonds and try to get it as powdery as possible because since i don't have any keef it would be much better idea to top this off with a 99 thc isolate instead of you know just regular old dried up keef so what you're going to want to do boys is just grab your nug and literally just dip it dip it and it doesn't matter if you get some wax on this because whatever's left over in there you could literally just dab this right after and literally i'm just going to go ahead and try to cover as much as possible starting it's starting to come out as like you know you know what it is you know what it is all right i don't want to say what it is because we don't f with that on the channel but it's starting to look like something you know something that's not like bud but you know it is a moon rock after all trying to get it all up in there and literally looks like all right it literally looks like it's just straight up drenched at this point really trying to get it into every single crevice of this nug because oh my goodness this thing is going to get us into the moon boys we're literally this is our this is our spaceship to take us to mars all right and this is only the beginning oh my goodness this literally looks like a monster like literally like a monster booger i'm ready but we're gonna top this off i was gonna add some batter on top but i think i'm gonna add some of the crumble on top of this this crumble right here is literally just so potent i wish i wish youtube had like a smell-o-vision man i'm gonna try to crush some of this up and just put it on top of the nug we were able to smash down the crumble enough to where i could literally just pick it up with my hands and just apply it right onto the nug so this thing instead of it just being like one or two colors right or two pigment colors it literally looks like a huge bugger so you got your yellow right there you got your white you got your green you got your slime right this thing looks awful but we have to smoke it so you can see right there man we have our moon rock bro oh my goodness this is the first time i've ever made a moon rock and this thing actually looks super super fire alright so i have it loaded up right here on a in a bong and i'm gonna go ahead and put up a iphone close-up for you guys so you guys can really see how far the moon rock looks because i know with my camera you can't really get every single detail and crevice of the kush plant itself and it just feels like literally with all so much freaking diamonds and um crumble bro and it's just like it's just blowing my mind i'm kind of scared to see this is my first time ever making this and i think it's my first time ever trying a moon rock in a in a bong so i'm hoping this works man because it was literally so sticky guys you guys oh my gosh i honestly hope this tastes fine like i'm saying because literally we put 99 thc um diamonds on there we put what it was like a 86 percent crumble like a 86 gelato um distillate and the butt itself was 26 so that's literally well over 150 thc and um yeah guys i'm just ready about i'm just ready to take this bowl because i i've done enough talking so cheers to you guys i appreciate everyone who's tuned into this video if you've enjoyed it so far do me a favor and smash that like alright cheers it's still burning because of the wax oh yeah that tastes so freaking good dude it's stuck on the bowl right here that what whatever leftover wax was there but bro that was so much smoke i didn't literally you guys saw that bomb rip i blew it straight to your freaking face y'all got ronin out and this thing was literally so fire bro oh my goodness dude i'm gonna have to go ahead and load up another bomb [Music] dude literally every single time that i take a bong rip off of that with the moon rock it's just like i just feel like so it literally hits like gas bro it tastes like gas like literally like not not like gasoline but just like some super super fire and like all of that the freaking crumble the diamonds the distillate plus i feel like the kobe 24 strain is just so like plush and purple and i feel like the terpenes of the strain with the terps of the like you know the crumble and the distillate and stuff oh my goodness dude everything just literally just smacks you in the face i'm blown like literally i don't even know what to do anymore this is actually really really fun video though i must say i don't know if any of you guys have ever tried moon rocks let me know down in the comments below what your experience is but because my experience from with the fire stuff that i had i know originally it's supposed to be made with you know just whatever wax and then you cover it in keith but i feel like i took it to the next level with this one honestly because the distillate is just so far i put that one it was gelato distillate left coast extracts put that on top first layer that was the first layer the second layer was the 99 thc diamond from left coast extracts the sunday driver that was the second coating and then the third coating was the crumble bro the crumble oh my goodness that's literally three different layers of wax right there it was just literally just so fire like i keep saying man it hits it hits it just so well it's honestly i didn't put a whole bowl of the moon rock it was i put some kobe 24 and then i topped it off with a decent layer of the moon rock and i feel like that was literally the perfect combination because um you know this is something that i feel like oh it just fell on my shirt bro moon rock on the shirt yo all right so like i was saying though like i feel like something like this is just crazy i know people really dig stuff like this but me personally i don't really see myself doing this again but it's just like a one-time thing you know a one-time thing that i feel like maybe every stoner should do in their lifetime because this is actually pretty cool i'm not saying that it's like horrific and that's why i would never do it again it's just for me i would rather just dab it and just smoke the plant you know separately but this is definitely something that is new and i was like you know i've never actually tried real real moon rocks so making my own moon rocks here at home is definitely a good experience also and hopefully you guys really enjoyed the video just as much as i did because it was honestly a great video so with that being said guys i'm going to go ahead and end it out here get this video uploaded for you guys and if you enjoyed today's video do me a favor smash that like hit those comments and most importantly hit that subscribe button we're so close to 40k

and watch to the end for a chance to win a free prize also check out my website that be dead without Ohio canvass live.com enjoy the show [Music] what's up everybody employed mastermind here in Valhalla cannabis light and we have a very special review today this is the botanist has now put out products and they actually did a project with you guessed it would word make a fire rock and so now they've created a vape cartridge this basically fire rock or woodward flying cannabis flower or trim and they've used this to make TAC baked cartridges so here's some material that I received when I purchased my product and it says here the botanist babe Carter's art strain specific makes feature complex cannabinoid profile is crafted to unlock the natural benefits of the cannabis plant this is a targeted recipe our craft extraction techniques achieve a uniquely potent and truly flavorful product only one ingredient cannabis the botanist cartridge features a highly refined distillate based enhanced with a complex minor chemin of cannabinoids I can never say that right kind of annoys viana TC unlocking minor cannabinoids our distillate is refined using a proprietary post extraction process that captures beneficial minor cannabinoids that enhance the effect of the TC resulting in a smooth and highly potency product mmm purity no fillers or botanicals our base will never use any harsh fillers like vitamin E acetate or I like this one both technical terpenes I learned a lot about those recently our oil contains one ingredient cannabis okay this is single source terpenes stay true to distrain each botanist vape highlights the natural turf pain profile of its cannabis strengths our small batch extraction process gently recovers her opinions truly reflecting the plants full flavor profile in the finished product traceability know what you're buying our oil is made using ingredients that can be traced from sea to sail to ensure transparency testing results for our products are always available ok botanist and here's a close-up of the card now you can get this at the botanist I'm not sure if in a dispensaries had this yet this product costs fifty four dollars with tax in Columbus Ohio I purchased two products I purchased wedding cake cuz we've all heard of wedding cake right and I purchased the sunset sherbert we've all heard of that too also another great fire rock wood wood product so let's talk about the expects here the specifications the total THC on the wedding cake is three hundred and forty eight milligrams of THC 0 milligrams of CBD and then the other cabin noise it says CBG 11 milligrams this was manufactured on April 24th and packaged on May the fifth so this is literally just hit the market so you know today is May the 6th so this just got put in the box but it was also tested back on April 29 so it was also recently tested on the Box on the front it says 348 milligrams and it also indicates this is sixty nine point six two percent THC these are half gram cartridges so basically for $108 you'd have yourself a whole gram and you can obviously mix and mingle that and get a couple different ones now they also had another strain there which is by Buckeye relief called ninety two cookies I didn't try that one yet because I haven't tried to flour yet so once I tried to flower from Buckeye relief on a 90 cookies then I will try the cartridge so I can give you a review on that also one let you know that there are some other products that botanist will have these are the tinctures and that will be in a different video so we're not going to go too far into it now but I will tease that for you my car got a little wet you know how it be it happens when you're trying to wipe it down with with a wipe so you don't get any germs on it anyway so I have not opened these so imma let you guys get the same unboxing experience then I'm gonna have we're gonna experience this together and like I said I'm gonna hold this back so you get a little bit light on it but like I said I'm gonna turn this here and maybe we can see a little bit better and there's a little wood there on the box so there's a tab here and then there's also a seal there I don't know if you can see that on camera now but there is a seal there and so I'm gonna go ahead and open the one I want to open the one I've been rushing to open is the wedding cake so I'm cracking this seal baby doc at this crack with my nails and then I'm gonna I'm gonna pull out this little brown tab here I'm assuming that's what you're supposed to do so we're going to try this together folks and no-knock whoo-hoo now here's a surprise guys here is the cartridge interesting enough they have put a piece of styrofoam in there not sure I think that's just to stabilize it so that it doesn't get moved around I think that's good to keep it from being disoriented up close I could show you check it out now there is a washer on here which a lot of you familiar what this is for a different type of battery that has a magnetic mechanism on it so I'll show that again and then obviously this just screws off okay now it's just a regular 510 thread many of you asking me about that this is it guys this is a cartridge only product surprise no battery oh my gosh how are we going to hit this thing so we have a couple of different options first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to try to use a battery that came with the Cure Ohio cartridge for comparison here's a cure Ohio oil half a gram and here is the botanist Woodward oil obviously there is a color difference don't let that concern you oops good thing I didn't break that would be all that so many of you know the cure Ohio battery is reusable so I'm just going to screw this on here and we're gonna find out if the wool it's a work for us so here we go wedding cake by Woodward processed by botanist and here we go it does work impressions this is smooth it is not harsh I can taste a little bit of wedding cake but not a whole lot so I like the packaging I think it's smart to have a little styrofoam in there to keep it stabilized so it doesn't fall around in there and maybe get turned upside down the package is designed to hold it so that it doesn't have anything going on with it as far as its orientation I mean there are a few little bubbles in here but honestly folks that's not uncommon with vape oils especially when they're loading them hot so there could be able to few little bubbles I am but it is a very smooth bait but I'm looking at terpene taste and flavors I'm not really tasting any wedding cake terpenes that I'm familiar with and you know just for reference I currently have some wood wood wedding cake folks so I'm sure I'm not tasting turps on this so we've went through that one and you know I don't smell in terms either but what I could also do is I could put this on an aftermarket battery just to be sure and see if we get any difference because those batteries are pre-configured at a certain voltage and I've learned that sometimes having something at a different voltage will affect your experience in your taste so I have to set at three point five volts it's still very smooth it is a very smooth like this doesn't hurt your throat this is very smooth but I just don't really taste anything so I'm set that aside for right now this is a vision to spin our battery by the ladies man these are like tanks the next one we're gonna go ahead sunset server so I again box is the same same packaging specs comparing it to the Woodward let's see the total TAC for the sunset server is 346 milligram point 95 346 point nine five milligrams and also the CBG is 11 milligrams I will talk more about what CVG is comparing to CBD in a later video so or you can just you know look it up we'll talk about CVG and CBN as well okay this one package exactly the same way the oil quality is the same a nice clear gold color and I'm gonna do the same test I'm gonna put it on the trusty cure Ohio battery but you before I do that OPSEC removed a little magnetic adapter which comes in handy if you have one of those devices that has a magnetic battery and I go guys now lift the sunset server I taste I taste it I can taste a little bit more Terps terpenes with the sunset server it reminds me of the flower so I would say both of them hit smooth I would say there's even maybe a little bit more I mean this again maybe a little bit more of a bite then with the wedding cake feel a tickling my throat a little bit but is it art trying to sit on this and hit this all day probably so yeah I'm gonna do the same thing before I'm gonna swap it with my vision here and I'm gonna see how it tastes with the vision like I said and I've got the vision at the lowest voltage was 3.5 volts if you want to know I have no idea what the state has their batteries and hopefully set could be higher could be less we'll have to find out so here we go okay did we get our malfunction well that's interesting guys it's not working so let me try to turn yourself and this is a fully charged battery so let's see okay there we go interesting I had to turn my battery off and turn it back on all right so it's been a couple minutes and let's talk about effects so what did I notice because I'm familiar with both of both of these strains personally overall I don't have any immediate psychoactive I'm not overwhelmingly getting a head rush type feeling which is good I don't want something that's just gonna take my head off and make me feel like I'm getting ready to have a headache so I want a balanced effect not looking to just be you know out of my comfort zone I want something that makes me feel comfortable when I I'm very picky about fake cards and if you know me and watching other videos how many babe card videos have you seen so I don't do very many so whenever I do do one is because I want to find out if things are improving or if I'm gonna learn something about it and so other bait cars that I've tried I don't quite remember them having the CBG in it and so I need to do some more research about CBG before I start trying to tell you about CPG so I'm gonna do some homework on that and when I come back with a 92 cookies fake card that's when I'm gonna have a little bit more information about the CBT other than what I currently know now which is what it says on Wikipedia so I want to know some more about it and I want to have some more experience with this product that way I can tell you a little bit more details about what I'm feeling overall over time but immediately this definitely helps me with a little bit of my anxiety and this is actually a little bit relaxing to me and that's what I'm starting to feel as this video goes on normally I will take a break and come back but the effects are more immediate with this cartridge so there's no need for me to take a break and come back I'm already feeling some positive effects of the product so what I think the feedback will be is that the packaging is great I'm very satisfied with the packaging I think this is just big enough I like the slide out factor you just have to get used to pulling this brown part out to slide it out I think that was smart I think putting a little piece of styrofoam in there was a smart idea guys so if you guys have the botanist owners of the botanist if you're watching this I think you did a good job with your packaging the only concern I might have is that if we have a lot of these stacked up like this depending on where they are in a dispensary that the oil is gonna lay down and then you know I guess we need to find out it's getting this box stand on its own and I don't think that it can and so what I'm thinking is well let's see yes it can't stand us home so part of with for me I keep all my oil Carter just a nice write up so you know the easiest thing you could do you know is take maybe one of your other containers and just take your battery and set them in there and this is an easy way for people to keep your cartridges from being like you know all weird-looking when you pick them up never let your cartridge be stored laying down sleeping so I think botanist is showing me right here as I'm moving them around on my desk that this cartridge box can stand up on its own and so it's a product good idea when you're not using the cartridge maybe keep it stored in a box standing up near where it's not gonna have a lot of activity you know I'm a bum push it up against my desk I'm hitting my desk and the cartridge does not fall that the box is not falling over and so you you're doing better than I thought bottom this with the box I mean because size and dimension matters when you're trying to have something stored and something convenient so the box is standing on its own even though it's empty I have a good thought that it will probably do the same thing even if we put the cartridge in there so my opinion I think this is a good product for you to try if you're a person that likes bait cartridges if you are someone that is looking for a lot of flavors I think there's still some room to roll I think that they should work on adding a little bit more terpenes I want to really get that cake flavor when I hit the cartridge but at the same time I'm very satisfied with the effects of how I feel the house affecting my middle and I'm glad that is not overwhelming me or causing me to feel like I am just so impaired that I can't speak properly and I'm glad that is helping me with my anxiety and also with a little bit of focus and concentration so with that saying I'm gonna recommend that you do try these products and give them your honest review and your honest opinion and you can also send in your reviews to me at Ohio cannabis live at gmail.com or you can send me your videos through the messenger and I will happily share any videos or be glad to do an interview with you / zoom or Skype or messenger so that we can have an honest discussion about how you feel about this product because that's gonna be the new thing now as we're gonna start doing things together since we're all at home or on limited restrictions in some cases we have to start doing more stuff to interact with each other instead of just watching videos on videos are great but just the one sided video can get kind of boring so going forward we're gonna try to have some interaction and have some more people in these videos besides just me and I want to hear what other people's feedback is it's not all about just my feedback but your feedback matters too and that's why I added the feedback section on my website wlky.com and you can go there and give some growers some feedback and let them know how you really feel and I think that's important for the companies to grow so make sure that that like subscribe button I'm gonna go ahead and wrap this video and we'll see you again next time [Music] [Music]", "gdkk4DoPg2Q":

up guys today we're going to show you how to make thc infused oil we used about 19 different pucks from 3.5 and 7 gram bags first let's add 50 milliliters of mct oil to our beaker throw it on your hot plate and turn it up to 120 degrees fahrenheit you're gonna want to let your pucks cook for about five minutes to seven minutes at most extract each puck individually and strain it by squeezing it to release any of the liquid that could be trapped inside you're going to want to repeat these steps until you run out of pucks [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] next we're gonna start the d card process turn your plate up to 240 degrees fahrenheit you're going to want to continue cooking your oil until you don't see any more bubbles rise up to the top don't panic if your oil darkens it just means that the d card process is working for our final step take a nug smasher 37 micron bag and strain your oil through the bag and into a clean beaker [Music] drop a comment below and let us know what you're going to make with your infused mct oil hey guys make sure you check us out at nugsmasher.com to check out all of our awesome products we also have tons of great information on our

no good I'm sorry to tell you that's not the case at all color remediation has given us the ability to further refine our extracts and that's that's nothing but but reason for joy however it does not need to be completely refined to this point to be enjoyable and unfortunately in a lot of cases people that are refining it to this point are robbing the plant of some of its natural essence shout-out to Murphy Murray dread pirate and I'm sure many others but those are the only two I could think of off the top of my head the shout out to the processors out there that are that are doing this crc thing and and truly they understand ads or banned chromatography and they understand that this is this isn't bleaching and when done properly the Terps are even louder there's nothing to to get in the way of them your percentage is skyrocket there's so much less plant matter to be in the way of your terpene to cannabinoid ratio and then how much of the hundred percent that makes up so CRC is an absolutely wonderful thing it's the the natural step for evolution as far as cannabis extracts go but I guess just buyer beware you know it could could be the best stuff you've ever tried and it could also end up melting kind of dark and leaving very very interesting colors this is pretty clean no but sometimes you'll notice some very very dark reclaim and you're smoking white clear shatter or almost white clear shatter but it's but it creates dark dark reclaim and of course when it melts it melts dark this stuff as as you can imagine when it melts it should look almost like water and that here if you see pigment appear during the meltdown then obviously the anthocyanin chlorophyll plant matter filtration wasn't successful it was clearly still plant matter there and even if your melt is okay but you think well a little more color than I thought they would be but but it still looks great that's that's not bad so check your reclaim if you reclaim start showing up dark like dark reclaim look like the kind of reclaim that shows up in your rig when you're taking dabs every flame it looks like that you're smoking on some polished hurts if it melts like this and you know you got yourself some fire so once again shout out to Mary Mary the whole team over at Santo Gardens and dread pirate shout out the future 4200 for all the information and all the love that he puts out into the community and I guess to that to that extent shout out to the entire good life gang but as I mentioned your CRC oil should melt and or vaporize and/or reclaim as follows okay guys probably should have saved you on some heat up time there but what can I say I'm not a filmmaker so let's use the heat up time some shut up 7:10 Montana shout-out to you guys we're having some fire clear BHO some some properly CRC material and shout out to the 710 extractions that's me we're making all this solvent that's fire that it's just just shattering the analytics and then of course tighten that shut up dude Glaser highly educated Gordo's scientific and of course mr. Connor still don't know what this is well of course you do it's a thermometer to very very accurately take the temperature of my quotes and if you're watching this on Instagram I'm sure you know it is right now if you don't know what it is congratulations somehow you've hidden from most of Instagram for a couple months anyway if you're on YouTube that's very possible this would be the first time you're seeing it and no this is not a dabber or anything even though there is a diving attachment for it I personally like to leave it on or not threaded in so that I can stand my Yosi so there we go we're green 5 85 86 so we got a couple seconds I like to leave the dab robbed of it because I like to stand it up in that little 3d image 3d prints damn this is what your clear should melt like ladies and gentlemen I hope you all are having a great week great weekend and a great start to year no chirps left behind hmm oh I see why you call that grape soda okay god [Music] right okay so before we get in here do any swabbing or anything like that let's take a look at what we're left with okay a half ounce of weed yeah that's all right and oh thank you tripod you did a great job of holding that phone still no look should be at least at least one little spot of reclaim sorry guys can you see it it's not reflection there it is look at the color of that very reminiscent of hash when it's being freshly made that color if it's a very very dark reclaim let's go right here on the front there's almost always something just underneath it now it's not another good sign is that it doesn't very heavily reclaims a bunch of your oil is we condensating and turning into reclaim in here I'm by that I mean it seems like you're creating more reclaim than you normally do then obviously we have a color up job they did not technically refine or filter anything they just lightened up the coloring particulates in plant matter and things like that things other than the cannabinoids and the terpenes reclaim a little faster and they reclaimed very ugly very dark not like a very very light sandy here so ladies and gentlemen hope you're out there enjoying all your crc clear clear clear clear if it's not white it ain't right or some dumb [ __ ] sounds racist this [ __ ] if you ask me but anyway um for those of you out there you know banging on your clear and being all hype man about it sweet I'm with you I'm glad you're excited about your missing make sure it's truly clean now because some of us actually know what's up by some of us I mean many of us know what's up so don't be the hype man for some clear that reclaims dark with it melts down dark that's just polished turd hope you all having a great day didn't really have any more of a reason to make a post than other Jin really just to share this clear shadow with you and my my thoughts as a chemist behind it and then of course I wanted the opportunity to shout out the people that in my opinion are doing this process properly Brent you know who you are 710 Montana you know I love you guys and specifically or more a little more a little more notably Murphy Murray and the entire Santo garden team which to be honest with you they of course they don't make shatter they make fine fine live resin sauce and THC a so they wouldn't even produce a product like this but if they did make shatter I bet in Murphy's would be even more clear just know hate 7/10 I just I gotta say it she's good and and dread we don't really know each other or anything but I've seen your work and I'm always impressed so I'm very confident that that I'm shouting out to of the right people and again I think a lot of us would be either a little bit further behind or maybe even worse maybe have some information that we paid four-oh if it wasn't for the likes of future 4200 so to wrap this baby up shut up future 4200 shout out dread pirate and shout out Murphy Mary and the whole team down at Santo Gardens alright guys just because it's clear doesn't mean it wins the prize peace", "l2MttSiE5q0": "you know what is up YouTube with your boy bacon today today I just wanted to show you guys this is the rosin that you guys keep seeing I think is really dark granted this is not like [ __ ] white cake batter rosin this is definitely a little bit more amber but I don't harvest my stuff a week or two early like a lot of people to get that super clear [ __ ] also that's like 30 grams 40 grams of rosin so you got to understand when you pull out a single gram it looks a little bit different so I just wanted to show you guys here's what it actually looks like when you take a single gram by itself so if you guys still think this is too dark for you then I don't know what to tell you but you apparently never seen extracts and large quantities before and know what it looks like when it pulls up it gets darker wherever there's a lot of it so that's it I just want to show you guys that real quick and yeah peace out", "oSB425ePaAM": "this is pinkish by San rafeal 71 this is the brand new VAP cartridge from San Rafael that has recently been made available in Canada with the THC percentage at seventy three point three eight and CBD of 0.07% this indica dominant strain is an alternative to their flower and capsule cannabis products this product was packaged on October 21st 2019 after taking one three-second inhale of this product you will be instantly greeted with the effects which are incredibly similar to the strains organic counterpart the taste is amazing for a liquid vape which is one of the reasons that you will pay a premium for this product in the first 10 minutes you'll feel lightness to your body and a slight head high afterwards a heavy body high will take over and you will be relaxed and happy while you spend the evening with a smile on your face all those five 10 vape cartridge is on the expensive side the taste and quality can help justify the cost enjoy you [Music]", "74HJydMO_jI":

strange review here for you guys so this is some mint some cushmits never had cushman so this would be cushman's this is some top shelf stuff has got this morning uh not to mention i got a few others that i will be sharing with you guys over the next week as i know the drill but yeah we got cushman's this is two grams here at cushman's we're just gonna grind up enough for one bowl basically but yeah here it is guys so yeah we're gonna do this right now then i mean it looks beautiful look at these knobs man i think i might take one of these big nubs may i'll do a couple of these big nubs in the grinder probably and then i'll save the rest of those for teresa for my girl when she comes over you know what i mean so she's gonna want to take some home with her obviously so but yeah guys so yeah this is it man some cushmits hey what's up guys all right so we're back before we're back with the review now so i just grinded up that weed i showed you guys earlier so one thing i forgot to mention and it slid my mind i'm trying my best to like get more description of the strains i get i don't know no one's really commented about it no one's really brought up my attention but i feel like it's not really much of a review if uh you know if i if i'm not if i'm not giving you guys more information so so basically what this is guys this is cush mints okay and what is it a hybrid okay it's a hybrid it's a cross it's actually a cross strain uh it's between um animal cookies and mints okay so that's where you get they have cushions from okay so either way it's two good strains well we're gonna be we're gonna be jumping into this so actually i take that back it's not it's not mint it's ammo cookies and bubba kush so it's a straight it's basically a hybrid for a cross between both those strands okay it's a hybrid so you're gonna get best of both worlds which means you're gonna get an indica and a sativa uh roll into one so it's kind of cool so if you're like an indica person only then then you know then this may not be a straight for you but you're a kind of person that wants to still be active and doesn't want to be locked into a couch or locked into a [ __ ] bed we can't even [ __ ] move because you're so [ __ ] high like that's that's the indica okay that's when that's when you want to be at home that's when you want to be at home you want to be going to bed it's usually for people that can't sleep at night those are ones that you really really need the strong indicas if you want hybrid then they got the best of both worlds you're at the full body high with the head high you feel me so it's kind of cool so either way though guys we got right here ready to go cheers dink it i'm just kidding it was all right cheers guys okay that does taste pretty good i don't know i read about it online guys it said it took it takes like um it's like it's supposed to taste like mints like you're gonna taste like a mint flavor to it i kind of tasted it this cement a little bit so yep all right cheers guys cheers oh man it's not bad it tastes pretty good actually it tastes really good let's do one more hit cheers ah oh man hey what's up guys so you guys a little update here um i'm not even through the pull ball yet and uh i'm feeling [ __ ] sleepy believe it or not this shit's like kind of knocking me on my ass a little bit i'm trying not to so i don't like sleeping during the daytime you feel me so yeah um yeah i'm sitting here like watching this video and i'm like kind of dozing off on the video loki like i kind of like nodded off a couple times already and i was like wow what the [ __ ] is happening i'm like really i'm really tired almost like it's like hitting me like like it wants me like like it's putting me asleep basically you know what i mean like i don't know explain it man i'm [ __ ] very loopy right now i don't like it i don't like being loopy you know i mean i like to you know i like to so now i can't even talk anyways but so yeah so so i told you guys earlier it's a hybrid this is an indica and a sativa so let's just say that like so now we know that more the indica site comes through on the straight okay so keep that in mind okay so when you guys get the strain make sure y'all make sure y'all keep this in mind that it's gonna be more on the indica side the sativa side okay which means you're gonna be more loopier and just more like tired so if you're getting it to sleep at night it's perfect but if you're getting it to function throughout the day time then i will not go the strength quite possibly i don't know this is just just perceived your own caution i guess you could say i don't know whatever all right i'll be i'm gonna get back to my show a lot of you guys get back to whatever you're all doing i'll see you guys next part of the review all right hey what's up guys all right so i'm back so i'm just gonna close out the review now um so yes i've been high for a while i'm still pretty high right now of that uh mint cookies or sorry mint kush or kush kush bits or whatever i write cushman's i don't even know where is that yeah cushman's okay i had to look at my label cushman's yeah see i forgot what they were anyways guys i am pretty [ __ ] up right now i'm very very high um i did falsely for a little bit there earlier i never fall asleep but i did i did feel pretty sleepy bullet there so just so just just keep that in mind you guys that like you may make you a little tired all that stuff so make sure you're doing something make sure you're busy like right now i'll be leaving for my buddy's place here pretty soon so should we go i'm gonna take a little bit for the road though too but i'm just gonna pack it when i get to his house probably so yeah um other than that i mean that's about it yes either way uh i get this i do i give this uh i give this weed uh 10 10 out of 10 uh very very good very very good stuff um so just so you guys already know it's a hybrid strain so you're gonna get both indica and sativa effects here but it's gonna be more it is more higher on the indica side than the sativa side just keep that in mind when you get this straight okay so all right guys

times fast here with uh michael the aging ant miggy 420 with cannabis legalization news and myself josh the talking hedge so we are here we're gonna uh review um do a product review for a dab it's called aggro couture which i either really really like that name or i absolutely hate it it depends on if it's a joke or not like if they're aggro couture and they're making fun of louis vuitton's logo i love this company if they're real and they think they're bougie and they think that they're pretentious then i absolutely hate this company though real quick just to throw those out there they're not super bougie bro they're not they're aggro mechanics this is their fancy line uh well if you're being serious with that then i think that's really funny i think it's a joke uh because you know you try to do some bougie uh anyways let's get into it we're not there yet let's get into it first off um we're going to look at seven criteria judge this just like we do all of our products we're gonna look at seven things number one we're gonna judge on appearance uh that's a scale of zero to one we're gonna look at aroma and taste we're gonna look at strength and effect we're gonna look at cure quality and care and then brand and packaging all coming up within uh within the chronic club so look at that that's like a honey you know like at the very bottom of like that organic honey you got to scoop it out with like a spoon very kind of honey consistency um right off the bat so what yeah let's let's start with the appearance here i'm gonna break this open is a one gram live resin citrus pez from um agro mechanics it's a sativa smells smells you know kind of like citrus maybe a citrus candy like a pez candy citrus good good comparison um but not like a real like real citrus uh so we'll see how that that works i don't like botanical terpenes they hit my throat makes it real scratchy cough so we'll see how this hits um again it's like a sugary consistency the um the look to it if you put my screen up i will oh thank you perfect there we go nice picture michael thank you yeah some little dab porn on that i got a few more we can go through sexy yeah good call thanks for taking those photos so yeah that's really sugary crystally um what is what type of concentrate would would you guys call this i think it's like a sugar um but is there like a term like is this a different kind of variety of concentrate well like are you talking like like what did you call a shatter hell no no yeah it's definitely not a shatter right yeah so this would be uh along the lines of terp diamonds in my classification but it's a little bit too waxy honey honey comey to really be diamonds because they're really small i mean if i was marketing this as like it's style right i would probably go about calling this like terp honey or something like you did or or maybe even like terp sugar but it's a little bit thicker than that too well the glistening it just reminds me of the diamonds like in their branding uh you know they have a diamond on there but this is a huge opportunity to take up the whole wall street thing with like the diamond hands like if you're gonna like look i would sell those diamonds or you know apes holding diamonds or something i think that's a perfect opportunity to take something and and uh and pivot it right so like this is not cannabis isn't necessarily bougie right so you're trying to sell something that looks like louis vuitton calling it couture i think that's hilarious so take that somebody actually take it and run with it who's not trying to be serious like these guys and do something like the wall street bets diamond hands and run with that i think that would be super funny this you're like you're not gonna no one's gonna see this and be like oh i relate to this louis vuitton looking like get out of here with that so real people don't but there's a lot of people who are like you know there there's a lot of people who are consuming cannabis in the market space right now because it is a thing that you can do and there are a lot of people who live on clout i just want you guys to like like here's clout that's the gucci dab mat that i have fucked the fuck up dude yeah real real too like real real gucci dude uh steve lee steve lee got a stack of these they were actually mouse pads and they're highly collectible and really freaking expensive and i wasn't supposed to like spill dabs all over it but like i'm like okay cool i'm gonna use it sure so i'm not gonna keep it pristine because it's gucci but part of that cloud i get it i get it they're looking for the high-end brand on the looks i mean it is a really nice looking product um it's it's pretty pretty good consistency and i mean it's got some some like you know stick to it it's just kind of hanging out in the jar there it's not moving around much the terps are definitely definitely like present and you can see it with like miggy you said that glisten just makes you want to get up in there right yeah i mean i was able to hold it for at least 10 seconds before it started crumbling on me like i had it up there in a whole piece and then i started crumbling because of the sugary texture and i was like oh shit gotta put it back in the thing so i can uh scoop it up but i mean it smells good it smells and just the little bits that are left over like on my hands when i was interacting with it one thing that was interesting it was almost like sand right like it's just if you go check those little bits that started to crumble it's got really density to it so you know it's kind of a kind of an interesting little layer there where it's at not quite diamond stage past the sugaring you know doing all the the interesting texture stuff i dig it i want to smoke this so let's let's do the um let's let's uh what's it called score it is it is this going to be um a 1 or are you guys going to give this a fractional little point for appearance how are you guys feeling on what it looks like i'm going to give it a full point i thought it was nice and bright and orangey um i thought the appearance looked really nice i thought the um packing we won't get there yet but everything else looked good yeah solid one totally yeah i'll give him a full point on the on the appearance here too all right um so what about uh i'm gonna mute him real quick [Laughter] what about the uh the smell or aroma um i smelled some you know pezzy like candy type of um smell to it um so it wasn't like a full citrus but it did smell good i'll give it three quarters of a point um i'd like to see what it actually tastes like we'll get to that uh next uh on taste but first up aroma i'll give them three quarters of a point for aroma what about you michael you know i'm getting um a little bit of sweetness and to me it's coming across more like almost like that hashy sweetness on a really high thc flour so it's got like you know basic kind of a clear thc-ish aroma to me like that's the sweetness i'm getting i don't catch a lot of fruit flavors or anything out of it it is pez which is uh you know kind of uh i i'm not sh i'm pretty sure pez is a descendant out of the uh the hash plant family um there's a couple more fruity stuff but yeah i mean i'm about like you know halfway through i'll give him a half a point on the aroma there's nothing really punching me in the mouth here or the nose what's the difference between live resin and live rosin rosin is heat and pressure live resin is a type of marketing that is uh should mean that the plant was processed freshly fresh fresh that they chopped it down it probably flash froze it right because uh it's better to process it when it's been frozen and then grind it up and process that plant so live resin it hasn't had a chance to die and it hasn't been cured before being processed okay ideally i mean i'm not a huge concentrate person i'll have to give it a full point just because i did smell that citrusy i mean smells terpene to me all right different things come across differently so um as we dab this we're gonna taste it that's next up on our uh seven criteria for um you know a successful dab or whatever we're calling this so what um when you guys hit this tell me also what apparatus you're using um i guess uh i'll go ahead and start i'll show you what what i got down here so this is the vape exhale so um we've got the the glass part here this is a glass filter that fits on top of here like so um so i'm going to go ahead and put some concentrate all up into here drop it in let that warm up a little bit and then i can either use this piece to put on top and then hit that but you know we kind of like the little glass i wish i had a little an electronic piece but uh wait for this to cool down uh just you know good old dab rig gabby good old dabby so yeah i think it's cool now i'm about to hit it my fucking prep just dropped so about to drop load it again i'll pick you up later guys hey don't mind me i'm just going to be behind a little bit on the dabbing because honestly i wasn't certain we were going to live at these but i did have one earlier and it definitely was a dab um it was concentrating and i am dabbing mine on a little small sized chamber glass bang rig with a decent-sized banger on it oh so michael you're the professional on this one uh hot dabs cold dabs for a live rosin press i waited till this got a little colder like it was first firing red hot and then i let it chill it's about 10-15 seconds and then it's it's hitting like a goddamn champ um generally glass if it's got quartz on it i'm i'm getting it hot for about 30 to 45 seconds till the bottom is all glowy right and then usually let it sit from anywhere from like 40 seconds to a minute depending on the glass i like them a little bit low but i'm not gonna lie like twice or three times a week i take a freaking pretty hot dab like 30 40 seconds to cool down and just take a big old hot dab that's what i'm going to do right now i'm actually going to wreck myself for you guys nice do it do it do it right right this is so cool hey you know i tried not this was my first smoke of the day actually kind of sort of because i had some uh i found this in the store yesterday chicha stash nice yeah and then uh i'm actually happy that it wasn't horrible like i was like oh please please please please please don't be bad i would like to be i actually tried to get some um keef i wanted to review tommy or uh yeah tommy chong's keefe not to be confused with chong's choice because apparently that doesn't exist anymore no yeah no they don't it didn't go very well same guy is marketing it though like that's just a guy marketing and branding dude that's it well you know it calls them too because i mean this celebrity shit is just that's what it is celebrity shit i mean all they're throwing is their name on it i would think you would have a qa person somebody quality like the guy who's doing uh chicha stash used to do really preserve and they had really good quality so uh i think they're doing pretty good i'm just happy that you know what one of my childhood heroes did fucking guys real quick it's going to be you know fairly large size and then i'll let you know how it tastes to me right on hey michael when you get a second share those pictures again leave that up and then i'll just be able to take it up and take it off for a reminder we are looking at aggro couture they've got to concentrate it's a sativa live resin and um so taste i'm gonna give it three quarters um i didn't taste really any uh citrus in there it wasn't bad my throat is a little bit a little bit coated so i don't know what that is it kind of my throat doesn't like it so i don't know if it's a solvent that's in there or um it's resin it's plant resin and we're going to get to that in just a second well so live resin i love that like my vapes are predominantly live resin from avatars and that's my go-to live resin is a marketing term okay live resin like i said it means they they claim excuse me to have chopped it live processed it fresh or at least without you know curing but um you know almost all cannabis is done that way these days and um what what live resin really is and what it's marketed as are usually two different things and here's why i say that so um didn't really have a ton of flavor right guys like we totally expected a little bit more than that i'm giving it like a 0.25 points on flavor but here's what's up from the minute i saw this i knew this had gone through crc color remediation this color cannabis that is this consistent right and at the price point you got it at which i'm guessing uh hey what's up michael willett um thanks for joining us tell your friends but this kind of cannabis uh hopefully the train's not killing me here is gotta be gone through a color remediation process which basically means oh you just beat yourself brother yeah i did i just got a call from my brain i'll feel you so so it's just another part of the processing process right this is why i don't think it can be live resin because the idea of live resin is it just goes in as the plant and comes out with what it's got but this clearly went through a crc which is another filtration level right so it's usually like diatomaceous earth and activated carbon that's in the actual like processing chamber and it pulls all the colors and gunk out so essentially this started out as boo-boo and that's why it kind of tastes like i'm not so when i pulled this out yesterday and i smelled it and i looked at it yesterday it was much more orange the color seems to have oxidized and it's now a lot more um sandy color than orangey so it's lost color overnight um and i didn't i was wondering like did i leave it outside did it freeze did it you know was there a chemical like change but i think it's just from oxygen it's very pale mine's very pale here in the camera and if you just switch to my shared screen it's got that golden orange color and i actually noted that as well it was much orangier um and hell there's the purple you can see how purple it is right behind me um yeah i i think that this went through color remediation probably got packaged close to hot which is also why it kind of sticks a bit but yeah a quarter of a point on the taste that's my thing i'll go on a three-day rant on crc what um what did you pay for this um so i think this was normally 30 a gram and i got a good i thought i felt like i got a good deal with st patrick's day so i got 30 off and so i paid 21 a gram that's probably what it should be so and look at it and look at it though like it's good weed there's no no i'm not saying it's not a good dab but it doesn't match the color it doesn't have the flavor because of the crc i'm getting high so we'll give the effect in a minute but yeah i wish it tasted like weed but again you know they set the expectation with this quarter bullshit right like like you don't have a fucking ahead of ourselves that's branding oh yeah but i mean like the expectation when you go over the taste with the terps and everything like you know uh anything that you put out if you want to say this is my high-end shit you want to make it beat your high-end shit if they're they're re-processing yeah right i mean whatever how's the taste though miggy what would you give that a one out of a you know zero out of one i gave it uh a half um i felt like there was some really good taste in on the front notes and then it just it just went away and then you're kind of left with this a sappy resiny kind of on my tongue on my throat i feel the resin i don't get that off a vape pen um but i also don't rip as much as i just dab so there's that i've got it too i'm over clumped from it yeah well there is something that they were talking about josh it's in my my tongue where you're like like it's like my tongue got coated with some paraffin wax so and and to clarify what i said about resin not like live resin which is the processing these are just phytochemicals these are plant materials that came along with it which kind of you know re-reinforces that this was poop before it looked like this this was poopoo and they had a lot of plant chemicals in which probably means it was double processed which also takes away from the fact of it being a possible for it being a live resin now the other side of that maybe those phytochemicals are there because it's a live resin it's got a low flavor profile in the plant but i haven't seen a lot of that and i've seen a lot of fucking dabs so before we move on to strength and effect what's uh what's your take on taste miggy gonna go with the half point uh michael willit from ohio he's commenting that he never had a good dab but he has baby lungs because every time he tries to smoke a concentrate many times he coughs his head off right that's kind of fucking what happens with everybody bro like clearly that's that that's part of it um dabs do that i'm over here coughing and i'm a professional but temperature also has a big impact yeah we were talking about actually right before you jumped into our live here anybody else out there you definitely want to heat a banger up or even if you're vaping it's slightly different if it's out of the machine but if you're using a glass or titanium banger heat it up let it cool down a little bit titanium much less so but quartz or glass you want to let it sit for a little bit get it cool change your dabbing style let that shit sit and it's not gonna feel as like i took a dab of cannabis in your lungs but you can let it get really low and just pull softly and get little tiny bits of vapor out of a good dab and it's a whole different experience you don't cough as much terpenes are more present than cannabinoids maybe not as much um and it feels differently in the lungs but a lot of people swear by like ultra ultra low temp dabs i feel this pain though because like when when debbie was the thing in washington during medical days uh you know i'd be like i'd do a dab at a thing pay two bucks at the dab lounge whatever cough my head off and fucking good in the car and go but that's why eventually i started going into the pens because i mean it concentrates just about how you consume it like any concentrate it's like orange juice like either you're gonna have the whole orange or you can just have pure the beer good shit you know whatever that plant is like the rocks also burn off so quick you know like three four hundred degrees so maybe when you were dialing that temperature all the way up you're burning all of that off um so eventually we'll we'll uh we'll figure out a better vote excuse now that now there's open research on terpenes i was just reading about this uh in a paper um it looks like terpenes may begin the evaporation process ultra low low temperature like 140 fahrenheit and actually go through the evaporation to you know fully being sublimated process all the way up to several hundred degrees which is like a low low temp dab you get all them terps in because they're nice and low they just start getting in you it's not pouring down your face if it's the right kind you know oh my god dude i feel that now like i'm coughing like right now like even after you have the dab sometimes you know like you're just like you're just sitting there trying to breathe at the same time i guess i'm still trying to get some smoke out or something like if i take a really really big dab i'm not gonna lie man i'm gonna sit there for like 15 minutes i'm okay and then suddenly it hits me and i won't stop coughing for like 20 minutes it'll just hit me fucking crying so that's a good transition how was the effect that's the next thing on this list here strength and effect um you know i did hit this earlier and so being a sativa even though we all kind of hate that that term uh because it's more about the terpenes and really less about you know sativa indica um i say it was a really good um you know we'll call cultivar strain whatever that gave me kind of a creative uh sativa daytime not great if you're trying to focus if you're trying to work but you know good if you want to dive into a spreadsheet or some kind of artistic um you know thing whatever you're doing um i just know that it reminded me of you know my mom adhd running around trying to do something and not being able to concentrate on any of it so as much as i love my mom there is a time and place for this um i would just have to make sure that it wasn't when i need to actually get something done yeah i mean like you know weeds good for like the body high too right like to make you feel better and i'm gonna probably today uh i do have some work to do but it's gonna be like physical i'm gonna move about 300 pound boxes inside of a building so yeah i mean you don't have to think too much and then i can just be like mr robot like my body but still right now first though i got that overwhelming just like all right first i'm just going to sit down for a little bit and maybe play a game or two before you be productive like you know i want to pop off first so yeah i'm feeling it i'll give it a full point full point for uh for strength all right uh michael how about yourself yeah i had some of this earlier today and um i i dig it i dig its effect it is a little bit of adhd but you know i jump on that stuff and and uh ride it so um i'm i'm always looking for something that's you know smokeable tastes pretty good look at these uh we'll be getting there on strength though but this is also i guess 79.2 cannabinoids it doesn't have a lot of uh thc and the high thca here's all the reason for the strength of it is that thca can like turn into other cannabinoids and i think thcv is what we're both getting out of this that whole like scatter brain get stuff done look over here look over there that's usually the cannabinoid that's that's like devolving and getting you that feel and i had crazy munchies though thcv is supposed to be an anti-munchie and i i had a crazy sugar dragon after i ripped that i was like where's the sugar and i was like all right chill out i realize what's going on yeah yes it felt like a thcv kind of effect for me and i'm just i actually you know i organized a bunch of stuff and i was like fuck a green screen i'm gonna put stuff behind me and you know like yeah so cool i'm gonna try i made a decision i want to be a little bit rougher on these so i'm trying for uh not to give everybody a full point on things that they don't fully deserve but i think this one's getting a full point for effect and strength for me yeah you know i was gonna give him like three quarters or or something around there but i think for if you know what you're getting if you're looking for a daytime that gives you a creative um you know behind the eyes kind of hits you it hits you hard um almo almost like an indica effect but but you know daytime energetic you know still gives you that that uplifting effect i think if that's what you're looking for then this is great and it doesn't have to be 90 whatever it's in the 70 you know 74 whatever it is 79 total cannabinoids um i think it's good if that's what you're looking for that's what you want you want to dive into some art project whatever or you are even like yeah you want to just like get in your own mind you know miggy as you're doing some yard work i think this is it so i'm giving it a full point myself for a strength and effect because if that's what you're looking for um i think it definitely does the job what about cure i know we say this every time is that an appropriate category and if so let's move forward all that shit i said about crc insert right here because that's that's my explanation on the cure part this isn't supposedly a cured product but it's obviously processed in a way that left us all feeling it in our throats yeah we all it didn't have the taste profile we'd expect based on its aroma which is you know another layer of it i think that all goes into cure here yeah totally i don't hate crc i don't hate it it's got a time and a place but it shouldn't be on the fancy looking packaging with diamonds on it and stuff which we'll get to in a moment which is here's the thing if i'm gonna buy salmon and it says artificially colored i'm not gonna buy it right but thank you for telling me because i'm not gonna buy that and if i you didn't tell me i might have and would be upset later on when you know i literally have that red dye bullshit in the championship yeah and then i personally boycott your company for you know throwing some garbage about you for like a decade or something when you're off the market yeah man like that's how i am too 100 so thanks for they should tell us up front for 30 bucks i shouldn't be going you know what i brought coffee just in case for that very reason uh well actually it's chicory root but whatever i had to bring a warm drink to rinse my mouth out just in case you know because you never know yeah no doubt i mean it's a good experience though i mean uh i don't regret this unlike that one oh yeah i got another nice little size nugget here but i i charred the shit out of my banger because i didn't clean it so judge the hell away look at how dark that got i don't give a i don't care i don't judge i had to clean my stuff yesterday because it was nasty i want to bring like a nice clear you know i have a brand new banger but i'm not going to put it in oh this tastes like it tastes even worse because the chard so cure what are we going to give them for q or michael are you giving them like a a straight straight zero uh okay so it's somewhere between there let's see it's somewhere between zero and one okay so it's pretty okayishly done it tastes all right it doesn't taste entirely like poop it definitely tastes worse than i'd expected to based on appearance and smell um i don't like crc i'll give them a quarter of a point because you know what at least it's not terrible at this point okay i think i'm going to go mid-range i'm going to give them a half a point because i think it's i think it's mid-grade um it could be a better taste it could be a better flavor it could be processed better all of that um if that if this is supposed to be top of the line i agree i'll go half point too just for all the reasons mike said okay all right half a point for those so um quality and care quality and care of the the entire thing i mean we're not we're not gonna at uh brand and packaging quite yet on the other side of what we just talked about for cure right um you paid 21 bucks right so maybe this was on the shelf originally at 30. um right i mean we'll see we'll see most my understanding is almost all the deals that happen especially if it's a third off that's more that's almost the whole taxes being paid for no one can really afford to give you a third off on anything if that was their intended retail price unless they were already cranking the price up in this market spaces especially so very likely this was already cheapo stuff that they produced so it could be knocked down on same paths so that that brings to detriment because you know it didn't really originally 30 bucks and if it did that might have been too high for it even though that's mids as it gets um it's market yeah um half a point for quality and care for me half a point chris for 20 bucks is pretty good yeah i mean i'm going back in so it's not like yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna burn this whole thing down i mean this whole container will be used so but it's not worth 30 bucks yeah unlike last month where i literally just gave it to this guy to to show uh as a joke you know the skittles like nasty brand like i was like i didn't even want that so yeah this this will end up getting consumed one way or another yeah i mean like i won't throw it away i've had concentrates that thrown away or not used and you know never follow that i can't say that although i will say that i have reclaim that tastes better than this does oh shit there you go it doesn't doesn't hit as hard that's for sure yeah now on the second dab i'm kind of getting it i'm actually getting a little stuffy not some stuffy brained you know like there's a layer of fog between the center and the exterior of my so i don't think you guys can see all of these holes but they're all clogged so this was i soaked this in alcohol this was brand new this generally doesn't happen for uh you know i don't i don't dab a lot so weeks or months but this happened within two poles within two dabs this thing is completely clogged i can't use this anymore and so i don't know maybe i'll just end up giving this away because i don't really need that in my my lungs and so let me hit this real quick though you know what brain finally pulled forward i know exactly what it is the feeling we're getting is from lipids plant lipids which kind of shoots my crc theory out of the water though because it would have been removed in the color remediation process because of the cold temperature and the carbon we'll see i gave him a quarter for quality and care it shouldn't uh clog my my rig within two dabs whatever you're doing if the if it is the lipids reduce the amount of fat um or maybe you know i just shouldn't buy this type if the sugar wax whatever it's called is that fatty um and clogs rigs that quick like what's it doing to my lungs that's what i'm better than that is a big concern about concentrates is lipids in them um although when you get the distillate as well like out of a pens there's another concern with distillate because it's uh you know got no other phytochemicals to kind of help along the way and entourage you it's awesome yeah mm-hmm all right um moving on to brand and packaging so uh you know we we kind of made fun of well i did i i'll own it like i think i think this is really this is satire to me i think this is funny um to have a louis vuitton style brand to be bougie and uh really it's just pretentious i think it's hilarious if they did it as a joke i i would i'd be all down for it especially like aggro couture it's it's incongruous um so i i love it i'm gonna whether they they thought it was supposed to be funny or not um i'm gonna give them a full point for branding because they think it's genius um but they have to take themselves a lot less seriously if if they're real about this like if if they're serious they need to like not be serious about this yeah full point you can get a full point yeah i don't know i mean like i'm disappointed by the cost and effect you know like like again you come in this is gonna be your top shelf your your primo well this is just for brand uh and packaging right well i mean that's what i'm saying i'm going with the expectation you set this expectation and like you're saying about the bougie it's like like diego palser man like when they said they had a whole store that was going to be all top end you're like right weed's not ready for that yeah i mean everybody talks about being like the iphone store or whatever like making it more tech you know friendly to older people but now people aren't scared like like this is a bullshit concept of like spa environment out there which is isn't it fitting now that it zips and it's a discount retailer because the whole bougie shit just doesn't work dude you can just see that work in that spot don't underestimate it man there's some bougie shops that charge oh yeah you you could be that way if you could if you could afford rent to like say capitol hill area like you could be a bougie or not capitol hill maybe uh like with bellevue maybe or something i don't know you know like a hot there's there's plenty of neighborhoods where they're great have more than half a million tourists a couple of bellingham neighborhoods that are here there you go real uh lit up there i think it's a little early to to kind of focus on that in the industry personally i mean we don't even have infused coffee yet so like where's your priorities at people because some coffee um where are you guys at on on brand and packaging i'm gonna give him a half point just because i just you know i mean if it's being comedy yeah that's cool too but again if you're this is your high end for 30 bucks and as uh that that that feel me thing man that's uh it's it's real and it clogged your bones that's just gross yeah that was actually pretty damn surprising um so this is actually agro mechanics right i've actually reviewed a bunch of their cannabis products over the past years it's usually cheap on the shelves this so agro mechanics the aggro of agro couture is their flower brand of the name brand right but the uh slab mechanics is their general cheapo line of product out there on the shelves of concentrates so this is all of their own flower to my knowledge going into this brand either that or you know everybody's saying it's their own but they're so everybody's sourcing from somebody else because there's not enough brands that are growing enough to meet the need so yeah uh so these guys aren't just this brand right so they have other brands this seems more like the kind of process on the brand point i think it's pretty legit i mean they got something out there it's not just the same you know it kind of is but it isn't you know it's not the same hipster logos it's slightly different i tore mine um but i tear shit when it's in my hands it just happens i like it i like the branding i like the little sativa thing that i had just there i like how they have that little card on the bottom in the package that's pretty cool i'm gonna give them a full point on this as well even though i did not want to damn it um i i'm going to give them a full point because they are on the shelf this is going to draw the eye the look on the product is going to draw the eye too after that we're not talking about we're just saying hey branding and stuff and yeah okay yeah i get it i just uh you know it as i look at this this the bougie wii the bougie branding i don't catch on to that like like josh caught that because he's into the marketing and investments and all that shit you caught that because you're into uh you know branding as well it's all about marketing i see just uh uh uh this diamond i see it's trying to be fancy but uh you know uh the couture thing doesn't vibe with me like it's more like all right you want to be high-end you better they fucking come with it but you don't so you know i gotta be like all right you're okay it's not i'm not their demo i'm not their primary demo for this product like i said it draws the eye it makes you want to look at it i think that as far as you know cannabis products are concerned in the packaging i mean look at the back looks pretty cool it's got more info it's at least professionally done got all these little components to it um i had to straighten out uh the package is not technically straight in this photo at the top i had to adjust some perspective things because i don't know why their cards aren't square actually though uh sorry to cut you out on that i guess they only get point nine points now but you um because you've you've been to the grow though right you've you've seen their their sources i've seen i i've not i mean just looking at their products and smoking a lot of it over the years i've seen them in a few different vendor days talking about their products and things like that i mean they're they're good people looking to do good business and put good products on the market i um i don't think this is really high-end product though i don't think that they're like it looks like it might be but they're not really saying hey this is the fancy dancing because it's not 55 bucks like that's 50 bucks is is like the top end price range so this is still mids and so man i'm gonna say this and somebody might not like it but you know how uh how like monster has like monster trucks and fast cars and all that bullshit because it appeals to a certain midzie kind of brain mentality and and it's kind of like thinking this is fancy and mistaking it for you know what's really fancy i get that and that's a big place in the market man that's 60 percent of consumers are right in that like i'm shitty and just want to have a personality through the things i buy yeah and this is that target demo gotcha my wife gets suckered into that when she buys wine at grocery outlet and she's look she's looking at the logo and we're like like you're in like the 399 section here like what are you doing yeah you know if you're if you're in the four buck wine actually like i love four dollar wine i i reviewed a lot of that too before i started uh doing weed but um yeah if you're in that just just go just go with it pick your style and hope they did it well yeah i mean it's not bad stuff i'm not again a concentrate person so even it's like me judging hemp i don't fucking do that shit every day i mean like i tell you guys earlier i smoked the wash and bloodco gave me uh i think almost an ounce of three different flavors and smoking it all in three days like it was it was like oxygen they replied they sent me an email saying you smoked it already i'm like because you know we have we had technical issues for the the chong show which will happen again happen next week but like when it's good weed it's like you don't really notice sometimes and except for your pocketbook notices then you have to be like oh i got a yes i want quantity i got called quality instead of quantity or whatever you know like a mid i've been smoking narrows for lately just for good mids but so we've got 3.6 out of seven so that's a 52 percent so yeah it feels about right what's the other one what's the other concentrate that we did how did that rate um i think that was an 86 percent i think that got six out of seven that was from gabriel gabriel yeah actually yeah gabriel's fucking fire dude like even their their their stuff theirs that's out on the market in the mids range is fucking fire especially if it's their weed um i i don't know anything about the company other than their weed is good fucking good but that's what all good product comes down to right is a good plant because and then also course process if we go concentrates because like uh you can do something like co2 extract versus or you know using somebody like eating labs technology there's different ways that you can different differentiate yourself from everything else but it's always about the source material in the end it's always about the plant and how is purge taken care of you know and then unfortunately that does reflect in the concentrate but most people don't give a fuck about that there's like yeah check out jim mccoso with flow technology all right on flow technology if you couldn't understand that it all came through loud and clear man we all speak mouth full of smoke cool yeah he's got all kinds of crazy stuff if you're looking for like um like crystal like dried stuff for ingredients uh this is like sugar and salt kind of stuff so if you're looking for all kinds of uh techniques he's no it's wild sugar's not that hard to make neither is the salts you can infuse those relatively very easily that's pretty much the only home infusion i've ever really done is making some sugar and then yeah well what's the thing called that breaks up like alcohol what breaks up the plant um this isn't what it's about the solvent yeah it's cause that's what breaks up the the specific components right like isn't that what helps yeah yes uh well there's a whole plan really i mean there is but there isn't like a press yeah i mean rosin so rosie is the only solventless one people who say that co2 is solventless are fucking lying to themselves and everybody they say it to no offense to if one of you two says that shit but it's true co2 is a chemical that's used to strip chemicals out of the plant this definition of a solvent scientifically is is that it's the liquid that's or the substance that's used to separate a solution um yeah and that's basically what you're doing you're you're making a solution also a lot of people do co2 use alcohol they use an ethanol extraction along the way and to get to the first level and then use co2 to pull the thc out and they're like it was salvageless all we used was alcohol and co2 and that blows my mind just like own it if you're making rosin though that's the only one yeah and time that's it but if you're doing anything you should also have solvent less because as we saw in oregon in the early days 2015 2016 when the regulatory board stopped everything because of you know motels in florida exploding from eho so i always say like something's going to happen from some testing somewhere down the line if you want to keep skews on the shelf always have a solvent-less product because eventually regulators somewhere down the line are going to wreak havoc on that sector like we saw with vape gate for you know similar if not different uh they're trying now with the thc caps and bullshit but the thing is with that product the concentrate product uh in a regulated market it's how it's both safe and efficient because you know uh uh we're down to the point where nano emulsion is a thing so yeah you know even for to get to nano emulsion you have to have regular extract it's all about the the plant first and then the plant being squeezed or mixed or you know because water hash is a thing you know that's you know there's just different ways to break the plant up but then when you're taking that broken apart you you shake it up again you put it in a centrifuge or a fucking you mix it with alcohol you to get to the next part you know because this is clearly not something that was squeezed with heat this is something probably i don't know man it is butane and propane yeah this is a hydrocarbon mix for sure but so like even okay so so josh you said you know you need to have a solvent-less uh option what are the real options that that producer processors have for solvent lists though i mean they can make hashish which you know is cheap takes a lot of keef and and you know doesn't sell for a lot of money there's not a huge uh cost to it though they can make bubble hash which is if you're doing it good and you're going to sell it well it's got a specific market it's got to be really really good and that's costly and has a very low yield right and then for concentrates maybe you can do rosin but right it's flower or plant rosin right straight from flower particulates it looks dirty it's dark every time right and if you're doing bubble hash rosin which might look beautiful might i've seen some that was like whitey white white and just amazing and uh it's got ultra low yields though the bubble hash has low yields and the rosin has low yields and you're looking at like a two percent yield out of that shit when you might get 18 out of bho so it's hard to say what solvent list options they actually have you know you could do selective drops though like we've seen with lyra canagars he'll do a selective drop at selective stores and he sells out by the end of the weekend so when he drops it on a friday morning um if you don't get it within the next 24-48 hours um you know then they're sold out so that's that would be my suggestion is just to have that skew on there as insurance isn't that how it really should be though essentially in this market like like every every grower every farm should sell out eventually because if you have a good product and people pull off the shelves like when when it was medical and there was a fair market competition you always had great call quality weed but now you got these people just trying to keep their name on the shelf so they're partnering with other farms to you know take their flower slap their name in it and throw it like that just seems like a shitty business way way to do business that's a consequence of the market model we have in washington though man yeah it just is because there's no vertical vertical integration man dude you hit another nerf um there were 33 3 400 ish licenses at first right josh thinking can craig not like 33 17 or something like that we're down to under a thousand there's under a thousand active licenses right now man so how the hell are is that happening well it's happening because the model was built on a lottery system there was no funding available there's no infrastructure behind it it was not vertically integrated and the market was at a point where the taxation at 37 47 effective tax rate fucks every grower because they're getting the they're the first guy they have the biggest amount of costs and the least amount of of profit protection too yeah yeah and the least amount of protection because what happens if a store gets one bad crop like product line from a brand oh well they don't buy them anymore they fucking get something else in the space they take the shelf above it and fill up space and everything's okay nobody's the wiser happens to a farm they're done what's funny is a thousand stores only operating right now and cannabis was what 30 pandemic the second that's total crops your processor and license is what i'm talking about okay but still i mean just uh because during the medical times there was thousands of stores everywhere dude like literally thousands and everybody was making money everybody was you succeeded by being good period yeah that's how mostly you know that's the legacy people like washington budko and troublizing you know they got high price points because the everybody expects like okay it costs this much to you know they're not rolling they're not i mean they're doing okay but they're not retired they're probably growing their views but nobody's nobody's getting rich quite it's going to revert to this same you know buyer behaviors that everyone else has so it's going to be price and convenience so there was a report that just came out from mj business daily that showed pre-rolls had increased 20 percent over the last year um jim belushi's farm had rolled like quarter million joints last year that was 35 of his revenue and it's all about price and convenience people want to grab it they want to you know burn it and go they don't want to spend you know money on a rig like vape exhale they don't want to carry around you know a dab rig or a torch they don't want to have a bong the majority of people just want to be able to buy something consume it and then move on have it be portable all of that it's about convenience and price yeah no totally agree like fake pens and everything and then and then when you're a high consumer like that and then you realize like the the waste that you produce and the guilt that's occurred yeah that's tough i mean there's layers to it there's reasons why the the licenses are reducing but a big part of it like the whole point of that was that you you don't buy cannabis the same way you used to in medical days i was not here for medical cannabis i i'm a carpet bagger who showed up in 2015. that's someone that's called me plenty of times i've been told that dude i care right um but so like you don't deal with cannabis the same way you can't go buy it the way you did in 2014 and so you're not competing at a shelf space for just who's got the best quality who do i like the most right now it's who's got the flashiest brand who cut the right deal for the store who's got the right growing methods you know like who are they getting their weed from like you said miggy everybody's buying each other's weed right like they have to because there's fewer brands than there are sha space for them and the market just shaped that way so whose weed are they getting even you know maybe you trusted them last week because their weed was good but they got a bum deal and they still got to sell it because they don't have the choice no one's got the choice of just saying ah fuck it i'm not going to sell this batch because it's no bueno like you might that's how it used to be that's how it used to be in the medical times was like uh if a store said you have shitty weed we're not gonna buy your shit like there was not this obligation now it's mold to gold we'll take anything go ahead and blast it and we'll sell it and that's words will always tell you oh well the customer demands it just like the customer demands the highest thc percent no they fucking don't that's like pepsi saying our customers don't demand single-use products be eliminated bullshit the all the smoking important for us is the market created by the lcb right this was nothing to do with like because the market that existed before was total about quality in in quantity and like it it was we're still not there yet like that's what i'm so sad about this is all bullshit like so i'm looking at this thing like the the plastic here and then the plastic here you know why not just do this with a tamper seal i don't know i don't there's other there's better ways to do shit but you got to sell it i mean until they can get some you know augmented reality virtual reality where you know you're on your phone and you incentivize this is the best weed i've smoked this is the mostly this actually is the jar from uh some of the the most expensive wheat i've smoked in weeks and this is how it's sold it's got other stuff in it now but they look like this and it's in the shelf and jar like that and that's what i'll pay 50 bucks for um i'm not paying 50 bucks for anything that's coming in a clam shell i'm just not and that's that's that's my point of view on the marketplace some people aren't like that but i think the old and that's the old school way of getting it right like i like those little makeup jars worth um i'm with mickey on this one we don't need the clamshells we don't need all that bullshit and we can't we can find ways around it but consumers don't just buy from what's the best like i was saying now it's the brands and it's what the store got a deal on what the word of mouth manager yes is good you know you know it's all about the shelf space you know that's what that's what 502 created because yeah but you won't need that if you can utilize technology like vr ar and gamifies you come in and you have your your phone and once you hover over what you're looking for you know through filters or whatever and then it pops up and somebody tells you about hey we got this aggro co tour and you're like do i want to buy that or not no move on to the next thing they're going to be other ways if something like that or or the next thing whatever but there's going to be different ways with technology to not have to look at this because when you go in that's not helping anyone when you have hundreds of products that uncle likes and you're looking you're so overwhelmed by 2 000 skus you're like i don't even know so you even go online and then you have your own filters so there'll be something at some day where it's like you know what was that one mobile game was it uh mario or something where you're running around and you're trying to grab uh there's quite a few of those but pokemon go oh yeah that was pokemon go oh yeah yeah no so so level five interactive scott mckinley's uh producer of the dab roast he's got a vr app that works pretty good that i've seen a few different brands using i just think that you know consumer adoption with the tech we currently have is holding back ar everybody would do it if google glasses had actually like been able to continue and there you go and we had our we had our wearables and we could have an ar viewpoint just by like bifocal ar fucking gimme that's what it's going to take and i think that's what it's going to take to make virtual conferences a reality because right now the the conferences i'm seeing mj bizcon was a big flop everything i've seen is a flop from conferences and expos and everything else so until they do vr with some kind of hardware like you were talking about michael and they can integrate that i don't think they'll ever substitute live events no but it'd be interesting once all that happens because the people who who have compromised immune systems or can't travel for whatever reason will be able to finally be there as well digitally did you you know i thought the emerge technology was pretty cool um that's the best i've seen so far yeah yeah but you know and and back to like it's funny how josh and michael you guys at the same point about how i don't buy weed the same as i did 10 years ago right within medical times right and uh uh but did you have a pterodactyl deliver it no but i used to be able to smell it and fucking know like and and touch it but now i just walk in the store tonight and i'm realizing about tenders because i don't give a fuck right i wanna i have a price point and i just wanna know what you guys recommend like that's it like i have 20 bucks today and i buy i like that idea of being able to trust butt tenders i wish i lived in a world where i could trust blood tenders well i'm just saying they're not gonna they're all stoners they're you know they're gonna give me and if they're pushing shitty shit then it's like you know well if your store's carrying it though it's their job though you know i mean like like the reason they get the shitty shit is it's cheap and the reason why it's cheap is the reason they get it too is because they can profit margin it and then because it's cheap it's an easy buy because most people don't have a lot of money and all they need to do is push a little bit and the owner gets a little incentive and he turns 55 000 profit in a day that he cost him like a 400 spiff and his team all pushes the same shitty shit for a day like that happens man that's that's no i guess you have retail and so i'm i'm i like personally i'm gun shy of trusting blood tenders and i i'm i know that you build relationships like a mofo so like i would trust your blood tenders if i were you the stores right like the reef dude i like the reef and and they're all pretty knowledgeable in downtown seattle right uh uncle likes to on the other hand there's some dumb motherfuckers that i've i've met that don't have like i walked in you guys familiar with the filters for glass pipes they look like jumping jacks right and i call them jumping jacks and that guy just looked at me with a blank stare and i'm like ah fuck this place you know man cal props made of glass so my wheels can stay i dude a security guard fucking had to explain to him i'm like i'm done oh wow i haven't used those in a few years but the last time i did i like went into one head shop and i was like dude i'm gonna buy five of these and the guy was like no one ever really buys them i'm like oh that's cool so i gave him like 25 bucks for him and he pulled out a sack and gave me like 30. he's like no one ever buys him just take the rest of them here's a series of uh ironic events is i feel the same way about uh the joint and so there's the joint and bearing and so i'm walking my puppies and so i ended up like stopping by the joint and beerian uh saw this online 30 off saint patty's day so i ended up getting this aggro couture live resin dabs from a place where you know you walk in and it's a new it's a new bud tender every time i'm in there and i only go in because it's it's you know convenient well the joy also has no soul i mean that's what i'm saying like there's some places you can tell like because i mean we all know that owner with his whatever history and i mean i knew when they were in uh medical times you know like a lot of these guys made money and are not really nice people you know off whatever but you know what props to you for making your money you know like uh what's that other guy they have a hard guy i mean like i don't care like that that's why i do the activism done that shit because i want people to have boat trips and vacations it's what it's about you know pay your kids and shit mike like michael you got your thing going with your advertising you know you're not a carpetbagger man you're legit fucking player you know oh yeah no people have told me that though so i'm jokingly saying it i'm okay with who i am i like me all right but i do here's the thing that happens when i do go into stores and i try so hard not to do this but um if you could uh could share that for me friend i feel like this guy every single time when i go into the store and i don't want to i don't want to be like a dick about it and be like come on but sometimes people tell me things blood tenders just say shit that i know that's not true or like we'll talk things about a brand because they're they heard some nugget it's kind of like other stoner wisdom you know you know what i mean like uh how it stays in your hair for 17 days or whatever all the bullshit that we've learned stoner wisdom i feel that's kind of like filters into the bud tenders as well sometimes when they're not experienced you haven't been there for a while yeah and so i try so hard not to go into a place and be like the fuck are you saying and why because i want to give everybody a chance and and you know i like product so it's a tough boat for me i i trust no one but i love them all and there's a few butt tenders out there like if they say i should try something i will like go find it i'll drive halfway across town to get it i got my go-to's but then if i don't see the price or the thing that i want to get then i just well there you go i don't know anything else so let's go with what you would do i'm going to be seeing a lot of bud tenders on a 20 this is the fifth year where i've gone to uh 20 stores on 420 i'll probably split it up three days like i did last year social distancing all that stuff so i'll do seven stores a day um we should meet up on the 24th for the next chronic club i'll go shopping on the 18th to 19th and 20th of april so would you like me to get one product or should i get a you know chronic claws you know sack of of stuff because it is it is 420 so what would you guys like you wanted something that that's you know 80 off or would you like a variety of things and we just do like an unboxing of uh of stuff and just gets super high on the 24th yeah i'm i'm down either one because i mean if you get one thing it's gonna be really expensive and good if you get multiple things it's just gonna be like well i'm i'm open as well um it's up to you guys i'm gonna be going to seven stores in tacoma seven stores in seattle and six stores in everett oh wow you should film the bartenders like have a question for each one of them like i have this will be the fifth year in a row i've had at least three questions for the um guy that comes in i always ask how many people have you had how many expecting then when i see the bud tender i say what's your favorite strain and what's the number one product that you're seeing being sold and i just tally that up and well that's good intel i mean that that's legit intel but look it's a small data set but it's interesting to see what happens yeah mickey wants some culture shit though i'm thinking well no just just ask them if you know what the intro category system is like see if you get stared at or if like they're like oh yeah man that's a thing that's in you that i don't really know much about because doctor shit but like it's a legit fucking you know why cannabis is uh i could tell them like i have a podcast it's called the endocannabinoid system do you know what that is and then just look at it with a blank stare like yeah yeah dude hell yeah dude i saw it i was on youtube right yeah totally totally oh man hey guys it's a good hour though rose yep yep we should balance michael do you have a preference on uh santa claus or i think we should premium pack it up with uh let's get something good we've had a few like poo poos along the way let's get something we know it's gonna be like or at least can go and thinking like this is gonna be good yeah we'll get some fire coming on the 24th uh going shopping on april 20th so you have to come back to the chronic club and find out what it is all right wrecked because i'm actually going to be on a tea break till then so i'm going to get wrecked on that show guys all right

legalization news where you at that's it cameras latest news.com and also the podcast boom all right talkinghedgepodcast.com i'm josh kinkade and we're out peace", "TKHuzNhPOEY": "good evening youtube universe preston pete coming at you with another one um so i have a 40 minute pressing video for some reason i'm having issues getting it uploaded to youtube so at some point tonight i'm going to be [ __ ] around with getting it on the desktop from my phone and then trying to upload it from there i kind of already started that process so that's just the update there um i just got back from work about two hours ago and i've been out in the rain [ __ ] around with rubber mulch and stuff for my kids playset so i'm freaking exhausted i just got a shower dried off cleaned up and time to medicate because boy do i need it um as you can see i've got the g pen rome i decided i need something quick and easy to medicate with um i will be doing another video later on tonight because i have something special to unbox all right so without further ado here is our review it is prime that's right it is a prime week it's just the way it is it's what's been available prime plus i like prime kunduz d number 13 live resin tree sap phenotype so i did the homework on it it's kunduz um mixed with marie laveau crossed whatever you want to call it so it is pretty damned terpy i'm actually surprised some of the prime stuff i've had lately hasn't been as terp as i would expect uh fairly potent it's fairly fresh it's a little over a month old this was packaged april 7th it is may 15th um not that it's going to bother anything cannabinoids thc 0 thca 82.772 thcv 0.361 uh cbd cbda cbdv and cbn a big fat zero uh cbg 0.142 cbc 0. okay terpene profile so here's where it gets a little interesting i've actually i'm used to different and varying diverse trip profiles i've never seen this much pining effort in one particular uh profile so it's i'm kind of excited about it uh this .117 b car .161 b merc b merzine one point two one six b pinene two point six three six now that's b pining humeline .077 limonene one of my personal favorites three point two seven seven percent which is outstanding i haven't seen anything with that much limonene in a while a little all point three o three terpenelene zero and last but not least pinene seven seven point one eight five percent so she's a turkey [ __ ] i'm excited i am excited and i've never had this before hence the review um supposed to be pretty tasty stuff from what i've seen i try not to be very uh influenced so i haven't seen any reviews but i did read from prime's website uh oh yes oh yeah kudos d yeah i'm pretty excited about this a little bit up on the sides but not too shabby boy that stuff is like white it's just bright white live resin you know it's funny i turn on the light and i have it facing the other way from when i did the pressing video so it doesn't really do us any good when it's facing the wrong direction oh let there be light all right there we go well you still just you can't even see it it's so bright yeah there we go there we go yeah see that's just it's all up in the bottom there a little bit up on the side but it is just yes it's just it's so white you can almost like not even see it it's not even there very very good exciting exciting stuff ooh it does have a very interesting nose make me sneeze excuse me i was building up before i took the first sniff just to be fair i just didn't think it would actually evolve into a full sneeze i thought just be a tickle and go away it does have a very piney aroma does have a very piney aroma now i'm going to scoop this all from the bottom of the jar to one side just so you can see it better yeah there we go that looks much better now you can see it that's really pretty looking stuff very clean looking and nice fat scoop in there it's a little more than i really should do uh to be honest in the room because it does goop up a bit easily if anything that's my one that'd be my one complaint about the roam it does goop up fairly easy so there is a bit of cleaning involved maintenance to keep it you know clean and usable um other than that it's outstanding i like it um and it doesn't have the best battery life either that's the other thing it doesn't have the best battery life um other than that it's really a cool device it's a neat device it's very portable it does fit in your pocket i'd be worried about tipping it too much and spilling because it i've heard people say it doesn't it does that's [ __ ] i've tipped it and i have spilled water on myself just saying uh not a lot it doesn't have a whole lot of water but it doesn't take much to leave a big wet spot on your shirt and that's just the way it is all right turn it on it is on it is set at 6.75 that's a fairly decent temperature it's not all the way up it goes up to 800 but i think 675 is plenty i tried 700 the other day was just a little too warm double tap you can see it's starting to heat up when it's done it'll vibrate and give a thumbs up so you know i like this little thing it's kind of neat it's a fun little device you can't drag on it too hard oh it tastes nice sweet and piney you know the flavors i can tell you sweet almost like a little bit of a berry very piney a little nutty i think a little bit does have a very nice flavor smooth there's no throat burn give that a reheat and see if i can't get another draw out of it this is very nice oh i like it almost there's our thumbs up oh oh yeah oh it tastes good still a little bit more in there all right one more like i said i packed that a little tight a little more than i probably should have but i wanted to get a little bit of a dab on here about to have some dinner with the family so i just need a little bit of chill oh yep oh that'll do it yeah so i'm very happy with that flavor is really nice i've already got a little bit of a dab sweat going i can feel myself calming down relaxing a bit as uh i'm not as aggravated and stressed out uh feeling as i was i kind of feel myself mellowing uh it's a nice hybrid it's a hybrid it's not a sativa it's not indica it's a hybrid um i do feel myself chilling out which is nice calming down getting where i need to be um i'm definitely gonna need more um just because of my tolerance to where i'm at i'm gonna i saw that but i'm gonna do another dab first but not on the video i'm going to call this one good for now i know it's a short video but i'm pressed for time i'm going to be going didn't do dinner and then after dinner it's time for an unboxing i got some new glass so i'm pretty excited about this i actually didn't expect this to come for at least another week so this is pretty exciting i'm pretty stoked about this i've not seen this per in person i've only seen it in pictures and videos and i this will be all right for dinner so be watching for that video so folks with that said i'm going to call this one a win the kunduz d uh and i don't give a [ __ ] if i'm pronouncing that wrong it's just the way it is uh prime kunduz d outstanding medicine so far um yes i haven't done two dabs like i normally do and hit it but i'm already feeling some good effects and i haven't done a whole lot of medicating today so with that said prime kunduz d live resin number 13 tree sapphino it gets it gets a four and a half out of five stars for me um and here's the only reason why it doesn't get a full five stars uh it has a tiny little bit of throat burn just the tiniest little bit um it's minor but it's enough to knock half a star off no but seriously it's out it's good stuff it's a win all day i do wish it was closer to 65 a gram but being live and being that terpy i'm pretty happy with it so outstanding stuff with that said we are coming up on 270 subscribers or not 70 260 260 subscribers coming up here i think we're 258 right now is the time i'm recording this it's nothing to a lot of people but to me that's

I'm Shane I'm Danny and we're back for another stray interview today we are checking out some London poundcake this is London pound cake number 89 from cookies yep this was requested by you guys and we had to drive all the way up to Oakland from San Jose just to get it it was one of the only spots in the Bay Area that carried anything with the cookies brand on it pretty crazy like Dan said requested by you guys if you look down in the comments usually whenever we do strain reviews we you know write a comment what strain you guys want to see us review next we usually leave it as like the top comment on the video so we actually do read those comments and see what you guys you know recommend what you guys want to see us review so this was one of the top of comments on one of the last videos so we're bringing it to you now as I crack the bag here it looks fire I think the trend could have been a little bit better but it does look far it's cakey you crack that it smells a lot like sugar I guess we should get into the genetics what is it what are we find on that this one's a little bit of a mystery actually I know pretty much for certain that there's a little bit of sure bin there I think he's part of the Sun set sure as far as what at what the other parent strain of this is or multiple you know genetics that went into this I don't know I've heard all kinds of creating different things I mean I've heard everything from tangi to what Ingrid I've heard that there's some og in there I'm pretty sure that yeah that's pretty credible I mean we're always hoping if you guys know we're having it leads obviously leave them down there we did all the research we could do and you know we've asked friends and you know this one was kind of a mystery so if you guys know leave them down there like this join up right another cookie strain named after a pastry just kind of keeping up with that same vibe I've never been much of a pound cake guy myself as you were talking about the look at this one honestly okay I'm not that impressed I'm not either we keep it real you know these genetics are obviously fire I definitely smell a lot of sherbert in there and I'm actually a server fan but to be honest I'd rather smoke some good shirt over this kind of that funky shirt herb to that like almost reminds me more of just like a pie you know yeah it's definitely got some pie I like dirty fun funky yeah yeah funky pie going on there I'm going on the bong here and try it out yeah I'm hitting the joint flavors so you guys can see it as best I can yeah we're rockin the new setup here I like it it feels more official yeah we're up in a better level to do reviews I feel like but yeah the joint you know it tastes good it's good wheat don't get me wrong but it's not knocking my socks off you know the buzz is starting to kick in it's definitely indica you know but not too heavy but yeah I mean I'm just I'm really keeping it 100 I'm not that I'm that impressed you know I've seen better work from the cookie conglomerate or whatever you would call it let's just put it at that right I mean well based off the flavor there there really wasn't much of it to be honest but you know it's really it's flat well I haven't really I don't know the smell like I say I'm getting maybe a little hint of that sure pie type thing in there but not much else from what I've heard this strains supposed to have kind of it's not supposed to be a real crazy exotic loud pungent turf but it's supposed to be kind of like a smooth vanilla type thing yeah I've heard I've heard the vanilla a lot to turn vanilla get target Londontown kid maybe it's just a fee no maybe 89 is just not the one but I you know I think the nicest way to put it is I've seen better work from the cookies people you know I mean they do grow fire they got fire stones but this one oh yeah for my first time trying something like this this one so far out of the bong at least didn't make leave the greatest impression on me for me personally not a ton of bag appeal on this one we rolled up some of the smaller nodes or the ones that were taking a look at here you know what's left there's some of the bigger ones right but overall it was a lot of just real kind of small bottom you know not really the best looking nodes even for how well I would imagine this drop of ground right the bet the bag that we got weren't very good overjoy honestly pretty much the same I'm just not getting a lot of flavor overall I was [Music] like out of a bomb he's pretty flat too it's really I would say the best thing about this read is probably the effect right that's a CCC eternal sin right there these things like back hills they kind of do yeah if the bowl is still on fire at all they kind of do but I did get me pretty high I'm pretty pod but got a couple new sovereignties to do the strain reviews for you guys we definitely did we're down to probably do some glass reviews of these coming up soon done a review on a flower tube and [ __ ] forever I'm liking it well I'm diggin the bond rusty this guy hit super nice we got another baby blue flavors edition got the stem line just regular came this one's got the little mini stems yeah crazy the little double shooter I'm give it one more shot here in the bong just to you know I like to make sure we do an adequate amount of research before week before we come to a conclusion on any stream but if we did had to rate this if we did have to rate this where are you going right now mmm like overall are we going you know break it down for my department okay I'll start with my always start with my what sticks out to me the most right so what sticks out to me the most is the buzz and I'm gonna have to give the buzz like that you know honestly I'm pretty high and on the indica guy I'm gonna give the buzz probably like an eight on this and that's probably gonna be my highest rating on this flower so I'll go affect or buzz and eight and then for the flavor I would say that probably comes in second for me it does have a little bit of that sherbert you know pie funky flavor to it so on the flavor up I give that like a solid seven and then for looks which i think is probably its worst trait to be honest it's like pretty dry the trim could be better I'm going to give the look like a six to be honest just keeping it real I've seen better work from the cookie people so I really wish this is one of those times like I really do wish I knew what the actual genetics were this one right because then I would know you know I would give me a better idea if I'm just not a fan of this strain or these particular genetics London pound cake in general or if this just wasn't grown it means full potential yeah you're right if it does have tangi in it which we've heard I'm not getting that at all could be wrong but if there's Dan Jenna that could be possibly making look shitty and I don't know why you would use tangi for anything like you just said yeah it looks like [ __ ] I don't know why you use it any for anything for breeding purposes other than just for the turf so I'm not getting any orange out of this so I mean I don't know again like I said it's kind of frustrating when we don't know what the actual genetics are yeah but this weed is just not doing it for me man I'll be honest like you said there's a lot of cookie strains that I like a lot better than this I'm excited to try another sample of it hopefully in the future to see if it's a little bit better you know I never like to make a judgment call on a strain overall just based on one sample if it's a really fire example I can say okay that's transpired you know yeah but it's something like this that's just kind of mediocre or nothing special it kind of just makes me you know hope that the next time I see is better yeah well go ahead and rate it then I gave it my rating I would say my overall rating probably comes out to about a seven and that's that's that's it that's generous I think that's pretty fair we're good I don't like the flavor of this to be honest with ya I really do stuff I mean break it keep it real I'm gonna give it a 5 a 5 yeah flavor 5 effect I just overall I know this strain of 5 yeah it's it's whatever there's nothing I stand out about it we usually just to give you guys a little behind the scenes the way that we rate the buzz is this is not the first time we smoked this like right we roll it up before the video we usually smoke one the day before yeah you know I mean we'll smoke a joint a bit all the smoke on a bit and that kind of gives us a good gauge for the buzz right and you kind of get to break it down smell it gives you more of a you know true understanding of like the flavor the texture of the weed and yeah I like that but I mean I don't know like I said the only reason I'm giving it a bump but 207 is because I do like the buzz on it I do remember when we smoked it yesterday I got a real Spacey I'm Spacey right now there you have it I gave it a 7 Oh max a little bit stiffer over there with a 500 pound cake number 89 for the CCC I'm Danny I'm Shane and were either [ __ ] [Music]", "XRpGRb2gkVE": "fishhead cush is an indica dominant flower with lineage from OG Kush and lowland Afghani it has a smooth taste with sweet earthy undertones and a fruity diesel aroma that is slightly earthy as well fishhead produces a strong body high with relaxing cerebral effects medically it is recommended for anti nausea anti-anxiety as well as treating chronic pain and insomnia this is a sticky potent strain that hits hard and fast come see why fishhead cush has become an extremely popular strain among the clinic staff and patients alike", "Crc9OKhpuNE": "I'll be rolling rolling I'll be smoking too Oh gasps my stash like I'm rolling in a stolen truck yeah you know sure we see the great thing is the bait Bank doe - jeez well guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny and we're back again for another strain review today we are checking out another one from Lumpy's another one a few um peas in the past but it's been a minute since we did one I want to say the last one we did was the Cali berry right yes we did the Cali berry a few months ago something like that bring it to you Lumpy's apple fritter and when i crack the jar I see perc a little bit of perp in there for sure and what is it it smells it smells along the lines of the dogs walls but is not quite that so I would say it smells kind of pervy yeah so it's supposedly apple fritters supposedly sour apple and animal cookies okay and then I think the sour apple I know it has I think it's sour D in Sydney 99 okay so yeah that's that's a nice lineage I don't know what sour apple is but there's animal cookies there's some diesel in there I just told you what sour apple is Cindy 99 Sour Diesel I'm sorry there you go sorry I agree though all the all the parents that went into that one every all stuff I would want to smoke on its own you know so that's usually a good start exactly it's better that then has like og cross with blue dream and I'm like oh why'd you go and do that - oh gee you know dude this smell is really similar to that dogs walls from from elemental wellness back in the day which is we that I love I love this turf it's actually kind of rare I feel like you know it's almost like the herbal turf but a little different yeah you definitely for me I definitely get those like sour II kind of fuelie notes in the beginning but then it's kind of more of like a sweet creamy thing like you're talking about you know I'm almost getting like as I've just broke that up I kind of got like almost like a little cheesy funk or something you know I'm really trippin on the snow guys like I like it there's many layers to it there's layers to that's a good word to describe it there's layers to the smell I'm gonna go ahead and light this joints I forgot we had it rolled I really want to taste this stuff I love me some purp great game in this thing I wonder how far we are into this video there's always somebody that comments down below the exact time and moment that one of us takes our first rip because if we're on top of our [ __ ] it's usually a minute two men in 30 seconds most of time it's usually two minutes and a half minutes and people were like hey I thought you guys were gonna [ __ ] smoke in these videos I don't you guys did high no we just blab on we're just blab blab blab but lighten up this Jeffrey here gonna get high let's see how it tastes huh definitely a good burpy I get purp on the inhale but you do get a little bit of that like almost gas eNOS I'm guessing it's coming from the sour apple or the sour deep very smooth out of the bone I like it the first and this will hit off the joints Barry I get a perfect flavor guys almost like yeah it's sweet like a sweet candy like a like a Laffy Taffy ah that's a little extreme but if I had to tie it to some it's almost like a great walkie-talkies yeah I kind of like that dogs waltz comparison that you drew cuz one that's a strain I haven't smoked in forever and I really missed back in the days when elemental had fire in San Jose that was one of our favorite strains to get from them similar parents I guess I left the cam yeah and then a vertical rise at the Kemp sister of the herbal I don't know after days Ray's dog yeah I think it was Charles about an Urkel so you get kind of that fuelly kind of more pungent thing going on from the chem whereas in this strain you have it with the sour and then you know got the cookies bringing in some of those may be sweet perk Terps not like truth no I can pure Oracle but it's a little very very hint in there to man and wife you know coming from that like great D flavor I'm getting but I almost got like a little berry flavor and there's really good guys yeah lots of lots of depth I feel like to the smells and the flavor of this stuff yeah it's been a while I think since we it may have not I don't know but I think it's been a while since we have we had honestly the best characteristic of this weed to me is the smell so far yeah the taste is good don't get me wrong but the smell I sat there and tripped on it for a minute different smell is what I am always going for you know it's always my number one criteria this strain actually won the cannabis cup a couple of years ago I want to say 2016 pack that for hell yeah y'all this trade year there you go there you go fair's fair yeah but this one the cup a couple of years ago that one was hitting out like 25 percent THC this one right here is coming in at 21.5 1/4 cultivated on 1213 package on 114 so Wow we picked this up a couple of weeks bail it's sitting on it took forever to do these reviews but I'm surprised it still has this good Terps after being packaged about four or five months ago that's really good I mean it stays like 70 degrees in hearing some of the dispensaries I'm sure go a little hot you know one of at least like that not the nice ones but yeah but we've only had it for a week or two and you know the shop it's still really they had it for four months before that so it's not usually when we get weed that was packaged a few months ago in California it's gonna be dry it's gonna be stale that's good the nose isn't gonna be there the way it is on this so I'm definitely impressed this has kind of been I don't want to say their flagship strain but one of their biggest strains over the last I don't know year - maybe longer sure this is the one that really put Lumpy's on the map for me personally and I think there's a lot of other people know yet for sure this is only my second time having it not gonna lie but the first time I believe was like you know beginning in this year maybe even like December something like that and fire both times like he said the freighter you talk about yeah the apple fritter is that what I said yeah I just didn't know if you meant Lumpy's in jail no no no that was for yeah yeah I've had Lumpy's a few other times Cali berry few of their other ones this is my first time trying the apple fritter I saw a batch of it before like one of my buddies just had like one left over and it was like a nicer nug as I look at this stuff it's some you know some of these bugs are a little bit smaller in these this particular jar that I'm looking at not necessarily the tightest no nuts what we're dense at least these particular notes sometimes if you get some like bottom or like more side note right they might just look like that if we were to see some tops of this it might be a totally different story yeah I don't know if I had to get down on rating this one I really like it I like this strain in general I think this is super fire I'm not sure if this is I do I know this isn't the best batch they've ever grown you know if you just want to go based on test results they've definitely grown more potent looking backwards some of the photos I've seen on their Instagram and from other people online I got I got a crazy little you know it's crazy sorry I just totally cut you off yeah go ahead what are you saying go ahead uncle Gard okay oh you know you're a Buddhist daughter you know how a [ __ ] beer has this always like 3.4 whatever the push there it's crazy how we can't get weed like that and do you think we will see a day that we do being that we can be able to grow apple fritter at parking the same percentage every single time well I mean there's so many variables with growing wheat everybody tell me that things are gonna be a little bit different and I think it's way easier I think it's way easier to control like every single just about every single very when you're brewing so you're saying that we will see the day no I'm saying that I don't I think that I think you can control way more of the important variables when making beer obviously I've never [ __ ] made beer I don't know anything about it but this is just what I do right now me too there are way more variables with ie just being that every strain is different yeah each one has different optimum requirement exactly I don't I don't think we're gonna see the day either I need to be able to grow the same plant at the same THC percentage every time that's not going to happen especially when you have the genetic getting weaker and weaker as you clone down I just don't see it happening all you scientists out there please prove us wrong or otherwise or other known or whatever the [ __ ] other stupid English anyways I almost rate this stuff yeah I was gonna say the best thing about this one like you kind of alluded to earlier is the nose for sure that's the first I mean and for being packaged four or five months ago and still smelling this good yeah obviously it was dried and cured properly even perfectly I would say it's keeping alone I would have loved to smell this on the plant or smell it like right after it was like fresh isn't you know at packaging time it's just to see if it was even more crazy and I love doing I would have loved to just rub the sugar that's the best part about growing at so that's the one thing I miss the most about growing is just being able to like just smell the evolution of the Terps knowing what it smells like at early the flowers date of the fire late flower stages and then like you know the color starts to turn yeah and then like once you cut it down and like after the chop and then how it how that kind of flavor just kind of like changes to that final project you know I like being able to see that evolution and like you're talking about just walking in there and doing that form is amazing so yeah we got a 10 on the smell Wow this stuff gets me high man I'm like really high sorry for the stunt 110 on the smell what's next flavor flavors not far behind but super smooth it's very smooth it could just be like more more beautiful white ash it beautiful white ass definitely that's for sure hundred percent so flavor I'm gonna give it eight I'm just gonna grab this a V you could just be more I'm gonna go with the word more really it could be it could be just more pungent I like the flavor on this one I think it's pretty good I did like it a little bit better out of the bomb than the joy let me give it one more bigger but yeah I'm gonna stick with a eight because we're running out of time on this damn video effect effects good I'm just now assessing it like I'm pretty pretty Spacey pretty a bomb-ass song right now it's very creative very uplifting it doesn't make me want to just sit here and be lazy all day so I'm gonna give it I'm gonna give it it I'm gonna give it a 9 I actually really like the high so overall I'm gonna give it I don't know if those average out - I'm gonna give it a 9 9 9 so as far as the buzz goes I cheated a little bit on this one and I smoked some a couple of days ago we kind of split these last couple notes we had up and in between these jars so we could do this video or whatever but it definitely hits me like that at first it's kind of like uplifting euphoric very like clear motivational I guess I don't know what the right word for it is but it's very like uplifting at first but at least for me when I smoked it the other day it just completely did a 180 on me like mmm and then maybe 30 minutes 45 minutes after smoking it because I was feeling like this last time I smoked it a couple of days ago then the coffin in 30 minutes later yeah yeah I guess I'm coffee'd up right now I could have something to do that overall overall I'm gonna give this a solid nine and a half nine point five yeah I like the flavor on it the smell 10 flavor I'm giving that like a 9 buzz I'm giving you no flu Niner ten everything about this is pretty much a 9/10 so I'm gonna go nine point five it's good we apple fritter from lumpy shoutout to Lumpy's for growing some good weed yeah I look forward to trying another batch of this this is something I would definitely buy me too Lumpy's apple fritter from your sister pick this up by the way at atrium down in a Southern California we actually did a dispensary tour on them a couple of weeks ago with that so check it out right up here somewhere over there check it out he'll definitely let us know what you guys want to see us review next put that down in the comments if there's a strain that you have Jalen's for us to review now is the time to let us know he's rambling yeah I might I'm showing you how to throw the Gees up right now it's like they're grabbing some titties I'm Danny guys he's Shane for the CCC 4/20 right hi hey see ya no nice home yet if I told you would I had my bag that [ __ ] will be a palm tree I got more flavors than letters this in the Alfa [ __ ] star no mids around my circle no we ain't allowed", "QWbhrFL99u0": "how's everybody doing this is John with CNC kind of sourcing we got a good one for you today all right well today I went down to the old marijuana store and I was looking for a specific product and they did not have it but they had it under a different name I will I am extremely excited every time I find this because this shows that a company is paying attention to the market and they are adjusting for that market it is always important to recognize who your target market is and cater to those people to ensure you have a customer base that being said what we're going to be doing a review on today is some Alabama liquid snake Alabama liquid snake this particular version is done by cult cannabis this is also a subsidy of Webster dam farms cult concentrates now this his club cosmic concentrates this is also Alabama liquid snake and this is also done by Wham stirred and farms however if you look you can see the size of the packaging is different the containers are substantially different the amount of plastic used is different and I believe this was ten dollars cheaper than this containing the same amount of the same product as a matter of fact the club concentrates is a few percentage points stronger than the cult concentrates that being said let's take this to the mat and see what we got to work with alright here we are let's take a close look at this this is the club cosmic concentrates very nice script extremely extremely happy with the loud background clearly one gram 21 and over cannabis Alabama liquid snake which is a sativa the club is open club cosmic DRAM calm this is a club live resident Alabama liquid snake from lamps or dam farms the statists are 83 for the total THC thca of 93 80 393 Terps of 2.2 okay this is called concentrates the Alabama liquid snake which is a sativa one gram of extract this is also a dram of cult DRAM Alabama liquid snake this one does not claim to be live resin like this one does this is club this is cult this is 76 and 83 whereas this one is 83 and 93 Turkey is a 2.2 terpenes of 3.6 all right well there you have it I say we get these open okay let's start first off we'll start with this club concentrates very nice this a exceptionally good quality product very dry very dry very hard very nice consistency overall looks to be very high quality this light it's got some good terms to it as it should as it should like I said this is the club Alabama liquid snake right here next let's try out that cult alright here is the Alabama liquid snake from cold concentrates there you go this is a dram Alabama liquid snake sativa well this is almost appears maybe just a little bit lighter in color minuscule e at most still very dry looks looks very similar I will be interested to see what this tastes like all right that being said let's bring these back up to the rig and see what we think all right so here we are top side again and we're going to do a little bit of a taste smell comparison on these two Alabama liquid state concentrates no the cult like I said it's very dry and it's calling for three point six chirps which is it a lot but it might come through a little bit more in the UH in the dab itself so here we go this is some cult concentrates Alabama liquid snake see what this tastes like Cheers very light flavor almost no flavor at all if I was forced to try to pin something down I might pin a little bit of a haze note a little bit of that spiciness a little bit of haze enos get a little bit of a nose burn but all in all very very nice light flavor not harsh a little bit of the tingle burn in the nose and then it goes away a little bit of lasting really bland haze flavor very nice I like it it is a very good one No that being said when it bounced over and uh try this club concentrate now this would be if you were gonna go for broke in style you'd be talking about your a line and your B line basically what you're talking about is um Lincoln and Ford Cadillac and Chevy you know I'm saying this here the the glass jar actually says on the bottom of it cult you know very high-quality expensive packaging the shape of this plastic so that it sits up by itself for display purposes that's that's a little more spending this right here basic simple little bubble pack ticker now and Laurent we're good to go you know very nice they left more room in the bottom here for the label sticker to go on whereas here if you look at it the label sticker actually cut off a little bit of their little logo they had to leave it hanging over this edge and then cut off you know harvested fresh and frozen that's they had to miss that part so you know they they're doing pretty good they're moving in the right direction this is a little dryer very I mean I mean it feels like diamonds in there it doesn't bring up doesn't stick much very very nice looks looks like very quality stuff can't tell a whole whole lot of difference like I said this might be a little bit darker then the cult but this is this is a little bit darker than the cult and that is what it is let's see let's see how this one tastes get a profile on this club concentrates Alabama liquid snake Cheers you know for having less terpenes that has more of a flavor to it almost a sugar cookie their detail in just on the back of the tongue on the tail end on the exhaust on the exhale just a tail into sugar cookie and not a whole lot of burden through the nose a little different a little different dab you feel it's good heavy heavy heavy product like it a lot both versions right here very top top shelf um this happens to be on sale today cuz it's 20% off concentrates on Saturday huh so this was picked up for $18 it's a very very good deal um I definitely would pick it up again um this like I said has a slightly different flavor profile and uh he's a slightly different product that being said if you guys make it to the Pacific Northwest especially up to the Olympic Peninsula you'd be sure to try out some cult or Club concentrates and let me know what you think you guys have an absolutely wonderful day thank you so much for doing it I certainly appreciate it remember to give this a subscribe and like if you liked it and a thumbs down if you did you guys have a good one we'll see you next time peace", "UDKXFg1ymvg": "[Music] what is going on you [ __ ] bunch of stoners my name is

flower review today i've got my hands on some blackberry kush from revolution a cross of an afghani land race and huckleberry let's check this stuff out stuff looks pretty damn good as always from revolution it's frosty good nug structure a really good grind down consistency and a lot of fluffy and smokeable medicine in there with minimal stem i'd give it a nine out of ten i would probably be more enthusiastic about this strain if i had never tried revolution flower before it doesn't quite reach the elite level of looks that some of those strains they have just seem to to do but this one is no slouch this stuff is another member of a pretty decent slew of revolution strains i've tried recently where the aroma is just really subtle and ultimately faint and disappointing for me you get a little bit of tartness a very very faint citrus pine on the breakdown and an overall dull floral aroma i'd give it a 7 out of 10 for smell it doesn't smell like hay or like it's overly dry it just smells like it has low terp volatility for sure the crescendo from nature's grace that i tried not too long ago and did a review on was a similar smell to this one but that one was way stronger and more nuanced to that one not much to write home about taste either i did get a little bit of hay and soil like flavor initially so i did some home curing and that did improve the flavor to have a little bit of a smoother smoke and a little more floral and citrus nuance to it the smell never got much stronger for me just to to go back to that category for a second but ultimately flavor-wise it was a pretty harsh smoke still very faint and not memorable at all flavor-wise i'd give it a 7 out of 10 for taste it honestly feels like i'm repeating myself in a lot of these revolution reviews but like many of the other low aroma and low flavor strains from them this one still packs a really potent punch i felt a heaviness of both my eyes and limbs upon smoking some of this stuff which later would consistently develop into like a mood boosting sedation and also inflammation relief was something i noticed as a side effect of this stuff a positive side effect let me re-emphasize though that gradual mood boost if you have depression or really any mental or emotional affliction or mental illness this gives you that boost to make life feel okay and puts a pep in your step i'm someone who often wakes up with high levels of anxiety not to get too personal here but using this in the morning was a really good way for me to ease into a day and feel medicated as i start my day it didn't interfere with my productivity and i was able to stay active and feel physically good when i was medicating with this stuff i'd give this stuff a 9 out of 10 for effects really a good high i can definitely recommend for physical and mental and emotional relief that's going to give this revolution blackberry cushion even 8 out of 10 overall this bud probably won't meet serious cannabis connoisseur's taste or smell desires because it's really faint in both of those categories but like i said the buzz is definitely worthwhile because it's got this simultaneous uplifting boost and bodily relaxation that uh really works for me medicine wise the buds are pretty they're sticky and they're dense um so there's not too much to complain about here other than i would love to see more aroma and more flavor i know that's sometimes a genetic specific trait and sometimes a a strain specific trait but i feel like maybe other cuts of blackberry kush out there and maybe even other you know past harvests from revolution of this very cut of blackberry kush i feel like based on other reviews i've seen this stuff historically has a little bit more smell and flavor to it um i'm talking about revolution specifically their cut of blackberry kush so maybe i just got a low aroma batch maybe it was less than optimal grow i don't really know let me know if you had the same experience with this stuff or if you had super terpy super super tasty black bear kush from revolution thanks as always for all the love and support to this channel and i look forward to chatting with everyone as always in the comments stay safe everybody", "Gk4nimGdf20": "what's up everybody it's been a long time since i made a video i got one a few little tiny debs of this durban poison life resin i really like it it's a great strain it's pure sativa definitely gives you an uplifting hi one thing I noticed even before I read the description on this train is it uh it kind of gets you going like in a romantic type of way so it's good for the libido and I was like man this strain is like making me horny a lot and sure enough when I looked up the description it is one of the effects is that it increased I think all marijuana does with this one in particular for me really gets me going so trying to take a quick dab of this I got my little my Gerber pocket knife right here and so I mean I was get it going ok King okay I don't want my foot in the [ __ ] camera good here we go guys resume great strain I love life resin lives one of my favorite extra so now I had some pie crust which is kind of like it definitely like in between shatter and wax in a sugary crystal eat like sugar consistency I have somebody take it was pretty good a little harsh though knows but uh pretty good though this is my favorite stars flavor everything from what I've tried so I've got some really good waxes but nothing compared to this flavor don't do them alright so here we go I like I've been letting it cool off a little bit more before time my dad oh yeah well it took a video of me torching it and the fumes just off of the torch like the distorted like Mirage looking thing yeah just don't like that and I wonder if some of the residual butane still on the nail but here we go you I might be upside down I hope not ah I mean like three other videos where I did it like this and I was upside down and I I didn't even bother but man mmm that first that kind of menthol II minty taste I'm durban is you know the strain that gives cookies that that minty cook you been man flavor man I love it but uh I want to enjoy this and everybody else have a great night and a happy 710 I always thought 710 was a harvest date because you know for 20s around the time we plant a seed and then I figured that was the

I'm not really refilling them I'm filling them with some double delicious we're just gonna do a DAB first so I get it rolling there yes there's a festival going on in the squib Washington area if you look up swim SE e qu I am Washington swim Washington right now there's a thing called of lavender Festival there is the perfect environment for growing lavender in this area and there are substantial my lavender farms and as there's a festival concerning lavender the little purple flower everybody likes the extract oil from it you don't talk about lavender anyway there's a large lavender festival here it comes through to get a little bit more business the local marijuana store here went on a very nice full weekend sale I'm having a lot of discounts for their cannabis and we were able to pick up we're hoping this stuff this for about nine dollars and ten cents three I'll pick up this one gram of distillate right here I knew we got this for twelve dollars and ninety cents possibly $12.40 I'm not really sure I didn't do the math all the way but it's about twelve and a half dollars twelve and a half dollars for a gram of mango distillate and like I said we're looking at a THC of seventy three point two so this is not bad this is not bad on any level um I know that wasn't supposed to have tea in it man I I feel you I figure I'm mom right there and this is an N one we're gonna do that on 4/20 one of these days man trust me trust me trust me we're gonna make it happen captain all right so these guys have the THC a the THC the th CV the CBD a the CBD the CB in the CB g the CBC and the CBL yeah there's a lot of information going on right there alright there's a lot of tea ages and see bees if you know what I'm saying a lot of but if you have that [ __ ] tested and those numbers come back why not throw them out there so people can see that [ __ ] right why not this is all pesticide free so there you go alright we're doing a DAB here and then we're gonna get on these cartridges once again I want to thank you guys so much for tuning in and as always in the description there is a link to my patreon if you would like to help support this channel and improve the content right now I'd like to give a shout out to some of my standard patreon patrons we have read and Foley there she's a wonderful woman very nice I got old mr. Warner he's a very nice old JK how you doing my friend then of course we got screaming coils old screaming coils he's throwing out a little bit too thank you guys so much right I don't know where the CVS is they should be right in there right right next to the NBC BG cheers folks Oh give me an order all right so they're real those are really nice little dab there now this was impromptu I know I set up a scheduling Ford but this truly was an impromptu and as such I am gonna have to get a couple things in line before I do this since this is a high-quality distillate granted it was cheap but that's just because it was inexpensive the quality on this is actually pretty on point and the distillate itself is actually pretty thick if you do not heat it up it will not flow well at all that being said I need to bring your heater over here and set up right here taking about one minute so if you guys got a minute there just grabbed a pipe grab a lighter pearl the [ __ ] you doing Phil common in the comment right there miss Foley I'm glad to have you here myself thank you so much and I will be right here [Music] like nothin ever happened right got here here turn a little bit so the noise is enough I'm super bad but it is what it is I hope you guys can still hear me I hope everything's hell yeah I do you want to see it you wanna see it you wanna see it this one right here do you want it do you really want it do you want it look it's awesome mmm these are almost real I bought off Amazon and for seaweedy to fill my part than the oils today I do as well I just got the whole system set up you just reminded me that my [ __ ] syringe tip I need to grab that son of a [ __ ] all right I know I'm bugging I'll come out and get it and do one okay the wines gonna come out do one real quick and she can sit down and enthused you just a second while I go take care of cleaning my [ __ ] tip because the oil is [ __ ] thick because I just did that video did everybody see that videos that I put out um I still hope that it helped some people out I thought it was really helpful if I'd have seen it whenever I was first refilling some cartridges whenever one went out and I just broke to some bits trying to get it apart instead of actually figuring out how the [ __ ] it works and come on push hard okay so Cassie's here everybody ready to say hi Cassie I'm from back here I just all you guys get to do is see the smoke nothing else I need abs and a tool and a lid I [ __ ] is hotter she just won one hot [ __ ] air like a [ __ ] right I know this is taking a long time to Marty fifteen minutes into it I'm sorry guys I know this is taking forever I apologize completely uh Emma you guys do over from the UK you guys tuned in at all I know this probably like tonight or some [ __ ] for you guys but that being said what we're going to do we are going to I'm cleaning out this goddamn thing I use it I use it to make that video and it got all gummed up if you guys don't clean your equipment in between uses it tends to gum up and it works like [ __ ] so please God don't do what I do and [ __ ] clean your goddamn equipment just clean your equipment not hard now I've lost a lot of people that's amazing I did that I did that live about three weeks ago yeah I do that I smoked the wedding cake I smoked the wedding cake cartridge in one sitting with my wife we sat down and we smoked it back and forth with a nitro collector using a dab cap it was uh it was brilliant it was absolutely brilliant okay now that this tip is clean I will be utilizing the built-in syringe that is used in these who filled these cartridges with it okay first things first I do have a custom cartridge stand um but I also have a couple different methods this is about the easiest one that I've come up with if you happen to find one of these laying around it's for 9-millimeter casings all right four nine millimeter but everybody nine millimeter this is what they come in these goddamn things they just they stand up and they're just [ __ ] so perfect they just fit right in there and they just stand up so [ __ ] good they don't [ __ ] fall out or nothing they don't [ __ ] fall out [ __ ] perfect [ __ ] yeah fell out thing cause I dropped with some of this but yeah you press them in there it's the [ __ ] works very very good very good okay now a tip like this and a syringe hover glass one can be found at Bay Park mark which is where I get all my bait supplies from and they are in the link in the description below bay parts marcom as well if you would like to improve the quality of the show or help contribute in any way check out the link down there for the patreon of double tears feel free to check them out no obligation but there are some wonderful prizes available as well that being said the first thing you do whenever you've got a cartridge you're trying to fill you unscrew the lid unscrew the lid a monster lid on each of these because I got 2 grams to fill so uh that's what I'm gonna be filling this is the distillate that we're gonna be using this one is the strawberry lemon-aid what I'm doing is I'm scoring up the top of this one because this one's the strawberry lemon-aid so when I open this one the mango and I mix them up because I'm [ __ ] stoned I'll know which one is which is there a better way of course there's a better way I just chewed on the [ __ ] thing yeah I could have got a marker and written on it if I wasn't a [ __ ] idiot but hashtag not a [ __ ] idiot you know what do you do this one as you can see this one is undamaged now I can mix them up readily and be like okay I know which is which always stinking always thinking now the mango flavored works out for total cannabinoids of 87 with a total THC of 73 the strawberry lemonade works off with the total cannabinoids of 87.9 a simple point to increase which is minimal and does not affect anything in my opinion with an actual THC total of seventy seven point three the seventy-three point two and the seventy seven point three that's about four percent that that can affect a little bit but when you're dealing with numbers this large if you're smoking hip and you're smoking weed that's got four percent THC there is a difference there but if you're smoking seventy three percent THC and seventy seven percent THC well you're smoking THC so they said as you can see these are come in and syringe with a threaded section there specifically to put a tip on it whenever it is nice and warm however if you can see there's a bubble in there and it's all graduated but I'm gonna do this is the chewed-up one this one has a bubble in there can you see that bubble in there it's on the bottom all right I'm gonna set this one up right here so you guys can watch and see if the bubble does rise up in that one which it won't it's it's pretty high-quality distally I rocket ition grot rocket ushion that's hard to say Joe are you doing my friend nice to see you how's it going thank you for joining my channel my friend what I do here is I spread a little bit of knowledge concerning the lovely world of cannabis and cannabis extracts right now what we're doing is I'm refilling I am filling two new cartridges these cartridges can be bought at bay parts marcom in the bottom with some distillate some THC distillate as you can see that bubble hasn't [ __ ] moved yet that I picked up for grand total I do is 12 and a half dollars give or take 10 or 15 cents twelve and a half dollars give or take ten or fifteen cents for the gram of distillate these are 77 percent THC and seventy-three percent THC we're really putting them into a cartridge we're gonna do the mango on the right and the strawberry are on the left I know this is cross corner of you guys but whatever like I said these are relatively thick and uh it needs to be heated up a little bit just to be able to flow you know not an overly a substantial amount but definitely a little bit definitely a little bit I have a heater over here that I'm using and one of the first things I do because I'm weird and I don't know if this really helps but this is the way I do it like my shirt oh gee cush Platinum boy I ran shadow what's up everybody boos Magoo man how you doing again again again all right so here it is I remove the little plastic cap that just screws on the screws off whoop take that off that is a plug that doesn't actually excrete anything you want to get rid of that [ __ ] this is completely useless much like tints on a rock you don't need any any tits on a rock and this isn't very good what you're gonna want to do is you're gonna want to utilize the tip that's using doing that why don't I do that just yet one of you first first and foremost I actually draw some air into the cartridge directly from in front of the heater this is some superficial [ __ ] at best but in my dumbass mind I think if I draw a warm air into it it will heat it up faster because you're a [ __ ] idiot we're total check out me I don't know so first thing I do is I draw some air into it and then I set it in front of that heater and just let it rotate I let it rotate right where my fingers are so that cylinder gets no harder than my fingertips now my fingertips can take a decent amount of heat but nowhere near what it would take to in any way compromise the plastic or the oil in that in that syringe so I'm not worried about burning it any more than I'm worried about actually burning my hands you know I'm saying my fingertips are pretty tough from smoking roaches and all that but when it comes down to it I'm not gonna let myself get burnt just holding this so that's how I basically keep it from getting overly warm possibly compromising there's the syringe in any way so this is actually pretty warm right here right now it's starting to flow I just see it's starting to flow down from the top just a little bit on the side there see you leveling out okay yeah now see you're starting to flow a little bit see that's that's how I do it as a heater some people will use a lighter or a torch or whatever the [ __ ] and that works out if your syringe is glass basically kind of use whatever the [ __ ] you want if your syringe is glass this this syringe is not glass for glass refilling syringes of high quality with the tip available a tip like this that will work in almost any cartridge they are available at the link in the description bate part smart comm that is vape part smart comm feel free to go check them out if you do use the link in the description I will get a little stipend of that and it is grateful for the channel to get that it's very grateful to you what the [ __ ] ever it's all he misses all words okay as you can see now this stuff is flowing a little bit kind of like like a little bit better you know what I'm saying oh yeah nice and warm that's what I do right before I do those refilling videos whenever you see me snap and come into picture I just brought it in from the heater so it's working it's working perfect so I I attached this tip to it just like this it goes in does a quarter turn boom it's on there it's on there I like to laid it down like this and then push some air out just so that it's in the top okay right there you've got your grab you've got your [ __ ] system right here you put your system into your system right like that and then you begin to dispense it and since it is warm it should have been so you come out pretty decent alright okay there we go that is topped off pull your cirrage out and you have a little area right there you see that where the oil needs to still get down in there but as you can see it is slowly moving in that area so it will flow right into there this cartridge itself is a little bit cool compared to the oil that I just pushed into it so as of right now that bubble isn't going to move I'm gonna have to heat it back up a little bit and all that good stuff but that's that's neither here nor there that's the way that one is so you can just touch this with a little bit of the tip there and you can see it's straight out like that the distillate is it's very thick [ __ ] it's like marshmallow [ __ ] fluff now simply take your lid place it right over that and screw it down once you've got it caught a little bit pull it out of your cartridge holder and there you have it there you see it has flowed a little bit down very little left as it goes into that area um this will be heated up and we'll give it about give it about a half an hour get it all nice and warm I'll use the heater again whenever I do it but this is just an example get it all nice and warm again and uh give it about a half an hour some people say five minutes some people say ten minutes some people are idiots so uh I'm gonna give it like I said thirty minutes before I even try to hit that day hit that bad thing so my wife came out and took the pin that I was choosing to smoke with um so what that comes down to is I'm gonna do another big dab here since I don't have my pin now those of you who've been watching from the beginning here's that bubble um if you're looking at the graduations you can see that bubble has moved approximately 2/10 of a mil in in the 20 minutes that we've been talking so we'll set that down right there and we'll keep that little experiment going okay now what I need to remember is that this cartridge right here is the mango first card I filled up is the mango will set it off to this side since it's on the right and this one's on the left we'll do that now I have this box sitting here viola I don't remember who I was speaking with on one of my lives but they said something about Humboldt County and I said uh Humboldt County hell yeah and I looked at this thinking that this possibly came from the Humboldt County area and for the life of me I think that it does but I'm not so sure now because the little exclamation point with the cannabis thing doesn't have a CA on it you know what I'm saying that doesn't have a CA on it now this says that this was done by rose any labs the testing lab is Rose City labs all testing data on those dates this was picked up when I went down to California and I think it was picked up in Northern California this stuff is absolutely amazing absolutely amazing one of the nicest concentrates I have ever smoked and I have smoked a fair amount of [ __ ] dope I'm just saying okay and this these guys right here I don't know if every single batch is as good as this but this [ __ ] live resin banana split this was on point like a point on the point you know what I'm saying like crazy crazy nice I'm gonna leave that right there just because they deserve a little bit of attention for what they're putting out that being said I'm gonna read a little bit I guess I don't know if that's what they call liquid marijuana or now but this is straight-up butane extracted hash oil that I'm smoking on right here and the liquid marijuana or the distillate that I've got right here is an oil and what that's done is they use a short path distillate by the way if you would like to expand your knowledge on the entire process about cannabis and the extraction process feel free to Google short path cannabis distillation it's very easy hit the Google microphone repeat the words short path cannabis distillation and they will show you a couple videos and a couple articles concerning the short path distillation process what it is is you take your extract which is generally any kind of cannabis extracted anything basically put it into a [ __ ] thing heat it up it eventually vaporizes it all be prized at different temperatures as it vaporizes it goes through a condensation tube and then it goes through some [ __ ] and then it just eventually um condenses into a bulb different temperatures you release different Turf and different molecules of the cannabis plant some people have five seven or three different chambers some go up one chamber and what you do is you just let it off gas until you hit your optimal temperature put the tube in collect it as it condenses in you will get your heavies which is the THC crystalline and depending on your process depending on how good you are at it depends on the purity of it it is it is what it is it's very intriguing it's very invigorating whenever you watch it and you think about it you're like holy [ __ ] really and that's basically how lots of things are condensed in a distillation process it's very very very very nice I'll do a video on it eventually when I have a little bit more hands-on knowledge I love the theory of it and I can explain the theory of it but when it all comes down to it without any actual hands-on knowledge like well what happens when you do this I [ __ ] really don't feel comfortable talking to you about a whole lot about it because I don't feel informed enough about it myself that makes sense fuckin'-a man all right here we go we're doing another dab on the damage right here this is some a in cream you know I don't even like saying that I don't like saying that at all [Music] so this is some crumble that we got from Black Diamond extracts they do decent job nine dollars and ten cents is what paid for this out the door nine dollars and ten cents out the door after taxes and discounts I'm pretty happy with it it's about a 70 percent THC wax they call it a crumple this one here is a wax cheers folks that's pretty good there is a little bit of harshness about it I mean you know it is a nine dollar crown you know not normally this is on sale but still need to understand that some companies do better work than others some companies have higher standards than others that's what it comes down to and some companies do a better job than others you're like hey man how can you get a decent concentrate for $9 a great deal how well there's a couple ways there's a couple ways sorry about that as you can see that bubble is almost 3/4 of the way up it has been about 35 minutes but that's the limits in there for 20 minutes I'm not gonna bow too much it but uh there you I'm pretty happy with the distillate though um yeah I actually don't like blunts at all let's have tobacco in them and I used to smoke cigarettes and now I can't I can't have any [ __ ] tobacco at all it's [ __ ] it's pretty lame it just it really it tastes bad to me and I'm not one of those guys that's like oh you smoke cigarettes well you should suck a dick no man you're a smoke cigarette smoke cigarettes I mean it's not like you don't know what's gonna kill you [ __ ] everybody's been telling [ __ ] everybody for [ __ ] decades and it's gonna [ __ ] kill you but everybody [ __ ] knows that's gonna kill you they did those commercials with the Marlboro Man and all that [ __ ] everybody knows I'm not [ __ ] I don't give a [ __ ] it's gonna kill you it's gonna key it's getting cait's gonna kill you my grandmother smoked for like 60 [ __ ] years she's lived to be 93 goddamn years old and she didn't die from cancer okay I'm just saying I'm not anti smoking I don't smoke I don't like I don't like how heavy it makes my chest I'm up I'm a pissy [ __ ] sorry coughing so art that's one of it that's a $9 gram okay see you got a little bit more [ __ ] on your chest you know you got a little bit more heavies in the in the hit it's not as pure it's not as it's not as nice that's why you pay three or four dollars more for your gram and then the upgrade just a little bit that's just that's that's what I'm saying folks just just that you know gingersnaps I'm having a decent day indeed indeed indeed I haven't had a good day in a long time I got four kids no I'm just kidding no never great day having a great day do a little bit of a live here I normally don't do anything on Sunday you know so I figured I'd pop on here got a friend of mine over and they wanted some distillate cartridges they're like man I really don't like paying the amount of money that they want for some distillate garbages I says you know what I got some cartridges here they're decent you know run over here we'll go down we'll go down by some really nice distillate at a decent price and uh I'll throw it into some cartridges for you I mean you're gonna have some decent babe cartridges at a decent price you know well it works out pretty good and it does you know even even if you were forced to buy these you know even if you were forced to buy these cars are just you know you go down you buy ten or something [ __ ] them you know you can generally get a decent cartridge a good I recommend going with good see sells you can use them two or three times and that cuts the price by a third but you get a good see sell cartridges if you only want one or two they can be about five bucks and that's that is what it is you know you get what you're paying for you can save money and buy cheaper cartridges if you want to save money by cheaper cartridges you could have a failure or they could not draw as well or I don't anything anyway you pick these up for about three or four bucks apiece right then you pick up this grandma distillate you know I got this gram discipline like I said I got it for $12 $12.50 you ever taste somewhere in there so you add that to the $3.00 you pay for this 15 bucks for a full one gram cartridge out the door you know whereas normally if I were to go down to buy a cartridge a decent cartridge even a cartridge from the guys that make this oil they still want eighteen to twenty dollars for a cartridge so you're paying six eight bucks just for that cartridge generally if you buy it in that manner then I just I don't need to do that I don't recommend doing that if you can get around doing that then do it as you can see now this is the same Boyle where that bubble didn't move at all I've been holding in front of the heater and as you didn't see that bubbles moving just fine now I'm gonna heat it up a little bit more and then I'll settle down and then I'll push all the air out then I'll load up this other cartridge and I'll let you guys get back to your day I do appreciate you guys joining in thank you so much it really means a lot to me and uh why I said if this helps you out or if you give a [ __ ] at all go ahead give a like on that thumbs up button down there and if you'd like to help contribute to the channel feel free to click the patreon link in the description and go check out some of my tears see if any of those rewards work for you I would appreciate it helps me out all right that being said we're drawing a little bit and then push out a little bit all right there we go once again we stick it all the way in to the bottom start to dispense the oil all right now do what there's a little bit all right so that being said and done so this is on the left this is the strawberry lemon-aid right here and this one on the right is the mango as you can see there's still a little bit of an air bubble right in there on that mango because I still haven't warmed up this cartridge it means II wind up let it sit in there whenever you've got some real good distillate you always want to do that whenever you see me doing my videos a lot of people like dude your videos three seconds long you take pure distillate you open it up you put in a cartridge then you start hitting it in [ __ ] thirty seconds dude there's a lot of cutting and pasting that happens there [ __ ] and my dumb ass standing in front of a heater for a minute while the [ __ ] cameras going going [ __ ] wildest goddamn [ __ ] feel better cuz I didn't heat it up enough that's why cuz I didn't heat it up okay um so yeah you don't see that all the time but all right at the base of each one of these mouthpieces there's a little silicone o-ring right there I'll make sure that squeezes out just enough to be completely flush with the outside so it's absolutely perfect um this right here with a little bit of an air bubble in it is the mangle and this one here is not as their differences but the mango is a little tiny bit lighter maybe a little bit tiny bit lighter maybe but that being said the mangos on the outside strawberry lemonade's one inch from the outside it's for my own benefit here you have it Oh Phillip a couple cartridges with a little bit discipline Oh hope you guys might be able to get a little bit of use out of that you know um I know it's not not everybody's gig but it's exactly what I do and uh it's how I make [ __ ] roll a lot easier and a lot smoother for me now I have got all of this done for approximately twenty-five dollars to one gram cartridges full of seventy seven percent THC distillate where the bubble don't [ __ ] move at all at all at all for a total of $25 $25 so you know for me this is the ideal way to do it okay you get a hundred bucks together you go down you buy [ __ ] what 9 grams of distillate you know if you've got a good C cell cartridge you pay five bucks down right now and you can use that three times you can fill that [ __ ] up three different times I can do it I try to do them never more than four but I never tell people more than three they've got a very good failure rating and that failure rating doubles or triples every time you reuse that but it's so low it doesn't even get to 1% by the time you're using it four times that's that's that's math anyway um maybe some reading real quick Daniels dude [ __ ] I'm a stretch to spit out some fold eyes I'm gonna [ __ ] just kidding I'm gonna do it dad's then we need the [ __ ] out of Dodge don't you worry about it we'll try to each phone in line what's the difference receiving Ewing oil and that stuff well here we go the difference between CBD oil and this stuff is to be exact this is oil if you look at these little numbers on the back the actual CBD that this has is 0.4% CBD all of these have a completely different THC v CBL CBC CBD CBN all these are different properties and molecules and components components of the cannabis plant each one of these components of the cannabis plant activates or utilize the different neuron or part of your brain to do [ __ ] you understand what I'm saying some of these are for nausea some of them are for making your [ __ ] pucker some more forget you [ __ ] high someone for me to get high longer okay that's just a scientific and I can get into that if you want to but that's a completely different video the main difference between lists in CBD oil I can buy this exact same package with a different flavor from a different plan that is 70% CBD in almost zero THD that's the difference they come from different plants therefore they extract a different material and that way this is a strike THC that they would attract CBD and that's the way that works very very baseline is that better you guys could have told me to [ __ ] turn that heater off and any [ __ ] kind and I don't listen to you fool it's just like right here anyway [ __ ] it's quiet now let's do a DAB somebody out there is running chainsaw leaves goddamn Christmas time one month while the [ __ ] eejits all right so here we go we're dabbing on some alien cream I still don't like the name of that right hey you should with some an alien cream in your [ __ ] rig right Wow really really that doesn't sound good at all I don't I don't know I

"[Music] yo yo yo what's up everybody welcome back to the tnc spot bringing you an exclusive product well not exclusive but i guess this is a fresh drop um you can luckily uh i stayed down the street from connected cannabis so i stay going there to get their little fresh deal so this is their cured resin all right cured cake uh cultivated uh april 27 this year so not too long ago total cannabinoids 95 that's pretty freaking high total thc is 76.9 4.1 total cbd so that's a pretty good mix and you know what for the price you can't you can't go wrong thirty dollars tax included for four grand not bad but you know how how it is you know you you get what you pay for so you know but it does come from a reputable brand i'm not bashing on the product this we can go this is hybrid skywalker og friendly farms i [ __ ] with them they got some good stuff i already opened it i just kind of want to show you guys you know the packaging looks like super legit packaging yep they grow their own stuff and whip it all up so 30 bucks can't go wrong for some clean meds with it skywalker og program [Music] smells pretty good so uh quick uh detail on that this ain't like live resin this cured resin from what i know it comes from dry herb like basically once it's cured so it's cured resin which uh which makes it uh which makes it easier with the process it makes it an easier process to make so that's why we can put a good price point on it you know so that makes sense 30 bucks but what i like is that you know it's from a trusted brand you know you're gonna be smoking some good i got my double quartz coil freshly cleaned i cleaned it out every couple days with a iso alcohol rubbing alcohol 70 and up i got 99 i got a 99 alcohol so i get my atomizer in there overnight let it dry for another night and then i try out new products on it so let's go ahead and load some of this up in there i'm about to go into work i've been uh working this new job it's pretty cool a lot of logistics a lot of mental work so i get to step out and smoke or vape whatever i gotta do no one's tripping because it's just me by myself but yeah skywalker og let's try out the cured resin affordable price 30 bucks a gram that's not freaking bad i'll put it at a medium setting i'm gonna put it at three point no 2.8 let's go with 2.8 so uh there it is shout out to connected cannabis for always hooking up their discount their dope loyalty all program [Music] [Music] pretty tasty pretty tasty kind of reminds me of their carts the friendly farm carts yeah very freaking similar some of the taste so if you try the cart it's very similar but in of course the cake form smooth not harsh at all pretty sweet flavor doesn't have that sauce flavor so you expect that sauce flavor you getting the wrong product so that's how i'm getting out of that i love this little piece you're not open i've had the back of this battery for like over a year don't worry how solid hits i'm getting i'm gonna load up a fresh one though so it doesn't taste chirpy though don't go thinking you're gonna get max tarps the [ __ ] is terpe you know to a certain level like 5 out of 10 terpe but it tastes like the plant it tastes like the [ __ ] plant kind of like you know how live rosin has its own flavor towards like once it like burns in the coil or the uh with the atomizer it gives you that flavor that just tastes like real marijuana in your [ __ ] mouth it's kind of how it tastes so and and the high is pretty [ __ ] good i feel uh more of a body high i'm starting to feel a little euphoria kicking in which you get that out of skywalker oh gee this is straight up skywalker og only nothing else friendly farms they're pretty dope they're [ __ ] packaging damn total cannabinoids 95 yeah that's pretty [ __ ] high all right y'all so i got it loaded let's go ahead and turn up the top the tap on that let's go ahead and turn it up okay there it goes all right we put at the uh the setting below the

don't know if you can tell but yeah it has like this like dark green color to it as you can see I'm usually going for the lighter looking strains but you can still see the trichomes are glistening all over the string that little part down there it's like well I didn't know what to expect when uh I saw the lineup in the genetics but uh just going off it looks like I said this string looks very different to me but you can't always judge a book by it's cover because looks have nothing to do with I was going to taste so don't ever get that you know those two things confused I mean damn it is a shiny the smell off of this is really like like cakey like almost sweet in a way so it makes it seem like it's gonna be a delight to smoke you know and it almost looks like way I can't especially

how to explain it it's like thanks like that drill you got back in the day it's some good [ __ ] though very very good very similar to Skywalker when you smoke it in my opinion extremely pushy so I wanted to read up a little bit of facts about it though guys I started looking online guys and on Leafly they have it as crescendo RB x1 and it says it's bred by ethos genetics no surprise to that so it's a cross between Tim Dogg I 95 and Mandarin cookies very very good so to say that Gibbs on a sweet cookie dough flavors I can't see the cookie dough but I can definitely see the citrus aromas and the gas eNOS and the cookies it is a little sweet and it does have like a more prominent type of pine smell to it and taste to it very very good though so we're gonna read off a couple of reviews and see what some folks got to say about it alright guys let's go ahead and jump into this joint while we read off a couple other reviews super-good at 22 guys very good rolled up I see it could be in good one tweak to probably want some overs out there so let's move on to a couple of these reviews guys first one is felt obligated to give this training proper review and just started getting on my mister truly if you're in Florida now that we have medical this is hands-down my favorite indica strain me and my wife are both indica people that tastes the smell and everything tens across the board

it looks and smells I will grab it every chance I get now that's a bold statement that's awesome I'm loving it guys the effects from it are super relaxed guys I'm like she would want to lean back on that couch lock mood oh man it's so similar to a Skywalker guys it's insane super tasty oh I love it what you guys smoking on today and have you tried crescendo let me know down in the comments also we're gonna go ahead and jump over and knock out this last review so picked up this morning from truly another one got it from truly you've got it in a distillate syringe filled my bait pod up with it smooth creamy smoke tastes like sweet cookies very physically relaxing high it is it really is it's really good stuff oh man so it does come up as a highbreed if you look it up online but I mean that's gonna differ on phenotypes are things like that growing circumstances and all that stuff I I definitely feel like it is that nicka though it's very very chill I don't feel like I'm gonna go to sleep though I just feel very very Mel very nice I love them really really digging this one so I'm not gonna keep you guys for too long appreciate you guys watching shut us to all the new and old

try them off for you if you like rap you will like my nose now let's tear the show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with blueberry buddy review check it out so I rolled up a nice fat joint of it we're gonna do a nice analyzation of it and see how good the buds that I'll pull them out so you can take a good look at it and yeah we'll just give it a nice review and see if it actually tastes like blueberries to see how strong the taste is I'm telling you right now it does have a strong smell I already smell through the bag and it is a very heavy blueberry type of small to be honest like most blueberry type of strains and whatnot they don't really smell like blueberry at all or anything like that or they might have a Jenna flu or something but this one actually don't have like a ton of blue or anything that just looks very nice but it has a very strong like a blueberry type of smell really to it so let's light it up and see if it goes with the taste [Music] to be honest it actually does that's really really good and it does have a very fresh taste to it as well what's up world I just wanted to interrupt real quick to let you know we reach three under subs now so my next video coming out soon is going to be how to toke episode 5 I believe but I'm going to be showing you how to smoke weed out of one of these it's a Japanese not.we so what I'm going to be doing I'm going to be making a smoked little place a device out of one of these and show you how back to the review but it actually does have a very strong blueberry like a taste to it it tastes very nice and it came with very nice juicy buds as you can tell it tastes very good it didn't bust out too bad so let's take a close look at the bud so you can see that it's very it's a lighter colored green but it has a very nice layer of crystal on it I hope that you guys can see it good it does look very nice and it really does have like a blueberry type of smoke - it's pretty delicious smelling actually and it has very very like light colored airs - it looks very delicious you can tell that it was grown very well and that's not even the biggest bud there's bigger buds than that in there so that is a decent account that's about 6 grams it's supposed to be so really really nice account and after this I'm going to be doing gorilla tuna it looks very delicious as well so keep your eye out for that that's gonna be coming out soon as well but we'll jump back to this review so I'm going to fix the run that's going on a little bit and I want to show you guys my bird so check this out [Music] that's a little baby Bluebird that I found walking it fell off of a tall building so there's no way I could have put it back in its nest so I got it a nice cage and everything and it's doing really well now see so I'm not sure what I've got to name him yet you guys maybe could put some let me know in the comments what you think I should maybe name him I was gonna name a piggy I thought he was a pigeon at first but we searched it up and he's a baby Bluebird so what you think I should name him let me know I'm not quite sure yet but we'll jump back to this review I'm gonna give the taste I'm gonna give the taste a nice I'm gonna give it on I'll give it a nice five actually if that's taste really well the account gonna give it a nice five as well this blueberry buddy is really good strain I do like it I'm trying not to give it to hyper rating but it is just all about good so I'm gonna give it a 5 out of 5 it's really good it tastes like blueberry like it said well at least like it encourages that the guys you know blueberry but do you think that they find the taste like so very so it does I give that a check it's very good all-around good account see this is the same amount as this they're both good accounts though so I'll give it a overall fun cuz it tastes really good good account you know we're not quite done disjoint but I'm starting to feel pretty good already so I'll give it a thought I definitely recommend the blueberry buddy if you get a chance to try it Oh or if you already have let me know in the comment section if you liked it as much as I did there may be somebody who ever grew that type of strain that you had maybe didn't do it it's good but this one is very good so I'll keep with the rating of five and does taste like like very freshly - and I'll book my pushback down in the description like I always do I'll look up some facts about it and put it down in the description so you can know a little bit more about it as well and I also still have Blue Dream is gonna be coming soon and pink I would pink so it's solid pink they're both gonna be coming soon so I really hope you are all doing good and got some good stuff to smoke of your own and let me know what some of your favorite streets are or what you think that I should try out next always look at this good [ __ ] to try out always try not know if it's trains and good concentrates and whatever else I'd like I think that you guys might want to see I'm gonna try to grab so I really do appreciate everybody spends time over here at juveniles and all I really do and I hope you all are doing good but I got lots more videos so you can stay for show so bust up some more fish to roll and watch another show now I'm glad to know this is my plant progress week six as you can tell most of them are growing some very nice-looking hairs on them now and that they're doing very good starting to look very nice these taller ones are on week six with these smaller ones they're on their week five so they should be about this size by next week about so that's how they're doing you", "G4ZNqMG6tUY": "my girlfriend came in here she was like it smells like [ __ ] [ __ ] and i was like thank you so much i just picked this up [Music] got my slide packed up with some gmo just got this brand new bong from cloud products figured we'll start the video off with a nice bong rip that shit's fire we're gonna be talking about gmo today i absolutely love this strain the first time i found out about it was in colorado and ever since then i've been such a big fan i always stock up on it when i see it at the dispensary typically you don't want anything that's grown with gmos but this is actually a good gmo this stands for garlic mushroom and onion so that probably gives you a good idea for the smell this strain is also known as garlic cookies it's a super unique strain and it's very popular most people are on the gmo bandwagon right now the hype is totally justifiable though just look at these buds the buds are multiple layers of green hints of purple in there too dark orange hairs and just layers upon layers of trichomes like this butt is so crystally just playing with it you'll have resin on your fingers you don't even have to break it up like it is so [ __ ] dank and the buds are all super small and dense and they're all shaped like thin and long they're not like big dense fluffy nuggets they're like almost kind of popcorny like i bought an entire ounce of this and this was the biggest nug i found in the entire thing a lot of the calyxes are like super beautiful and purple and there were so many calluxes in there i was actually able to pack an entire bowl of galaxies there's really no benefit to doing this but i feel like it has a nice asmr vibe to it there's no doubt that gmo is a super high quality strain however i did find a seed while i was breaking this up but that's something you can kind of blame on the grower more than the strain but this stuff has a very strong high i [ __ ] love it got another pool of the gmo packed and ready to go i've seriously been loving this new line of glass that called products dropped they have like five or six new pieces both of the ones that i'm smoking on this video are from them you can go to cloudproducts.com if you want to check them out let's just appreciate this function real quick gmo is an indica dominant hybrid it's a cross between girl scout cookies and chem dog which are two super popular strains which is another reason why this one's so popular i just love that gassy rank odor like well it's called gmo for a reason it has a straight up garlic mushroom and onion smell it is not something you'd think would be pleasant but for some reason with weed those weird ass smells just smell great it's definitely got a funk to it let me just warn you even before it's being smoked like i just cracked one of these jars the other day my girlfriend came in here she was like it smells like [ __ ] [ __ ] and i was like thank you so much i just picked this up there's something about weed that just makes something that's like rancid as hell that wouldn't be appealing to the news all of a sudden like a beautiful aroma have you ever driven past the dead skunk and been like damn did someone just spark up when you grind up gmo it hasn't even crazier scent it's like super super garlicky mixed with rotting fruit the scent of the strain is really what separates it from the rest the high is great too but there's no strain i've smelled quite like gmo let's finish this bowl up [Music] it really packs a punch the effects are like super euphoric and really last a long time this specific patch is running at about 30 thc which actually isn't too surprising for gmo i don't think i've ever seen it run below 25 i'm not somebody who buys weed based off the thc level but you're not gonna find gmo testing at a low thc percentage gmo definitely is the popcorn stamp of approval i highly recommend you checking out this strain if you ever see it at the dispensary we're gonna pack one more up and call this a video let me know which stream you guys want me to review next by the way gmo is definitely highly recommended [Music] that was nice and it really is a smooth strain but thank you guys so much for watching click like if you enjoyed this video you probably did if you made it this far subscribe for more videos i got a lot more on the way and don't forget leave a comment let me know what strain i should review next i'm sad i only have this much gmo left right now but thanks again so much for watching my name is jeff peace", "3V4wLZjxwY8": "what's going on you too so I made a video last night and I had some technical difficulties so be sure to hang out you can see it you guys really didn't miss too much but all you really missed is me talking about my ingredients and watching me putting it in and all that stuff but other than that you guys are good and check it out additive you're gonna add to your base very very strong you don't want to kind of make do all this and have it just you know you have to eat 10 candies to do whatever you're trying to do you want to make it worth it spend the money put the effort in and I assure you it'll be well worth it in the end so it's been about four and a half five minutes now and we are just crossing 240 degrees so I like I said this doesn't happen super fast it but once we hit around 270 degrees it will start moving a little bit a little bit faster so when you're flavoring with this recipe you want to use one of these kind of bottles you can get them at a Seymour Michaels any arts of crest or you can get them at Walmart when I went to Walmart they only have peppermint cinnamon and that's not my thing but right here I have cherry and I have an orange oil that I like to add so usually if you're going to say if you're going for lollipops or like life savers or anything like that flavor to get that exact flavor like they come out like it comes out of their factory you want it for this recipe when you use a half of one of these bottles and a half of orange oil bottle and it'll taste just like you bought some lifesavers what the orange oil does adds a little citrus and it just gives a little brightness to it but you don't need that I did a batch with just watermelon and you know I loved them they tasted great it wasn't super watermelon flavored and to be quite honest with you I hate the flavor of water now so these these oils then they they taste great but I know you're probably wondering why you don't add it now so you have it all incorporated it's all said and done well this is a different kind of liquid than what we got going on here obviously so if you added this to a 320 degree sugar base and this will probably burn out see they want you to wait till 250 degrees to add your additives if your flavoring but I feel like that is just way too late of a weight I like to do at almost 275 degrees you're gonna deal a little more heat when you gives you a little bit more time because once you add this stuff this is going to cool down drastically and fast so and one thing you don't want to do with this is mix it around a bunch because if you think if you live in New Jersey you walk along the boardwalk what do they make in salt water taffy so you keep stretching the sugar adding air adding air what's it gonna turn into a taffy it's not going to be as much of a hard candy it's gonna keep out again it's gonna it could turn into a candy corn which is honestly not a bad texture in itself either but it just now we're done for right now well what I like about doing these little candies and gummies and stuff like that is these molds there's so many damn cool molds that you can pick up like a robot dude here it got lollipops dinosaurs and it's like pixelated dinosaurs are pretty cool I seen Super Mario Batman ones like Legos you can actually take the Lego ones and build with them so there's like really cool stuff you could be doing with candy and if you get really good at it you know pull your kids aside and you can do a day with the kids and show them how to make the favorite candies and kids blown away that you can actually make this yourself it'll definitely be way more impressed with this than a batch of cookies that Pillsbury makes just don't have any funny business to it so we're crossing about nine minutes now it's a nine 10 minutes and we are hitting 250 degrees so in about four minutes we only went about ten degrees so once we're all mixed up and our basis set we add our additives we add our flavoring the name of the game is speed and just I don't want to say steady hand because if if you know me I am the last guy to ever have a steady hand you can people will hand me a 2 ounce ladle got a 2 ounce souffle cup and say fill up some butters just the laughs at me because I shake but for some reason I can do this pretty well but you want to almost come down and just go in a line 1 1 1 1 1 if you're just all over the place you're going to lose quite a bit of what you're doing here and nobody wants that but I would say 1 to 2 ounces for this batch usually I do a 2 cup of sugar 1 cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water and so I'll do it it's basically a double batch of this that I would do 2 to 4 ounces but this I think 1 1 2 2 maybe 2.5 ounces will be good all right it's been about 4 4 minutes later and we are just hitting 290 degrees so I'll check back up at the end a couple of minutes all right it's about 3 minutes later and now we just hit hard crack we're at 300 degrees so most people will want to go to 310 but we're going to 320 so I'll check back when we get there well it's about 30 seconds later we're at 310 so we're almost there so get ready all right so we hit 320 degrees so now what we're gonna do is so now this is a so now this is a hard Canyon and it's going to be very hard it's not going to be questionably hard and it's not going to be and it's not gonna lose its hardness from what we had so now we wait until about 270 degrees and we're gonna add about one to two ounces of whatever additive you're gonna add and your flavor so we'll check back in about five minutes when we get there so what I like to use to make my my tinctures or if whatever I'm going to make the most is I'd like to use either a leave o or a magical butter machine the the two of them it's it's perfect the you can perfectly adjust the temperatures and you could really make it long and really strong or you can make it really fast and get you get it done fast so if you're looking for a way to do it without having to you know use mason jars and stuff like that look into buying a leave out or a magical butter machine those two things makes the process so much easier and not just easier but it makes it stronger and enough of talking we're there so now that we're at 270 degrees we got to move fast so speed and accuracy is the name of the game now do not let any sugar touch you so first get all your stuff ready because you're gonna add at one shot so I'm gonna add my flavoring to my additive half I want of the cherry I'm gonna do and I'm gonna do half of the orange oil now people like to do food coloring and all that you don't have to I don't like it because I just don't like the I like the natural color that you get so this part you don't mix too much the more air you're gonna add the worse off it's gonna look so you got to be fast go okay so we're all mixed up don't know what to do let's go and then we pour accuracy now look guys I have super shaky hands and I'm go it's all about accuracy if you tried to reheat this it would still work but it's not gonna be as clear its goal is is clarity and just like I said if you reheat it you're gonna be mixing it again so you're going to add more air the more air you add the different the texture is gonna get try some of these but a nice steady pour and you could if and when we look you're going to tell that we didn't even have that much waste so this a little bit I got here and the rest I got here I can reheat and I can make other candies so what we'll do now is we're gonna is we'll wait and I'll give it about it don't take long about three minutes five minutes and these things will be rock-hard and check them out so check back in a minute all right everybody we're all done so let's take a look at what we got just like that all you gotta do is pop them out and move and look these things they're rock-hard they don't stick together nothing and you're really that worried you can get some powdered sugar and you're good look at that perfect so I got these little robot guys so many cool things you could do and I got these little dinosaurs so what I like to do is I like to have little ones and I like to have full-size ones because a lot of ones honestly where you're gonna find yourself like in these little small ones the best at least the parquet knees but like I said guys super easy super fast and anybody can do this you've got to get yourself two simple ingredients throw it all together and you're home free you can take these out in the lake with you and your fish and boom you're good but if you guys like what you saw today leaving a like subscribe don't forget to check me on instagram at the edge a chef and a lot of big things happening this week with medical edibles calm which I will be announcing later in the week so definitely be on the lookout for that because there's some big things happening I appreciate you guys watching and as always smoke on", "OqQv4CGMoUY": "[Music] this gorgeous out Saturday the sun is shining birds are chirpin and as you can see we've got a pre-roll here from Edison so city lights it's called critical push it's actually a hybrid between a critical mass and OG Kush so I don't have a lot of love for Edison and given the previous products we've tried but yes there is a number it's where is it I just this two point three five milligrams what's up seventy nine point five milligrams for the whole joint 0.35 milligrams of CBD which is weird they never used milligrams instead of percentages before I've noticed anyway I did not need that my apologies everyone I will mute my phone now shame people shame I really do with my Senators wind up right great nice such a hot anything and I found to doing one quick with prohibition blend something and that this one to smoke good containers are sealed like saying no it totally works in it yeah sealed like that was pretty neat defined yeah and then sealed in a box as well with the tax label still on it and you know a stupid motion you had to go through yeah yeah that's an alpha motion I don't recommend well I mean you know for people who like the RJ is the way to go you got a half a gram joints pre-rolled and it's a beautiful rural joints like it is I can't machine perfect yeah that's an inch-long filter yeah if you don't smoke the much cuz you're gonna pee RJ's with you and your buddy then no one [ __ ] up the end yes yeah true well let's see I'm excited for this one because as you know I've got a soft spot for pushes yeah I don't really understand why protocol pushes a hybrid and not just straight up dominant evening I didn't know there let there's parents and such when I think push they're always just happy and because so makes me wonder about this one and its Addison because I like crush yes exactly yeah push was always the big thing it still may be but you know there's so many new brands and stronger brands out there like yeah I would like to check that out actually yeah it's got a nice flavor anyway you know little light littler key well no citrusy there - is it it's 9:00 a.m. so as I left my house I brushed my teeth and I'm haven't stopped getting all the taste so yeah that's fair this makes sense no person thing to do in the morning they probably should break your shitty knees oh yeah yeah here we are but I can tastier than this but not much else it's a better smoke yeah that's why I get food you have good quality rolling papers but I've never been one to christen joints it's just never been something I've ever gotten do I know a lot of people who do I don't really find it ever makes much of a difference even though stocks your smoke becomes as baptized this [ __ ] right out somehow THC is just like I said anything we tried was a lost rod and yeah the other Edison products we've tried I not been impressed with at all they've you know I I think they're gearing themselves more towards a an open area smark --it so you know people are just getting into smoking or trying out but you know that seems to be where they position the position themselves just given the quality of the weed I've tried so far I don't think we write home about this one either yeah my friend little really like she she gets this and she enjoys it that's a good you know activity joint but I'm not why would it push I believe that's a confusing name to put on a critical issue they can put you in the [ __ ] ER Wow their their actual Brandi and the city lights so you know critical push given us name [ __ ] yeah I mean you can expect more I'm starting to get a bit of but though this is definitely gonna be like a 20 minute and see ya it'll be a surprise yeah and it's beautiful day now but the Rough Riders are playing today you'll see tonight yeah Buster's next weekend but the Natalie weekend yeah yes yes buskers and hellofax next weekend for anybody who's interested the fest of the buskers festival used to be so much better though like they used to go on for like a week or two and then I don't know if they had as she was getting more like street performers maybe it's just not that prevalent an occupation anymore I would have to think it's not you hired you didn't hire nice together yeah you would think not that's always hard to tell you know you don't really know how the demographics hold up when that kind of work [ __ ] [ __ ] that's the demographics looking for some yard sales nothing interesting no um nothing that looks like clumps it together or community they're all like scatter all over the place the handful that were there you're better off picking out like an old highway and just [ __ ] going along there's always there's old yard sales on the old highways just the question of picking the right one at a time you know we can do better very true very true the Internet should provide that sort of information or perhaps a local newspaper website we still have a little newspaper yeah and is it still printed yes all right I don't know where how much they still have paper copies it is I'm gonna miss I'm gonna miss print media when it's gone my books I have a lot of books it took up a lot of boxes they do they're really heavy libraries are good books or business they're long lasting medium like before our digital media is very temporary yeah and like paper you can sort of keep around the last a few hundred years and then the other problem with some of the digital media is like accessing it long-term like who's gonna look out for the server say Sergio cities Yeah right but there's a lot of stuff there that was an interesting part of the internet especially for place in the time yeah it's driven don't call the thing for the server's no exact here yeah whereas a book would still be out there in some way exactly yeah there's some benefits but like I like that doesn't weigh anything even make the letters big no especially my volume thing yeah all your DV books are awesome all your D&D books on the iPad are probably a lot easier no I don't like looking through a D&D books it's just yeah I mean you know where you're going cuz you have a book so well regardless so for anybody who plays the India out there I don't know we might be the only ones left but yeah you know I started playing in junior high you know I stopped after high school and then I just started up like I stopped enjoying it one video games got good it's the point where I really happen behind the scenes say oblivion style you got that all right it's all of three yeah good master to friends to fight with an [ __ ] try to tweak the rules just play along I got that yeah so you listen up yeah I think we'll give about twenty will be well you won't notice anything well you know better much better than expected actually I'm finding the creeper now no no for sure really desperate smoke another joint cuz I'm not stalling yeah exactly very much woman chattier than I ever would expect for a push well for an indica at all I mean you know yeah it's labeled hybrid I guess which is why I like the name setting on wood even though they've rebranded it shouldn't have the word cushion there you would think so but you know they call it what were the two parents it was critical mass and og cush yeah Mogi lights mass yeah the push really has expectations to it that I'm not getting yeah for sure see why people enjoy this for sure I recommend you know it's good for it's a creeper for sure but I mean even for for our low to moderate users it'd be you know I'm like you're sharing this would be good for you to be happy with coach lot three people and I'm all [ __ ] on know exactly you know it's a good it's a good social lead for sure um I'm called seven and a half seven yeah I can't disagree with that yeah very enjoying its money no that's enjoyable for sure just porn name yeah yeah but I think there's something with with naming strain like having to give strains yeah all right well thanks for coming out everybody and like and subscribe and become a [ __ ] today", "NN5GlVnEE-s": "[Music] love you too thank you for tapping in whether you subscribe or you searched for this product either way I'm glad I came across this today I picked me up some alien cash buy buddies indica there's one other well it's one of their strongest ones they usually range from 7 D THC to like 85 80 89 this is 87 total THC super indica alien Kush with 1.20 of limonene it gives you their little terpene profile in the back ingredient cannabis concentrate only nothing knows no fillers I see a lot of people are speaking highly of buddies I have to agree I've been on them for quite some time now I believe where he went for like more grams yeah yeah yeah I've been going through his stuff like crazy and it actually sugars up like on the flag inside the cart at the very end it gets all Dimond up so you up liquid live diamonds live resin up liquid diamonds it is my buddies alien fish and we're gonna go ahead and open this up at the end I'm gonna post a picture of one of the cards that I had prior to this which was the Durbin poison I've been going through it probably for like a week and a half you go straight see the diamonds like and the sugar inside it looks crazy so that's how you know these besides ain't playing pretty reputable brand and they range from like 40 45 to 55 a gram which is not bad for sauce in a cart I've been stopped [ __ ] with the distillates but hey I got nothing against this tool it's just personal preference now look at that look at that amber color that's our live resin that goes the buddy's logo then we got their their own parts check this out they got the little Callie and cram it in the back no sticker straight up there look at that color pretty good stuff like I said I went through like four of their grams already and I haven't been disappointed now this one yep 87 87 THC so it's pretty up there 49% and 0.49 be mercy 0.24 Lionel ooh I mean I know what these terms are all about so uh packaging is pretty dope always on point mission statement on the side full grand shout out to friendly farms for the free battery low voltage I believe it's at 2.2 right now and my present should be intended to vape I hope you guys are taking the music in the background that's all me every time you see a video of mine it won't be my own beat in the back so uh yeah nice color there [Music] I've never gotten a running cart from them it always just sticks right there just stays didn't move like molasses I gotta add the lowest setting there it is buddy's alien fish indica zero point zero zero CBD oh here we go by the way check that out that's the Durban poison after a week and a half you see the Barney's so yeah I've been recommending the brand for sure it's freaking on point with the price and whatnot so buddy's much respect to you guys for bringing some of the clean meds that are affordable and super delicious I can't wait to you guys get in other states some on the top for other people you know so enough talk let me go ahead and take some rips of this [Music] [Music] marry tasty super turkeys super turkey why pay $80 for a gram when you can pay 40 to 50 for some super [ __ ] fire wow I've never tried their alien fish this is it straight tastes just like the plant straight like it almost reminds me of like rosin you know how it leaves that plant flavor in your mouth that's this very similar friendly farms if anything I'm gonna say many people are gonna hate me for it but I personally will choose buddies over friendly farms this shit's been [ __ ] tasty don't get me wrong I'm just giving you guys my quick opinion that's just what it's been lately with the price break and all that praise when mattering a lot so [Music] [Music] super cushy straight-up you can taste the [ __ ] plant very very very earthy very good flavor smooth doesn't make you in a cough I recommend you to take small drags you know three to five second pools at the most you know get the flavor out of it you want to get the terpenes and before the fact I feel it straight up going to my brain right now into my body making my eyes feel a little lower so it's been a couple of hits that inhales so mom Wow kind of like if I'm hitting a rig like on low tent paper vapor production is pretty freakin strong as you can see I'm barely even taking drags and straight bringing clouds very light drags just look at her head and they seem to last I had this other one for a week and a half and I just been dragging it oh I work at night this is a team of Durbin poison so it definitely helped me out this is the indica I'm feeling [ __ ] high that was like what four hits leaves a good aftertaste I feel like each hit I'm getting a different note on herbs which is a good thing like it's freaking good because I like the taste of herb you know you don't want to taste some [ __ ] that's like fruity or like you taste artificial things you know this is straight herbal stuff and it smells I smell it in the car right now smell saucy yeah that's what it is liquid diamonds y'all buddies go do some research on them the prices they carry sugars they carry live diamonds very very euphoric high absolutely [ __ ] high FL lift it take another hit [Music] those Terps are on point yeah as you guys see I haven't caught once it's been very very subtle on my lungs very smooth I highly recommend it I approve of it just trying to show you guys their sativas are little lighter like a little yellow er I notice that but they're all still live resin you know just like this [ __ ] like that's that different poison you can see the diamonds in there we got this alien fish is very very euphoric if you want to feel really really relaxed and that euphoria through the roof this is it I'm like ready to go into work and face my supervisors but it's nothing they're super chill I'm used to dealing with people and I'm super medicated yeah and I mean my body feel relaxed right off the back I like the little protector it comes with you that keep the best ones going in and I've been keeping my cart if I don't use them for like a couple hours inside of the container just to keep everything fresh you know I don't want the terpenes to get exposed just a little tip Wow yep I've been pleased for buddies I'm high as [ __ ] I wish I provide it I hope I provided how you guys the information that I had provided so 87.3 CHC liquid diamonds live pressing straight tasted Erb very tasty manufactured by hash tag extracts whatever that is that's probably the company that makes it for them as young guys someone you guys may know these companies outsource production you know they oversee everything but they do a good job 3% terpenes everything's in the back all right job so I hope that was helpful hopefully I can rinse the guys to get some 18 inches my buddies check them out thank you guys for watching peace like and subscribe", "N5uT2n_7mUE": "[Music] hey what's up 4/20 family cows coming back at you guys we got another product for interview we're looking at some new stuff it's been a little bit since we've been here with the strain of you guys but I'm coming at you guys with this cushko or cush company oh gee so you guys aren't familiar with Jenny's defense rate they are in north las vegas location here in vegas for us they are the recreational and medical dispensary here in las vegas now I will say this they they got some really fluctuating prices roughly between concentrate versus flower however they do have good quality product at all times so I haven't been disappointed in too many things everything any issue I have had has been handled wonderfully by the staff so I don't really have too many thing negative things to say so keep that in mind guys so we're gonna go ahead and take a look at this guy's it's not a yeah you know nothing super to be able to pull out but as you guys saw in the clip at the beginning you know you guys got a closer bond it's a little frost it's not bad so oh what am I look at that like go ahead we're gonna throw them into our nice Phoenician grinder and hit it with this dryness [Applause] [Music] there are some buds in here we're gonna go ahead and grind some of these up this is good company's og og cush basically Jenny's dispensary guys make sure to check out my BR in the Vegas area let him know who sent you tell those like cows came by you know they might hook you up you never know see nice break all right okay so we're gonna go over we're gonna load up Travis Bolin I like this little bolts a good uh it's a good a good piece of my opinion want to get this movie started so of course you guys know how I do things here I like to hit everything with a review by doing the looks smell taste and of course the high so first and foremost for looks as you guys saw to be getting in a video in that clip it was a little frost it's not too big now so because they are popcorn eggs I'm gonna go ahead I'm gonna give it a six out of ten simply just because it hasn't who doesn't have a fat big you know braids and I like personally now that does not mean the flour has anything wrong with it don't judge it from anything silly like that so it looks six out of ten now if we go into the smell the smell has a lot of that citrus a lot of limonene you could tell us than this in the Terps now unfortunately I don't have the sticker for it so but I do remember being in the high teen THD nineteen not th da but THC was what it was testing roughly eighteen nineteen percent if I remember correctly if anybody happened to actually pick this up let me know down below just in case you guys might know the actual pretendin here that'd be awesome help everybody out there so check it out Jimmy's dispensary guys so as far as the smell it has a very citrus aroma a lot of pungent you know since they just kind of jump out in gravity that's a really fun fact so with this one I would have to go ahead and say with the smell I gotta give me at least a 7 out of 10 because it just has such a wonderful fragrant it's something I would want to go and try again and I will I will pick up some of their bigger buds and send their popcorn you know Alice's just cuz I want to try some of their nut flour and say all the colas are like now now my favorite part your favorite part is the taste guys that's the best part so I'm gonna sip a little bit they're finally coming to Vegas new home new game new stadium so all right guys time to take a taste test grab your balls fill them up puts up those J's if not I'll be grabbing the dab grab your torch grab your ring let's get ready here we go guys Cheers right away it taste has that a very very very very earthy tones right away but then those pushes do but then it hits you with this wonderful palette of just just all these mixtures of Turkey encased with it and I do have some actual liquid trips I've been experimenting with flavoring for the Turks so this is incredible all on its own natural terpene taste so this is wonderful so as far as the taste goes I give it an 8 out of 10 so we're pulling six seven and now eight so that's pretty funny now on the high on this it is a very relaxing high I've smoked this now for a few days it gave it the full 72 hours you know smoking on it let it get good idea before I review it for you guys I want you guys to get an honest opinion I I personally I have to say that it is a very sedated but it's not quick hitting it's a

peace", "u-6vdIFCSvw": "good morning YouTube universe it is press and Pete the press and puffin I am here with a new one for you I have done one of these in a while G leaf concentrates I'm not gonna lie I'm freaking nervous as hell about this review because I've been hearing bad [ __ ] all week about this latest drop a G leaf and how their concentrates have tasted like ass or chemicals or what-have-you so and that's diamonds that's butters that sugars I've heard them all this week so I'm not gonna lie I'm not gonna lie I'm nervous so anyway triangle cush cured butter did some homework on this one it is kosher cush blue power pusher cush crossed blue power so sounds interesting it is a hybrid you know G Lee's labels are basic so we'll just get into it it is pretty fresh broken at the 16th this is packaged April 6th so it's pretty fresh I mean it is cured but still THC 1.79 THC a 65.4 6c BD 0 CBD a 0.17 Carr 2.0 5 v humulin point 701 a little all point one five nine and limonene 0.09 nine so not too shabby for a cure drug you could see I haven't cracked into it yet we are going to bust it open together is my wake and bake is is my dad for the day get me going this is new so I've had issues before with their jars they flop around in here get tipped upside down I've commented on it before in the video and it looks like they've come up with an idea to combat that now granted it is creating more waste but it stops your concentrates from flipping upside down inside this jar a little bit of paper packed on top now normally I'd [ __ ] about the waste however I would rather deal with that a little bit of paper then have my expensive ass concentrates upside down all over my [ __ ] lids so that is awesome kudos to G Lee for that I will give you guys that good job you keep that kind of [ __ ] up that's good that's thinking that's using your head I mean I'm sure there's other ways to get around that but hey you came up with a solution good job I know as you can see this is dark it's a nice chunk in there nice big fat chunk let me turn this light on maybe get a better color is brown it is dark it is cured great it is G leaf so I'm not surprised the real test is going to be how it smells and how it tastes so let's give it a shot cracker open doesn't smell bad it smells like typical butter doesn't have much of a nose to it my lights are flickering a little bit must be they're warming up LEDs got to love it so let's break out the G pen connect in my luka glass rig from luka glass at world's finest vape shop in Bridgeport oh yeah all right we're gonna

with the second one it's not bad little grassy little earthy but it's good I mean I can taste the cushion it's definitely got a cushy taste but I lucked out guys I got a good batch I'm just gonna say I don't know how the effects are yet we're not getting into it yet we're just starting I mean I am get a little bit of sweat going but it's a little more I'm wearing a hoodie and I'm dabbing so oh

very popular marijuana concentrate vaping has become very popular these days steadily replacing smoking wax liquidiser has brought these two popular products together in a super easy manner for those of you who are new to the world of marijuana concentrates let me explain a bit about rosin cannabis rosin is the solid form of resin from the marijuana plant resin is the liquid that is found inside the plant which contains turpan s when you take out the resin from the cannabis you bring out the terpene s these are the oils and waxes the potent essence / THC of the plant in a liquid form this is then processed and turned into a brittle or gooey substance depending on its temperature now if we want to vape this high test THC concentrate in any kind of efficient manner then we need to turn it into liquid that is exactly what wax liquidiser does in fact it does it so well and makes it so easy it was awarded the 420 product of the year in 2016 the fact that you can be vaping rosin in a very easy and fast manner is not the only benefit of liquid Eisinger rosin vaping rosin that has a smooth great taste and no nasty aftertaste is what makes vaping 420 concentrate super enjoyable check out

14 grams of this indoor frosty goodness in the notes master XP we're going to use a 120 microns 7 gram bags we're gonna extract the flower bottle textile which would require folding corners in converting the corners on the bags start to do I like to polka with seven points using the tips of the scissor so so they're inverted I like the corners overlapping so they interlock [Music] the corners are folding in like that it's very nice excess bag off about a half inch of the material line the distance that I drop the plates what I'm doing is you see the corners you have it sticking out you lose just a little yield at the end this round coin with the corner stick it out I predetermined what type of pressure I'm going to use at this point type of pressure that I'm going to use on this press is I'm gonna go to 3,000 psi on the gauge max I've been determine that because I've looked at school page German how much is on its actual material it's about 8 both between the plates here kind of evenly spaced them to push the rosin under the bags and try not to let the bag come out have that done beautiful colored material but at 2,800 looks like I've reached my ultimate pressure and I'll let the extraction happen at this point plates are going out it's going to start coming off the front plates and has the material extracts you see I just lose a tiny bit of pressure there I'm gonna try to maintain that another 45 seconds or so see the whole sides and plates are full so if you want a week or so worth causing this the way to do it can also put two 14 bags gram bags in this unit double the amount I just thought with this type of yielding staring it would be a little much so after you've left us in about 90 seconds or so we're going to remove the I like to lower it just slightly so that the bag doesn't run into the results [Music] [Music] see [Music] I'm just gonna roll it onto the paper at this point get everything off my tool gently three point eight eight grams so you get a swab", "5fIH3pznGps": "[Music] what's going on everybody Joe here with the strain of the week this week we have grassroots po og this indica dominant hybrid will make you feel amazing let's

where as you know we make great food and even better Rossi what's up guys we're back and we're gonna do something super special it's the holiday season we're doing Rasen infused snowball cookies we have our rosin right here it's about a gram we just pressed this we pressed about 4.1 grams of a motorbreath and we got about 1.1 grams back that's super high yield we did the math about 27% we just pressed it using the next Smasher XP the XP is great because of the pressure gauge we did this at about 700 725 material pressure that's pretty light for doing flour but we wanted to keep it light to get that really clean looking product back we did about 205 206 degrees you know not too hot not too cold and we left in about 200 seconds that's a you know longer time than usual but because of that lower pressure you can add a little bit more time get that good yield back and that clean results so we're really excited to deke are with the mini today this is our number one selling product everybody has a mini right now and we just came out with an expansion mini D carb this thing makes activating your rosin super easy so get yours now just came out we're gonna throw our rods and in that mini D carb we're gonna put in the Nook Smasher mini 250 degrees 25 minutes we're gonna do that and then we'll get started making those snowball cookies what's up everybody this is chef Eric here at the crown and kitchenware today for our holiday recipe we're going to be making snowball cookies absolutely my most favorite cookie of all time there are sometimes called Mexican wedding cookies but they're basically buttery and delicious shortbread cookies that are covered in powdered sugar and we're gonna make ours even more delicious today by adding in the fabulous motorbreath rose and then we have d carving right over there we have about eight hundred and twenty-five milligrams of THC be carving over there and the batch we're making today's 418 cookies so you're going to end up with about 46 milligrams of THC per cookie give or take some see how it goes when you make this recipe just make sure that your total amount of rosin is divided by 18 so you can get your portions just about right because you don't want to be givin people too much or too little I think that the 825 we're gonna have is gonna be just perfect cuz I know I'm gonna be eaten probably the whole batch so if you are ready I'm ready I'm super excited let's get to cookin [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right everybody welcome back I for one I'm super excited to try these cookies I wasn't lying when I said these were my favorites so just a word again about dosage remember there was about eight hundred and twenty five milligrams in that entire batch so each one of these cookies has roughly forty six milligrams if you have a low tolerance like some of the people in the office do around here they're not eating these because they are just right in the face so please exercise caution proper dosing is the proper way to enjoy edibles thank you for watching we will see you next time here on chronic kitchen on nug Smasher on YouTube be sure to LIKE comment

we get started with anything else let's go ahead and take a quick dab so one of the big keys to how I'm showing you to do this for cheap is because I'm showing you how to do it with some reeds and you'll notice when you take a nice low temp dab you're gonna have a little bit of reuse I tend to keep mine in this little jar just like that got that out of the way so first off the things you're gonna need are some nugs something to do this over I'm using some parchment paper you're gonna need a little Bowl or a little dish to hold the key then you're gonna need the actual Keeffe itself just from the bottom of three-part grinder you're gonna need some type of oil to cover the nugs in so the idea is you're going to be covering the nugs and oil then rolling them and Keith this is all stuff I have already at home but it's even better to use like honey oil another good one you can use is distillate another good one is rosin and you're also gonna want some gloves too because this is going to be a sticky mess at some point so it's then good to sticky in here [Music] so now the goal is to wrap this whole bud in oil let's go ahead get this going and we'll just take a nice see there [Music] see that's just pretty gettin towed it already just coat it as much as you can [Music] now that's fully coded and then we're just going to take our little jar keep like that and we're just going to start pressing it down just like that [Music] [Music] and now it's probably starting to look a lot like something you've said you know we're expecting [Music] that is what I'm talking about right there that is a fully formed ball perfectly round Moonrock for you oh one down we're gonna go ahead and do this one more time I'm gonna go a little bit lighter on it than I did last time because this one's like a little bit like a play-doh ball you know it's it's too soft [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah that one's this one's mostly hash oil kind of the difference is a little bit this one feels a lot better just a little bit less oil I spread it out a little bit more even this one has a bunch better texture as this one's like a [ __ ] gooey mess I put on so much hash oil but it's just I mean look at that that's too much there's a little nugge pot in there but I mean not much so I'm actually I break that little tiny piece and make it its own little moon rock so that guy too he's an hour like it's so so and this one I can I'm just flying away that's just so like kief so oh yeah but way to get my channel on this one I am like I'm just pulling off the hash oil and rolling it in the key I think I'm creating my own new thing right now I'm calling these comments with AK a little venom comments and that's just pure hash oil and Keith rolled into a little low ball making new things the cat see Ziggy likes a chef I'm just glad he's sleeping on the chair next to me and not [ __ ] getting involved with this one cuz it's too messy those are cool they feel like a little like candies or something a little caramel balls but they're just pure oil drops rolled and Keith from the excess I had made off that moon rock just pulling it off now that I pulled off all that hash oil look how much smaller that is I was able to take all of that off of that by pulling out so I weigh over did the oil you don't want to do that because that actually sucked like this one and this one now are like perfect you got these perfect ones so now these ones have like a great consistency and these are kind of cool I like these little new inventions I came up with I'm sure it's been done I'm sure someone's had it if anyone knows about these put it in the comments below and tell me if anyone has a name form or anything like that because if not I'm coin in that [ __ ] they're little little comments but okay so got your moon rocks here and now these ones feel really good they're really solid and they're gonna break apart fine we got this little mini moon not here another way I like to do it is to take all that oil we got it and just start spreading it onto there we're gonna touch it for two seconds and really [Music] it's got all these little chunks honey there yeah Randy the same thing just go spread it over anything it sticks to alright so there you go that's another way to do it right there to is to take a paper cover it in oil cover it and keep and there you go I've heard these called caviar or moon rocks I think moon rocks is more of a thing that's been coined to a certain brand I think it's corrupt its corrupts moon rock that's it yep so I believe that technically moon rock is coined by that guy and that's like a brand that he grows and that's his thing so technically this is all caviar so let's let's clear that up I've been calling it moon rocks and a little insider knowledge on that as well as when caviar was first coming out I need someone who had you know the hens had just a dispensary they knew what was going on in there they worked there and he always told me not to get caviar and I'm like why and he's like well okay did the coming Aaron type thing is like the thing is is sometimes we get bud that's just really really shitty it looks like [ __ ] there's no crystals it just doesn't really do much for us so what they started doing is rolling it in oil rolling it in Keith and hiding it just like you know you could take something that's not very good and turn it really good you know what I mean you could take pretty much swag and make it besa got one more thing for you now the last one we're going to do is something called Sun rocks so what we're gonna do is actually instead rolling it in Keef we're going to roll it in all this and you'll see how there's all these shards they actually work a lot better if it wasn't so [ __ ] warm right now and every time you break it up you know there's a little tiny shards all over the place little flecks so we're actually going to be using that we have that all piled up put that to the side I'm gonna steal one last rap [Music] he's pretty much covered now we're gonna go ahead and take that and start rolling it [Music] [Music] [Music] and then you got one of those guys it's like a quantum Jim Rohn [Music] [Music] [Music] this is an OG Mike Montgomery double bubble bubbler Mike Montgomery is one of the original artists at the Chong glass company and this is a UV one it lights up really nice I'd like to eventually own a piece by like all the dudes who used to work there let's go ahead and load one of these [ __ ] up so I'm gonna go ahead and break that apart you can see it just [Music] crumbles and there you got the layers like to give a special thanks out to mr. Chuck I'm gonna put a link to his Instagram he helped me acquire this bad boy I love this thing so it's got the Homer smoking a blunt [ __ ] Satan Flanders to Satan Flannery's I should say and playboy Oh Marge oh yeah that's [ __ ] awesome awesome piece awesome moon rocks again gather so it was a little son rock here made ourselves some new little comments I don't know if that's a thing and also just I think the easiest way is to just roll it on paper and smoke it that way a lot of people put down the outside of the paper but that's kinda I feel like for show more which is fine sometimes because it's cool to can I don't look at it do its thing you know but it makes a mess I think when it's on the inside it only makes sense anyway so that's how I make my own caviar for next to nothing that's all from reuse I saved from my dabs and put my jar for later it's all from Keef that I collected on the bottom of the three-part grinder and it's from you know just any type of bud you want to use like I said I like making it myself because I know what ingredients this is the cheapest way to do it not the best you know what I mean you know all stuff that we've collected now if you get some really good distillate or some really good rosin or you know all these different ingredients you can make it yourself and excellent excellent quality this is just a really awesome link to experience if you even like it again super awesome thank you to everyone who helped make this happen thank you to everyone who watched go ahead and let me know how you like to make it I'm sure this is kind of an open thing this is you know what I'm doing isn't the way to do it it's just a cheap way to show you how to do it if you have other tips on that go ahead and leave it I think that's awesome anyway go ahead and check out some older videos be sure to LIKE share and [ __ ] subscribe from me and Ziggy take it easy keep it keep see you next time", "5hFOXxtXdFw": "hello everyone it's me again multi 420

soon from them so make sure if you're not already subbed to some so you'll see what they send me because i'm super stoked too i hope y'all like the review so y'all have a good night and have a good life peace hey you welcome to my course review at juvenile style this is what i do i smoke push pass and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you by the time i'm done we'll be on the moon now let's start the show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with the fourth episode of 12 strains of christmas so what we're going to do to make it a little different and special today i'm going to smoke a 10 gram and review it and we're gonna put up a five dollar gram against another five dollar gram from two different stores and see which one turns out better so we got green crack and black rhino they look like they're both really good grams so let's start off by reviewing the three grams of alien og i rolled up this nice joint of that and i already have two nice joints rolled up of each of the five dollar grams as well so let's light this up and see how good the 10 one is and we'll compare it against the five dollar ones as well to see if it's much more worth it or if it's better to go with the five so let's light this up and see how good it is so this has like there's a nice of a stronger taste it kind of seems like it has a bit of a stronger taste but it's not like a really strong flavor i would say it kind of has like like a nice crustally taste to it and tastes a bit sweet but it's not a strong flavor but it does taste really nice so let's take a nice look at these buds and then we'll give them a sniff test and a closer close-up look at them too so this one came and i got three grams of it and seems like a pretty nice account i got this joint plus this let's go so let's take a nice look we'll pull up the biggest one here wow that looks like a nice looking bud yeah see if i can hold it so you can see it better hopefully you can get a nice look at it it is a very nice looking bud so it's a nice light color it looks like there's a lot of crystal on it let's bust it open so we can take a look in the middle so nice thick as a butt looks very good let's give it a nice sniff for a nice smell so it does smell very nice it smells like the nice hydro used to get back in the day you know it just has that nice like girl smell smells very delicious so let's take a look at these little buds i guess hold them up so you can see nicely that's the whole three grams that's a nice fat three grams so a nice look a nice smell a nice taste it's just not like a strong like a type of original flavor that i can kind of explain to it just tastes really nice kind of like some dro so that tastes very nice so i say we'll jump on to well let's give it a little bit of a rating so we'll give the account rating we'll give it a four out of five because that's a fat three grams so we'll give it a four out of five for a count and i'll give it a nice at least a four for flavor i like the dro taste so that's a very nice taste so i'll give it a four out of five for flavor and i guess we'll give it an overall four out of five very nice strain alien og try it dope when you get a chance and let me know if you already have in the comments let's dab this out and try another kind so i say well dude let's do the green crack first let's light up this joint that i got rolled up the green crack so let's light this up so the green crack it tastes really nice and it has a bit of an earthy taste to it kind of like an earthy plant flavor it's kind of nice though it tastes really nice so i'd say this kind of has a bit of a homegrown taste but it's a nice home-grown taste it's not like a bad flavor yeah a weed memo they taste pretty nice actually though so i'll hold it up so you can see that's a gram of the green crack and this one was from smoker s and the gram of the black rhino we'll be looking at is from um mitsu i know i'm saying that wrong it'll be in the description so they're both from a different store and i thought it was pretty good idea to put them up against each others and to see if it's worth putting the extra couple dollars for the ten dollar gram so so far i prefer the ten dollar flavor and the look of the ten dollar bud does look a little nicer but these look nice too here i'll pull some out so you can see it better so let's pull it out i taste maybe a hint like maybe a hint of lemony taste into the green crack this one tastes really nice so and i've had green crack before that was a lot better but you can't expect a a or for a bud for five dollars you know sometimes you can get really good deals but this kind is really nice though and it smells really nice it kind of has like a bit of a lemony but a kind of like a glazed smell like a sugary sweet type of smell and tastes a bit lemony i mean smells smells a bit lemony so that's definitely not a bad bug for five bucks at all we'll dump it all out so you take a quick look at it i would say it looks like it's a little bit more a little bit of a bigger account than the black rhino but not much it's a nice looking bud though especially for five dollars i think it's definitely worth it so i'd say if you get some weed at five a gram especially if you're just buying a couple grams of stuff if it's not like complete [ __ ] it's probably pretty good if it's pretty good it's worth it so as long as it's pretty good these uh the green crack she just said it was around 20 and i believe it with the taste and look and the smell so i believe that's about what it is the black rhino um i think it was 20 as well or 21 so they're both around 20 which ain't bad but nate hi the uh alien og i'm pretty sure it was 26 percent thc so it's obviously a little bit more more thc for the price so um i'm still going to be putting the plant update at the end of this they are growing real nice now so make sure you stay to the end because they are doing really well and i can't wait to see how much we get out of these i'm going to go through the whole process with you guys and i'm going to show the yield too and then we'll do a review of every different one that we get and i think it's going to be a great time so i hope you all are having a good holiday so far don't matter what you celebrate whether it's christmas hanukkah anything else it don't matter i appreciate all of my viewers everybody that stops i appreciate it big time so let's finish this review though i just want to let you guys know i appreciate it so we'll give an overall rating of i'll say at least 3.5 out of 5. especially for the price it's definitely worth it if you're around terrell nova scotia i'd say jump into smoke arrest i don't i hope i'm saying that right i'll put it in the description as well drop them and see what they got so they just opened uh back up two days ago i think it is this is when i first went in it's the day they open up so it's pretty cool actually no we'll put this out and we'll jump on to the [ __ ] black rhino so let's see how good this is if you're not keeping up we were at three four five six we had six strings of christmas now so we need six more before what two days now two days to do six more so let's get out i knew i had to do something to get them in here you know i should have started this a lot earlier in the month but i didn't have the idea until like closer to the end of the month so i'm hoping i can get them all out before christmas i'm trying my best the black rhino this tastes pretty nice actually so the black rhino kind of has more of a stronger taste and a stronger flavor it kind of has like a kind of a hit of citrus i find yeah kind of like citrusy sugary like kind of like crystally tasting too tastes really nice so i do like the flavor this tastes really nice let's take a look at the black rhino buds well maybe they came in about the same account what they are they seem shoot i dropped one of the buds we're good so they seem to be about the same account we're gonna dump it out so take a close look sorry the setups a little different for now things are just a little different until right after christmas but i'm trying to keep things about as normal as we can on the channel but things will go back to how they were right after christmas so let's take a nice look at these okay to see it's a pretty nice account as well for a g note so let's hold this up see that's a pretty step g too nice looking buds these uh are a little bit darker than the last couple we just looked at i find but they look very nice as well so it has a nice amount of crystal on it i hope you can see a little better i hope you can see it good because my light seems to not be doing so good i'm gonna have to get another one so i hope you all are having a good christmas so far because i haven't been having too bad for one myself all kinds of nice weeds to try out i hope you all got some good weeds to try out at home so i'll hold one of these up for you pretty nice looking but let me know in the comment section which one you think looks the nicest out of the two five dollar ones obviously the the ten dollar one is going to be a little nicer looking a little better but let me know what you think looked better in the comment section i'd like to know which one you think and let me know what was the best cheapest bud that you found at what strain it was and i think we're going to hold the contest for the art contest so we'll for the picture that we're going to put in my intro we'll hold it until january that will hold it till the end of january and that way it'll give everybody time to draw some pictures if you want to send them to my gmail juvenile styles gmail.com and i'd like to see what all you guys can do and go to my twitter it'll be in the description too and go vote on the pictures i already got up i'm gonna post some of the new ones i got later on and i'd like to see some of y'all get involved in this little thing this little project so you guys can choose what's on my intro you know i'm saying it'd be pretty cool so what that i hope you all having some good [ __ ] to smoke at home and i appreciate y'all stopping in to spend some time at juventus dolls and let me know what you think of the plants i think they're doing pretty good let me know if you have any suggestions because i'm going to experiment a little bit a little bit with a couple so if you have any suggestions i'll try out your ideas and we'll see how they work so make sure to stay for the plant progress you all have a good night peace [Music] time to grow time to grow time to grow with mars hydro and now we're gonna grow our dope to smoke i don't know what the [ __ ] wrong with this but check it out we're on day nine and they looking fine so let's take a nice look at them [ __ ] they looking big they were on day night now from here they're going up on tuesday wednesday thursday and friday every day they're going to keep going up until they nice big buds so i can't wait to have this good [ __ ] to smoke so let me know if you have any suggestions on what to do and keep your eyes out to see what i get next from our sideshow because it's coming soon and thanks a lot nice hydro because [ __ ] they're looking bomb thanks y'all have a big christmas", "wkJDaIPGCL8": "hey guys this is drevis connoisseurs and we're gonna do another segment for you today and today I didn't want to do something different I want to show you how to make moon rocks at home so we've got the what ifs moon rocks moon rocks on and I get some we've usually hand-selected covered in oil and if Keef so here I have a beautiful example of moving off and you'll see those in the pictures as well and I'll show you the inside of it so when we cut into it we could see the inside is our bud covered in a layer of oil and then dusted whisky mmm this smells wonderful this also had some terpenes added to it to make it smell like green apples so you can do that as well to your oil so of course where do we get all the Keef well if you have a large bust edge such as this you could get Keef collected in the bottom of it quite a bit of team that comes off of it as you can see on the tray and this key is the same teeth that you could use to dust you our butts with as well so before we go to the kitchen to show you the process we will show you the hand selection of nuts that we want to eat so guys that our next step is nugget selection so we have different kinds here on our tray some moonbeams some of the rest by Cove some be hazed and some Keats so here you definitely do not want to use anything long like this even though it's a nice snug you know we don't want to use it for our moon rock application what you're looking for is dance heart none something like this would could work if we take out the bottom so if we sniff that piece off this top piece could be a perfect little moon or nothing same with this this is a perfect example of what we want to use again something big like this not recommended unless you're going to take off the bottom and just use the top piece and of course in your bags you're gonna have lots of best stuff and this is perfect to use for your oil and anything you don't want to use if you have if you have no other way of producing our oil you don't have your homegrown your best bet is to research some methods of making oil or find somebody who knows how to do it because not we're not going to come we're not going to recommend you using highly flammable substances to make it concentrates of this woman but if you're if you have oil and you have found your terpenes that you'd like to use the next step is in the kitchen so come on by and see what we got brewing [Music] [Music] [Music] is a double boiler with some oil and our brush that we're gonna use and when they weaken the code these guys with it so these guys are prepared little nuggets that we hand chosen and then we use toothpicks in order to hold them up once once we coated them to keep them dry so let's see how we do that [Music] [Music] so we have tried many different brushes before this one and none of them successfully worked or was really hard to clean so this so far we found to be the perfect brush for doing the job and getting clean afterwards of course you don't want to mix your if you're using different terpene flavors to make them you don't want to mix your brushes because the flavors will get right into your product and will mix and with undesired results so here we have perfectly coated nut ready to be dried and then we're gonna show you the next step [Music] would give my all to get to you if there's a chance what can I that's what can I do you can make it you can make it happen would give my all to get to you if there's a chance [Music] [Music] [Music] would give my all to get to you if there's a chance what can I do you can make it you can make it up would give my all to get to you if there's a chance [Music]", "iGcHR_Qhzl8": "hey [ __ ] on the leaf on the road with a good blood yeah with a [ __ ] and that's it from

you know we talked about earlier uh blueberry muffin strain jam sequoia uh grown by me truck finley you know very good strain i showed it to you as well um covered in trichomes pretty good starting with your overall now some people use a dab tool to collect it i find sometimes the best way with fresh consistency buttery rosin is a knife and again i got my chilling plate here as well and then dabs really want to stick on to themselves you know that's another good quality they have as you see here and you really want to make sure your chilling plate is cold you know that's super important as you can see here the tip of the the tip of the knife comes super in handy i'm collecting it and also the flat edge in my opinion it's similar to like when you used to shave or get a shave back in the day the olden days of the fresh night it really helps you collect it almost like how you're shaving over the hair you're shaving away the dabs off of that parchment paper you gotta keep spinning it as well you want to be careful not to rip the paper you know as you see i ripped the paper earlier but i wanted to you know do that to show you i didn't do it on purpose i wanted to leave it in the video um show you that mistakes happen you know not everyone's perfect you want to do the best job you can um so again that goes back to patience as a virtue um patience is not usually a thing that i'm too good at but uh you know it helps with that all you smokers out there know what i'm talking about but the idea is to get it out of here and um 95 off and you know the hotter you do your temperature the more it's going to be like a shadowy consistency you'll have a much easier time getting it off as well this here is more like a buttery consistency you know and i'm going to move on to the next one again you'll keep turning it be careful not to rip it [Music] so still working here you know again rosin is not an easy job but uh you know overall it's some of the best quality of smoke period on to the next side here on this one still going you know i apologize for the view but uh one man show and rip that purposely now so i can get a good layout and make sure it's cold i'm gonna

added gave it some more nudes because I know it's got a couple more weeks to go and so I'll give it a flush you know seven or eight days before I'm gonna pull it down I'm just I'm not giving her a lot of newts I'm just giving her something that keep are doing this you know if you cameras not the best that you can see she's really shooting off some Steph she's looking for pollen when I cleaned off a

does taste and smell really good so i'm gonna go ahead and heat up my banger and i'll be back once it's all hot so i'm just waiting for my trip timer to go off but here's the the wax or sauce so it's

i'm just waiting for this timer to go off so i know how hot it is should be any second now like five more seconds and it should be good all right so let's go ahead and give it a hit put on the top now

welcome we're doing the green half grams of this stuff on the nugs masher XP here's three and a half grams that we're doing we're gonna pack it in the three and a half gram next Smasher under 60 micron bag yes and see that we're gonna pack it Bobby textile and reason we pack it bottle textile is for the surface area of the extraction so by packing it up right so it presses like a coin one that's already pressed we get a consistent surface area meaning this round area that the puck smashes it's the same every time we put it in there rectangular way we have to really know what we're doing in terms of size and whatnot because we can change via strain the difference between this and this from a more denser strain can be 30 40 % surface area difference and what that means is different consistency in your return so that's why we prepare a bottle textile like that now to do that we just invert the corners on the bag you can see that I like to use the end of a little dab tool kinda helps me put them in there invert him turn him inside out so that's what the the bag ends up looking like no we're going to do is we're going to put the material in the bag when we start to put material in the bag and we'll pack in a bottle textile we just put a little of the material and somewhat evenly and then once we get enough in about like that we'll go and just take the bag hold it upright and just apply pressure and just a little pressure just push down by doing this it forms the bottom of the bag and makes it makes it round so you'll get this this effect and then once that's done we can put the rest of the product in at that point we're just trying to dump it in I'm not trying to smash the hell out of the product at this point I'm not trying to mix the Detroits with the plant material that's what I'm I want to separate in the actual extraction here so I'm not gonna do that but rather I'm gonna try to pack the bag evenly so there's not any air voids in it sometimes difficult to do but once I get all three and a half grams in the bag any big stems like that one I'm gonna pull especially as the material gets drier you want to pull the stems out say well tear the bags and when a bag gets tour basically what happens is the surface area changes so the consistency of the pressure on your extraction changes and that's what we like to to keep it to a specific bottle tech pack so once we get three and a half grams in the bag it looks like that and it doesn't matter if you're loading a three and a half gram bag a seven grin or fourteen but all kind of loads the same now once we get the product in there when I take our scissors and cut the excess of the bag off if you all can see that I'm gonna leave about a half inch above the material that's all I'm gonna leave and once we do that we fold it up like a present well each of all four sides in so it's folded up just like a present and then that will press up right just like this so once we get our bag off fold it and ready to go take parchment and I like to use Kirkland parchment works really good even if you packaged in this pad rosin and in this for over a year and it's it package is fine holds fine doesn't soak into the paper so Kirkland parchment we get a Costco it's a seasonal item so stock up on it then we lower the plates to be right about the height of the bag what this will do is will allow us to hold the parchment and everything in on this traction makes it much easier the process now the next fee is nice because it has a gauge on it and we know exactly what we're gonna go to here's a little green indicator yellow orange and red indicator on the gauge that gives you the safe zone in terms of if you pack the bag bottle textile like we did in that surface area it gives you the safe zone to go and pressurize and push your material so at this point we just start applying pressure try to put the load right in the middle of the plates once we have the release handle tight here just slowly apply pressure and you'll want to see the bag coming together it has more of an accordion effect when it comes together looks like accordion looks like an accordion that you're playing kind of folds in it doesn't bold it bulge out against the bag which is very important and on this extraction we're gonna go right about a thousand psi a little less than a thousand right here real low pressure and like I said once again we're coming together to get to that pressure stage very slow and the reason is we want the temperature for all the material to be normalized we wanted to be the 207 208 degrees Fahrenheit by the time we reach our 900-page and that would be my dog barking in the middle of the video so once we have once we come right down to the thousand psi which is right here we have full pressure and you can see the extraction coming so it's starting to juice here starting to make nice Rossum QB it's always good to have a little partner a little partner coupie gives me him keeps me company see beautiful color coming out there take this close up it's coming out there really good-looking material this process lasts about a minute minute and a half at the most we should have so go ahead and take pressure off it's been real close to a minute Matt in half we'll see what the results are once again this was just an 8 1 8 you can see the the bag here and then the results now at this point we'll just go ahead and scrape it right off the parchment and it's really nice looking material see that's the puck and then there's the rosin so stay tuned here I'm going to stick it on my collection plate see this is a seven gram bag here and this is a three and a half grand bag so you can see the difference in the surface area seven grand I'm three and a half gram alright so she's a regular collection tool to collect a little dab tool it's smooth on one side rounded on one side he has this flat edge on the other seems to collect a real nice for me when she stick it on a collection plate get it kind of cool right after the extraction it typically comes off real easy we get a little on the tool and then rub it across and it just really sticks yourself and there it is looks like maybe a little under a gram or somewhere right around the ground we got out of this eight way it though and give it to you but you know what it is you see it close up on the product it's really nice smells amazing wish you guys could smell alright stick that there for a sec away this so yeah pretty nice extraction 1.0 2 grams 1.0 - from 3.5 and i plucked a big stem out of it it's got to be real close to 30% or so that's how we do it 1.1 grams back and thank you for watching [Music]", "jbn9-JQgw28": "[Music] what we have here is a sample of what we would get out of a supercritical run pressures of about 1,800 psi you can tell the consistency is a little syrupy kind of thick so harden up a little bit if you've got it in a fridge but what we're going to do now is go through the process of taking the plant waxes and fats out of this and come up with a sample that looks like this and this sample is good enough to pull up into a syringe and load it up into a vape pen we'll start the process here we'll go through the steps and see what it takes so first what I've got here I'm warming up some alcohol this is 200 proof pure alcohol we find it's a little easier to mix these two together when the alcohol is warm got a hot plate you can put it on a hot plate and use that as well just for convenience I have this sitting here so this is what we did I'm dry off the bottom we're going to take this over to the scale we're going to weigh it with this sample and what I found is about a ten to one ratio is what's been working well you know ratios you could use but ten to one seems to work really well for us so what I've got here is about 800 milliliters so that means I'd use about 80 grams of extract here so we'll stare that out zero the scale and we will dump in about 80 grams of this all right close enough and now what you want to do is make sure that you've got this sample stirred together as well as you can there's methods for doing this as well just for our sake right now I'm just going to stir it up it's the same stick here that I've put it in with but you want to get a blend here you want to get this whole thing blend together so you don't see a mix here at all they self they actually sell plates you can stick this on that will warm this up with stir sticks on them as well so that you can sit there and have it automated and stirring a product for you but you definitely want to get a good mix on that so you don't have any any clumps or anything like that I can see clumps on the bottom so make sure you get all that off mix all that together as well as you can okay well after we've gone through that process what we're ready to do is I like to throw a glove over the top of that just to keep any contaminants or anything from getting into that and at that point we're ready to put that into the freezer take a look at the sample that we've had in the freezer now we recommend 24 to 48 hours is a good time for for the separation to happen so let's check the freezer its head to the funnel we've got the funnel in the freezer as well the main reason we do that we don't want to shock the sample with heat or with a vast difference in heat so if we freeze the funnel we get that closer to the temperature we're able to preserve some of the oils that might otherwise get damaged with heat let's grab the funnel and the filter now with this process you're going to need a little rubber stopper here that actually just is like a spacer between here and here which creates a seal because we want to hook up a vacuum line into a vacuum pump I'm going to have that in there with a good tight seal and then I'm going to lay my filter in all right back to that and we've got a little spray nozzle this is a spray nozzle alcohol I will take this and I'll pre soaked this filter just to make sure we get a good seal with the bottom of the funnel you see the bottom of the funnel has holes in it and when we turn on the back you're going to see that suck that paper right down to the bottom of that funnel and that's what we want that way we keep the edges filled so we don't get any of that oil to go past or 100 needs of our filter and back down into our sample once we have our sample ready and we're pre soaked here we've got a seal just start slowly slide that to the top of the filter and you'll start to see it come through first they're poor in the church with his blow pressure then they're taking that out and putting that in the oven and be carving it bring that back in the system is running it at higher pressures you can get everything else flood and then reintroducing it sir boil to the other one so that's for the guys who are hardcore enthusiasts you want the cannabis Terps reintroduce back into you can see what's happening here see the difference here yeah got some liquid here on this side saying salad but here I mean look at all that guys save this and it'll still have a small trace amount of THC in it and they'll take you to make that into lotions or so it's gonna end of my sliced ice cream right looks like though they don't seem what's good left until it's light job scope and with this process and actually refrozen of sample this is you can do this and they save up to three times probably I saw that on your video yeah like two or three times yeah if you wanted to get it receive a lot of very small a lot of times via satellite that rolled and I ran through this yesterday the same process I took this yesterday and I want to see what's going like that it came out real nice and clear see the floating same man so even when it came out real clear looked fantastic and I thought you know there can't be anything left in there sucking in freezer again overnight and there still is so it's really funny I feel like if I ran through that process one more time to go shut down pull the back in and there you can see don't come any to check always what okay so that's what we've separated there with that process okay from there we are going to take it to the rotovap data is really important so you guys are going to do trial and error so the only way you're gonna be able to figure out where you stand is by collecting data yeah right so I'll show you an example of a worksheet that I have that I use of the information that I'm collecting I'm practically and you guys can figure out what works best for you but we found that you know collecting all the data you can just helps give you a baseline and to improve your product and repeatability is such a big thing you want to be able to repeat the same quality of last year this is a two liter flask and it's a standard ground glass joint so you guys wanted fish them last way or anything okay fine tip it down alright and you you want to explain the advantage of this oh sure well we'll see what we're when we're pulling it out depending on the viscosity of the oil when you're finished it can sometimes be very thick yeah and and then it's difficult to get it out of the area what we've done before I'm seeing people do is put the bottle upside down and let it drain we've seen people use a heat gun put it in an oven you know kind of warm up the oil and get it rating that we were doing it the top after we took it off the root of that so it actually flowed out pretty well what this bottle does is it has an adapter piece this isn't f1 it just gives you a wider mount so just easier to get a tool in or anything if you are doing anything nice we'll see getting it out you know these are the standard bottles like I said getting it before out of here if you all becomes very thick this is difficult and you may have to add you know something using the heat gun you don't want to do too much you have a hot spot designing the oil industry yeah so you know you're gentle but at the same time you want the stuff and back into like a hot water bath you could just a warm it up people to get that gentle warming and then put it upside down we just we took it off the rotovap it was still warm and we put it upside down and it was able to flow out okay you know but I'm using it practice it is when you start right yeah yeah it makes it easier use it and really if you're learning from multiple samples of the same things don't worry about getting every last drop out of it it's when you go transferring between different strains something like that yeah you know you're going to have to clean that out even in that case you're not going to necessarily lose at all because you can wash it with alcohol and then have an alcohol flask let's just say let's go between down now that I hear that good so we're going to take this sample though we use a little photo here industries you could use a bigger one if you like I'm singing a Phillies big moment that that whole combo I think Nick was talking about is on the website the combo includes the funnel and this flat for 550 I think Oh to that angle yeah yeah all right the winner will go to the rotovap and this is really easy setup here good thing see how that threads in and out Josh so we're going to bring it out here a little bit got this lip on here it's going to go underneath this clip right here and take it here see it just clipped so what I'll do is I'll start to thread it up a little bit till it gets closer where it won't fall back down just kind of hold it up in place felt like that when we turn the vacuum on the vacuum you don't want to tighten it too much I've too much data and that lip on that is kind of rounded so if you did it was kind of it might have sexy to pop over this know what I mean uh-huh so you just get up there snug like I said when we turn the vacuum on vacuums going to help hold that on there you know so flashings in place now I'll go through this real quick here it's pretty simple easy up and down buttons are up and down up and down for good gonna hit the head ultimatum gotcha okay if I want to say I've got this shows your bottom and solid stop for your bottom basically we're going to come down yeah so it came down and stopped at five point nine okay and you can adjust that just hold this button to set that and then that says here right there kind of like what not good that was probably at the right depth right there to you when you say tool and what I did is I change I changed my zero day the heart stops at zero to say zero yeah yeah so then you can walk around the mic dial dial until the point and if you put it in five point nine then press and hold it then it'll say five nine there that's the new zero well then it will know that and that way you just can't bottom it out you try to hit the bottom of the yes okay so that's up-and-down for that temperature set is right here you have switched up here and now I'm controlling temperature here what yeah I we started it yesterday at sixty see guy Celsius yes and so once we get that set to where we want it and click this button right here that's on and off for the bass there I think Roland just turned it on because I just shut it off so what's happening with this blanking right here to show you that the bat is warming thank you yeah and once it gets to the temperature 60 it stays it okay I said a sample that we came up with her yesterday all those and alcohol says stop condensing then this is a simple and that's when you said you took it and that's about the consistency we're gonna get that okay great and stuff we got with a lot of very hot if that were true sorry this shirt give me that so we started with a message right cool Oh dance hall said yeah that's right there is definitely a nice consistency and quality for putting it so they as realize exactly that's what wind up with this this KNF unit is a fantastic city was great yeah a little bit okay right then I just have one more question for okay just because we're using a different machine you know for ours when you take this and you take this and you hook it up the way that he did on the end of there mm-hm then what would I write there yeah you can have a disconnect at or this is just a hole for us I'll do it I'm just gonna break vacuum on this with this is just the boss I mean so you can disconnect this if you wanted to put you know a key in line if you were going to be doing it on a regular basis you know we didn't want to have to keep pulling this off oh I can say I know a piece of - even though I'm able to - sighs but that's all we've done then I just you know so now there's no vacuum on this you see the get alcohol ooh got yet no nothing so when we do that then we just turn this on 100 I'm hydrated for vacuum for vacuum filtration and the concern is what we're talking about before you don't necessarily want to pull as strong a vacuum as you can because you'll start to pull down you can rip the paper or start to tear those sounds and things down through the paper and then you're gonna have to do it you know another filtration and seventy-five to a hundred it's a little bit of a general you know you don't our machine 75 to 100 okay you don't need to pull all the way down to a you know a descending vacuum for filtration you you just want a vacuum assist just help me counselor how we looking Roland getting down then let me get to either will it stops dripping you know right now pretty much got yeah and that's the question to its you know you're saying it's much thicker so the question is how much alcohol you want to take out do you need to remove all of it well for face you think yes and that's a question what you're doing you know what you're going to do with this afterwards yeah put edibles we'll just take it straight out of the first one take all the wax out right if you don't have to do those steps you know I don't know that's awfully push it is easier to work so Nick this morning that a lot of guys can take our customers have been taking some of this extract straight out of the cup and then just mixing that diluting that and there's solutions out there PPG are probably propylene glycol isn't like that they using e-cigs right but and then this coconut oil a more natural approach right so the guys can take that right out of cup and mix that with that consistency that's good enough to go into a pen right so a lot of guys are doing that just like that the problem becomes you're cutting the concentration of your extract so right you're you got the plants and are the the fats and waxes mixed in with that too which will cause some issues in a bait pen right yeah so you're cutting concentration risks you're not so and then also they introduce terpenes from other plants you know terpenes are common throughout the plant families after you have like say this right here would be fantastic because this is just your straight oil we haven't cut this with anything right - alcohol I see how that is turning the syrup and you can just kind of see the syrup in that normally the one that he gets moved after huh you can do that yeah you just unscrew this one we can I counted this it comes with both oh it does yeah come come both yeah so you'll have at least two flat all right this is Swiss made a mess German to release the back yep so over here about to hi Todd but not yes yeah it's been ticket row yeah okay push and hold that long I push the stop button first I hit I'm in just push and hold Vince out come in this and come back up yep there you go right you transfer it out of this would be a lot easier I like to wear the gloves it gets sticky your stuff is tough to get off your hands right you really only need to get real crazy with cleaning like that when you're going to change strange writing you running different materials and you want to make sure you don't have any cross-contamination then that's when you need a about cleaning right this is one and they've got they've got this too but they got the two liters right that's correct yeah so this is a three litre usually gonna be a bit smaller than this one it will still have to hang tight yes the opening here so you could definitely get in there with a better tool and get that clean down so much is good yeah exactly and again washing that off if you're going to change samples washing that off with alcohol real well and saving that alcohol and a flask that is just for that sample will be the way to do that and this fits right on - right this fits right onto here yeah it is funny so that's it okay same setup the only other thing I didn't really show you on this is a the ability to adjust see what this is doing is tilting the whole thing and so that's so you can figure out how to get the majority of this into the water right so for your flute sitting here you can adjust the angle great exactly just depends on what you've got in there so you got the ability to do that in the end okay I think you guys will have no issue with any of this equipment and this is probably more complicated than that so I don't think you'll have any issues with that you know as far as a cleaning process hey did I really just say that it's first cleanup or anything else on this maintenance wise do we have anything if they have to standard maintenance you know there is a two-week sit if every splashing there's a tube that runs through here and there is a seal in the top here we just take this office here that you know there's a problem with the seal it won't hold vacuum so see how this comes apart I'll do is if you could hold this so that way I don't have to take any of the coots or wives or or even the bottom off okay okay so that that's all together okay this comes off don't think your name to rubber seals holding that in place on inside there's a button underneath I'm sort of doing it okay okay cuz otherwise this your spins can't press the button underneath and then locking blue okay now this is a yo-yo Scotty so this is the part that will wear out over time but we shouldn't be talking about any time in the near future so now you know to me again but we have these available and I think they're about 60 bucks and then it clicks into place so where this could have lights in you I see that oh yeah yeah so that seems easy to take out and clean as well if you have to where you get the bump we're talking about is oil carryover then you can see how this comes before it yeah why would you have that much maintenance if you do it the right way you do it later yeah after cleaning itself yo this girl is actually on first yeah you kind of feel just by rocking that around where that needs to be all right that's it let's just for just four stakes here figure out what the dump the rest is in here and we'll go get an idea on how much of the alcohol we actually uncovered that's about where I started it is amazing when you watch that we just had this nasty concoction of stuff put together with this and we were able to make it look so clean right alright well what's happening is I mean alcohol is a different boiling point then then the other oils too so even water so I mean when you figure out what that temperature is with the vacuum it makes the process extremely you're going to leave that much in there but again gets you a little spray bottle with your alcohol and then just spray it down and then I like to just give it a shake shake everything up try and cook the whole inside of it and then just clean all that up and save all that into another flask lay down label it whatever if if you're not just dump it out reuse it just dump this out and just put any sample in here if you got the same sample there's not much worried to clean it like that well I think that about covers that you guys [Music]", "uiiyBZxyutg": "what's up homie murder bombs small tubes been a minute [Music] we here at the lab you know um yes that well like you can see it there's little circulator running that's recovering a run from the closed loop system but for right now we bounce in a little bit of dry [ __ ] just real quick nothing's nothing special just doing some quick bounce tech let me get that off here so it doesn't contaminate that just doing some quick balance tags you know it's been a long day i've run a little over four and a half pounds and i don't have any hash i mean i have somehow but i want different you know what i'm talking about so how is everybody how's your day going what day is it [Music] okay that's the this is uh 120 through 159 not the cleanest or anything just trying to just trying to get a little something together to rip with you guys oh we can't do it like that can't see [ __ ] um [Music] not bad huh for some midzies so you're looking to learn about some dry [ __ ] mojo jojo well then i i have wonderful news for you i uh i finished uh shooting and there's just a little bit of editing for the um second video in the patreon series and aside from that i had all this uh dressed up stuff out and i had some material that i was working with so i went ahead and shut up oh comprehensive driveshift uh tutorial-ish video really a sort of revisiting because i have uh i watched a couple of bubble man's um old videos and some john brothel and a d420k and i realized my dry sip tack is nowhere near what it should be and um well to give you an idea why i'm feeling okay about it i'll just show you here in a second we pressed some rosin we're gonna show you [Music] and what we're doing [Music] wanted to see what kind of a quality product i can get from this and still um this this will still maintain a pretty a really reasonable view um this is 120 through 1 49 159 dry sift but this is in a 50 micron bag um a little bit larger than i typically use for hash but not too let's see what we got right here again not not to clean just trying to bounce any particulate through the screen that's smaller than 74 micron obviously boom playing drum solos over here [Music] i tried to use the camera last time but i guess you can't focus when you're live on youtube oh [ __ ] can you guys see this not bad for how long you saw we just worked on it 519 canada here shout out to my dry sipped masters from the north marcus of course uh john six grams i don't know i guess i could weigh it should we wear it yeah we can wear it why not oops we do have a little scale right here anyway so shout out to whoever the hell this company is no more batteries [ __ ] it usb rechargeable scale and i charged i've charged it one time and i've been using it for almost a month all right so we're going to weigh this the easy way [Music] make it a little bit of dry ice sit and really i was just bringing you guys in to take a break with me but when i set up the stream i noticed i had all that sift on the screen and i thought you guys might like to watch that hey four grams 3.95 looked like more didn't it all right guys it's good yeah i am tired i'm ready to take a dab i'm not sure how much i'm gonna get done after that but i have put in a very full day all right um [Music] you guys wanna you gotta [ __ ] it i guess we could press this real quick i do have some wonderful things to show you that i pressed earlier today from some dry sift that i spent much more time with um so if this stuff comes out amazing i'm going to be a little bit disappointed because why did i spend all that time making that stuff nah it's just there's absolute technique that cannot be denied and then of course there's the advantage to you know fully mature trichomes very dry fully mature trichomes in a very cold environment with very low humidity i mean in that setting you don't even really have to be this very good at this thing with all your variables perfect like that you're gonna you're gonna get some decent hatch but for uh mojo that said in the comments there a little bit ago about getting some screens or recently got some screens for driving oh what's happening here guys i can feel just a little bit of loose sift that's around it you know i don't want that on the parchment obviously okay now where's the first one the one i'm on i don't know we'll see if we get any yold out of this this actually is some 160 160 to 249. huge very high micron hash i don't think we're gonna press that but hey let's see what happens with this step as a matter of fact i know i want to press this because [Music] we want to try to stream i guess by a little bit of dry slipping i meant a lot sorry sorry sorry let's go let's go let's go [Music] all right here we [Music] that's a go too close how's everybody doing how's everybody doing it was a little fluffy you know what that points to unfortunately a high uh count of a capitate and stocks so that's contentment um only only contaminant would have it looking so fluffy like that we both thought it was like [ __ ] when you said seven grams i was like yeah probably maybe even a little more and then it was half all right guys so we're gonna first press the uh which one is this i can't remember which one was the bigger bag now the bigger bag was the last one so this is the 120-159 this is the 74-119 i think yes this is the 70 419 that's the stuff that we thought was seven grams but it's actually get my big fat head out of your way [Music] [Music] should be ready to go whoa those are some big comments yo what up austin video is called miz uh mecca mccall man static oh yeah [Music] so i don't know who so so dare you you must not have been here for the beginning i was talking about the marcus um adding to your driveshift quiver that i watched about six years ago and then i revisited over this past weekend and it was a really it was a wonderful reminder um no we're not of course i didn't just do static tech i don't have the time for that right now just want to make some dabs [Music] no they're actually four thousand dollars so sorry to i'm sorry to so sir dirty i love your information i appreciate the help and everything but you're a little bit incorrect there brother um yes of course the video at least i well i mean bubble man pro had had published tutorials on full mel dry sift and static tech six years ago so that makes sense as far as the drying being done with a freeze dryer oh yeah sure it's a great way to do it but old school microplaning and and drying um on cardboard honestly if you know what you're doing if you know how to keep your room cool and dry it can be very dope aside from that even whether or not you're freeze drying or not you're going to have to microplane um unless you're just going to stuff chunks of well you know i have no way of doing static technique the same thing as you were thinking security i'd like to check that yeah oh of course we know that's v man yep it is you're absolutely right sir dirty it is very simple the uh well there's the [ __ ] [Music] oh he's always doing it dude that's that's all that's like every single day for solving this bacon big he goes live for like four hours at a time and washes and presses and you know all that that's what's up yeah so depending on if you want a pharmaceutical freeze dryer which for the record if you're going to get one through low temp um and we are we're only talking about harvest rate i am not going to speak on anybody or any other company's freeze dryer if you're going to go through low temp you're not you're only going to be able to get a pharmaceutical one and they're not and that's not 2 000. they do have a small freeze dryer that's like it has three shelves it's very very small if you don't need a pump or anything like that if i remember correctly i think it's uh we could just look it up i think it's like 25 maybe maybe 3 500 but if i remember correctly actually i think the medium one is because i was looking at the medium one with a pump and it was going to be right here just over four just over four grand i'm so interested in that uh [Music] i love it i love it um yeah i'm so interested in this static tech austin what you got what you got that's new yeah you and that's don't even get me started on that oil free clown so you know dope about fire fire driveshift if you accidentally [ __ ] around and get and get caught answering some questions on youtube and just watching your [ __ ] burn there's the 120 micron obviously buttered to hell because how long i let it sit on the press but i don't think it's gonna hurt it [Music] all right let's press the big one and then let's go take a dab and then i need to get the [ __ ] out of here but i like to say dear tate because it reminds me of joe dirk [Music] oh that's right yeah okay a moderator i understand i'm sorry i've been so into reddit lately you guys that it's just usually i mean bops are mostly moderators over there but anyway i get what you mean now you got a blue ranch when you go live with them and you help them keep [ __ ] together [Music] i know homie i'm waiting for my taxes to come back so i can make skunk man austin god damn it yo if you don't know anything about skunk man sam you actually don't even know anything about triceps and sir dairy that's you seem very knowledgeable and i don't mean to say that to be rude but i actually you're pretty knowledgeable so you probably know who scott manson is marcus himself bubble man himself shouted out to scott manson without skunk man sam we would be we'd be a long way behind in the full mount [Music] there we go there we go probably let that guy warm up for a little bit too long but that's okay that's the beautiful thing about pressing at 155 degrees you got a little bit of yeah a little bit of leeway looks like there's a couple of you in here hope you guys are having a good day i am wrapping up my work week we're trying to anyway i'm gonna have to come back tomorrow of course but here we go let's get a little bit of frozen banana dry sip hash rosin glow for you again remember guys i didn't really clean it we certainly didn't break out any static tech we're just trying to get some dabs for me to get going with skunk man sam is the [ __ ] man just i gotta say it again austin you know what's up hey thanks mojo i laven if you're old school weed too you remember brett mavericks using the static tech on a pool table with the playing card brett maverick used mavic was that that's that's long enough static tech ago that that's before uh i was seeing people regularly doing it with books and dvds and things damn see i knew we had some crossover man i love solving this bacon bank he's such a cool dude and you ain't kidding i do need a netflix series and i'm down for that pay too um but he is such a cool dude and i just like what he's about um i of course i'm i'm kind of busy doing the same same similar stuff so because of that you know oh i have the timer set for 90 seconds i'm gonna press a little longer than that it just we're probably about 110 right now um [Music] also i don't want to get too crazy with the pressure because i just want this to be fire i don't really care about you um that's a shitty thing to say yeah but solving this bacon baby's such a he's such a cool dude and he's just he just seems to be so like the thing i some people are like so you could say that but they're just so nice i don't get that with him i get to know [ __ ] from him i like that you don't need to be [ __ ] nice for me to be a fan of yours you need to be about your game and he is he's about his game i just don't know personally i get silly with trying to be nice to everybody again some presses you just don't [ __ ] care about the yield this was on the plant how long ago did we start streaming 21 minutes ago this was bud a little over 30 minutes ago now let's see here's our first press this is our one yeah this is the big microphone i think that stuff's going to be better 35 40 minutes ago for sure this stuff was flour in a plastic bin in a tupperware you know what's that you know what time it is only i had a [ __ ] rig ready over here [Music] better not take forever geez my desk is messy i'm so sorry you guys let's uh just bring you in on about that much of it so you don't have to look right at all oh i know what i want to show you so that's the this is a little bit of frozen banana dressing pass rosin that we just pressed together we made it [ __ ] around with the card didn't that card moved it around a little bit let some of the let's let gravity do most of the work for us and uh there we got those two processors from it i couldn't absolutely get a second press and i will later earlier today what did i press oh this is nightwing so here's some night queen dry swift rosin that i pressed a couple hours ago and this is the second press i never [ __ ] with second presses unless it's good hash good hash will press two sometimes even three times if you're not if you're if you're doing short presses or whatever if you're [ __ ] it out you shouldn't have to press it three times but anyway i just want to share that a little bit a little bit a little with you we got some super fire rosins for dab on and um we made them all from the plant to the parchment ready for the bag and it's just 45 minutes tops where are you where are you oh you guys wanna get silly little slurper dab i just saw the case over here don't do that that's how you lose a marble all right guys i gotta have that gauge up all right how we doing how we doing how we doing just so you know i can't see you and i have no idea what the hell is going on but i love you guys [Music] [Music] all righty then [Music] let's uh let's start this [ __ ] off right i'm going to start it off with that second press from the uh from the night queen oh [ __ ] i forgot that i'm working one thing [Music] and by working i mean taking a break i like to take a break about every six to eight hours yes i do work 12 hour days 10 to 12 hour days today is going to be a pretty short day though i'll be out of here i'll be out here right around 10 hours um anyway yes we'll slow down the recovery there a little bit so i can play with you guys for just a minute come on guys i think i just want to look at the picture of that deer pooping now so again give me something let me know what's up give me something to read in there sir dirty had all sorts of good information i do i hate that i'm so uh contrarian and so oppositional and i'm sorry about that but it seems like sometimes like somebody i mean regardless of whether or not he's right about the price we can agree to disagree or just look it up or whatever but i don't know why i have to oh no you're not right he [ __ ] cares if any of us are going to buy a freeze driver we'll find out by the time we check out you know what i'm saying you know what i'm saying there we go that blazer though all right so we're going to start this off with a excruciating dab of the night queen second press tricep hashgraph oh i barely even smoked last night i certainly haven't smoked anything yet today i've been working for since 10 when it's about 7 30. [ __ ] i'm at nine and a half hours now it looks like it's gonna be more like an eleven-hour day whatever where's that second graph that's not it that's not it that's a good problem to have right you like that you guys this is the other reason why i want to do a dab with a second press to start and you might be able to pick up you guys having fun watching me let me watch when i finally get my youtube page pulled up here on my laptop i'll be sitting here by myself i mean i don't know how anybody wants this [ __ ] i gotta be [ __ ] annoying as all hell but i love you guys and i love sharing my little bits of knowledge about how to make hashish with you well and don't worry guys if i knock this rig over digger gave this one to me um for court sales i want to say three years ago so it's a decent ring but it didn't cost anything surprise says oh that's me right there i was like i call myself a surprise set all right here we go oh that's that's actually a very big dab already cheers ladies and gentlemen oh my god i'm not even gonna be able to dab the president that's some night queen and really it's like trim then keith that i threw over a screen real quick and it was so terpy i almost couldn't even i really whoa that must be good where there's the very turkey dab one of you what whatever mcafee any cheers come on dude my antivirus pop up was cracking the comments and then thank you elite uh 27 m uh 27 32 and four and that's for the regular and that's in us dollars iso um but that's just a regular freeze driver it is a food grade freezer option but it's not the pharmaceutical ones which have way way way more um options and settings that you can play with as far as dry times dry times depth of vacuum temperature sublimation is a really amazing thing got me by the nose it really did too man it's like uh and honestly that's the oh that's the second press um mixed micron or whatever it didn't it doesn't have a very clean melt to be perfectly honest with you i'm a little less than impressed with that there's absolutely no char or particulate or anything it's just a little darker than i think it should know anyway let me set this down over here or not shut this down oh man yo night queen [ __ ] give me a break jesus i have never experienced that strain being that loud before um i i've washed it and pressed it i have some sugar of it it's just amazing but never had that happen jesus this frozen banana [ __ ] looks amazing this is not frozen now that's good man all right there we go now this should be the bee's knees wait that's the night queen again i can't do that it's definitely gonna be good that's the 120. the 120 to 159 oh all right here we go no he said it was 2k for a freeze driver and it's 2700 and if you're in canada that's more like three um so he was off by 50 number one and then number two that's if you if you have a pump if you need a pump too it's more unless i'm mistaken if that's the price with the oil pump the other thing is that anybody trying to get one of these to use it in a setting like i'm trying to use it in is not looking for an oil-free pump the oil free pump is like an extra six to eight hundred bucks so at that point it's 35 for the small one and for the record that freeze dryer is so [ __ ] small you're gonna be pissed at yourself for spending three thousand dollars on something that small when you could have spent four thousand on something that is significantly better but still goes back to my point i just i don't know why i always got to be right anyway that's fair and honestly that's the thing is if it's a thing to waste and you're like a hobbyist or whatever damn you're really going in on your hobby but for me i look at it as like well why would i spend two to three grand on something that then when i recoup the value for it it's too small so i mean um freeze dryer is on the schedule not sure what size i'll be getting but we'll see you know what's up it really does man what kind of class is on a dab right what would i say and then aside from that hello annie yeehaw right man damn i [ __ ] but i'm almost scared to go in on another job but we got but number one i need to wrap it up and number two come on jesus man i got dab sweats and [ __ ] my gloves all hashy man jesus and my hands are clammy now because they were in the glove that's probably why i was so hot it couldn't have anything to do with that dab i just took i'm sure it had to do with the gloves all right ladies and gentlemen you know how much i love you um i mean if you don't know who's being silly if sir dirty's still here let's haven't seen a comic i'm gonna walk but if you're stupid still here looks like we're going to split the difference um we're both no i mean to be fair i don't know i don't know actually i don't know about that before i think i just said they're not too um but also i was speaking about the pharmaceutical freezer regardless it is the morton salt girl except it's the morton salt girl taken and done by slinger which marble slinger is a glassblower but then he takes it and he puts an assault rifle in her hands and we have a salt girl that makes sense and this is a special february edition this one's called oh this one's called rain and blood that's right that was the other thing the slayer rain and blood um yeah i love slinger [ __ ] um but this is a this is the picasso version of the design super cool first time i saw it i was like that's like a morton salt girl and then i realized he's holding a gun and i'm like a salt assault like a salt oh god and i've been in love with it ever since because i'm an old nerd and when i see some [ __ ] like that and i think it's cool i never get over it jesus christ look at this [ __ ] frozen bananas you guys it's on was he i didn't know that was i didn't know that was with it but at the same time i was too you know hope you're still here if you're still here let me say something um that's what i was saying about the split the difference oh my god look at that melt you guys need to see the color this rosin is melting into uh [ __ ] dude i went in hot we went in just under 600 degrees holy [ __ ] you guys whoa hey what's up austin my homies in the northeast you know i love you i'm saying that a lot of them anyway that is a beautiful amount and if we were if you remember i was out of the right micron bag so i had to press that at 50. that's the 74 to 119 pressed in a 50 micron bag almost like the same size um you know not really but just a little bit so the fact that i knew that was going to be a little charry or maybe dark on the end as it did get a little char charlie when it dried up or finished but i cannot get over the color of that when it melted down was [ __ ] beautiful and it maintained its color for a minute tastes great tastes great it's a very interesting terpene profile um very very unique for me uh well you guys know it's got to be unique for me because every time i take a dab or a hit of anything i [ __ ] cough for 10 minutes and cry and that isn't happening so it must be different all right guys i was going to say have a great day but that dad was so [ __ ] delicious so delicious just like dog food tastes exactly like it smells delicious all right that's the low mic that's the that's the mids frozen bananas compared to this because this is way way way larger micron hash pressed out of a 50 micron bag so this is certain oh my god what do you guys think drop it i don't know sorry guys this [ __ ] is and i'd like to smoke something with some of my homies back home in missoula how is annie doing man thank you mom um reached out to me about um tincture help for either a sick person or a sick dog or i can't remember exactly but i wasn't able to find the uh micro encapsulation article i was looking for anyway uh it's been a while i'm glad you made it over so if anybody has the chance to try this strain frozen bananas this is my absolute first very very first experience with it [ __ ] uh don't get me wrong the guy that i the guy that i work with is an incredible brother absolutely incredible of the highest calorie so you know if you get your wheat from somebody that all the strains look the same don't be necessarily excited about frozen bananas it might not be that different this is very very exciting for me because it's so different than what i'm used to eddie peace 340. well that means it's 6 40 in california and almost 10 o'clock on the east coast cheers ladies and gentlemen that's exactly how you spell it with a k and one l oh my god wait you guys know i like that i like the flare for the dramatic but i tend not to exaggerate especially not when it comes to ash no cap definitely some of the best cash i have had hashtag that i've smoked so far this year period i don't care if it's from a hyperzone maker or if it's from the dispensary down the street this frozen banana ah find me um 120 to 159 the micron is dry ships hash rising is [ __ ] wild i cannot explain this taste to you guys i guess it is kind of mild like the way a banana is like a mild fruit but yo for real grizz that's what's up man austin where are you that's super cool yeah caspell's though also california's the only town county whatever it's the only place in montana that has a chick-fil-a so if you know what i'm talking about when i say there's nothing quite like the taste of [ __ ] hate oh you can only get it in council i got jokes open your heart let the hate out oh oh you guys i gotta lose some weight i gained weight during quarantine and then i just uh gained a little more love to michigan oh good luck with that because to be honest with you this is the problem the dab before this one i was supposed to quit and get and just finish what i need to do and be done but this [ __ ] is so good man so good nah anyway i hope you all have a wonderful week and hope you all have a wonderful weekend uh for those of you that are patrons or interested in becoming a patreon i'm sorry for those of you that are interested in patreon or are already patrons um i published uh one of the first of an eight video series um a couple days ago i've i have minutes maybe an hour left of editing for the uh part two part three is going to be wild it's going to be a celebration so far we're all only into hydrocarbon content but episode four if you can't tell from all these parchments around me is a dry sift and dry sift pressing episode so we got content coming go over and check it out if you like i and i say this because i encourage you those of you that are interested to just to go over and check it out it's you certainly you know pick the tier that you want with for whatever much you want to support me if you if you don't really give a [ __ ] about that and you just want to see what but what's up with the videos or if they're worth the money whatever then just do the small one you know either way you get to see with everything i just ask that anybody that has the ability and has any interest in helping to support me does that like mr david brazier has been like a [ __ ] high-level tear patron for a year and i mean i've while i think he's i think he's the longest that couple a couple of you guys have been rode with me and it's amazing but mr brazier from alaska i think he absolutely holds the record yes sir i'm gonna try i know this much up until um when i came to work today i had always had some hats you know what that or some oil or whatever but didn't really have any fire rotting feeling like my weekend's gonna be pretty sweet now let's get it started right cheers ladies and gentlemen after this i am gonna rock and roll and go ahead and finish my day pardon me i do encourage you to check out patreon if you're interested in processing a tutorial um hash tutorial but essentially processing tutorial content if you want to learn how to make some stuff make some high high quality stuff uh like there's there's a lot i number one i encourage you if you're gonna get into it to get a notebook my videos are you think my videos are long here the number two that's being published should be published tomorrow it's one right now i think i'm going to be able to knock down another couple minutes so if i should be able to get it to around one hour and 50 minutes it's just under two hours it's a [ __ ] movie i mean but it sucks and it's not entertaining however the amount of information in it is is probably pretty valuable um again check it out if you're interested if you're not i'm always here on youtube you can always email 710.consultations gmail.com you can always email the 7th extractions at gmail.com you're interested in booking a consultation and i'm actually i'm commenting from my 710 consultation so there it is 710.consultations gmail.com or you can text that number if you're interested in booking a conversation and for those of you that are interested in going over and checking out patreon that's great because i feel like i owe so much to the people that have supported me over the last year and the amount of content i i just fell short on being able to publish on time at all um i have this very very very comprehensive eight video series that i'm working on now and when it's finished it may be more like nine or ten videos but when it's finished i'm definitely going to turn off enrollment for a while um it's i uh it's hard when you finish a ton of content and then you need to get back to you know to work and or whatever you're doing and you have a new patreon patron or a subscriber or something come in and then you know their first question is when are you going to post something and i'm going like in my mind i'm thinking like i'm not even trying to shoot anything for a month so it's it's uh it's an interesting thing i'm not the kind of i'm not the kind of uh creator on patreon that like has a podcast going or anything that you would want you know that you check out regularly but there is a significant amount of information available to you right now and when i'm finished my a video series the amount of information that's available to you for the cheapest monthly subscription which is insanely cheap i think it's a pretty good deal i wish somebody would have put all that information together for me and been like give me a couple bucks and you can watch all these videos for a month all right guys yes you're absolutely right i didn't want so austin thank you um as far as things like if you might be interested in them like merchandise uh some personal time with me one-on-one stuff like if that's the kind of thing you're interested in there are some advantages to the opportunities but cheers ladies and gentlemen frozen bananas oh i'm under the same name i am everywhere brother however i do think it is all just one word i don't know why i spaced that either jesus that [ __ ] is so good i want to try a dab of it and save peace and kill the stream and that's my third day oh i love you guys but i gotta get back to it and get it wrapped up again i hope you have a wonderful weekend should anybody have any questions comments concerns anything feel free to go ahead and throw that in the comments section below and aside from that if you have any uh interest in a consultation inquiry you can email 710 dot consultations at gmail.com or you can text the number that i wrote in the chat 406-500-6698 peace", "nigBtfIJcaQ": "hello rso sosa and today i ain't stopping people don't get me wrong it knocked me out at 5pm last night with that weed [Laughter] woke up today and i thought [ __ ] it let's get a reload so what we've got is in this one is this is what once is i think this is the white rants this one well that's the wheat ranch one of these is the white ones that's probably the wheat runs and it looks weird yeah that's gelato both look pointed are we in it well i'm confused now moody packaging then it sandwich bags i'm saying that's what it rants in there and that one is some gelato stuff i can't remember even that got a lot of i don't know something cool feel though the ginger balls on it yeah that's the gelato we won i don't know what the name of it is but it's gelato something or other but i'll let you know in the comment section five [ __ ] balls i run it all day strong whoa so then we come to whitehouse mcrunter snaps through our ass absolute gary glitter balls in this [ __ ] oh [ __ ] me bash it up looking forward to a drink to that so we've also got some pink sandy and animals so we get these animals out see what animals are saying let's see if we're getting to the bottom of the bag of all god's animals miss it by day and it all goes away isn't as potent as these two but obviously gelato comes with a heart hurt thing and white runs well you are right smells very nice though very very nice it's animals and then good old [ __ ] pink sandy's going your t-birds how are we doing pink sandy i want to just go you're the one you're the one one go on pink sandy the glitter balled up to the eyeballs a little definitely got smaller nugs than we did yesterday but like i said leave it a day it all flies away but we don't stop cherry pop fireballs upon fireballs upon fireballs upon fireballs stop i couldn't stop couldn't start nearly bought half ounce of two different flavors at half our free [ __ ] i had yesterday and cosmic crisp or whatever the [ __ ] it was but that cosmic crisp weren't good enough to be buying a half ounce of and zr3 i thought you know what i've tried it i'm gonna go for four different flavors half ounce and then saves the pennies done it while you get to taste the rainbow so what we're going to do is we'll start with these animals from flavours no moody packets or whatever people go on about it but flavors is animals i'm going for this one first because i don't think this is going to be the best out of them i think it's going to be the worst to be honest with you so rather get it out of the way first of all see how we go mr malocco first type very smooth very nice very very nice it's got very clean sweet with it it tastes very very clean this dude very very clean not not overpowering with a turp profile so getting a little tingle not a bomb straight in the head but yeah you know you're smoking a bit of bang bang here it's animal very clean very very clean that's all i can really say about it it's very clean about seven out of ten on the kick starting to get that caddy bang bang swept with it now but overall clean smoke right the next one i believe guava latto guava latto i think this gelato gelato guava one of them as the videos going i'm sure by the time we get to the by the time we get to the description or the title we have the correct name down another lawyer please all the turp profile you could hit straight away soon as you ever talk through that is it be is it me straight away straight away that one there there's animals you toke it and it's it's clean it's nice it's power but just clean with this one with the gelato we're not i suppose it's coming with that gelato tur bit it's [ __ ] nice you know i mean it comes with the power with a nice gelato okay it's a very sweet lovely that's wow nice that is that's very very nice i don't know i missed the cross with the la wherever the lotto is but what happened i was it quite interesting wanted to see what this one actually is you could talk about that that would be happy very much taking the taste of sure but that's what i'm saying it's got very nice very nice profiles but very very nice smoke's very clean as well i would prefer this one over those animals because it's just got a bit more of a turp profile to it you know it's over i'm getting more higher because i've smoked the next joint and that's why i'll get you more stone don't know much you've just had some weed of the other one charming get your head straight you can't but the power to the face flex to the face rso is it's left a lovely turp profile on your mouth now after you've exiled you're left with a lingering scrumptious should i say not really wanted to put it down to be honest with got it's microphone ash have a bash i would tell that have a [ __ ] bash and if you don't want to ever take these off then we're going to go for white runts i've had this in a while believe i have had white rants before you know been a crocodile last time i had weight rants but at the menu on the second go round our four yeah come on then let's have some wheat ranch on it profile ain't as good as sharper very sharper this one that one's got some depth in the top profile this one comes have some of that very nice though very nice once again i don't know if it's just because it's the third joint but this joint's feeling look it's got more power tell you what though falling asleep at [ __ ] 5 r5 yesterday in the afternoon after all them bangers feel [ __ ] tested today fan [ __ ] tastic white runs if i wanted something where nowhere you want to sit there and get a nice taste on with it i would choose the guava latto if i wanted something nowhere you're feeling all fresh and just thinking so what [ __ ] it get moving just have a nice drink i'll go for the go for the white runs it seems like that that guava is more of an evening you know when you're in the evening you just want to [ __ ] really sit there and enjoy your banger guava i think would be nice for that the white ranch is more like daytime freshy i like it's deep but more moose pig sandy i've left this the last because i thought this is going to be the number one bang bang a real head high [ __ ] turpee profile fingers in a pie aye aye captain barrels eye do you know what i mean jelly bean pink sandy [ __ ] andy just comes with a whole swap to the side compared to these ones this is cut it be on the right side this did it's come in with a the brass bands just come in and start kicking off you know i mean they're playing now i don't know this because it's the fourth joint but see guava's coming at you with a turk profile which is very similar to [ __ ] gelato even if this is quite like i don't know let me just be july but it tastes like [ __ ] gelato but with a rump on it this pink sandy's coming at me with the same troop of strength from the profile of that but with a whole different type of profile more sweet more a step five distance this is how many blind side in yeah one bang to decide what didn't see that coming rough i mean left with bit pink sandy walking home i'd have done him if i knew that love that means he said you and sandy's walking home you've been sidewinded that's it [ __ ] over at it at least you and sandy will be all right though old stroke pig sadly i would smoke pig sadly out of these and then i'd go for the guava then the wheat rats and then there's animals peace out people", "HViZBkNF-uM": "my entire house is a cloud this is the [ __ ] crazy instrument I ever rolled what's up guys my name is Jeff Austin of this popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if not make sure you subscribe I got a lot of dead last videos on the way I would have failed to meet actually making this I was really stunned the other day so I had a bunch of different nuns in a jar and I didn't really know what to do with them so I started pressing them into this mold from Purple Rose supply calm and this is a press that makes you able to make your own can of cigars now what's different from a Canada cigar from a normal joint is that like instead of grinding up the weed you get little nugs and you press them into this little container pack as much of it as you possibly can in then you can fit way more and it burns way slower because it's just these nuts that are just pressed together instead of a bunch of ground-up flour but I made one of these I didn't film myself making it and it ended up being pretty [ __ ] epic I ended up putting caviar in it in three different places because I have like two and a half grams of caviar and I didn't know if the deal with it and I was like [ __ ] it let me put it in this and by the way caveat another work for moon rocks or honeyBun whatever you want to call it now I have this six gram joint that has weed three different strains of honey but and if you can't see there's this little stick that is poking through it and since it compresses so much it needs that stick sitting in there so that when you pull it out it actually has good airflow so I figured that time like the present might as well spark this up some of the message me and said this looks like a wheat tampon it's gonna fly and disgusting that's hard to get out oh yeah now you got it goin unless not completely goddamn it's living in a sentiment finger this is legit six grams it does not look like it at all with a Panikkar like this you gotta light it with a torch [Applause] that's it burning [Applause] yeah then we hit a nice I kind of [ __ ] up though because the joint paper is burning away fast on the we [ __ ] beautiful white ash in their exciting using the moon rocks damn this is a nice hit it like burned your lips as you hit it doing this it's supposed to make the joint last like three times as long as it normally would so this is really something you're supposed to do with people but I decided to face this one holy [ __ ] this is ripping it's really close to getting through the caviar I'm really excited what's gonna happen once you get to there probably wasn't the best idea to put moon rocks in a joint but I think I'd try it should have started a timer to see how long this thing burns yeah just hit the honey bub mean tell it's crazy you get hips like that and it really doesn't even burn being only when you hit a blunt like you see a nice little cherry every [ __ ] time holy [ __ ] that caviar like just these giant a trips every time and super smooth - it's all weed all the way to the end they're coming to sent me these do two different sizes this is the smaller one but it's thicker the other one is longer but it's a little bit thinner this one's a little bit less than twice alright and it's about half the width so you want to super skinny one this is the way to go but I like these shorter fatter ones this one looks more like a cigar to me this log was shorter than a king size joint so there's excess paper so I just kind of cut the remainder off and wrapped the [ __ ] up stoned and wrap the rest of the paper around the mouthpiece and it feels really nice it feels honestly way better than a cigar a lot of people ask me why I didn't make this a cigar and honestly I feel they don't smooth back woods or lungs to off them so I wouldn't do it for this and rather do it a joint if it was possible I took the risk and it worked so I'm happy I did obviously though even if you smoke the Thai sticks the weak cigars that are a pot leaf wrapped around it it's just so harsh like this is such a smooth enjoyable feeling it's like a night and day difference versus having a pot leaf wrapped around it or a cigar wrapped around them I hit the caviar like five minutes ago and it still just stayed there it has not moved like a millimeter I can see the oil burning but it is not moving it off I'm gonna be here for a while god damn I have so high so many people that sit over where you can make them up these I think I smoke my own and show you guys where to get it this isn'ta dad I really don't know how it lasts long term something they pointed out to me when I was at Shaolin in one of my previous vlogs was that they make them out of silicone so it's easier to clean these ones are made out of plastic so I do fear that after a long period of time there might be some wear on these but I just cleaned it after I put the honey button there and it was totally fine after a wife of rubbing alcohol it looks like it's really high-quality plastic so probably fun this is a really stuff that you do all the time though like this is cool but if you like are trying to party like this is when this comes into play is it last so [ __ ] long like I've been doing this over 20 minutes maybe maybe a bit of the weight room so it's gonna be a long evening I'm not gonna lie this tastes very good it is harsh and there's a mixture of strains in there so it's starting to become a little bit more raunchy in taste but in still does have a really good flavor yeah I'm gonna be really hot yes better be smoking with me if you're watching this because like it's not fair and I'm just smoking this whole thing alone come on y'all better be sparking up there I put a link in the description to where you can buy one of these for yourself people keep asking you where they can get their own but dude this is such a cool thing to watch the caveat that I put in it is melting but you can just see how soaked the paper is around it it's just oozing out of the vents that's what she said but like so much movie was coming out of this [ __ ] walk you know I got that clean white ash this was an expensive joint probably it was always that I just had set aside I had this jar where it was just like my tip jars what I always caught it then I would take like a nut from every strain I picked up and I would set it aside and at some point I forgot I had it so I looked at it the other day and I'm like oh cool I have all this extra weed I felt boring just smoking it so I was like let me do something cool with this boundary and then I did something extra cool when I put the caviar in there so I mean this alone is very intense I am so [ __ ] stoned already I'm not even nearly done it's been exactly been a minute since I sparked this and just weren't like maybe a third of the way through [ __ ] I don't know what point we're at in the actual video but I can cut up my videos a lot to make them a little bit more entertaining a little bit more fast pace I am so high my entire house is like hotbox already I'm curious this is gonna get clogged if it's gonna make it all the way to the end so if I said it good something tells me this is gonna be burning for over an hour you know gets a high end it will get withdrawing a like why the [ __ ] you doing this to me blah silly thank you for doing this to me I haven't even hit the second chunk of caviar that's right here and then we got this part right here I'm currently high as [ __ ] I think I rolled the everlasting drink similar to the Everlasting Gobstopper bull way cooler so I I think my favorite part about this is how while I rolled them out these I don't know why but it's just so perfect it just reminds me of like an actual traditional cigar holy [ __ ] I don't know where all these endless trips are coming from because I feel like this thing is making never aggression and I'm just getting hyah hyah better crazy but it's literally on the caviar right now and it is literally impossible to smile whoo damn let's go safety my party house there we go back to Prince trunk this caveat really slowing it down like if I'm not cheating on it it'll just go out right away trying to smoke this in one sitting but I am [ __ ] you're hurting I wish I knew how to make smoke tricks that would be like a lot more entertaining I'll try to show you that how bad I am this is the smoke ring yeah pretty much strata crunch inhales about all you got he kind of did a ghost but not very well holy [ __ ] another was Girl Scout cookies in this another Cresskill cookies lime stunk Juliette Jake you know there was sunset sherbert and there was one other strain that I don't remember but there were six trains in this I'm pretty sure but there at least those five I'm just rambling I'm so high I [ __ ] regret this my entire house with hotbox this is a weed rock I've just decided can you [ __ ] flick your joints this might be the slowest burning attacks that God ever smoked now what point am i smoking too much wheat is the real bush oh I had to roll it you know popcorn paper not available to the public I can say well you successfully went through the second piece of caviar I'm tasting wheat again that's just a fad I bet it'll fit in the [ __ ] drink oh yeah that worked up so high that hurt so bad that was so rough try this one more time it's weird it's not like a thick milk eat smoke but it is so uh so intense well judges they fall down the ash is so white like whatever we died according was some fire athlete pretty much everything I've been smoking recently is in Pennsylvania weed there was a little bit of a drought right now that when the dispensaries all my favorite dispensaries have like a third of the options they normally have I've never been a kid and my dad liked smoking cigars with his friends and be like man it'd be so cool it's a smoking cigar filled with lead I was like 15 at the time but I remember being like dude that'd be like the coolest thing that was cigar for weed like I would smoke in like when I'm older I wanted to do that like I imagine me being like 40 in my backyard looking a weed cigar and that's actually possible hey I did it at 25 it's still hitting super [ __ ] clean I'm so happy I didn't get clogged and we're making our way it cooks the last record honey bud honestly it's like when you're avatar and like me if she has us I know that's like there's a peak - you're high definitely hit it definitely hit my peak I'm at the final moon rock and it was getting hard to hit man like that's me repping the [ __ ] out of it and like that's still not a huge rip that nice little burn I'm actually getting to the end have the superpower where my eyes don't get red like I never use eye drops and like this is pretty much as red as my eyes ever get I definitely get the heavy eyes but they don't get red so as long as I can pretend that I'm tired I'm always good I can't believe they're closed stays like this perfect the entire time very impressed just try it cheap do this now so I can kill it the hit is so disgusting now non-durable a dog is just straight road shit's not really one for challenges but when I made this something inside me just said you have to face this one this one's just for you I was really skeptical and I lit it but the paper was gonna burn faster than the joint holy [ __ ] you guys I don't know the cameras gonna pick it up but like my entire [ __ ] house is just like a

these pots for about two weeks maybe three and we're just going to keep vegging them until they get bigger and bigger", "fVIclho0GoY": "[Music] yeah see i understand the purple lotus was started up you know quite different than i think a lot of other dispensaries and especially dispensaries in san jose were established it was just established by my by my wife and i was in a situation where i had a lot of money that i was coming into this with a huge investment or anything and just lost you know money doing in a business venture um it was kind of my first forte into business that lost a lot of money was credit card debt but we started up the shop with a very small amount of money about fifteen thousand dollars when i opened the shop i had you know just four jars of marijuana about a little less than two pounds of marijuana i mean this this place over here really set us off i mean you would have people flocking from all over this area to to come on a daily basis it became a community of people the landlord that i was leasing from was leasing to another dispensary upstairs so we had we had competition up there and all humility you know they were closed within about three months of us being there um you know we just my motto was to reinvest that product you know i sold the original product and then i made the sacrifice didn't hire anybody i worked for a year straight just myself right there every day all day and just put all the money back in the product and that increased business and so many people were such strong advocates because they saw what we were about which was first of all people love great cannabis they love great wheat so we had great weed at the good price and then we were good people we got more involved in the community and because people came every day we became you know they became part of our lives we became part of theirs also when we first moved in here i mean i would park up here every day and then at night time i would take the bud with me inside ikea bags for the first maybe three months because i didn't really have a good safe situation so i would take it with me at the end of the night bring all the cannabis back with me the next morning i said this was popping up here as much as i like to at the time say that they weren't you know people smoking people you know a lot going on up here in the parking lot we ended up needing to get a guard up here to ensure that everything was all cool everything was all cool but they came from every which way they came by car they came by bike scooter walking because these apartments right here and all this area around here you know the bus stops right there this was a community right here people are proud to say that they came here to jackson you hear people say oh i've been coming here since jackson great great great memories from this place fought hard to stay here you know didn't work out but uh this will always be the original [Music] spot we barely squeaked into our next location over on lundy it was it was a rough move i mean it was not a successful situation at all it's very tough to get somebody to lease to us during that time it's not like now it's still very federally legal and people are really concerned we paid six months in advance and got the place over here and once again from day one we had issues um you know just especially in this place this has a shared uh it's an office building uh as a shared air conditioning unit by this time we were carrying a large supply of marijuana and uh the whole buildings just stunk like even though this is not far away people felt like it was far away so this was always a place where we were waiting for white road this is you know we had white road that we were building out while we were here so we struggled through this place they wanted to evict us from day one we fought through that and ended up staying for six months while the business i don't think grew a lot of customers during that time what we did is we grew a lot of resilience during that time we used to tell them hey uh you'll find this over by the loading dock you know you know that's i believe at one point we ran an extension cord from way over here down to the street just so that we could sit there and put a light out so that people could know that we could tell them that there's a light down there because it was so dark you would miss this because this is a building that closes at nighttime except for if you're selling wheat up here then it closes a lot later [Music] this was the nicest place we had built out beautiful place it was formally been a bar and we just made it really nice restored the bar had it all set up to serve it was really right in the middle of where at that point a good portion of our patient base was that opened up people were lined out everybody they were fighting to be the first person to say that they were the first person to come through the door um you know my mom came to pictures of all of us so happy to be opening up this great location we have been working for months to get it we didn't have a lot of money evicted from the other spot this other spot unlucky wasn't working out so you know we got this set up big day our biggest day ever still had the other location open but pushing most of the people down here feeling great eight o'clock sheriff's come tell us we need to close this it just happens to be this whole area is san jose and this corner right here out of all this area annexed to the county and the city had given us a business license for the address but it still fell underneath the county zone and the county at that time it had a ban on all cannabis activity even though san jose city allowed it this was a beautiful place we put all of our resources into and they closed this place down right here it was a big blow it hurt especially after only being open for about 10 hours [Music] you know 903 was was a blessing i didn't see it at the time but blessings come hidden and you know looking at the spot there's only about eight parking spots assigned to us but see how you can make that work especially with the employees and you know us needing parking we ended up uh leasing a little spot next door for parking um and making it work we put four or five security guards there at about a 50-yard uh uh distance and they just funnel people in and out in and out in and out it was a 4 20 weekend hey what year we moved in over there and uh it was actually it was a convention there's a big hemp con or something in town and uh we did 42 42.8 you know out the door and by that time we had built our our our venue up to 30 or 35 strains good bud 42 out the door and it you know it worked so well that we just kept it moving from there we just decided hey this works and we just kept on doing it and we kept on selling at 42.8 and it became just very popular we got to the point that it was you know we were running five six hundred people a day in through what was a 600 square foot retail sales floor with eight parking spots i'll tell you man one christmas day we're the only shop open man lined up from here all the way down to the head man waiting to get inside the facility we were the only club open on christmas we've been we never closed from the first day we opened we never closed we never been closed for one day we've been open for i think it's coming up on 4 000 days in a row no matter what happened we opened almost 4 000 days in a row [Music] listen lou gehrig type street [ __ ] you know what i mean you started talking about that you know with iron man because iron man [Music] you", "7m53NS7xYRo": "they wrote ingredients with that i so i n g r i n in gradients as you probably already know youtube has very strict community guidelines so if you're not 18 please [ __ ] off of my video thank you let's have a nice day what is going on guys tony robb here back for another youtube video i hope you guys are having an amazing day because mine is going amazing like every other day in today's video we're up in my car and we're about to review the wiz khalifa og by pure1 and just thinking about it i could have done this in my room because like vape cartridges don't smell that much but before i start this video i just want to give you guys a little disclaimer to watch out for fake cartridges when i looked up the pure one wiz khalifa og i had seen that there's a lot of people out there that had been scammed with fake cartridges so when buying a [ __ ] cartridge buy it from a reputable source and just don't buy it from somebody who's super [ __ ] shady so please watch out and with that out of the way if you guys want to see more vape cartridge videos drop a like hit that subscribe button check out all my social media links are in the description down below and without further ado let's get this video started whoop all right guys we got the pure one wiz khalifa oh g over here which is a indica strain i got 1 000 milligrams which is equivalent to 1 grams of concentrate and i bought this from a reputable source so i don't want you guys saying in the comments down below that this is a fake cartridge and just looking at the packaging the package is very beautiful you know with that gold tint on the side um with the warning label on the back which i will be reading for you guys on the back of this package it says wiz khalifa og the best hitting ceramic cartridge disposable cartridge 1 000 milligrams it says ingredients and i just want to [ __ ] point out which kind of scares me you know because i just said that this isn't a fake card they wrote ingredients with that i so i n g r i n ingredients whatever in the ingredients it says cannabis oil natural terpenes all right instructions for use screw the cartridge onto the battery to ensure the best vaping we strongly recommend the pure one battery blah blah blah that's just advertising obviously for the brand inhale for at least three seconds exhale repeat they're not saying how many times you should inhale and exhale repeat but i'm assuming like three to four times should get you gently or modestly baked um if you want to take it to a whole other level obviously you're gonna spam the [ __ ] cartridge up until you can't feel your brain but i would not necessarily recommend that as a natural product the color of the oil may have a slight variation without sacrificing quality prolonged exposure to sunlight and heat will cause the cartridge to leak now the government warning this product contains cannabis a schedule one controlled substance which is not the case in canada because it is 100 percent legal keep out of reach of children and animals cannabis products may only be possessed or consumed by persons 21 years of age or older unless the person is a qualified patient the intoxicating effects of cannabis products may be delayed up to two hours i have never taken a cartridge where the delay is two hours it is generally like two minutes right like very rarely no actually it is i think impossible to smoke a joint or hit a cart and the effects hit you in two hours it's not inedible right cannabis use while pregnant or breastfeeding may be harmful consumption of cannabis products impairs your ability to drive and operate machinery please use extreme caution and then there's the final warning which is not the government warning this product can expose you to chemicals including pulagon which is known in the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm for more information go to www.whatever blah blah blah blah and then you have like the purevape website and purevape instagram with that out of the way we're gonna open up the box over here and i don't want to destroy it right because it is a very beautiful box so i'm just assuming you either push it up ah yeah wow a beautiful push feature wow and i could keep this because this is actually a beautiful packaging so i'm gonna put that on the side and now we got the pure vape cartridge wow the color of it looks amazing like it's not too clear right but it's not too brown it's a right in between color we got one full gram but we got it over here and this is what it looks like it is kind of transparent if you put it up in the sunlight honestly and the color isn't too dark right it's not the darkest i've seen but it's not the lightest color and it is obviously not the same color as the packaging as they said on the back the color may be different blah blah blah blah blah we got the vape cartridge turned on now and i will be putting it oh i turned it off oh [ __ ] i will be putting it on the lowest setting and going to medium and then going to high and i will be telling you guys like what best setting to hit it because there's different types of vape cartridges where if you hit it on a high setting it just burns completely the car other vape cartridges if you hit it on the low setting it just does not hit and sometimes you know the middle setting just doesn't work so you got to try it out all right i'm on the blue setting which is the lowest setting and we're just going to follow the instructions that are on the package so for best use inhale for at least three seconds exhale repeat so like i was saying i'm gonna inhale for three seconds exhale repeat three times for each temperature setting and then i'll be able to judge which setting is the best and tell you guys if it actually tastes good and then finally i'll take [ __ ] blinker because i know everybody wants me to take [ __ ] blinkers right but now the moment that you guys have been waiting for let's take the first three second puff so let's get it guys cheers what the [ __ ] [Music] why did that taste like dry pasta that wasn't the taste i was expecting what the [ __ ] like it literally caught me by surprise bro like i was expecting some sort of like stronger taste because it is like an indica and i was expecting like something you know a little fruity because like you know wiz khalifa og kind of a tropical fruity taste you know but no it tastes like dried [ __ ] pasta but i'll be taking another puff because like i said we're gonna repeat three times on each temperature setting so without further ado let's get it cheers guys okay on that second puff a little bit more fruity maybe needed a little bit time to you know heat up and activate um there's not much of that like you know tingling sense in the back of your ears and like inside of your eyeballs when you're hitting a cart there's not much of that to be honest with that second puff there's like a mix of like dried pasta and like fruity taste so i'll be taking the third and final puff on the lowest temperature setting so cheers guys well i'm just gonna be 100 honest after three rounds on the low temperature it did start to kick for me right i feel as if this was like a productive type of indica buzz because it's not really a body buzz it's not gonna like slouch you it's not gonna get you tired it's kind of like one of those productive ass buzzes in my opinion that's how it's feeling right but we will keep going up with the temperatures but we're on the [ __ ] red setting so that's the medium setting so let's see what the medium heat see if this shit's gonna start smacking and yeah let's get it guys cheers nice three second hit and wow okay the taste is way smoother so with a low temperature low setting it tastes like [ __ ] dry pasta with this it's just a fruity taste to it honestly it's maybe because the combustion is a little quicker but yeah i'm going to take the second puff on this one because it was super not harsh so cheers guys [Music] them three second puffs are very blessed [Music] overall this [ __ ] started to hit man you know the indica feeling is starting to creep up slowly maturely upon me right and i did get a full night of sleep so i'm not tired in that sense alright we will take the third and final puff of the medium setting let's get it guys cheers got that one all right so just overall the key difference with the medium setting is that the hit is a little smoother and it tastes a lot less like [ __ ] ala dente spaghetti you know what i mean so we're going to be moving on to the final heating temperature with the which is the highest temperature of the battery so we're going to be taking the three puffs off of this if there's a key difference or there's something to add i'll add it or else it's gonna be like some sort of i don't know three puff montage or whatever but let's get it guys cheers okay yeah i do have something to add with the high temp you can really taste the full amount the full flavor you know what i mean which is pretty sick so medium and high is better for for this strain there's like i said some other strains they prefer i guess low temperature to hit better but with the wuz khalifa og is tasting pretty pretty good so we'll take the second puff cheers guys nothing to add on that second puff so we'll go directly to the third one cheers just overall nine puffs in it really fries you like nine puffs in i was expecting to be a little slumped like a little you know all right guys this is future robin and i'm currently doing the outro because i just checked my computer checked the gopro and i just cannot find the rest of the video like for some reason it's just completely deleted maybe it got corrupted i don't know but i will be taking the blinker because obviously i promised you guys a blinker so i'm not gonna beat around the bush too much cheers guys alright this is like post post editing rob and i just gotta say that like i did hit a blinker i tried my absolute best to put my finger in a certain type of way where the camera would capture the actual blinking but like my dumbass kept my finger in front of the light so it did not appear in the video so you guys gotta take my word for it that i actually did hit a blinker and like i wouldn't be coughing uncontrollably and not being able to hold on the hit if i didn't take a blinker trust me on that take my word for it this is like post post editing rob i'm like on some omnipresent [ __ ] yeah okay i think i'm gonna leave now but god damn like i was saying the strain is very very like uplifting and it's not like a super indica for some reason like this train doesn't get you couch locked it doesn't give you that natural indica feeling it really uplifts you and it kind of gives you a boost of energy like i just took a blinker and i'm feeling up and at it right and i've been awake for like five six hours but besides the fact that the word ingredients is misspelled i really didn't join this cart and i do hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop

media let's turn this around check out the back so yeah there's that THC that is 35.5 ooh we'll have some fun with this one hopefully all right let's break it open here we go the infamous black tube up north Humboldt and pop this one up and get that little nice little logo in there okay so that is a full gram will I've been actually pretty enjoying that uh that was not words that came out or that
