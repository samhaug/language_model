peace", "En-rdL6bxMg": "cereal time they real time real time let's go to me [Music] you what's up sir so as you can see I'm not at home in my la stereotype studio I'm here in New York like to come back here and visit like once or twice a year just a business and family and friend and see a new Broadway show or check out a new restaurant but while I'm here this time I thought I'd take the opportunity to show you three of New York's awesome cereal bars so here we are a first cereal bar stop Kellogg's NYC let's go take a look so Kellogg's NY seeds in The Times Square area located at Broadway and 48 entry you can see here that the hours open until 9:00 p.m. during the week and later into 11:00 p.m. on weekend any leggo my eggo sandwich with large coffee or tea for 12 bucks to doughnuts with large coffee or tea for 5 bucks pop-tarts and coffee or tea for bucks and lastly any specialty bowls for the drink of pop-tarts for a buck over here in the other window they have to display with whatever fruits your loop sign you can see at the bottom of the window here to have some cool coffee cups with two cans am Tony the Tiger the Sun from Raisin Bran and snap crackle and pop then they have this display say and the two cans and shades are finally here and they have five bowls of their signature recipe cereals here we'll get in a little more depth about these in a second let's get inside apparently there holds birthday parties and catering well the store isn't that big you can see the whole layout here decked out in white brick walls with the two chairs and table but it's a tight squeeze if it gets packed in here the first menu in the wall here is for their pop-tart milkshakes they have six flavors mocha very wild heart fudge sundae strawberry short shake express it yourself and then cookie though which was sold out today he's the rest of their menu you can see the combo of the top then because they're killing it with the puns at the be bold section for their signature cereal bowls donuts and six flavors in the old-fashioned soda which is supposedly fruit loop syrup and seltzer they also have three angle waffle dessert sandwiches which aren't listed on this menu when you turn around they have cereal dispenses where you can make your own blend of cereal and you can choose from Kellogg classics like corn flakes corn pops rice krispies Cocoa Krispies Froot Loops and frosted flakes and here they have a visual menu of their six signature cereal bowls so you can get a better idea what you're going to get if you choose one of you I'm going to go with birthday cake lights in color and corny blues here's a small tone ocation some of their doughnuts including the lights and color a birthday cake pistachio lemon s'mores and some red ones don't know what flavor that is they have a really cool display behind it by the syrup glass milk jars filled with cereals nuts marshmallows sprinkles Oh an antique rave up there on the top row gross oh look there's Ernie Keebler taking a break from baking cookies they also have a vintage rice crispy bacon kit and a vintage Rice Krispies dollop here and again they're really pushing these Froot Loops sunglasses it might be fun but they definitely are not forty dollars fun okay so after you order they give you a little bundle that tells you how to pick up your order when it's ready here at Kellogg's in life you have this row of numbered lockers so put your order in a locker and they'll tell you which door to open upon your delicious cereal while you're waiting you can check out this cool pop-tart station where you can grab your pop-tart order and toast them they have a number of flavors here but I don't see the root beer or soda or great pop-tarts on this list so that's going to be a hard pass for me over here on display they have some collectible Kellogg's bowls you can buy for seven bucks and then they have the Badger cereal blend will come in or you could choose to put your cereal in a souvenir tube for six bucks more does really seem worth it what else what else Oh some more pop-tarts some mugs shirts tote bags and from what I've seen online they change up this display so it might add other Kellogg's merchandise here from time to time there's the milk fridge with skim whole almond and soy milks and then has little prizes you can win it for a quarter and this dispenser over in the corner it looks like most of these are Kellogg my speedy temporary tattoos oh the budgets gone off let's head over Locker number fourteen whoa there's glowing light coming from inside Wow there's my bowl of birthday cake stereo with a birthday candle it's not even my real birthday it's precariously carry these three cereals in one hand while filming with the other hand especially with a lit candle here okay here we go here's what a bold birthday cakes area looks like it's frosted flakes you can see the yellow cake make sense wrinkles on top can't really see the vanilla syrup but I imagine it's under this was awesome next up life in color crew loops with marshmallows drizzled with passion fruit jam and topped with a little lime zest this one smells amazing my mouth is watering lastly both corny blues this one is corn pasta blueberry jam lemon zest and just a pinch of salt kind of regretting ordering this is my third cereal it doesn't look that appetizing I'm not even a big corn pops fan my wife Lydia came with me that's just filming here we hit each bowl with some milk and tried all of them I would like to try all six signature blend on a menu but I already felt like a pig order indeed three bowls of cereal so we'll just have to give you our opinions on these one I think my favorite was life in color as you can see it's almost empty here but I'm a huge fruity cereal fan so that's to be expected neither of us were fans of the corny blues something just tasted a little off with that flavor combo which is disappointing with this limit of blueberry usually great together maybe it was just the Corn Pops my wife's favorite was the birthday cake one I really like the tube it was a bit too rich for me after a few bucks it definitely lends itself to some tasty milk afterwards that's what yellow cake mix will do I guess finally before leaving I had to try to get a cool temporary tattoo from the dispenser well unfortunately I wasn't so look I got a silly little classic green frog instead you can make them jump by pressing on its back leg but it's kind of lame than not really what I wanted oh well gotta go sleep off the three bowls of stereos so we can hit up another stereo box [Music] the second stereo bar we're going to hit up kit treats there's two locations there's one in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn let's go by the one in Brooklyn first so this kid stores on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn that's right the street from the Barclays center where the Brooklyn Nets play so if your next man who might get no one's in that span the stores of clothing and shoe store I got into more details in a previous video for the cab hit collab they did a while back but basically you walk in into the left and stores a little look with a kick treat cereal bar you can see they have a bunch of digital displays of cereal boxes on the wall the images change and cycle through older versions of the boxes as well it's a cool little layout though the place is super tiny so here's the menu you can get either ice cream swirl a milkshake or bowl of cereal with whatever combination like and mix-ins added as well at this original Brooklyn location they have special designed by named after celebrity I decided to go for the Bam Bam because I like Action Bronson but also because he's the only celebrity on this menu whose name I actually recognize I guess I'm just not as hip as I used to be now I chose it as a bowl because I'm a serial purist and I didn't why I scream more milkshake but be forewarned this is what they consider a bowl it's just the same small cup they used for ice cream you can see it's packed with Cookie Crisp rice krispie treats cinnamon toast crunch Oreos Marvin basically the kitchen thing it was just a sugar overload for me and clearly Kip treats recipes demand for ice cream milkshake now we're going to go check out Kipp tree in Manhattan so this one is located at Bleecker and Broadway a couple blocks from my old stomping grounds when I went to MI use building school like 15 years ago when you walk into this store you're greeted by a cool little Nike Cortez display and there's a display on the sitting bar area with more old Nike shoes that you can look at while eating over on the right there's a counter where it looks like they screen print shirts and clothing I don't really get a close look because that's not what I'm here for you can see the menu here is much smaller with no celebrity specials I decided to go with the elephant add ice creams for this time because I can't do another small cup of cereal and they no longer offer the bowl it looks like a shoe box you can see the wall this one isn't as cool at least not to me since it's a cereal box collector I prefer the visual of the classic boxes that I know and love so the elephant is captain crotch cinnamon toast crunch and mini marshmallows mixed together you can see this like golden tone of ice cream because of the Captain Crunch we're looking for some cereal ice cream this might be your jam me I'm more interested in a bowl of crunchy cereal but at least you can explore soar see some old Nikes some vintage sneaker ads in the walls and shop for a pair of kicks we're getting your cereal pick all right one more cereal bar to check out tomorrow what stops turds we're at the third cereal bar here me and my friend Pablo it's called milk and cream cereal bars in Chinatown we're going to head it and check it out so here's the outside of the shop this place is located on Mott Street in Chinatown right on the border of Little Italy this place was pretty crowded and popular which is a good sign I guess the line was out at the door when we arrived thankfully they have scenes from a bunch of cartoons that you can watch what waiting in line alright here's the menu you might start to notice a trend with these kinds of places you can either choose a bowl of cereal ice cream swirl or milkshake they have a list of the cereals and toppings you can mix together but then they also have the signature blend that they pre designed for you I always go with the chef's special so I'm going to try a bowl of fruit berry bliss and a bowl of peanut jelly crumble Pablo get an ice cream swirled Applejack avalanche here's a look behind the bar where you can see one of the employees making an ice-cream swirl here's a look at the cereal prep station where they have all the cereals to mix in that you could want cereal lover's dream oh wait that looks like crave again in that little glass bowl yeah why would you ruin a perfectly wonderful cereal ball station with that and in case that's not enough stereo for you they have Tupperware cases filled with all the different kinds buying the shelves behind the bar here's Pablo's Applejack Avalanche ice cream which is Apple Jacks cinnamon toast crunch granola crisps wended together topped with caramel drizzle he thought it was good but mostly tasted just like cinnamon toast crunch but these are the real stars of the show first the fruit berry blitz which is fruit loops time up with fruity pebble dust and gummy bears the ice cream comes topped with real fruit too and then there's peanut jelly crumble which is Reese's puffs the top of peanuts and Reese's Pieces and drizzle with grape jelly doesn't that look awesome let's hit it with some milk and this is one of the coolest things about a cereal box me the spoon it's a straw spoon it works perfectly and slurp up the notes on the bottom while eating it cereal to make sure you're left with an empty hole the fruit berry bliss was a little overkill for me I think it was the gummy bear but Pablo and I both really love the peanut jelly crumble cases just like even a PB&J sandwich and I'm sure the ice cream swirled milk churns are just as good if not better all right well I can figure Brown was just watching the same Spongebob clip play over and over on the little screen but I think I have my share of cereal bars for this trick okay so that's the three best cereal bars in New York City as for which one I recommend I guess it kind of depends what you're looking for if you want to buy some gear and some clothes and cereals not your main objective then I definitely hit up kiss treats in Manhattan or Brooklyn and try a cereal shake or cereal ice cream swirl but if you're sort of purist and you're just looking for a good bowl of cereal with a cool recipe or unique flavor combination I go to Kellogg's NYC or the milk and cream stereo bar which are when you pick though I go sooner rather than later because certain bars have a short shelf life here in the US and I would be surprised if one or more of those locations closed down in the next couple of years so during New York and get the opportunity definitely stop by and check it out you won't regret it so I'm gonna head back to LA as always thank you for watching and till next time stay crunchy and little bit closing doors please you", "j5dAa1RSjyE": "[Music] Morrigan is my family's name my mother and grandmothers last name is Morgan and my goddaughters first name is Morgan as well so it's a tribute to those women in my life what inspired me to open this cereal bar was a trip that I took to London I noticed while walking the streets of London a serial virus called serial killer the concept I felt was really amazing and I wanted to eventually open one in the US and Rochester we're out of there I knew I wanted to be in downtown Rochester area I just didn't know exactly where I shop for a while or a location and then I stumbled upon this one one of our number one dishes is the cereal infused waffle it's a waffle infused with whatever cereal choice that you want basically you get a choice of ice cream in a drizzle on top you can be strawberry caramel or chocolate we also have shrimp and grits we have pancakes waffles all types of cereal bowls sausage bacon eggs it feels amazing I I can't lie it's a stressful sleepless nights but it definitely feels amazing specially seeing the feedback from the city the city has definitely been come in showing support the feedback from the customers the smiles on their face the looks on their face when they see their food come to the table is amazing as well the look on their face when they see the menu you know all the little things that I work hard for and just seeing people smile and happy about it it feels great you", "cCbnHn8wcfI": "this is the first time i've cut peanut butter as\u00a0\nyou guys peanut butter or butter  this is gonna be\u00a0\u00a0 interesting so i'm gonna melt the butter a tiny bit not fully are\u00a0\nall melted i mean no guys it smells so good guys\u00a0\u00a0 my arm hurts so bad that nice marshmallowy\u00a0\npeanut butter gooiness chocolate chip look how good those look look\u00a0\nhow gooey that is oh my god\u00a0\u00a0 cheers everything about\u00a0\nthis is delicious way better hey guys what's up i'm katie and today i'm going\u00a0\nto teach you how to make the best cereal breakfast\u00a0\u00a0 bars these are so so yummy and they taste so much\u00a0\nbetter than the ones you buy at target and they're\u00a0\u00a0 so easy let's get straight into the video okay\u00a0\nso i gathered all of my ingredients with me and\u00a0\u00a0 you only need five ingredients and one of those\u00a0\ningredients are optional that's peanut butter i\u00a0\u00a0 love peanut butter peanut butter is so good to me\u00a0\nso i am going to use peanut butter i think we have\u00a0\u00a0 a special guest and she is going to be helping me\u00a0\nwith the measurements and yeah let's get straight\u00a0\u00a0 into it so the first thing you'll need is two\u00a0\ntablespoons of butter and so i'm just gonna open my big pot and i'm gonna cut two tablespoons of butter\u00a0\nthis is the first time i've cut peanut butter\u00a0\u00a0 as you guys peanut butter or butter this is gonna\u00a0\nbe interesting and before i melt all this butter\u00a0\u00a0 down i'm going to use the excess butter and i'm\u00a0\njust going to put it all across my pan where i'm\u00a0\u00a0 going to put my finished product this will help\u00a0\nit not stick to the pan just gonna put it all\u00a0\u00a0 around the edges and up the sides i also think it\u00a0\nwould be very helpful if you pre-measure because\u00a0\u00a0 once the marshmallows are in melting it's gonna go\u00a0\nquick so you want to measure everything right away\u00a0\u00a0 so you can just keep adding ingredients because\u00a0\ntrust me it moves quicker than you think my pan\u00a0\u00a0 is all buttered up and now i'm going to measure\u00a0\nout my ingredients before i melt the butter so i'm measuring out five cups i think\u00a0\nit's probably already four cups yeah i think only one cup is needed\u00a0\nnow and i slayed my half cup of chocolate chips maybe opening the whole thing was a bad\u00a0\nidea guys honey nut cheerios are my favorite\u00a0\u00a0 the measuring is probably the\u00a0\nhardest part for me to be honest\u00a0\u00a0 okay so i'm gonna start melting the butter i have\u00a0\nall of mine that one doesn't work ingredients\u00a0\u00a0 i'm gonna melt the butter a tiny bit not fully so\u00a0\ni'm gonna turn it down to medium heat because you\u00a0\u00a0 don't want it to all burn or you don't wanna add\u00a0\nhigh heat because it's all gonna burn really fast\u00a0\u00a0 you're making rice krispies cheerios i'm\u00a0\nmaking breakfast bars cereal breakfast bars\u00a0\u00a0 sugary breakfast but i'm just gonna add\u00a0\na full bag of mini marshmallows these are\u00a0\u00a0 16 ounces yes and so i'm just going to add this\u00a0\nwhole bag while the butter is still melting and then while this is melting i'm going to stir\u00a0\nit up so now i'm going to mix this up until the\u00a0\u00a0 marshmallows are completely melted and then i'll\u00a0\nadd peanut butter and melt that completely okay\u00a0\u00a0 guys so i have it all melted let me tell you my\u00a0\narm hurts but it looks very very good so now that\u00a0\u00a0 the marshmallows are all melted i mean no i'm\u00a0\ngonna add a half a cup of peanut butter and melt\u00a0\u00a0 that all the way i don't want this burn go go go\u00a0\ngo my arm hurts let me take over no okay fine yes\u00a0\u00a0 but in a second okay guys it smells so good okay\u00a0\nguys so now i'm turning the heat off and just\u00a0\u00a0 really whipping it oh my gosh guys this smells\u00a0\nincredible now i'm going to add the cheerios and\u00a0\u00a0 really like guys this is probably going to be such\u00a0\nan arm workout five cups as i said before guys\u00a0\u00a0 my arm hurts so bad make sure you turn off your\u00a0\nheat right now and you're just mixing it in with\u00a0\u00a0 the cheerios really get in there oh the dogs\u00a0\ncame that's how good it smells guys make sure all\u00a0\u00a0 the cheerios are coated because you don't want a\u00a0\nplain honey nut cheerio yet while you bite into your\u00a0\u00a0 little rice krispies you wait to put the chocolate\u00a0\nchips in at the end because you do not want them\u00a0\u00a0 to melt all the way it will change the taste\u00a0\nof it and it won't be that nice marshmallowy\u00a0\u00a0 peanut butter gooeyness you won't taste all\u00a0\nthose flavors you'll only taste the chocolate\u00a0\u00a0 and the peanut butter add them at the end in it\u00a0\ntrust me it's so good it's an arm workout you did\u00a0\u00a0 it for like two seconds okay guys so i'm gonna\u00a0\nkeep mixing while Kam puts the chocolate chips in sprinkle dinkle don't say sprinkle dinkle and you just want to fold\u00a0\nthem in you don't want to stir them in so now that\u00a0\u00a0 they're folded in i as i said i don't want them\u00a0\nto melt so i'm just gonna Kam i need assistance\u00a0\u00a0 can you hold it hold it and i'll yep guys they\u00a0\nare definitely melting so they're definitely\u00a0\u00a0 melting but it's like a good like a good amount\u00a0\nlook how good those look guys i didn't completely\u00a0\u00a0 fail i mean although the cheerios didn't go as\u00a0\nplanned this looks a phoenominal you want to pat it\u00a0\u00a0 into your little tray and this is a flat pan then\u00a0\nwe're going to top it with some chocolate chips\u00a0\u00a0 okay guys so i have all the cereal in the bowl\u00a0\nthis looks so good we're gonna sprinkle some\u00a0\u00a0 chocolate chips these are Garadelli chocolate chips\u00a0\nand just sprinkle a few in and press them into\u00a0\u00a0 the pan again you don't want a lot

easy ingredient simple to do have on hand cereal protein bars if you're ready to get another epic video underway then man i'm here to do it for you let's do it [Applause] [Music] i wasn't expecting it to be that chewy not all protein powders are created equal and i think that if welcome back to the anabolic hub we make anabolic deliciousness we're back here again inside my kitchen to do a recipe review on the remington james no bake protein cereal bars this looks like a real winner but we're gonna put it to the test very simple to do not a lot of ingredients you probably have them all on hand already like rem said if you put it together you pop it in the fridge you have a nice snack high protein ready to go and a moment's notice we've all been there we get busy but we've got to run somewhere really quick we need something quick to take with us we don't want to stop and get some junk this could be the answer to that problem we're going to put it to the test by starting off taking a look at the ingredients here we go regular cheerios don't get the honey nut version throws the macros way off natural peanut butter vanilla based protein powder sugar-free syrup that's it so seriously does it get any simpler than a ingredient protein bar i don't think so and if you think that the four ingredients is simple enough wait to see how easy it is to put together if you haven't already seen rem's video which you probably have but anyway i digress here we go back to the recipe first ingredient we're gonna measure out is 39 grams of our regular cheerios again not honey nut regular cheerios 39 grams on the money next ingredient is a vanilla based protein powder you need 31 grams of this in an ideal world that would be final boss cinnamon toast swirl but that's on order isn't here yet so we're using this stuff 31 grams measuring it out boom 31 grams on the money then what you do is you take your mix and you just give it a little shaky shake shake shake [Music] get that protein powder incorporated with those cheerios and that part's done okay next step as rem said we're gonna start putting together the glue that holds it all together and boy is it some anabolic goodness with some peanut butter i know we could use pb2 we probably cut the calories down significantly a little less fat but let's make rem's version because you know what he's usually pretty spot on with this stuff we're going to be measuring out 32 grams of our natural peanut butter 32 grams on the money and of course got a little dirty in our recipe okay we're taking our 32 grams over to the microwave we're gonna microwave it for 45 seconds all right now if you've microwaved it you're going to notice that it has a definite gooeyer texture melted up a little bit here let's add the final ingredient and last we need 60 grams of our sugar-free syrup 60 grams on the money then once you get that in there you just mix it all up want to get it all incorporated into one nice brown color and once you're there it's going to look like this all right let's finish putting these together we're back to our cheerios and protein powder mix and we're gonna add in the glue that holds it all together and then once it's in you just gotta mix it all up to get all the ingredients incorporated together and you're mixing for a little bit and you're like this isn't all gonna mix up together at all it's gonna be dry that's your sign keep on mixing it's gonna work trust me and then lo and behold it's all incorporated and we're ready to go on to the next step let's do it then we have our mini loaf pan here with our piece of saran wrap that we put over it so that we can fold it on top so now all we need to do is scoop this into the muffin tray [Music] kind of press it down into the pan moving it towards those corners and what you want to do is fold your saran wrap up over the mixture because it's so sticky as rem pointed out this would be the perfect time to do the final shaping move it all into the corners and get it all nice and pretty after all we want to chop this up into bars okay and when you're done you have your cereal big bar ready to go into the refrigerator now he recommends doing it overnight minimum of 30 minutes but you do want to put it in overnight thankfully i've already made this so we're gonna swap that one out for this here's the one i just took out of the fridge we're gonna chop it up here on our good old cutting board before we head over and give it a taste test just pop it in your hand what we're going to do now is cut it into three bars all right let's go taste them all right here we are again back at the taste test table and we're gonna try these bars and they look really good honestly i think the longer that you let them stay in the fridge the more solid and less sticky they would be these have been in the fridge for about two hours i bet if you did like rem did in his video and he pulled out the ones that he had from overnight i think they would be much better and much easier to handle i did notice they're a little sticky as i was moving these around anyway nonetheless you probably could have had them without putting them in the refrigerator at all and they would taste amazing kind of like coach greg's anabolic popcorn where you could put it in the freezer or you don't have to it tastes amazing either way but we're talking easy grab-and-go snack here if you've got to run out the door you need something quick rem talked a lot about how when he's editing his videos oftentimes you just get locked in and you're just editing and editing chopping up clips and i kind of know what that's like a little bit you need something quick to eat you have time to sit down and make even a simple anabolic recipe well this takes simple to the whole next level here it's so easy especially you do it ahead of time you keep them in the fridge you got a nice solid go-to right here but we should find out if it does live up to the taste test let's do it with no further ado i'm going to take the bar that is closest to me and we are going to try this out here we go very chewy very chewy that tastes pretty good i have to say i wasn't expecting it to be that chewy but as i'm thinking about it rem did say in his video that it takes you a while to eat which is a good thing because the worst thing we know about protein bars is that we're so hungry when we go to have one that we devour it in about 30 seconds this i can see this taking a little bit longer to eat you can have more than one bar obviously it's gonna take you that much longer so in terms of that great the flavoring is good if you like peanut butter yeah you're gonna love this and rem mentioned this in this video too depending on the quality of the whey protein the flavor of the whey protein it's going to make a difference to how these taste not all protein powders are created equal and i think that if you did it with a cinnamon toast swirl whey protein that ram actually sells probably tastes even more amazing i used a regular vanilla based protein powder it it tastes good i like it i like it a lot very gooey and chewy texture to it if you're expecting a crunch i think when you eat cheerios you're not gonna get that from this there's no crunch and that could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on what you want texture wise it tastes amazing as far as protein bars go i mean i would i would probably rather have this this seems like it's going to be more filling and i'll flash up the macros here for all three of these bars you're looking at 500 little over 500 calories one of these two of these maybe all three depending on where you're at for your food for the day and you'd be set it's almost like 170 calories a bar there's a lot of fiber in this and i think that's why ram ended up using regular cheerios as kind of like one of the main ingredients they tend to have the best macros most fiber they actually have more protein in them than you would think i think it's like four or five grams of protein just in the cereal so you add that in with the whey protein and get yourself a solid protein bar here for sure very satisfying if you find yourself digging into a jar of peanut butter a lot and you have that kind of craving this could be something that could really help you with that because you're getting that um having a lot of peanut butter feeling we all know how easy it is to spoon peanut butter out of the jar into our mouth you half the jar is gone and you only realize that you've had thousands of calories having one of these bars i'm already starting to kind of feel full a little bit like i said easy grab and go this could be something that's ideal to help you out if you're ever in a pinch you need something really quick to have on hand this could be the winner right here the sweetness from the syrup is totally on point provides the perfect amount mixed in with the protein powder and all that works well together kind of uh on the money in terms of how it comes together it's really really good stuff again can't underestimate the chewiness factor it's going to take you a while to get through all three of these especially if you're trying to do some kind of work while you're eating them yeah it's going to take you some time you will need to wash your hands though now maybe overnight it's not that bad but uh as of right now it's kind of like the anabolic popcorn like i said where you're going to get a little stickiness on the fingers but that's fine as long as you're doing some work we're not typing it's not a big deal or if we just can use one hand i'm gonna give it a solid 8.5 out of 10. this is really good this is this is great i would definitely recommend that you try this if you have or if you end up after seeing this let me know what you think in the comments section i'm curious do you guys think it's good did you try it with pb2 powder instead did you try both did you have a preference on which one you'd like better let me know we'll have another boisterous discussion down in the comments section which i absolutely love so guys thanks for chiming in i really appreciate the comments when you come back after making the food and let me know how it went that's awesome i really appreciate it so link down in the description to rem's original video also a link to my instagram account if you want to start following me there at kennybfisher.com that's on the website kennybfisher on instagram if you want to follow me there and usually i post up that day you can see a little preview of what's coming but anyway solid job by rem on this one for sure all right guys that's gonna be it for me i'll see in the next one bye", "UFYDUq07Jlk": "okay a

"ISscxKl60Y8": "hi everybody everybody I'm back and today today Gina young is going to show you all how to make fruit loop breakfast bars here's what you're going to meet you will need six cups of fruit loops okay and believe it or not let's say this is dudududududu at ten point one ounce box of fruit loops this whole box is the six cups all right you will need some type of icing and me preferably I'm a chose the cream cheese icing because we're going to drizzle this with cream cheese I see it has a little easy quick spout there alright you will need salt and we're just going to use a pinch of salt believe it or not but this pinch of salt goes a long way and it brings out the flavors in sweet dishes okay we are going to use to fund milos these are the miniature malos that the miniature marshmallows that have the different colors and the different flavors the flavor is orange strawberry lemon and lime alright and then you will need ten ounces of excuse me of marshmallows you can use the mini ones or these big ones here whatever is fine as long as you use ten ounces this is a twelve ounce bag so I'm going to use you know just about all of it but not all of it all right now over here I have the pan that I'm going to use is just an aluminum pan that I've taken a paper towel and I put a little bit of cooking oil which is a vegetable oil on my paper towel and I just rub the vegetable oil all over this okay so that our breakfast bars don't stick to this all right over here I'm going to be using this wok okay this wok is the woof woof gang puck collection I know I reason why I'm telling you all this because a lot of you love this wok and want to know where you can find it at you can find the Wolfgang collection of pots and pans on Amazon now we are going to use a half a stick of butter then we're going to start to melt our butter so turn your pan on to medium-high heat and one thing that I want you all to know a little trick that I did I took a little bit of oil and you can see the oil on the bottom in a rubbed oil all up the sides and all at the bottom how come you did that Gina well the reason why I did that is because we're getting ready to cook something it's going to be really sticky which is our marshmallows and I don't want my marshmallows to stick all to my pan you know not it's going to naturally stick but I don't want it to stick too much so I coat it my pan with a little bit of oil okay all up the sides now we're going to go in with our 1/2 a stick of butter and get it to get nice and melty I'm gonna put that in just like so let's come this way so y'all can see exactly what I'm doing I hope you all are having a great day today today is Tuesday I hope you all are having a great work week if you haven't had a chance to check out my video for the no baked key lime pie that I made check that video out because that pie is absolutely amazing do you hear me if you never tasted that before that's the recipe for you you definitely want to try it so make sure to watch that video let's go ahead and put our butter in just like so okay and we want to get this nice nice nice and melty once it melts all the way and we're going to put our 10 ounces of marshmallows if you haven't seen my video for the rice krispies treats I've made a rice krispies treat that had Oreo cookies in it be sure to check that video out because it's awesome as well and it's very simular to this recipe except for this recipe doesn't have rice piece of it now if you wanted to put rice krispies in this recipe absolutely you can you can use three cups of rice krispies and you can use three cups of the Froot Loops and you got breakfast bars absolutely if you wanted to use the fruity pebbles you know they look like the rice krispies you could use those and mix them with regular rice krispies as well like possibilities are endless when you want to make some type of breakfast bar or a rice krispies treat you can pretty much do what you want to do and it's a lot of fun and here's the thing get those kids in the kitchen get them in the kitchen to help you because when you give them an entrance that interests in cooking when they're smaller when they grow up they understand the art of cooking they understand what cooking is all about okay I'm just gonna swivel this around just a little bit just like so like I did my oil okay and then we're gonna go ahead and start putting our ten ounces of marshmallows in not the whole bag because the whole bag would mean I'd be using 12 ounces okay now what heat I'm gonna turn this just onto a medium heat because it's very very very easy to burn this and you don't want to burn this be very watch this very very very closely okay highly suggested that you do not walk away from this while you're melting these down because this can burn alright see this and so the marshmallows are well coated in the butter okay and then I'm not gonna have a pan that's gonna be too hard to clean up because we coated it with the butter and the oil as well so what I want you to do I want you to bring your cereal close to you because here in just a second very quick this is all going to happen so quick you're gonna want to put your cereal in and then I love I love the idea of putting the cream cheese icing on top now here's the thing you can do like I'm gonna do I'm gonna just kind of drizzle it all over the breakfast bar if you want it to you can completely cover the top of that and when you cut it you can turn them upside down and they'll have a layer of icing at the bottom and then you have your cereal at the top oh absolutely so like Dakota my 10 year old when he goes to school in the morning tomorrow all he'll have to do is take him a sip of milk and grab a breakfast bar and get ready to head out to that bus stop so that's what I have planned for him for breakfast tomorrow he'll be really excited absolutely he will be he went crazy over the cookies and cream rice krispie treats that I made they loved them even the bigger kids they went crazy over it see this here and I'm just kind of just going you know scraping the sides and the bottom so that nothing sticks and nothing burns but we're looking just fine this is beautiful this is what you want just like this nothing nothing hard about this recipe I'm going to reach over the camera really quickly then I'm gonna grab my little ones and I just want to open them because we'll be using those shortly as well all right these are just about where I want them but you want them to liquify all the way before you add your cereal okay we don't want any big you know any big marshmallows in this mixture make sure it's all the way melts it and me also time go ahead and put you some salt in watch how much I put in guys seriously that's it all you need is that little pinch and really seriously it really does a difference if you wanted to put vanilla extract in here absolutely you could but I don't suggest using the brown one use the white or the clearing color vanilla extract to give it a little bit extra flavor oh yeah we marshmellows just about done baby these marshmallows are talking to me all I'm thinking about right now I'm thinking about s'mores I'm thinking about going can't be not like my brain is just going my brain is just going and going when we wake camping we make what you call a banana s'mores boats in the banana s'mores boats you take aluminum foil you slice open your banana in the rind so you slice it open you put marshmallows in you put your Hershey's chocolate pieces on top of that you crush up your what do they call guys you crush up your graham crackers you close the aluminum foil you throw that bad boy in the fire and you cut banana s'mores boats you have never guys seriously you have never tasted a s'mores until you've had Gina Young's banana s'mores boats I actually have a video for that be sure to check it out it's awesome okay what we're gonna do we probably got about one more minute we're gonna go ahead and put our I'm turning the stove off I'm gonna go ahead and get ready to put our cereal in there okay and I believe we're gonna do it right now because these bigger marshmallows yep they're turning right into liquid let's go guys it's like this and now you want to put a little bit of elbow grease and then let's come off of the stove because we don't want to loop this anymore okay but you want to move fast move fast and use that elbow grease guys you all huh you all know what elbow grease is I'm sure your grandmom told you when you were cleaning use that elbow grease I know mine's bit all right see this here beautiful this right here this is what it's supposed to look like and minds are gonna be extra gooey you hear me I like gooey oh yeah now watch this check me out packs now that you have everything well incorporated go ahead put you some in there the marshmallows the colorful marshmallows put them in there and they will stay intact they won't melt and they're going to be just a beautiful pop in your mouth and they make these so beautiful and pretty I think I'm going to put just a little bit more in just like this oh yeah and then you have what a nice beautiful treat I wish I would have made this for you all for Easter you know and then you could put these in your kids and grandkids baskets but it's never too late it's never too late cuz this video is gonna be on my channel and you'll always be able to go back and see what Jena Young has up her sleeve now check me out guys bringing us into the effect and we're going to hold on guys I'm trying to I don't want my arm in the picture let's put this in here and you want to kind of work quickly this pan is heavy and it's hot and I'm working with my right hand even though I'm left-handed I would prefer to be holding this pan with my left hand but that's okay just get it in there right there you go okay good that pan got heavy on me so if you have any problems if you have any problems pushing this down into the pan just take a little bit of oil and put it on your spatula or you can use your hip put a little bit of oil in your hand and then just start pressing everything down in until you get your treats into this pan give me one second guys I will put some oil on my hands and then I want to press everything in place give me just a second okay I got oil on my hands oh yeah and now we're ready to go I was kind of struggling a little bit see my hands and will this make it oily no not at all guys don't worry about that okay I want to show you guys the right way how to do things you hear me I'm gonna show you guys when every time I make a recipe for you all I'm I put all my love in it I appreciate you all and I'm so grateful that YouTube has given me this platform to be able to share my gift from God with you all in hopes that you all mitt will make these recipes for your children and your family and your loved ones and let people know that Jena young showed you how to make it okay look at this here guys I don't suggest using a pan that's thinner than this because you don't want your bars to be thin you want them to be nice and thick around about this thick when you slice them okay now here's one thing that we're not going to do this right here is a little warm to the touch is it hot no it's not hot not not hot at all but it's still warm so you do not you do not want to put your icing on yet because your icing will just melt and it won't look pleasing to the eye I want mines to look at nice beautiful drizzles okay so what we're gonna do is we're gonna put this in the refrigerator only for around about a half an hour this will be nice and cool see how it's nice and flat this will be nice and cool and then I can come back I can drizzle you know what whatever you want to drizzle you can write your name you can write happy birthday whatever you would like to do I'm gonna wash my hands but this in refrigerator for about a half an hour come back we'll put our icing on I'm gonna cut these bad boys and I want to give them a taste so I'm gonna let y'all know what they taste like be back okay everyone if you hear a little bit of noise in the background please forgive me it's just my dishwasher going now cream cheese icing that's my choice use what kind you want if you don't want to use the icing you don't have to okay and literally seriously it's that simple okay I'm just gonna hold it just do a nice little drizzle all over these beautiful fruit loop breakfast bars is what I'm gonna call them you can call them rice krispies treats whatever you want to call them hey that's fine just give them a try and let me know what you think absolutely okay I'm gonna use this hand here I think I need a little bit

welcome to another episode of world you smokes today we're making cereal bars we're gonna take an eighth of weed and we're gonna turn into edibles so stay tuned stay lifted and get high [Music] [Music] here we go [Music] [Music] [Music] you all right here we go so the method that I mentioned earlier and the reason why you might need two pots is called we're gonna do what is called the diet double boiler method so you need a smaller pot with the top that fits within the bigger pot water goes in the bigger pot yes I have to do this yes I know don't I usually don't do cooking videos because my house is usually a mess I work two jobs those kind of hearts it's in helping cleaning dishes [ __ ] what you want to do is you want to wait for the water to come to a boil and when it's boiling we're gonna drop this bad boy in just like that so I stay submerged let's fill it on on the edge right there you see yeah it's gonna boil right around the bottom I might even add a little bit [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] ooh [Applause] [Music] why [Music] [Music] [Music] to the line [Music] just be hot enough to stay melted but not hot enough to get sticky where you're constantly stirring it so it makes it a lot easier also if you have one of these pans that locks and unlocks these are great because we're gonna first gonna forcibly keep it kind of close just keep it warm but then once it gets warm enough and boiling we're gonna open it up and maybe even take it off you just want to see a boil but for now let's just give it a second a little warm up and we'll get right back to it all right so we're gonna be using like you know I'd say a 75% full bag of marshmallows not a full bag but just it's about 75% of these smaller eight bags this one in particular is I Tory I don't know maybe 12 ounces or something and a full slipper butter along with two scoops of coconut oil 2 big tablespoons of it that way should have enough butter and oil liquid to go along with these marshmallows and you're gonna see the process great looks like our water is boiling as you can tell gets pretty hot so we're gonna grab our other pant set it on down in there there you go Dan we'll grab a regular stick of butter and because I am quarantine and just leaving my only stick of butter that I got I'm gonna let that melt down before I add the additional coconut oil that I may use the fact that private should have made it with coconut oil but I like butter and in my edibles I like the flavor of butter more so for all your coconut oil fanatics so I could get the best of both worlds another that's going and started to melt a little got my coconut oil this one I've had before so grab a spoon boom and another spoonful boom people love that [ __ ] yeah and there's just stir it up and I actually let it all dissipate and to basically clear liquid before I put anything else in you can just stir it up for another couple of minutes and we'll be right back one this is nice and ready all right now that we're here what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just the heat from directly halfway to about 25% you know we're at 50 now I'm just doing 25% the reason for is when we go to cover this it's gone this is actually gonna become more like a convection oven just like your regular oven down here and it's actually gonna enclose everything and it will not only D carb your weave but also cook it within the butter / coconut oil make sure we got here and that's how this method is effective and how it D carbs are we and the Scientifics behind it if you do not set your top on you're not deke are being your weed and your [ __ ] up so make sure you have a top all right the other thing that's important is obviously the bud and make sure you have your button nice and fine like we do I like to grind my knob but you can do whatever hand grinding is just fine go ahead and make sure you get all of it there you go and you're gonna stir it up whoo darlin stir it up mm-hmm you can instantly tell that it's turned green look at that quite gorgeous so this is like I said this is a one bug that was completely covered with high columns and very very high quality so this is gonna make us some really strong edibles some people will say you gotta take the top foam off but when it comes to edibles you want to keep everything you have because you know every little bit counts and that's just wasteful man you won't see that in the final product anyways when you bake and make edibles with this so don't worry about that foam but as mentioned earlier most important thing is once you give it a couple stores cover it up that bad boy and make sure that it's locked boom and that's gonna sit there for 45 to an hour it could be even less some people like to do 30 minutes but when I'm doing in double boiler method I find out that it's a little bit longer than a convex oven which is 30 minutes so if you do it's 45 minutes to 50 you're probably good that's like that's mine that's where I kind of pull it right up around 50 55 you know in the middle of those two numbers but you'll be fine regardless because it's only heating this bad boy up at 200 degrees Fahrenheit and it does tend to keep a very consistent boil because of the water and the hot water disperses in general cool stay tuned alright now that we added some water we gotta let it come back to a boil but I'd say you can start scooping out some of this foam if you prefer I am we're just gonna toss it on out it's not that much foam but I like to really really be careful skimming it so that I only get the phone and none of the oil or none of the butter just like that and the slower you are at doing this the easier and better cleaner butter you're gonna have most of the bog should still be on the bottom as you can tell you'd see it right in there so don't worry if you skip a couple Lisa but it's not gonna be the end then there I'm just gonna keep it stern keep it boiling and we got another 30 minutes left on the clock so this is a good half way check point something we should all check on halfway and just go ahead and let it get back to it everything is looking pretty de card and real nice and light green in color remember that butter color but now it's just that green color that's what you want we're gonna start adding a marshmallow minis and I just do a little bit at a time you will say you know half a bag for this mod and pull back for that amount but what I notice is most of those people are just kind of guesstimating and it doesn't always work out that well for you so if you do it hand by hand and you slowly start stirring them into they melt you're gonna know exactly how much you'll need and you'll always have enough marshmallows to make this stuff don't worry and enough butter you know we usually do your mom one stick of butter plus those two extra scoops is way more than what's recommended for a regular cereal bar recipe and the reason why you do that is because we're stretching our eighth across an entire pan you know maybe if you're putting it in like 8 pounds worth of weed or like a kewpie or a couple of ounces at least you know then you have to start thinking about you know making it really concentrated because that's just ridiculous but if you keep it within normal measurements for regular people especially during these times of quarantine you know when none of us are really smoking like very regularly smoking I'm just trying to conserve my stuff this is a great way of doing it and another thing about it is edibles are just a great way of not you know coughing and [ __ ] and so if you're feeling sick and you're starting getting like fem onea which is the Phoenix lands you in the hospital of this coronavirus is most people give ammonia first and then they end up in the hospital you better start making edibles this is saving lives people all right out of all those are the way to go especially during the time of sickness during the time of this kind of [ __ ] like I know some older people and they don't really smoke they got kids they can't be out there but they'll buy they'll buy a cereal bar they'll buy a brownie you know don't take out like a three pack of cookies wrapped up that's all I'm saying you got to find the right customer for the right product I like to get all the marshmallows covered in this juice before they start blending in together see how they're finally starting this kind of mushed together well I always stirred so that they all get a good covering of this butter / oil now we're still gonna add a lot more of these marshmallows in there to get the right kind of consistency however this is a great start you know let it melt together close it up for a little bit just let it cut down just a little bit and maybe in like five minutes we're gonna add a little bit more so give us five minutes and we'll be right back oh yeah that's looking pretty good pretty sticky but there as you can tell there's still a lot of liquid underneath so we're gonna actually have to add more marshmallows to this and that's kind of how you can base it is as you start see underneath how much butter and oil is left excuse me I just ripped a huge bond and it's coming back on me but yeah as you stir you can see how much oil and butter is left which is a good way of telling how much you might have to add so as you can tell I told you this entire bag was gonna be too much maybe like right in right in that pocket it's gonna be okay whoops get that out again you wanna keep stirring this so that there's a lot of equal disbursement among your your marshmallow mix this is after all what is medicated it's not gonna be the cereal itself it's just gonna be this so you want to make sure that it says well mix and as even in the dispersed as possible well I'm not over over spilling it who that bomb oh yeah you just want to make sure your Stern they're still actually a pretty good access mom of butter so I have to add another handful at least yeah I'd say that's about two small tiny handfuls you write you rather unloaded and overloaded every time I tell those people all the time and you want to get that perfect perfect marshmallow fluff out of this if you undercook it with all this it's not gonna come out if you don't keep stirring it in making it more and more consistent it's not gonna come out and if you just sit around it's gonna burn man so you got to keep your eyes on it you gotta every five minutes you gotta check on it you know and here I'm doing nice little stir as you can see the viscosity is definitely a lot higher it's becoming a lot more creamier and it's just starting to look great it's even got a nice little green tint for all you stoners out there now you could have strained this and not have any of the wheat particles in there but I could give a [ __ ] glass I like my out of Oz taste in my buds so I just keep them tasting like bud and that's just mean all right so we're gonna cover that up five minutes we'll take a look again whoops and this ought to be the last time we do this so well good thing I had a cover when it dropped look at that perfect sure everything is good we'll walk away we got just enough marshmallows in case we need them I actually started eating them back that's where they're even fool same thing with this I had a bowl of it pretty good I love Captain Crunch can't complain so I think this combination is gonna be great you want this is so little let's just toss it all and then come back in five minutes in college the next step is where all the fun begins boom all right looking pretty good oh yeah the whole thing now it's more or less this right here which is what you want like that account nice that looks right there and not only did you just go from stop one you just did step one two and three we D carved our weed we put our weed in some sort of butter or oil and we also created the first step to our next recipe so feel good give yourself a pat on the back this is the fastest way to make cereal bars and the tastiest way to make cereal bars now that this is done we're gonna have two nice lis mix it all in one here and the reason why I keep my water running is because I'm gonna put it right back in here and I'm gonna keep it going so that this stay is a good consistency and doesn't turn out on us while we're you know spinning our actual making our actual bars right here I like to use a spoon because that does actually y'all it does a pretty good job at mixing everything together to give it a equal mix right now it's it's hot and it's wet so it's actually really easy to do this but once it gets drier it gets harder harder so you may want to start spilling it over onto your pan just like that and then get the next part going oh yeah stand strengthen up we're just gonna fill this pan in and using our spatula which we can kind of create a nice flat surface we're gonna stretch these out a little bit there we go now again if you wanted to use a 4x4 pan or double up this recipe and use an 8x8 pan that's a baking brownie baking dish pan it's gonna give you a nice thick piece like you see in other places you more than welcome to do that but I personally I like mine thinner I like they're just easier to eat easier faster and you might to you know try this recipe and I urge you you might see for yourself it's just it's just a nice little quick snack I don't sell them for as much some other people I usually do like you know like two pieces for ten maybe three pieces for ten bucks depending how much you put in there again it's audible so you're not really ever gonna make your money back on on it we're not much if you are so it's always just something something more of like a treat to yourself and the treat for people that that are around you that are cool so I'm gonna let that keep burnin see we may actually need to add shoulda maybe added a little bit more marshmallow but that's okay pour it on all this got to get rid of all of it and now that this is all done we're gonna turn this off let that sit and mix up all this if you have a bigger mixing pan I highly recommend that you do it all the mixing pans so it's more even but I just don't have a big enough mixing bowl yeah I'd like to get one of those big KitchenAid things that has like ah you know that like spins mixes the ship for you but right now those are pretty expensive and I'm not much of a cook yeah I'm just getting better with every every year as a time use you know as you get older you just start cooking and I think most people like in their twenties tend to go out tend to on a date and that's what it is the dating scene makes you go out and makes you like go to restaurants restaurant it's kind of nice with your significant other once you get older man it's always fun to get better at cooking at your own place and being your own man it's nice it really does give you a different kind of sense of it's like growing your own because you have different sense of self sustainability also nice work a little way to make a little cash if you're into that nice little way of making some friends happy making some older people happy not everyone likes to smoke weed man but everyone loves edible crazy and see I like that sprinkle of fact that you can't win crush them up I do that with all my out of o stereos I know some people look at me like I'm crazy but it gives it a good consistency you know take some of those throw over here where it needs to be so it looks like we're not even gonna get a full pan out of this no just try and keep everything leveled in you don't get the corners nice and good one side seems a little bit thicker than the other side but that's okay you almost got a full pan maybe next time we'll get to two boxes of cereal so we can get this the rest of this filled in the other cereals fill it in and just kind of depends on the texture and consistency of the cereals I didn't know that these Captain Crunch weren't gonna fill in the full pan but that's pretty good telling you guys you just want to keep it pretty flat put this edge just how I'm doing here and as you can tell as everything is forming to place it's really looking pretty solid I would say that's great so the next and final move is you got to actually take this and whoop almost fell over got to walk over and put it in the fridge now through wondering why my fridge is all empty it's because I didn't really listen about the quarantine lockdown so I got quarantined with no I didn't go grocery shopping or none of that [ __ ] so I'm just eating now what I have and I'm doing just fine I'm linking through another week don't worry about me just yeah I got a lot more frozen food than I do non frozen so just letting you guys know no worries anyways in about 30 minutes to an hour I'd say that should be done and we can have our first fate taste test alright here's the finished product after I ate a couple pieces of course but look at that goodness [Music] look at that beautiful color alright guys and we're back with our delicious Oh cereal bars and look how good these came out this is why I like mine thinner see when they're thin they're way more easily biteable they're kind of grier you know mmm telling you guys con candy flavored cereal there's a way to go this is just like handy it's a nice way of extending the life of your weed sometimes what you'll find is they'll be a little bit of them kind of butter your / sticky marshmallow stuff on the edges so once you were done with all this make sure to eat all that up to scratch out the sides take a spoon punch it down because there's a lot of THC in the corners that you won't be able to get to right away other than that I hope you guys have fun watching I hope you guys had fun cooking with me this is gonna be a new series but maybe we'll keep it going because I'm a pretty good cook for those who know me I make a lot of edibles I love eating weed so I'm thinking about just trying something different and I appreciate you guys watching along and as always stay lifted this world your smokes my [Music]", "PZlx1QCyIeU": "what is up guys welcome back to the channel today we got a great video what can I say I mean they're all great I need to quit saying that but this one I'm telling you how not holiday season is fast approaching at the time I'm recording this video we are 8 days out from Christmas I don't know about with you guys but for me all the days are always the biggest temptation especially when I'm traveling out of state I'm staying in hotels I don't have access to my routine everything my kitchen my grocery shop and all that stuff right it's really easy to flub your diet to easier for being honest so today my goal with this video is I'm going to hit my macros my shredding macros a hundred percent on point using nothing but fast food we'll be stopping at multiple restaurants on the order of multiple things I'm gonna eat all of them show you guys what they are break down the nutritional profiles why you should get them why you should avoid other things we're gonna have a lot of fun man so next time you're in a pickle you don't got food with it your fin a little hungry you can pull some away from this video man and not fall off your diet keep making gains keep getting shredded you know what I mean if you know what I mean so if you guys are ready another epic for me today's video then as always man I'm here to do it for you let's do [Music] so it's about 9:15 in the a.m. which means it's time for meal 1 and we're gonna hit an American classic hey we made it the golden arches man don't disrespect Mac dawn yeah can I just get out two egg white delights and that will be it thank you thank you thank you a lot of people like to on McDonald's to say it's not good but I mean it's good good for you but it's good yep thank you it's go time man we got me a one let me take the seatbelt off so I can break this down a little better oh  I lost it meal 1 today is going to be not one but two egg white delights baby how long since I've seen this yellow packaging nostalgic rid of that bag and what these are is essentially egg white Canadian bacon and cheese on a English muffin what I love about these is they taste really good and when you're on the go and need something than a pinch only 250 calories a piece low in fat high in protein for two of these guys right here it's 14 grams of fat 36 grams of protein is 64 grams of carbs which adds up to 500 calories per meal one these work great for me man get a load of that bro I hate you eatin in my car because I get crumbs everywhere and I never eat in my car and these English muffins like shed like a dog man what is that right there what is that I thought something just falls off over my CD player now come on don't give her a go you guys ready yep Ronald McDonald still got it seriously I don't know when the last time is you have one of these but you've been eating clean for a minute these you're way better than you remember I'm cool with it I'm cool with it so back in the day before I gotta know this whole fitness thing I was a big fan of the sausage McMuffins right but just a little note for you something to think about one sausage McMuffin right it's 480 calories which is almost the exact same calories it's two of these except eating a lot more fat and less protein which isn't what we want here man it's all about the macros you want a high protein you'll try to keep fat as low as possible that's the biggest thing with fast food as fat as up so quick which you'll see later in the video I'll keep pointing things out but little tweaks like that man said of two sausage McMuffins you two egg white delight so they're still good but there goes half the calories and you get more protein and less fat so you can't lose that way man mindful eating all right I got one more of these to eat I got a couple errands to run I'm gonna check in with you guys for a fast-food meal number two let's go ready need some fast food bro let's eat boy let's go such a beautiful day like this ain't did Noth nothing going on so he's gonna accompany me for the rest of this video sir i'ma watch you go yeah go eat how many some all right he gonna eat some if you don't know who he got it right now you know now you know link in description I'll do a six-inch bacon cheese on wheat with a double steak [Music] Neal - we are at Subway now I know subway advertises that like their foods healthy and all at which you can get pretty good meals here but the key is you want the cars to be long or the protein to be higher so what I got is a double steak and cheese 6-inch sub on wheat with some spinach so what that puts aside from meal number two 14 grams of fat 41 grams of protein 52 grams of carbs 490 calories something to keep in mind here right I like to keep my carbs lower if you were to get a footlong you're gonna double your carbs you're gonna essentially be over a hundred grams of carbs at one meal and I don't want to do that so what my recommendation is half the size of the sub double the size of the meat you're gonna win that way baby let's go ahead and give her a little try here man what do you think you think is gonna be good subway is always good it's always good man enough talking let's go what'd you get bro same exact thing except I got some more veggies and he did in just a smidge of light night just a tiny if I gotta have some sauce no I feel it I mean so Jamal subway still good everybody out always good about always we just sat in subway for about an hour and a half have a little business meeting it was a minute that's what I love about what we do man we can have business meetings at Subway it's the corporate it's the corporate headquarters doublemeat only our final boss athletics launch was so successful we have been planning our next launch our next release so we're looking at a spring release we got four new items in the works which is awesome add a few more that we're kind of playing around with but we're having another launch coming soon in the meantime though you want to copy yourself a dope hoodie and let me like for example it's like 50 degrees here in Houston today look at that baby no undershirt blingin I got to put that there to keep the ladies from looking at my upper chest shelf but these hoodies are like perfect for when it's like this whether you swear the hoodie you rock it or if you got some patty sleeves you want to show off finalboss three-quarter can't really go wrong with either Kenny no I'm Anne good we do too good sometimes a lot of you guys out there look good too you'll see in the pictures let's all look good together man if you're posting over get the Tagus out final boss nation and our personal accounts on Instagram anyways it's been a little bit of time can you eat again I can always eat again so can I blessing and a curse less go Chipotle we can never go wrong with you're trying to get clean except if it's about noon and you got a line all the way to the back [Music] [Music] good meal three is going to be Chipotle no matter what diet you're on you can kind of like to eat Chipotle however you want it so today for it to fit my macros all I did was double steak black beans we got pico de gallo and lettuce it's a pretty big bowl here with the macros on it we got 13 grams of fat 50 grams of protein only 29 grams of carbs in 440 calories a couple tips about Chipotle as much as we all love the burritos you add one tortilla here that adds 290 calories to your overall meal and I know people - they love the tortilla chips I used to get them all the time and then I found out 570 calories are in one order tortilla chips and that gives you 73 grams of carbs and 27 grams of fat so here is man keep it simple I got four things today we got black beans we got pico de die which basically tomatoes and some onions and lettuce keep a slow calorie give our protein high to keep me moving throughout the course of the day a quick easy way to do it - a few avoid the sour cream you do or the cheese I know they're gonna make it taste a little better but you don't need it just unnecessary calories so I mean you can't the steaks bury our need but let me give you a bye hair you look at that man some steak some black gold on put a leaf of lettuce on there and complete bite by itself that's still good but you got to add a little sauce man I need you to comment below which sauce is the best I'm a green man in a green man for years what about you that's a polar Tabasco the Chipotle Tabasco yeah he likes a Chipotle I like that green all my favorite things in life are green yeah which one do you like comment below but this is meal three and I think we got probably one more meal left so I'm gonna eat this and then we got another one coming [Music] hmm alright guys it is almost 4 p.m. which means I'm gonna eat my final meal dad dad it's tile eat up the macros I got a lot of protein to this we gotta somehow get in a lot of protein keep fat down and if we have a little bit of carbs to play with but I have an idea let's go hey it's chick-fil-a home of the original chicken sandwich I'm game with it alright I got a look at my order here let me get char grilled chicken sandwich ball banana six yeah just nuggets thank you so much the work I put in for these angles you all would hit that like button every single time and you'd leave a comment but what can I say I'm just one man out here doing his best thank you bro that window my nipples are getting a little hard unless you know what this is the final meal so we're gonna take this mug home and I'm gonna see you guys at the quick boom through the power of editing in the expense of some gasoline we are back home so to fill out my macros I needed quite a bit of protein so what I got was a grilled chicken sandwich char grilled plain cuz a lot of times if I'm eating out of the restaurant I don't know exactly what they're gonna put on it sometimes they're gonna like give you a grilled chicken sandwich and then put like some 200 calories sauce on it ain't cool with none of that so I just get them plain and then what we got here I've never had these either off the top these are grilled nuggets I wasn't sure how they would come being a grilled nuggets but it looks like they just take a grilled chicken breast and cut it up so basically pure protein right here which is gonna solve our protein problem so before I try this out the final meal of the day ends up having 11 grams of fat 104 grams of protein and 36 grams of carbs which ends up being 640 calories and for anybody wondering the quantity I got 18 grilled nuggets just in case so um we'll go ahead and try this taking a sandwich let's see how she is man 3 2 1 I mean it's bread and grilled chicken you don't get much more plain than that see if the grilled nuggets have any redeeming qualities here I mean this gets the job done is it delicious by any means no I'm not salivating here but I guess the job done but I know what I can get to spice it up a bit - geez old Tom yeah she is like the perfect wingman yeah ingredient is gonna make sure you get yours but if the opportunity arises he's gonna get on top god gee my man get a front-row seat see if that helps a little bit if you all remember the Popeyes worst chick-fil-a spicy chicken sandwich video I had people commenting that I messed up by not getting the chick-fil-a sauce so I decided who is calling me hello dude that was the realest sounding machine I've ever heard they're taking over at me for a second so everybody was telling me I needed to try the chick-fil-a sauce after the Popeyes video right so I googled it right just to see what the nutrition facts were man in one packet of that sauce or I keep in mind next time you hit chick-fil-a 140 calories and the only things in it is 13 grams of fat and 6 grams of carbs and every one of those grams of sugar so imagine you get two or three of those packets that is my entire days where the fat in packs of sauce ask for mustard that gave me this honey roasted barbecue I can't trust that first ingredient is soybean oil the second is sugar I ain't foolin with that to keep that in mind when you're eating out you're doing fast food like you like that little stuff adds up if you get a sauce pocket at every restaurant boom river your calories for the day right eat a plane you suffer through it or you bring your own sauce way better off so to wrap it all up man my entire days worth of eating if you add everything I ate up together I was able to hit 52 grams of fat which for me when I'm shredding I always keep my fat between 50 to 70 grams the further I get into extract if eclis it falls down to around 50 grams 55 so for me that's a big one if I'm trying to get shredded my protein I depending 231 grams total which for me is perfect I usually keep my protein right around 1.3 to 1.5 times my body weight right now I weigh around 178 pounds you do that math it's right there at about 230 and for me that's perfect and then my carbs are at 881 grams on this program for me when I'm shredding that's usually where I start my carbs at on it cuz around the 180 mark so once again perfect for me and then my overall calories I'd end up hitting 2,000 and seventy which for me my body type my activity levels my training my cardio that is perfect if you guys watch my last series the last cut I did we got shredded and my macros were almost identical to that and I was able to hit it today in fast food now you're like REM that's great but there's got to be some downsides and I'll name a couple here first and foremost downside number one is the price so I added up all the receipts right here right every one of them to eat all this today it cost forty nine dollars and 71 cents the biggest offender was the chick-fil-a and the Chipotle chick-fil-a was like sixteen bucks and the Chipotle was twelve twenty nine and the subway was fourteen so really they were I mean extra meat anywhere is gonna cost you so from a cost-effective standpoint cooking at home is definitely the better option and then number two what would be wrong with this trying to follow us every day not that I think you'd get results off of it but you don't know exactly what you're getting right cuz like who's to say each of these nuggets is exactly an ounce right who's to say we're actually getting four ounces of protein in this sandwich right you never know who says the bread it has as many carbons as they say you don't know exactly one loaf Oh bigger than another so at the end of the day when you do this it's you don't know exactly what you're putting in your body and I finally your way and you're tracking your logon you're following an actual meal plan you're gonna get the best results cuz you control everything that's going on your body but doing it this way right if you're traveling or someone holiday or whatever this is a way better alternative than just saying screw it bro nachos make sure to bring the queso - chili dog extra cheese boneless wings you want fries with that yeah I can throw some bacon on them it's a way better alternative than just saying screw it so there's ways to do it man I was the goal of this video it's got to show you guys like you can be flexible you can go out without a plan without food or do and still hit your goals man make things happen it's the end of the day it's all your mindset that's a hundred percent dieting all this fitness crap going to the gym the cardio there's all our mindset you got to wake up every day with that I'm not messing up today mindset you got to stick to the plan man you got a plan you execute on that plane every single day you have no choice but to win whoa I really hope you guys enjoy this video I'm gonna get to finishing off my delicious final meal grilled chicken sandwich some own list nuggets and I could have made all this at home for a quarter of the price real talk but hey it's all for the love of the content baby if you enjoyed this video smash that thumbs up button if you have an idea for a video you would like to see put it in the comment box if someone commented this video and

videos come in and yeah I will see each and every one of y'all at the next video see you guys", "5i5MgWwQ9Z0": "what is up ladies and gentlemen all right man we're doing something a little different today last video i asked you guys what your favorite protein bars were there was tons of comments tons of bars and we ended up with nine of them that you guys suggested and then i got the two that i'm about to drop the anabars baby check it out ain't that packaging fancy it's like the mercedes-benz of packaging what i'm gonna do is go down the line with all of them i'm gonna review the macros i'm gonna review the flavor i'm gonna tell you guys what i personally think and keep in mind man one of these might be your favorite bars you might just love yourself a luna bar and to be honest that might do a lot to explain you as a person but regardless if i don't like it cause i haven't had a lot of these man don't hold it against me this is my personal opinion but i will tell you guys what i think of the calories the protein the macros everything that way if you're looking for a good protein bar and you see these at your store and you're like that looks good maybe it ain't maybe they're lying to you i don't know man so uh let's have a little fun shall we if you guys are ready to go to epic video underway then as always man i'm here to do it for you let's do it [Music] [Music] let them drip on me all right baby let's get this thing rolling starting off bar number one is a quest bar this one is chocolate chip cookie dough flavor i put these in a lot of meal plan videos i've been eating quest bars for a while one the overall macros on are pretty good nine grams of fat 21 grams of protein 21 grams of carbs rule of thumb for me a good protein bar should have at least 20 grams of protein if you don't have that to me it's like a glorified candy bar my honest opinion so really uh for this one the macros are pretty solid but one thing i do want to share with you guys right it says 200 calories on the back of the label a lot of these bars will lie to you because if you do the math and you add all these macros up it's actually 249 calorie bar with a 60 gram serving size they can get they can trick you dr greg talks about it a lot but a lot of these companies will do things like adding extra fiber into their bars so they can subtract the calories from it and manipulate the system so you're not getting 200 calories getting 249 with this bar keep that in mind this is chocolate chip cookie dough one of my favorite things in real life is cookie dough and hopefully that focuses let's get a look at that man you got chocolate pieces in there a nice thin long bar 60 gram serving size so let's go ahead with a taste test for me in the past quest bars and the extra fiber was always kind of something that i liked about the quest bars right but i'm gonna approach this from purely like a flavor standpoint on the macros obviously that passes in my book that's fine other than i'm lying to you on the label so if you're scanning these into myfitnesspal make sure you're accounting for that 50 extra calories they're not telling you about that's where those sneaky calories can add up if you're not really breaking down the numbers overall flavor not bad not the best bar i've ever had i probably like a little better if it was frozen but it gets the job done so a quest is kind of like your average bar you know like i'll eat it because i don't mind things having a little bit of a protein taste but like you give this to your mama she might not like it so quest bar overall gets a pass i'll just move that over here the right size so acceptable in my opinion now we got an rx bar interesting thing about this you look at the ingredients on it it's only dates egg whites almonds cashews blueberries and natural flavors so it's supposed to be like a minimal bar right not a lot of extra stuff pretty following his channel you know i don't care about that extra stuff give me all the extra stuff nutrition label says 210 calories what did i do here when i got the math 207 calories if you add up all the macros so technically they ain't lying to us so that's not bad and i've never had this flavor i don't believe open her up all right she she looking like that hopefully that's folks and we got some nuts in there some some dates so those dates haven't been on a date in a long time forgot what they look like yeah we got this let's uh let's see how she is man i'm always a little hesitant when it comes to these like natural things it's actually pretty good better than the quest bar that blueberry gives it a little pizzazz and for a 52 gram serving size so that is less than the quest bar 7 fat 24 carb 12 protein oh okay flavor pretty good but uh that might explain why the flavor is so good because there's only 12 grams of protein so personally i would not buy this bar nor would i eat this bar some of you all loved it though you suggested this flavor and it tastes good it's good but you know for the calories and everything only 12 grams of protein just just buy a snickers you know that's kind of where i'm at with it so i i'll put this in the one i would not buy so left pile next up we got the luna bar a lot of you women out there love these bars and some of my more feminine men i ain't judging you but you like what you like never had this one 200 calories on the back what do i got 203 so this one is another accurate label 7 fat 27 carb 8 grams of protein so off rip no matter how good this tastes i would never buy it but it is non-gmo i don't care about that oh okay and she's pretty when you only have eight grams of protein you can fill the rest with uh sugar and icing you know it kind of makes sense looks pretty though three two one let's go i mean it's really good this is white chocolate macadamia flavor tastes like an all-expenses paid trip to muralago you're going to like it in the moment but the backlash on social media afterwards is going to be terrible the flavor on this one man that's excellent right there so i get why you liked it why you suggested it eight grams of protein i ain't buying it not anabolic enough but your taste buds work so that's a good sign next up we got the one plant protein bar baby i uh anything that has plant on it i normally don't like it's vegan certified gluten free i don't care about either one of those i'll never be a vegan even if they tied me up and brainwashed me with some mk ultra type stuff it just ain't happening my genetics wouldn't even allow that 180 calories on the back what did i get 213 calories they're lying to us by about 33 calories because they do the fiber trick that same fiber trick eight grams of fat 21 grams of carbs 12 grams of protein jesus they're skimping on the protein here so automatically i'm gonna tell you i wouldn't buy this let's see if the flavor is good all right if you take a ganders at her she looks just like a chocolate bar really with a 45 gram serving sauce you're getting a pretty small serving size too for 230 calories so keep that in mind as well man some bars do optical illusions they look bigger but they're thinner and they're not as wide it's the weight on the back you got to look at man that gramage all right let's go three two one nope nope don't buy that one not enough protein plant i didn't bring a napkin we'll just use the final boss joggers yeah don't buy that one um don't wasn't good and so far just to keep it in perspective the only one in my go pile is the quest bar so moving right along couldn't believe how many of you guys suggested the power crunch bar man apparently these are a big hit huge hit let me see 215 calories what did i get when i broke it down 217 calories so they're accurate on the label accurate on the label macros 13 fat 13 carb 12 protein so once again i would not keep these in my house because it's not 20 grams of protein at least come on man it even says protein energy bar on it what are we doing let's open this up oh red velvet flavor by the way okay looks like a kitkat kinda serving size of 40 grams so this is the smallest bar by far as far as how much we're getting for the calories see gotta look at that stuff bud you want to be fuller i'm just going to break this down the middle what's that middle look like oh that made a mess yeah see looks like a kit kat in there three two one come on low airy not bad i mean the flavor's not like out of this world good or anything but it's not bad the texture is the best part okay we're gonna go in the do not buy pile flavors all right they have 20 grams of protein maybe but uh yeah i don't know not digging it next up we got a clif bar the amount of times clients ask me in programs so they can use a cliff bar i always have to tell them no you don't want a clif bar so see what we got six fat nine grams of protein 43 grams of carbs the worst macros of any of them we've had so far 260 calories on the label accurate because i got 262 with the math so they ain't lying to us but there is not enough protein in here what flavor did i get that smells terrible coconut chocolate chip made with organic oats and coconut organic that's how they're getting people man it's these healthy buzz words they're getting you with this is just a candy bar bud alright take a look at her covered in chocolate i mean she looks pretty i guess if you live in west virginia i imagine that looks like something you'd enjoy i mean all you taste is sugar into coconut overly sweet 68 gram serving size you're getting like some heft to this so not bad but just the amount of calories no protein this goes in the no pile holy cow i wasn't expecting it to go like this people we got a crumb mess here next up pure protein bar i have also suggested these in quite a few videos it's because i love the macros we got six fat 19 carb 20 protein big fan of that hit that 20 minimum and they're cheap if you buy them at walmart not too bad what did i get here on my little breakdown 210 calories they're lying to us by about 10 calories so not terrible could be worse i've had quite a few of these but i've never had marshmallow crispy treats that's a flavor i went with because i wanted to have one that i've never had before and honestly the other flavors of these i've had normally i freeze them i think it makes them taste a little better but these have a very strong protein taste all right so if you're not used to a protein taste like you wouldn't give this to your mom and she'd want to eat it if she doesn't like work out but you might not mind it but you know other people might not like it and we get a 50 gram serving size here so not terrible but not the best all right that's what we're working with here doesn't look too bad a little thin ram is the length that matters no it's not its width three two one come on this one might be oh okay never mind that protein is an aftertaste it comes in at the tail end at the front end you're like this this is actually really good then at the back end leaves a sort of phlegm in there but not a bad flavor for these pure proteins but i mean they're cheap you kind of give what you pay for you know what i mean i think if you were trying to budget and save money this might be your best bet although flavor leaves something to be desired so that goes in the approval pile i will approve those next up we got the kind plant protein bar i'm going to give it a couple extra points because in a world that's so cruel it's reminding us to be kind all right we look at the macros here we got a 50 gram serving size so not too too big but here's the kicker 18 fat 17 carb 12 grams of protein fat's low high protein's a little low around 12. so personally i can already tell you i would not buy this one 250 calories on here what did i get 278 so lying to us right 278 calories only getting 12 grams of protein not a fan not a fan but you can see why when you take a look at it now that's beautiful i mean if you just wanted some nuts and some peanut butter that is a beautiful bar right there get a load of that sucker take that one to the beauty pageant three two one come on it doesn't taste as good as you look it's just nuts i mean you ever had a peanut that's what that is it's just nuts so we'll move that to the wood knot by pile whoo we getting down to the nitty-gritty okay cliff is making a fantastic return here this is the builder's protein bar so they're advertising protein on this bad boy we got a 68 gram serving size so this might be the largest bar that we're gonna mess with 11 grams of fat 20 grams of protein 29 grams of carbs i could work with that advertises 300 calories on the label but when i did the math 295 calories we're putting a little bit in the bank with this one and what flavor is this crunchy peanut butter okay how's that new car smell to it so this looks like you know white chocolate pressed in a factory in sweat shop like conditions i don't know but that's my guess three two one come on that does not taste good at all at all who's buying these yeah um nutritionally i like to have 20 grams of protein so i'm not mad at it maybe their other flavors are better but this was just not good it's not good um i don't know how to put this one because nutritionally for me it works but i personally would not buy it so go in and do not buy a pile boom all right now the moment we've all been waiting for man keep in mind these next two protein bars are about to do with the ones i am about to launch which is the anabars baby this one is cinnamon swirl crunch now keep in mind all the bars up to this point i have no steak in i do this the company i am launching so this is uh you know obviously i might be a little bit biased but i'm gonna tell you guys i might be as honest as i can because i believe in my product 100 so let's get down here man serving size 65 grams so this is uh the second biggest bar we've done other than that builder's bar we just did which has 68 grams macros you got 11 fat 21 grams of protein 24 grams of carbs that works for me man 275 calories on the label if you do the math it's 279 so we're within four there bud that's that's my promise to you we're not going to give you an inaccurate label and subtract fiber i couldn't do it to them this premium packaging let's open it this is even hard to open but that packaging is premium so this is what we are looking like right here she's dense and what you're seeing if you can see that hopefully that's focusing sometimes it doesn't have a flip out screen but we got pieces of cinnamon toast crunch in there when you bite into it you're gonna have a crunch tour and uh you're gonna be incredible i'm telling you well let me just eat it three two one come on i understand some of you watching might not trust me they're like all right this is obviously product promotion he's going to tell us it's the best bar he's ever had because he wants to sell a crap ton of them and i do i want to sell them for sure but i'm telling you when i designed these right when we went into the lab and we made these bars the goal my reputation is food i knew my reputation was making products that actually taste good right with good macros good ingredients and um we killed it man this is uh ah man i i feel so bad telling you this but this bar tastes better than all of these every single one of them 100 times better when i was testing these i was sending samples to my mom and my sister because that was my goal right i don't want to make a protein bar that only appeals to a certain type of crowd i want to make a protein bar to where if you took 12 of them you ripped all the packaging off and you put them on a plate and had them just sitting out at like a christmas party or something it said you baked freaking cookies or something and people were grabbing them and eating them no one would have any idea that it was a protein bar that was my goal the goals i do my recipes on the channel everything is like i want you to love what you're doing i want you to enjoy it right so with this protein bar and this brand in particular that is our goal so uh it's freaking incredible mmm this one's just so crunchy that's the best part it's so soft like the other ones are heavily processed look at that dude it just falls apart falls apart jesus i mean that alright that goes in the the my preferred box over here the preferred pile were you expecting anything different all right next up we got the anabar peanut butter and jelly flavor now if you know i live in texas next to alphalete gym i took multiple boxes in there and had i was giving these out for free i wanted everybody's opinion there on them i didn't get one piece of bad feedback but it seemed the majority of people liked the peanut butter and jelly better so uh let me see i'm gonna i've been eating both quite a bit i had three yesterday i've had like three today so far so i'm just gonna be honest eat this one i'll tell you guys which one i like better this one actually has better macros than the last one 265 calories 11 fat 21 protein 21 carb and according to the label 267 calories actually start label once again is accurate only off by two calories so but once again take a look at that we got little crunchy pieces in there she's soft watch this watch this look at that bud does it get fresher than that not one i'm not want to try to sell you on buzzwords or anything either but we don't use any fillers no sugar alcohols no gmos i personally don't really care about that stuff but i know some people when it comes to like sugar alcohols and things that upsets your stomach right but everything in here is all natural seeing i will sweat that all right baby let's eat it let's go it's hard to say i can make an argument for both of these bars but if i had to swing it one way or another i would say i'm 51 in favor of pb and j 49 in the cinema swirl crunch but i'm 100 in flavor of the white chocolate oreo which should be done in the next couple weeks i was my favorite i literally cannot wait if you guys try these holy cow holy cow 65 grams serving size once again so other than that one builder's bar we have where you at that big old goofy one it beat us out by three grams other than that we were the uh the second biggest bar here so the most bang for your buck 21 grams of protein the flavor is out of this freaking world give one to your grandmama she gonna think it's good that's what i'm trying to bring to the table man so when it comes to the winners we had pure protein bar we had quest bar and we had the anna bars baby the goal is going to be with these guys we're trying to drop them we have to wait on white chocolate to finish which should be in the next couple weeks which will put us at an early to mid march launch so follow me on instagram at the remington james follow me on twitter remingtonjv

moisturizer and then i use the pm\u00a0\u00a0 one at night and this has spf so it has sunscreen\u00a0\nin it but yeah okay guys i am genuinely looking\u00a0\u00a0 really really bad today i just want you to know i\u00a0\nnormally don't look this bad but i just finished\u00a0\u00a0 and now i'm just gonna drink my spark and do some\u00a0\nschool hey guys so we just got back from our run\u00a0\u00a0 and we made this little creation so you guys can\u00a0\nsee every step we do so the first thing we do\u00a0\u00a0 after we get back from our run is take our\u00a0\ncontacts we do wear contacts we wear our contacts\u00a0\u00a0 during the night and take them out in the\u00a0\nmorning if you want to know more about\u00a0\u00a0 that we can talk about it in the next video\u00a0\nor any video so basically she just goes in\u00a0\u00a0 and takes the plunger and it just plunges right\u00a0\nout and then you can put them in here you just\u00a0\u00a0 put them in the case case like that close it fill\u00a0\nit up and it's in both eyes by the way she just\u00a0\u00a0 wanted to show you fill the case up and there's\u00a0\nour contacts so that takes literally two minutes\u00a0\u00a0 okay guys so

"homemade rice krispies treats are crunchy gooey and sweet I'm going to show you how to have more fun with them by adding different cereals on just add sugar we're bringing you some of our favorite sugary recipes that are short attempt and to light any sweet tooth so I already have some butter melting in a big pot and I'm just gonna add a 10 ounce bag of mini marshmallows so fun I'm pretty much making this just like your standard rice krispies treats but I know I feel like Rice Krispies have all the fun and what about they're pretty pebbles and the golden grams of the world so I'm just gonna have these marshmallows melt over a medium-low heat now my personal favorite combination to make is fruity pebbles Froot Loops and Trix it's pretty much the most colorful sweet cereal you can find but I feel like it's a lot of fun combining a couple so like Reese's puffs are really really yummy with chocolate Lucky Charms so you have like the chocolate flavor but then the peanut butter from the Reese's puffs another really great combo is cinnamon toast crunch with Golden Grahams so freaking good so I think what's great about making these at home is you can literally have so much fun with all the mix-ins and it's it's a basic recipe it's just three tablespoons of butter ten ounces of marshmallows and then six cups of any cereal you want as soon as your marshmallows are melted nice and smooth you're gonna turn off the heat and add your cereal all right so I got my tricks my fruit lose my fruity pebbles pour them all in and then give it a good stir and fold the marshmallow all over the cereal you want to coat every single piece oh it smells so fruity in here and sweet and yummy mmm this looks fantastic now I'm just gonna pour it into a pan that I've already sprayed with nonstick cooking spray now whatever sticks to the spatula I just think that I should keep because I'm the one that made these anyways so I'm gonna save that for later and then a great tip for pushing all of the cereal down into the pan is just spray your hands with a little bit of nonstick cooking spray a little rub rough and then just press and be very careful this actually isn't hot anymore but it's warm I like my rice krispies treats really really thick so I'm pushing this into a brownie pan but you could actually press it into a cooking pan too or a baking sheet and what's fun about making them at home is you can cut them out any shape you want you can use different cookie cutters heart crispy treats alright so now that it's packed in there I'm just gonna let it cool before we cut them now that my marshmallows cereal treats are cut and cold you can even take them a step further by dipping them in chocolate so I actually have some melted chocolate right here and you can drizzle it or you could just dip them half away oh my gosh so this one that I made is the Reese's puffs with the chocolate Lucky Charms dipped it halfway and milk chocolate and then I'm just gonna let it harden for a second let's whistle this one with some white chocolate you can really have fun with glazes frostings anything you want really and then while the glaze is wet I'm just gonna sprinkle it with a little bit of sprinkles these are such great desserts I think people think of rice krispies treats as being a snack but if you brought these to a party let me tell you there won't be anything left these look so amazing and they're so yummy - rice krispie treats aren't just for kids thanks so much for watching let me know what your favorite combo is in the comment box below and don't forget to give this

welcome back to the channel welcome back to my kitchen on an ideal anabolic morning the sun would be shining the birds would be chirping and you'd be standing over a stove making some anabolic french toast or some anabolic pancakes but not every anabolic day is going to be ideal some mornings you wake up and a tree's falling on your house other days you might wake up and your toy poodle attacked the mailman and did three dollars worth of damage or sometimes you got to hop in the car and rush to kroger because they're having a sale on sugar-free syrup so when an emergency strikes and you don't got time to cook something it's nice to have something in the fridge that you can just grab and take with you on the road shouldn't have done that motion so today i'm going to show you guys a super simple make ahead meal you can store in bulk and uh when the mood strikes you can get in that fridge and get you one in today's video we'll be making anabolic four ingredient cereal bars the perfect anabolic breakfast bar that is loaded with flavor and so simple to make even a toddler can do it if you've been wanting anabolic pancakes for breakfast but your girl's water just broke and you gotta rush to the hospital and look no further than this video cause i'm telling you these bars just might change your life and this recipe along with every other one of my anabolic stupid simple high protein recipes is available in my cookbook handy little guide right in your pocket man my arsenal my toolbook is basically if you took my channel all the knowledge contained within put it in an easy to use guide right on your phone if you want to die that's sustainable you can eat the foods you love and still see results check it out baby you get it one time and get every future recipe i have for free so if you guys are ready to go epic video underway then as always man i'm here to do it for you let's do it [Laughter] [Music] [Music] i'm telling y'all this recipe is so easy anybody watching can do it the four ingredients you probably already have at the crib well maybe not one of them just an easy ingredient anyway so let's get this started man y'all are gonna love it come on so the first ingredient in the one you probably don't got laying around the house is a box of cheerios of all the cereals cheerios tend to have the best macros and they're pretty iconic and these ones are even shaped like hearts kind of ironic coming from a company like general mills that steps on the soles of its employees just to make a net profit so all we're going to do is weigh out 39 grams in a mixing bowl and next up we're going to add a scoop of protein powder now the better your protein powder tastes the better this recipe is going to be that's why i use that fono boss whey for years i was a lost soul until someone showed me the way and at this point all i want to do is shake this up a little bit and evenly spread that protein powder around [Music] so we're done with this bowl for now we're going to swap it out with a smaller bowl and in this bowl we're gonna create a little glue that's gonna help everything stick together so i need 60 grams of sugar-free maple syrup five calories of serving right here put that right down in here and then the final ingredient we're going to throw in here is 32 grams of a natural peanut butter i like to buy the ones that got a little bit of oil in them a little bit of that separation i think it melts a little easier but if not don't worry about it but that's what i'm talking about look at the top of that looks a little gross but it works good so i'm just going to measure and weigh out my 32 grams all i need to do now is throw this in the microwave for about 45 seconds on high gonna melt this peanut butter down i'm gonna have ourselves a nice little glue and after 45 seconds she's looking good i'm gonna go in here with my spoon and stir this in together until it's fully combined with the maple syrup and you'll notice how the peanut butter just kind of liquefies man i mean legit you could eat this right here and uh i wouldn't judge you and then once you got it mixed this is what it should look like thick runny peanut buttery mapley all the qualities i look for in a warm one now all we want to do is spoon this down into our mixing bowl with our protein and our cheerios make sure you get all of it and then now we just go in and we're going to stir everything together until it's fully combined and everything has the same consistency [Music] and once we're fully mixed up we just take a mini loaf pan which i've set a little bit of plastic wrap in here and all i'm gonna do is slowly spoon oh look at that you could eat that right there and that'd be great but i'll just put it right down in here i'm gonna do that with all of our cheerios and once we're all in here we're just gonna go in with a spoon and press down until it fully shapes the plan and looks like one big bar [Music] and once it's all firmly pressed down we're just gonna fold over our extra plastic wrap to seal it up once it's folded over you can even use your fingers and shape it a little bit more just press it down and then now all we got to do is toss this in the fridge for about 30 minutes to firm up but overnight if you want the best texture is my preference like i said technically you can eat it right now and it'd be incredible you'd love it but we're going to let it firm up because we want to cut it and split it into multiple bars so i'm gonna toss it in here look how packed this fridge is maybe look we got meal prep containers two full cauldrons of sugar-free soda more fat-free cheese than anywhere else in america so i will go ahead and swap that one out for one that i made last night so we got this one let's open it up so like i said this one was in there overnight and look how easy it unwraps take it right off of that plastic and look at what we got here man a solid anabolic cereal bar it's not crumbly it's not sticky it's literally perfect [Music] and all i'll do now is take a knife and cut this into three bars boom and boom ladies and gentlemen i present to you anabolic no-bake cereal bars [Music] and there we go man just like that we have healthy cereal bars that are perfect for grab-and-go minimal prep time minimal ingredients you're not buying some processed thing at the gas station wondering why you feel like crap after having all that sugar it's really man a win-win for everybody involved we do have a couple extra bars here because i have been testing this recipe and trying to perfect it that's why there's five but feel free to double or triple this recipe use a bigger pan you can make more bars at one time if you're houston's most eligible bachelor like myself you don't need a big batch but if you got a family you got kids that are running out the door you want to fill them up with some quality nutrition or you got a woman in the house to feed go wild man make as many as you want if you made it this far into the video guys please smash that thumbs up button for me that helps more than you know any comments down below will do what kind of recipes do you want to see me make i got this idea from a comment so who knows man if you got a dream you want to make a reality put it down below i might just get around to it and you already know what it is i think it's time ladies and gentlemen to pull up a chair strap on the old feed bag and try this thing together you guys ready let's go all right baby it is time to go i'm gonna go ahead and eat one full recipe right now which is gonna be three of these bars because i got the calories for it man when you're eating recipes like this we don't just get one of them and then we're done we can have the whole thing if we want and as always man the protein i use in all of my recipes is final boss performance way the flavor is great it works great in recipes man sometimes i get emails people saying they tried a recipe it didn't quite work out and i asked them what their protein powder was and they'll be using like vegan or like egg white protein but you want a good solid whey protein a dairy protein with good macros man so if you want a good one finalbosspromise.com could rgf10 will save you 10 and we will start with this one right here four simple ingredients a little bit of time in the fridge let's see how she is three two one let go super how simple this recipe is it is so good i mean it's peanut butter syrup protein powder cheerios what could go wrong there oh my goodness you can just pull it apart too end up with a little bite size guy like that and it's soft and chewy so it actually takes a little longer to eat than you think which is a good thing longer your food takes to eat the more time you have for them signals to be sent from your stomach to your brain saying hey bud cut that crap out in bars like this they're super convenient like for me ma'am the most uh i would say arduous i don't know if i call it arduous that's a big word the most dialed in i have to be for something i do every day is when i'm editing a video man that's hours just sitting there chopping up clips you get a little brain dead and a lot of times once you get that focus going you don't have to interrupt it by cooking a meal so having something like this just laying around you can grab right i mean just one of these guys is like 150 calories good macros protein everything you need sometimes just one little thing to tide you over until you can make a bigger meal can make all the difference or like i said earlier man you're heading out of the house you want something you can take on the road with you this will work just fine now in this entire recipe if you make it exactly like i did for all three bars which you end up with for the whole thing is only 508 calories 20 grams of fat 36 grams of protein 46 grams of carbs 6 grams of fiber so roughly 165 calories per bar 12 grams of protein 15 grams of carbs 2 grams of fiber 7 grams of fat which is basically what you're going to find in a lot of your store-bought protein bars it's about these macros except we made them at a fraction of the cost made them at home and we know exactly what's in them you know i mean that label ain't lying to us we know we put into it we got complete control over it and uh for real man the flavor is outstanding and we are down to the final bite let's go i gotta give this one another 10 out of 10. it gets extra points for simplicity the flavor is simple but it tastes amazing if you like peanut butter you like syrup you like cheerios you're gonna like this one and to be honest there's no reason why all of you shouldn't try this recipe out make it tag me on instagram on your story that way i can repost you to mine i can see the creations you guys are making i'm telling you you take the time to make this one that little eensy weensy bit of time it takes to make this one there's no way

else besides him he's telling me so but yeah we about to make some [ __ ] cereal bars on fruity even pretty probably i've seen the title you can now gotta explain it too much but you will need some fruity pebbles for this recipe i don't know what the [ __ ] you making uh you're gonna need a measuring cup i mean if you unless you got like some other [ __ ] you for me you're just gonna need five cups of that [ __ ] you're gonna need a 10 ounce bag of marshmallows you put me 10 ounces make sure it's 10 ounces this is how you check my guy nobody ever told me how to check at first it's on the bottom to say 10 000. now you need some can of butter or coconut oil this is coconut oil all you need is three teaspoons uh this is just leftover i had from making gummies and [ __ ] like that yeah i wanna know how to make gummies or infuse [ __ ] like that that's like storyboard already let me know let me let me know i have a stain on my tank top oh from what nigga's wallet yeah i think he's feeling good today it's early in the morning he's feeling good today but yeah oh [ __ ] let's just get it started oh damn i'm walling up man you need wax paper too for um when you uh put it in a pan and [ __ ] you also need a pan i'm forgetting mad [ __ ] good but uh i do need a pan and some wax paper for me you should like that oh yeah rp king vaughn too man again like damn bro like just got the drop on the flexor [ __ ] [ __ ] damn i didn't think that i [ __ ] [ __ ] he's waving his plate oh my god bro i took it to the ah [ __ ] bro that's not i don't even want to talk about it no more let's continue on but i like to prep my [ __ ] first so i'm uh which i know everything i'm gonna show you everything i'm doing down here yeah but uh measure up five cups of this [ __ ] for me i did not get the large size but that's why i'm [ __ ] instacart man [ __ ] i said the family should they get well i'll be one punch i've been wanting to punch so what i like to do is pre-measure my [ __ ] i got a ziploc bag for me i'm gonna put the um damn cereal and give me five cups sorry if you could hear the um if you can hear or see anything i'm doing in the background with cannon butter and [ __ ] like that my [ __ ] hey mind your business yeah we gonna do it like that one cup do that five times all right so this is five cups of pure [ __ ] [ __ ] um fruity pebbles oh [ __ ] but then there's enough for me why the [ __ ] do i keep saying bananas like marshmallows what the [ __ ] i don't even know why i'm thinking of bananas that's kind of sucks bro it's kind of such i'm not i'm not gator not saying there's anything wrong with being gay man if you gay do you man i really don't give a [ __ ] for me yeah now we gotta get to the melting for me but uh i need three teaspoons of this [ __ ] well tablespoons tablespoons don't let me [ __ ] you up three tablespoons of that [ __ ] yeah i'm gonna take y'all over to the pot right now it might be a little less light but yeah we bout to go over it i got the i got the oven on six right now i mean oven i'm bugging out today bro what the [ __ ] i got the skillet on on uh six today you feel me we need three teaspoons three tablespoons of this coconut oil one huh you still got some more to spare make some hot cheetos with this later if you want me to show you how to make edible hot cheetos just let me know in the comments okay now take your marshmallows that big ass panda mellows throw that [ __ ] on there throw that [ __ ] on oh yeah that's all in there all the good [ __ ] now you want to get you a spoon for me start mixing start mixing even before this [ __ ] hot because these shits melt fast and uh you don't want to get the can of butter i mean uh the coconut oil is too hot you for me so have it on a low heat i put it down to four at this point one again i have a low heat it's already starting to melt it's already starting to melt together [Music] [Music] all right let's get in there we on the way this is not melted enough i wish i could see the [ __ ] green and [ __ ] in here some people do this [ __ ] with their hands i don't know how my [ __ ] yeah get this [ __ ] to basically consistency like that or you can't see like the solidness of the marshmallows anymore i'm gonna take that [ __ ] off the heat yeah yeah i see that see that [ __ ] all right you get that for me put that right here real quick i hope you can see me put that right there real quick get you a bowl all i got is this [ __ ] this [ __ ] i finally got at least one one guy give me this it's something for me they get cereal for that [ __ ] in there now put all of this [ __ ] in there all that i see all of this [ __ ] is infused marshmallow so i would get all of this [ __ ] you don't want to waste none of that chicken here all right that's about all i can get out that [ __ ] that's all infusion you get us into your dog or something if you like getting your pets off and now most people do this [ __ ] with their hands bro i'm not about to do this [ __ ] with my hands so just get a spoon start mixing start mixing all right at this point you're basically done my guy but now this all depends if you like it gooey or not i like it a little less gooey so i'm gonna add a little more cereal just like that for me get back to stirring she's gonna get a little hard to stir when you get this [ __ ] all together real hard to [ __ ] stir all right i should be all right now pretty much the gist of it but now you gotta make them into bars if you want to eat this [ __ ] just by itself like this have fun you probably be high as [ __ ] get some wax paper look at the size of the pan [Music] through the pan out of here basically just line it on top before me want this [ __ ] in here oh actually just came out the bowl now smooth it out for me make it into bars this [ __ ] is sticky so it might be a little hard just take your time for me there's no rush that's on real quick cause this hand is biggest [ __ ] to add a wall right here yeah this pan a little too big so i basically made a little pan out of the big pan it's not like we're putting this [ __ ] in the oven but it's going in the fridge yeah see that it's not sticking as much you're good flat in it yeah i know it's been a damn i've been doing this [ __ ] for a minute yeah hey after you get this [ __ ] to the size you want it's pretty good that [ __ ] does take a minute

them by adding different cereals on just add sugar we're bringing you some of our favorite sugary recipes that are short attempt and to light any sweet tooth so I already have some butter melting in a big pot and I'm just going to add a 10 ounce bag of mini marshmallows so fun I'm pretty much making this just like your standard rice krispies treats but I know I feel like Rice Krispies have all the fun and what about the fruity pebbles and the golden grams of the world so I'm just going to have these marshmallows melt over a medium-low heat now my personal favorite combination to make is fruity pebbles Froot Loops and Trix it's pretty much the most colorful sweet cereal you can find but I feel like it's a lot of fun combining a couple so like Reese's puffs are really really yummy with chocolate Lucky Charms so you have like the chocolate flavor but then the peanut butter from the Reese's puffs another really great combo is Cinnamon Toast Crunch with Golden Grahams so freaking good so I think what's great about making these at home is you can literally have so much fun with all the mix ins and it's it's a basic recipe it's just three tablespoons of butter ten ounces of marshmallows and then six cups of any cereal you want as soon as your marshmallows are melted nice and smooth you're going to turn off the heat and add your cereal all right so I got my tricks my fruit lose my fruity pebbles pour them all in and then give it a good stir and fold the marshmallow all over the cereal you want to coat every single piece oh it smells so fruity in here and sweet and yummy mmm this looks fantastic now I'm just going to pour it into a pan that I've already sprayed with nonstick cooking spray now whatever sticks to the spatula I just think that I should keep because I'm the one that made these anyway so I'm going to save that for later and then a great tip for pushing all of the cereal down into the pan is just spray your hands a little bit of nonstick Spray a little rub rub and then just press and be very careful this actually isn't hot anymore but it's warm I like my rice krispies treats really really thick so I'm pushing this into a brownie pan but you could actually press it into a cooking pan too or a baking sheet and what's fun about making them at home is you can cut them out any shape you want you can use different cookie cutters heart crispy treats alright so now that it's packed in there I'm just going to let it cool before we cut them now that my marshmallow cereal treats are cut and cold you can even take them a step further by dipping them in chocolate so I actually have some melted chocolate right here and you can drizzle it or you could just dip them half away oh my gosh so this one that I made is the Reese's puffs with the chocolate Lucky Charms dipped it half way in milk chocolate and then I'm just going to let it harden for a second let's drizzle this one with some white chocolate you can really have fun with glazes frostings anything you want really and then while the glaze is wet I'm just going to sprinkle it with a little bit of sprinkles these are such great desserts I think people think of rice krispies treats as being a snack but if you brought these to a party let me tell you there won't be anything left these look so amazing and they're so yummy - rice krispie treats aren't just for kids thanks so much for watching let me know what your favorite combo is in the comment box below and don't forget to give this video a thumbs up and subscribe I'm brandy we'll see you next time on just dead sugar", "1ez_d0UoBrw": "[Music] are you a parent with a toddler that has way too many Cheerios lying around that's what happened to me and I needed to find a way to use them up that's why I'm making today some three ingredient cereal bars there are a sweet no big treat that couldn't be easier to make and the whole family can enjoy and I promise you that those extra Cheerios will be gone in a snap so come on grab your box of Cheerios and I'll show you how to make these [Music] what's up universe hook them back to my kitchen and in case you're new here I'm Julian I'm a chef I'm a mom and for this season of our show our focus is on some easy and yummy snacks that we can actually execute and film while our son Lincoln naps with all that said I think it's time to make some three ingredient cereal bars what you're gonna need is plain Cheerios peanut butter and honey this is almost embarrassing ly not a recipe it's so easy to make but you know what I feel like sometimes just watching the technique helps right you're gonna start out with a half a cup of peanut butter so this is like regular like Skippy jiff that kind of peanut butter can you use natural peanut butter or say something else like almond butter you know what I really don't know cuz I haven't tried it I think it should be okay cuz you're just looking for something gloppy I don't know if you want to give it a try let me know in the comments how it worked out for you and then you're gonna use a third of a cup of honey so you're just gonna pour that in and let these two mingle sometimes it helps to spray your measuring cup with a little bit of nonstick spray so that the honey will just slide out I've seen some recipes out there where you're using one to one as a ratio and I can understand where that's coming from because you're essentially making a glue that's holding together your Cheerios kind of like the concept of rice krispie treats so I guess more honey the stickier it is the better it holds but to me I find it a little bit too sweet actually even with a third of a cup from my preference I think it's still on the sweeter side but I think you need a little bit of it just so that it holds together this is gonna go on about medium-low heat for about three minutes or just until it all comes together and melts nicely just make sure you stir it every now and then and you're just looking for some ribboning like that okay that looks good so while it's nice and ribbony glossy and smooth that's when you grab your Cheerios and I'm using three and a half cups of plain Cheerios you don't want to use any kind of sweet and Cheerios even multigrain or Honey Nut because it'll be too sweet and if you have a little toddler or little baby then you probably had this in your pantry already and I think Lincoln's just at the stage where he's kind of outgrowing it we had a good run he's two years old now so he was fine just eating plain Cheerios but now I think he's kind of bored of them so now we just have like an excess so this is coming out of pure realistic necessity then you're just gonna toss and coat until every single little cheerio is covered with a glossy mixture it's tempting to just grab a spoon and eat it right out of the bowl and then you're just gonna grab yourself an 8 by 8 pan so I'm just using this little square one right here and then you're gonna cut down a piece of parchment that 15 side and if it looks like it's just rising up it might help to use a little bit of nonstick spray just to weigh it down so there and now it's kind of glued down to the bottom okay and then you're just gonna dump this right into your parchment paper the parchment paper helps the Cheerios not to stick to the dish because we're not baking this this is a no bake recipe but it is gonna spend time into refrigerator and then once it hardens you want to be able to lift it out easily and you can see how this little square baking dish is the perfect size for this amount just going to grab a spatula and push the Cheerios to all the corners try to get it nice and even the first couple times I made this cuz you know these kinds of recipes are all over Pinterest I was wondering why my Cheerios kept falling apart the key is you really have to press the living daylights out of them because you're not baking it and all its relying on is the peanut butter and honey hardening up in the fridge I can't help myself mmm well you can't go wrong with peanut butter and honey if you were already using a measuring have to measure up your peanut butter you can use the bottom of that you can use the bottom of a bowl or a cup just anything that will allow you to have more impact because like I said you really want to take the time to firmly press without crushing and crumbling your Cheerios and that's it so we're just gonna pop this in the fridge for about an hour you need that chill time to allow it to solidify and then we're just gonna unveil it and cut it into pieces [Music] all right so it's been about an hour and we're just gonna oh and it is nice and firm I can tell I'm gonna use this little pit part Schmidt and perfect and you can cut it any way you want you can cut it in like lumbar form if you want but because I didn't put a ton of honey and I'm afraid they're smaller I cut it the more crumbly it'll get I think I'm gonna go for about 16 pieces from this one 8 by 8 square wow that crunch yeah it helps together guys I mean the more time it spends in the fridge the easier time you'll have having it hold together I mean I guess if you want to be super generous you could leave it in these long bar forms but I think it's a little bit too much cereal treat for me so I'm gonna cut it smaller all right they're so cute and a little crumbly and so now I think all there is left to do is taste it [Music] I know this is no surprise to you how these tastes because I make this often these days so but we'll just taste it for you guys again and these are best served cold actually I think they have to be cold because they'll start to crumble apart as they get to room temperature so the longer they stay in the fridge the better luck you'll have with cutting them and the better luck you will have without them crumbling apart well these are pretty solid as it is so delicious it's not surprising because yeah I had even these this morning for breakfast well as you can tell I'm trying to get rid of our Cheerios for sure okay ours is crumbling apart but my batch before this wasn't because I kept it in the fridge overnight this one we're like rushing to film this so it's not that solid yet but you get the concept right nice and sweet but not too sweet not too sweet mm-hmm I guess you were saying about the honey like the amount mm-hmm put in it gets a little harder but then it gets a little too sweet yeah I just want a glass of milk with this because it's so peanut buttery yeah actually that's immiscible really good or even a cup of coffee in the morning this is a great snack to have even in the morning or on the run or you know when you just have like that Snickers moment where you're just like hangry in the middle of the day this is a great thing to just keep in your fridge so anyways there's not much to say to this except for they're just sweet and satisfying peanut buttery goodness so if you enjoyed watching this recipe then please let

recipes granola bars muesli bars and cereal bars all these bars are plant-based grain free some of them are not free and without any added sweetener let's start with the granola bars which are very similar to kind bars they are really easy to make and consists of only three ingredients coconut flakes almonds and maple syrup I have made several variations of these granola bars with different ingredients including peanuts cherries chocolate pretty much all the flavors that kind bars coming [Music] mix everything until well combined the mixture won't really look like it's going to hold together but as the maple syrup caramelizes and congeals in the oven it will bind everything transfer the mixture into a parchment paper lined the dish and press it into an even layer pack it down really tightly so the granola bars hold their shape [Music] take the granola bar set 325 degrees Fahrenheit until golden brown on top for about 35 minutes let the bars cool completely before cutting [Music] next up our muesli bars with loads of seeds and dried food the only sweetener and a binder in this muesli bars is bananas the riper the bananas the sweeter the muesli bars will be of course you can add a sweetener but I don't as long as you have ripe bananas the muesli bars will be sweet enough the bulking ingredient here is quinoa specifically quinoa flakes but you can use rolled oats or any other flakes you like sunflower seeds pumpkin seeds hemp seeds cranberries cherries and that's it feel free to use any nuts seeds or dried fruit you like this recipe is really flexible so you can easily change it up gently mix all the ingredients until well combined I'm saying gently because quinoa flakes are quite delicate so you can easily crush them [Music] transfer the mixture into a parchment paper lined baking dish and bake it at 350 degrees Fahrenheit until firm and lightly golden around the edges for about 25 minutes [Music] last are what I call cereal bars these are actually really close to Clif bars the sweetener and a binder here our dates add the dates into a bowl of a food processor and process them into a smooth paste metal dates work the best here because they are a fresh fruit so they are soft and juicy if you are using a different type of dates you might want to soak them first so they hydrate and soften up a little [Music] at if the date placed into a large bowl together with buckwheat flakes again you can use rolled oats quinoa flakes amaranth flakes whatever you prefer hazelnuts almond butter and vanilla extract [Music] mix all the ingredients together until well combined because the date paste is really thick you will just kind of need to retch the spatula in to evenly coat the dry ingredients the mixture will be really thick and clumpy [Music] transfer the mixture into a parchment paper lined baking dish and bake it at 325 degrees Fahrenheit until firm and lightly golden around the edges for about 25 minutes you could actually keep these bars completely raw if you wanted to and that's it granola bars muesli bars and cereal bars [Music] we've got three types of granola bars or cereal bars here whatever you want to call them and as you saw in the video they have different binders and different sweeteners so not only do they taste differently but they also have completely different textures so what do you think I think that the simplest way to break this down this is go the candy bar which is almond and coconut yeah with maple syrup as the binder chewy crunchy snappy so it really reminds me of candy bar really sweet then we have the breakfast bar over here which is bound together it's like slightly chewy malleable lots of seeds most of the flavor is coming from the banana so it's not as sweet as this it's the least sweet yeah that's very thin and then it has the most amount of seeds in it so there's lots of nutritional content I'm guessing in there so that's why I'm calling it like the breakfast bar I think you'd get a lot of like jump start your day out of this it's like a trail mix sure yep I would prepare this one it was buckwheat and hazelnut and dates it's like a energy bar like a Clif Bar reminds you of a Clif Bar it has a very dense but once again malleable bendable kind of form to it really reminds me of a Clif Bar in the in the texture of it but it's its second in sweetness to the candy bar or the almond coconut that we're doing here and it's not as sweet as a Clif Bar no but this one is like the hazelnuts are really tasty the buckwheat isn't a really pronounced flavor I don't like it when the buckwheat is really evident because I find it as a really strong aftertaste and it's almost gritty in this case Petra has somehow managed to do it without any of that dates and that butter then overpower everything and that's a good point it's very dense like a Clif Bar but it's sweet at the same time hazel not to give it a little bit of variation in texture it's really good alright so I hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give me a thumbs up comment or subscribe to my channel and I'll see you next time [Music]", "auAi00g0LNU": "hi it's Rosie Batista with I cook naked calm and of course I'm not really naked but I'm here to show you how to make a low fat healthy cereal bar that using mostly naked ingredients meaning that it's food in its most natural form now this is really simple easy kids will love it I love it it's a great grab and go snack and it's literally one bowl to mix it up so what we're going to do is put all our ingredients into this cereal and the base of the cereal is it's a brown rice krispies cereal which means when I looked at the box and I looked at the ingredients the only ingredient is brown rice period so what I'm going to add to the cereal is 1/2 a cup of peanut butter again you want to watch the ingredients on your peanut butter because it's very deceiving out there some jars of peanut butter will say natural but they'll still add all kinds of extra oil you don't need anything added to the peanuts there's enough fat in the peanuts and enough everything in the peanuts just to be peanuts we have 1/2 a cup of peanut butter 1/2 a cup of date paste to make de paste I use a cup of dates and a half a cup of water soaked overnight and blended and that is my sweetener of choice in all of the sweet treats that I make because dates are a fruit and they respond much better in your body so I'm just going to mix the cereal into the wet ingredients into the sticky ingredients making sure that all of the cereal gets wet there you go easy now I'm going to also add 1/2 a cup of chopped nuts these happen to be almonds but you can use whatever you have or you can mix them 1/2 a cup of raisins and a half a cup of dark chocolate chips I prefer to use the darker chocolate chips the better these are 65% cacao just for an added little tiny bit of a treat and this right here is so much healthier than any of the sugar flavored cereals that you might buy already prepared a store and we're making into a bar so you can grab it and eat it on the run or as your kids are walking out the door or walking in the door so all we have to do with this now is put it in a nice pan and I happen to find this very oblong shaped pan which I like but you can fool around with square whatever you want to do but we're going to eventually be able to cut this into some really nice bars and we're just going to put this right into the pan and you really cannot get much sympathy cereal bar in the freezer for about a little over an hour so what I'm going to do is just separate away from the side this is another amazing kitchen tool because it's just a tiny little spatula that gets out little tiny pieces of bar so it's great so I'm going to just cut this into four separate rows and then I'll cut it into three it just seems to be a nice size for me and there you go your healthy cereal bar and what I like to do for a lot of fun i buy these little cellophane baggies and then I can put an individual sized serving this way doesn't get dangerous and I don't tempted to eat the whole pan into a little cellophane bag and take a little ribbon wrap it up and you've just created an awesome little healthy snack for your family or for yourself because you deserve to treat yourself well I'm Rosie Batista from I cook naked comm ciao for now and I'm going to try to cut the rest of these up and put them in bags before I Cho down on the whole pan they're that good", "RCxQcmFQlLo": "what about Nestle's cereal bars I love me some zero but are lost any good let's find out what's going on guys thanks of my elbow comes that is video it's time for our episode of the series what about that product and today we have something that I'm really excited about cereal bars next quick Chuck a pic and cinnamon ease which is basically like cinnamon toast crunch all three nestle products you know how big of a cereal friend actually a dict I am and I love trying new cereals but here in mogera we don't have that many varieties like for example you have there in America which I'm really jealous for and if anybody is up to send him some cereal from America or from anywhere that we don't have here just just right you know so we have had those cereal bars from a while here but a few Kevin tried any of them and this actually is going to be my pre-workout I'm not gonna get anything else I hope that this will give me enough energy for today squats so let's get started I'm think I'm gonna start with a choco cake so they are 25 gram bars and each bar cast 102 Cara sitting too close look at that guy's this looks amazing like for real it's like there's a chocolate glaze and underneath it has like a white chocolate or just like some kind coating so let's see how it breaks and look at this let's see how it is whoa this reminds me of something this tastes like KitKat snack bowls and tastes like that it tastes like paper or just cereal coat it in really really good Nestle chocolate and it does have a chocolate layer on top it's not just cereal now that's real good I'm going to try next week next same kind of bar the cereal a little bit of coating and underneath it has like white chocolate or watch I don't know so I'm expecting something similar they taste pretty similar though I think that chuck epic cat a Richard chocolate flavor and your head next week was a bit more sweet I think I prefer a chocolate cake the chocolate layer was much much better than this this tastes just like cereal and a bit more sweet I don't know I just feel like the chocolate was better and now to the cinema nice guys I'm not the biggest cinnamon fan but still I'm gonna give it a try okay this is a bit different it has like Rice Krispies and guess like little cinnamon squares a caramel coating and again white chocolate layer underneath so it smells really strong cinnamony I mean give me a second so if you like cinnamon like cinnamon toast crunch I can't say month-old I think no I have never had cinnamon toast crunch but if it like cinnamon II cereal because this is basically a cinnamon cereal you'll love this bar it tastes just like cereal with a really really nice caramel coating and the white chocolate definitely makes it taste better but for me this is just middle-of-the-road it's okay I mean it's a good bar I like it but it's not something that I would run to get yep I think the same goes for next week it was a really good bar but I don't think it's better than choc thick and choc a pic it's not in my favorite list but definitely is a very very good bar it's in the middle road of being good and does the this is the bomb you should try this bar definitely and that's quick it's a very good bar too but it's still middle role for me though I would go and get this bar again the cinnamon maybe maybe I would get if there's no next week or topic that's guys hope enjoy the video this was my weekly product review if you liked it make sure to give a like comment down below what you think which bar would you try and if you have tried one of them or all of them which is your favorite subscribe the channel and still makes one", "l0WmrRBlyys": "today Kevin and I are going to be comparing the Millville fruit and grain bars to the Kellogg's nutrigrain bars the these are both blueberries the milk bill is an oldie brand they were a dollar thirty nine four eight bars at all day these were two ninety-nine Crowe a Kroger so big difference in prices they may have been as low as 250 if you think Walmart had that Walmart did not have anything but huge monster boxes did that gal they had like oh yeah you can had to buy the big family box with the Walmart Whitmer at or you didn't buy it at all I know well cheaper if you got into Walmart but not going 30 now in shape that's pretty tricky well let's compare some things on there they're blueberry blueberry and they're individually wrapped you get ain't ours let's compare some numbers on one bar is a header 1331 hundred twenty who says it'll make Grammys are more aligned nutrigrain is lower the boom on 37 grams this one's 37 grams so the new terrain is 10 calories one thing Wow the total fat is three ones thirty saturated fat is one month point Bob this trans fat is a brown road cholesterol is zero zero sodium is 90 mine's 110 it's a little more sodium on I don't know a cat trying to get him Oh laughs hello potassium is 105 I don't have potassium on carbohydrates is 24 total yeah 24 sugars is 12 right - protein is one month - and what's your doctor your father - two months three okay so there's little differences here and there Rodney is less calories and less fat yeah yours really sounds the nutrigrain sounds like it adds a little bit more sodium and a little bit more you're sad how much sodium 1:00 p.m. your Manhattan is 90 so it's on the road it would close yeah but for me for somebody if I know as me about calories you know 10 calories you know if he's always smell like food I guess you have to think about the price though as well yeah yep for them to be that close eater yeah you got if you have a family with a lot kids who go through these quickly if they want break it then that price really makes a difference okay now the millville is going to be this one and the new program is is this stuff bill bill nature [Music] okay there's what the tops look like it's a bottom there's a thickness and there's the filling so it's pretty pretty similar each other I thought which one do I smell first milvey oh it's very very soft hmm cook me oh hush I mean Mike hey girl I swear a baby could almost eat this make it count less because there's an economist missions away yeah there's just please go there it's just there's no harm texture hard edges anything like that it's all very very soft there's a lot of blueberry filling yeah the flavor is good it's not super overpowering but it's a it's a nice blueberry flavor yeah not curious if this one's gonna be stronger the textures different flawed Rory mm-hmm the texture of the nature friend wasn't it soft I mean it's still soft nice proud I'm good blueberry but the milk bill was so very very soft that round you know if that cooked for just 30 seconds longer it's gonna make the difference I don't get the blueberry flavor from the Nutri regulator though go ahead I know it does say stronger doesn't hmm the millville actually has a stronger blueberry flavor they're very close they're similar bearing edges out just a little bit take one more bite of the neutralizer at 200 they're very very similar so if you wanted to save some money I think I'll just go with a new dog and be done what yeah don't worry about the ten galleries yeah I think they're close enough to where you could say they're the same pretty much yeah really I do think Noble has just a touch more blueberry to it but but it's not by much it's just a little bit but the maybe that's where the next we think ours is coming from it could be for me they're they're so close that yeah yeah if you don't hear about galleries and most people don't let specially don't know yeah especially tan a dollar thirty minute I mean that's dirt cheap for a bar and they have all kinds of things that's quite new to Rome they have like an apple and I didn't see cherry because I love the cherry the cherry is my favorite major brain so if I could have compared them I would have compared to cherry but they think I didn't see them they're only saw at least at our Aldi I only saw the Apple Cinnamon I think it was and strawberry so you know if they have cherry in the future I would definitely get it though because I think it would be good yeah these yo so yeah save yourself some money and go to all if you have know so I hope you enjoyed the video I will have a picture for you at the end of what's left and thanks for watching [Music]", "TaMWGo2LXiU": "what's up everybody and welcome back to\nanother episode of freak eating versus. the world today I'm going to take the advice\nof a guy I used to work with many years ago and I'm going to find out how long\nit's going to take me to eat 50 nutrigrain bars new game bar the kulluk\ncereal bars general barsen cereal and bar form and not quite good old bars and\nnot quite candy bars but they gotta hit the spot but 50 is a whole different\nmatter one or two is one thing and I got mixed\nberry raspberry here to make 49 to 50 because Costco only sells 48 at a time\nand there's blueberry Apple Cinnamon strawberry in here 16 16\nand 16 I know it's confusing and so I got a nice variety pack of flavor\nwow I never open 20 before inside oh crap I'm spilling my tea everywhere plus\nthe fine mess I get laid can't yeah you can't unring a bell I guess\nanyway there are 16 strawberries there are sixteen blueberry bars and then\nthere are sixteen Apple Cinnamon bars I don't know I have a favorite flavor I'm\njust going to go ahead and open it all up here actually I think I'm going to\nget a towel well screw this I think the tables already going to be a sopping\nmess and there are 48 months poor low l48 nutrigrain bars mmm rack\nmen saw all mine but in all seriousness what you see from me is about 6000\ncalories I'm going to be using as needed a little tea to get it down and it's\nlike if I need something else I'm probably got to go get it actually it's\nright here on the ground I have milk with me just a kiss\nok it's about 4 pounds of nutrigrain bars and so no further fanfare no BS and\nno stalling I'm getting a stopwatch here and with no fanfare no BS and no\nstalling time for 50 new tree rain bar challenge here we go starting off with\napple cinnamon one of these little boys come on move on strawberry probably a\ngood idea to try to go for variety here see those blueberries ah Eric if you\nhave any ideas but how long is going to take me go ahead and drop that down the\ncomment section and you think I got no shot he'll let me know no then maybe my\njob just going to lock up well I'll take down some of the apples\nbecause I think those are the ones that I'm going to hate the most well it's a\nlittle hard much it will be worse 50 of these are 50 pop-tarts sort of\ncontinuing the discoveries think if I switch flavors I can kind of give myself\na variety so I don't get bored I don't you just worked out over here we have that really good cheap candy\ntaste of strawberry I can tell you now I have twenty four bars remaining so I'm\njust over the halfway point I'm just eating 26 Wow well the old saying if you\nfeel like you're going through hell keep going stop it so basically of just of just about\neating 3,000 calories with the nutrigrain bars I have more blueberry left with anything\nso good keep attacking a bluebird right now that's hard this one's hard almost\ncrunchy trying to distract myself I'm locked in\nthe video over here just look it up raspberry it is different but that's so\nscale I just got shut off my brain again done a diesel switch little cabbage is brutal is mixed berry the final push three\nstrawberry three blueberry I can do this the final blueberry I never want to see\na little bit pop-tart again or move all of our needs are embarked last bar\nstrawberry dig a rose their taste so sweet is disgusting and their news I'm done I am done I have\ndone it Wow there Kim over there I didn't know that was going to happen I\nknow I said it all the time but I really meant it on this one the fruit feeling\njust got really repetitive really boring and if you thought I have favorite\nflavor you're dead wrong because at the end I handed him all I hated him off but\nit was a it was actually pretty good challenge I mean it was difficult so I\ngot to give a shout out to my coworker I managed for many years ago Eric thank\nyou for suggesting this idea and if so you may have been hanging around the\nchannel a long time he was the same guy who suggested I drained an entire case\nof 5-hour energy shops mmm he may not be\nthe nicest matter Allen but he's come up with some crazy challenge concepts um my\ntime just over 34 minutes to finish an entire 50 pack of course it's made more\ndifficult for the fact that you have to open every individual bar as you're\ngoing through it obviously if you have to all open to begin with this should be\na fairly not easy but either your challenge um I hope all of you watching\nat home enjoy the video and if you did please give it a thumbs up totally\nappreciate it drop down some comments you have ideas or other challenges that\nI should do things that you can find in store and maybe at fast-food joints\nI'm always open always always thinking brainstorming about what I can do next\nso that's this doesn't gallery tool entry books and I will see all of you in\nthe next video so stay in school don't do drugs me like a freak oh man that\nmilk tastes so good so good you", "2V8vnNTVIQs": "[Music] [Applause] week by week day after day and every week means a new [ __ ] episode in a new place we're gonna go ahead and hit up with the munchies I got my rig this time with me cuz I wanted to get the it's breakfast time it's kind of about to be non-stop but you know you can never go wrong with breakfast all day especially when it's someone s bomb so this spot right here is a fairly new spot in the heart of downtown LA like you know like usual thing about downtown man like just leave downtown LA with the with its own [ __ ] vibe I feel like people are trying like these people that are building [ __ ] and everything or trying really hard to give it that New York vibe and I'm sorry that New York vibe means a lot more [ __ ] in the [ __ ] City and I do not like that [ __ ] but this this this [ __ ] place right here is located and I really down town LA well you see a lot of the working people shit's [ __ ] constantly move in and it's it's the equivalent let me see it's like it's like if a diving bar [ __ ] all the boxes of cereals and they opened up early as [ __ ] and they and they combined and they created this place and this place that I'm talking about is this brand new place it's a cereal bar that's right a [ __ ] cereal barn like like [ __ ] cornflakes you know cornflakes [ __ ] a that [ __ ] it's it's like that on steroids this place is called gizmos and it's a little small spot that has is opened up it has not that it does not have that money that much time being open but I became a fan the first time I tried it because first of all I think a stoners listen I'm just still that stoner that Leverett like Big Daddy you know saying like when he was eating the cereal watching TV and cartoons I'm that kind of stoner I gotta take a quick lord dad man I got a brother's appetite anyway so this spot it's called gizmos it's literally looks like a little pop-up shop it's not the kind of place you go in and sit down so be prepared to take this time to go or it's perfect it's it's really great if you're gonna postman a or something like that and I know what you're thinking pal I don't want to post me some cereal I'll just go to the [ __ ] story by yeah [ __ ] cool do it this place is special because not only not only does it give you like that [ __ ] like that to have it your way aspect where like you can choose what you want they have certain plates so for example like there's certain things that you like that that you like on your taste buds let's say you like cocoa puffs with [ __ ] chocolate fruity pebbles and the choc materials you can get all those three add some pop-tarts on top and it's not just with regular milk you got hemp milk coconut milk you got almond milk you got almond milk you got all these different kinds of milk that go along with your with your different kinds of cereal combination that's literally like Yogurtland and all the cereals [ __ ] and then this is what the outcome came about by the way a couple tips before you come to this place parking sucks parking sucks dick you're gonna have to pay for it I'm sorry don't get don't get mad if you do you happen to pay for it try to go for a parking lot like this where you can chill and hotbox for a good long time you know tomorrow you how abouts a good long time nobody's gonna tell you [ __ ] you go over to like the seventh floor tomorrow Bart Diller rate by a nerve glass yeah man I've been I want to get dab the [ __ ] up if you are in the calli area and you are gonna be coming you know anytime soon in the land next two weeks you might want to hit up the Rio festival because not only in San Bernardino there's not only its flavors biiis own gonna be there with the propane booth but I might just be hearing the stage I might just do a high hungry they're like I got two jobs three jobs to do there this way carb County bull [ __ ] never ends she's still smoke coming out people that keep on like [ __ ] commenting that I'm not this and I'm not that comparing me to other people man [ __ ] sucked my medicated [Music] alright y'all so we're back here your gizmos and that [ __ ] ordered I got some custom so they have like a bunch of different cereal combinations um higher yeah so they have pre-made [ __ ] you know bowls like very much like the soda game I like to hire exotics in it they have the exotic cereals here as well so I ended up going with the captain bulb along with the split half-and-half pop-tarts it's quick and the little marshmallows on top I know you guys are probably thinking like oh my god some [ __ ] in and I OD on [ __ ] diabetes of [ __ ] listen man that's why you got to coordinate the [ __ ] sweat that [ __ ] out later I don't really know how you can really kind of get this all into one actual smoke you don't have to get like regular [ __ ] milk I got you know stoner milk I got him milk it doesn't get you high for all you [ __ ] that are high out there but oh yeah it's [ __ ] made out of hemp I swear this is not the kind of place you can something up in here 100 deep I have a big long table like that but this is the kind of place that's worth waiting out outside the line for because this is a real stoner [ __ ] like that's like I said it before stoners only be playing [ __ ] inside their food this is the equivalent to fries aside your burgers equivalent to chips inside your sandwich you got to put extra stuff on top of your cereal and I know a lot of you [ __ ] probably did it at home prior to this but just know there's a place out here now in downtown LA I'll go ahead and just think of different combinations and stuff that you haven't even thought about putting in your cereal in it so you don't have to think about it at home anymore all you gotta do is just pull up here pay for a little parking cuz you know you don't want to park along the walk you dance sometimes and you come here really stoned by the way parking that parking lot where you guys saw me doing where I was dabbing in the backseat that's perfect nobody is the technique bro you gotta stick you gotta stick the pop-tart in there can't have it any other way bro don't expect just what kind of cereal terms this is the combination of everything you know how I gave it a pop right in there yeah the pop-tart was warmed up and I stole a toaster out of it so I don't really know how much more you could tweak up sorry oh man I think this is this is as good as it's gonna get her I mean [ __ ] like this is like having a big cookie in your [ __ ] cereal or to it but that being said finish [ __ ] up the city over here but then you guys should come check out gizmos it definitely has that feel it's like kind of like Yogurtland [ __ ] a bunch of cereals and created this store and it's kind of cool because it has like it hasn't way nicer feel you don't gotta like actually touching me in the ingredients all you do is watch it be made with all the exotic stuff that you didn't even think was out there like the exotic flavor is with the actual cereal hi I'm hungry where is Moe [Music]", "6uloKnrZxEs": "the weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we are looking at today another product from MILF and cookies those big freaking lips milk and cookies edibles we are looking at there 200 milligram peanut butter cookie if you've watched weeks before you know I've reviewed several milk and cookies edibles and found them mostly to be pretty disappointing across the board I do like their [ __ ] brownie it seems to be more potent than most most seem to be lower more lower potent than advertised and they're not the cheapest this 200 milligram peanut butter cookie I believe cost me $11 which is on the higher end for a 200 milligram edible that's just like a cookie so especially at my very affordable dispensary all right without further ado let's open it up and if this is your first time joining wheats what we do is I'm gonna eat some of this cookie in front of you I'm not gonna bore you by eating the whole thing Bowie I love this cookie let you know how it tastes Leggero it smells whether it's garbage or not and then the most important part is I take a break and I come back in two hours to let you guys know how it's feeling because that's the most important part of in your review all right so without further ado here's the cookie no weed smell very basic looking peanut butter cookie I'm a fan of peanut butter cookies looks nice smells nice let's see how it tastes tastes nice hmm that's a pretty good peanut butter um crumbly a little bit on the UM a less chewy a little bit firmer but good very good I really dig it but as we all know as I said way too many times by now it's not about how it tastes it's about how it makes you feel so in about two hours guys I'm going to come back to you and let you know how we're feeling and if this is another bust missus might be it for MILF and cookies for me um it's been nothing but disappointment so far but I am hoping that the paper cookie sort of turns it around with that guys thank you for watching weeks and we'll see you in two hours thanks it's been two hours here since I had the milk and cookies 200 milligram peanut butter cookie and you know I feel a little bit I it definitely has an effect on me um I think it's actually more potent than their cereal bars which I've had of the fruity licious and god I hate saying it cocoa Luth cereal bar so that's good um but still for $11 you know it's it's a little bit expensive for what it is and I'm not as high as I am as I would be with you know some other edibles that are 200 milligrams or even less um so you've got that to take into account it does taste great though the cookie was very good I really really enjoyed the cookie um in terms of a peanut butter cookie I would eat it just as a cookie so that's this pretty high praise I would put MILF and cookies sort of right in the middle of the road of edibles in terms of taste and quality if you see it at your dispensary and Oakland cookies are cheap there stick with the brownies and peanut butter cookie avoid the cereal bars and I think you'll do okay with that guys that's gonna do it here for weeks and we will check you out on the next review thanks for watching oh wait this was to throw this at the camera that's how we do it hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to

Dave and I have been known to go through food pretty fast but today we're gonna find out how fast these go through us to bald guys eat stuff and talk about it alright today Dave and I will get our fiber in a granola bar taste test yep today we decided to go with the chocolate chip variety cuz I was going through County Market these have the most brands associated with them when it comes to granola bars now what I've found with these is some of these have chocolate chips although we are coated in chocolate but all of them are oats and chocolate in some format now I am a granola bar novice I I don't eat them I haven't had one in probably five years so I'm gonna be legally new and completely blind in this but you actually eat him a lot I eat them a lot they're easy to grab and go my kids love granola bars of course for their lunches after school and they also love just box granola okay so so quick and easy and it's healthy at the same time saying it fills you hope from liver will be really proud of us for doing this taste test and I like these because the chocolate chip adds just a little bit of decadence I guess yeah a little bit of flavor to it so we're gonna go blind taste this as we always do bring them on scale of one to ten to figure out what's the ones the best tasting it might swing your purchase at County Market yeah what are you looking for in a granola taste test boy I like different textures you have the soft oats mm-hmm sweet chewy granola Jim then of course you have the chocolate chips do you like it chewy like a brittle something I get chewy okay me too I think I'm gonna like a chewy one and something that's sweet oh man I don't really breaks apart mmm this is almost like a toasted I get a lot of brown sugar mm-hmm not much chocolate but it might be melted in there yeah it's pretty a few little charcoal bites in there this reminds me of you dump it out of the box and form it into a bar and business raw NOLA mm-hmm I like it though I will say it's sweet but it's not overly sweet yeah it's a it doesn't make it bitter so I'm worried about his granola mate being a bitter having a funky aftertaste and this doesn't have that that is really yeah what that tastes like yeah that's the old-school way I remember way back in the day when I used to have to walk in the snow uphill both Whitney's some seventh seventh - this is a thinner yeah her and lighter you can see all the different pieces in there definitely much different taste mm-hmm oh honey I'm getting them lots of honey very sweet well I want to chew through though it's very gummy mm-hmm that's a good flavor it's almost like a dessert bar yeah mister NOLA this is pretty anemic on the chocolate man Victor JA work really hard I almost prefer that first one over this I'm gonna be tired by Tuesday hmm exercise my jaw I don't wanna be in pain when I mean another that one yeah too much work we're gonna need to floss - yeah number three this one's darker but it still appears the gummy texture mm-hmm some chocolate chips oh it's softer though mmm like that much easier that's on the jawbone homey tasting mm-hmm no chocolate the first time I'm gonna mention it chocolate this one's richer no no no one's will get pad the last one you could just get like a honey this ring you can taste the chocolate definitely so that's the flavor that stands out to me but I'm still getting the oat the granola a faint hint of peanut butter I don't think it was on the box this kind of tastes like peanut butter I think it's just the way it's mixed that one tastes like a dessert to me I wouldn't chili that's like a granola bar Oh chewy but it's not gonna kill you I'm gonna do a dessert there one and a half I'm holding back because I think one of these is gonna be good for us the rest of these all look really good and this one is different than the others because that's chocolate on the bottom Wow so it's overly chocolate and drizzled reminds me of a what you might call it mm-hmm and the chocolate flavor stands out I mean mm-hmm this has a lot of that rice in it like a whatchamacallit mm-hmm again I'm getting a little bit of peanut butter yeah mmm there is a slight aftertaste ism and haven't gone the other ones I was just gonna say it's a sharp have an aftertaste I know if it's in the chocolate like an artificial sweetener but it's it's it might be it's pointed or in the the rice cereal that they use yeah I'm dumping those six I don't like that number five this one's another drizzle for shizzle drizzle a lot of different textures in there maybe some nuts and they have mashed together hmm this one is almost marshmallow yeah it's rich mm-hmm for a granola bar this would be tough to have more than one hmm even though that chocolates just drizzled on top that's really prevalent mmm again there's that rice cereal in there they probably use it as a filler and Ollie gets but how do you like to text your different so you might into it a soft inviting look so much more chewy mm-hm but then you got a little crunch in there too at the end you're still chewing the oats which I like hmm that was different um it's just sweet enough mmm that's complex - there's lots of different players in there rather than just beyond yeah appeal I like that one yeah a half yeah yeah number six this is when we this is a puck yeah it's a goob I think you people probably know what these are but hey whoa it's a different initial flavor than the other ones that is as dense as I am I will say it hmm ma'am my place with that flavor is it's almost like a reason yeah there's uh its sweetness and I think it comes from a fruit like you said I think it's a raisin look a great note or a reason or something no we'll say well this is good and it's different I don't get a whole lot of granola announcer there's much different texture more of a fill you up mm-hmm type of bar yeah I'm sure it's got a lot of protein you know yeah all right last one number seven this one has more chocolate chips in it than I think anyone that we've had yeah this is really colorful to all the different pieces in it this is what I think of when you think we don't call the writer chewy not over-the-top mm-hmm let's hook up some crunch to it for sure I will say it could be a little sweeter yeah um it's a little dry hmm okay one not bad it's staying that seven a little blowing up a little bit all right so who knew that granola bars could taste so different lots of chewing yeah but after seven brands we found out the neat winner surprise surprise fiber one fiber one so the one that you know of being a healthy option yeah was number one to us we liked the chocolate flavor and the overall texture to it was really good the drizzle on top wasn't perfect it was sweet but you still get the different granola pieces the oats chocolate chips and I was telling Jones before the show that these are banned in our house just for the simple reason that it has a lot of fiber yeah it's in the name number two was delicious but Sunbelt someone was just barely below that again what we really like that with the overall texture this is when they kind of like melted in your mouth yeah that I compared to a dessert and this reason why I like this one too that's a that's a pretty popular brand and I guess all of these are and there's a lot of different varieties to we've got the chocolate chip today but there's oats and honey peanut butter they're always coming out with new stuff too so busier local county market let us know which one's your favorite - bald guys eat stuff and talk about it", "jwamWD5k_Ac": "all right what's up everybody protein bar review guy here i just finished a leg workout and it's time for another protein bar review today is robert irvin fit crunch this flavor is caramel peanut all right the criteria same as always ingredients protein content macros calorie count taste texture and that will give us our overall score one through ten this one's gonna be pretty quick we reviewed robert irvin's fit crunch chocolate peanut butter the other day i'm a big fan of anything chocolate peanut butter this one has caramel too and it looks like it has peanuts and chocolate so i'm excited um let's look uh ingredients pretty much the same as the other one uh not a fan of the soy protein isolate in this one as well as the other stuff geez there's a lot of this is a long list look at that i think this is because this one has caramel in it the other one didn't so this this ingredient list is about twice as long as the chocolate peanut butter one so same thing 190 calories this is i guess the half size bar they make another one that's almost 400 calories that's not what i'm looking for but this 190 calories 16 grams of protein 14 grams of carbs 8 grams of total fat so again a third of these calories are from fat not really the best thing so ingredients i'm going to give this a 4 protein content i'm going to give it a 4 there as well for not even reaching 20 grams in this 190 calorie serving macros i'm going to give it a four there as well calorie count calorie count we'll give it a seven because that's i think that's about right where they should be you know i don't you know i'm not looking for a a protein bar to be a meal of you know four or five hundred calories i'm looking for it just to be a you know a quick spike after a workout and then uh you know tied me over until i get home get some real food real nutrition you know chicken complex carbs or whatever healthy protein you want complex carbs vegetables whatever um so yeah macros um calorie count we're gonna give it a seven let's see how it tastes it's really good it's basically like a candy bar i mean this is like eating a milky way you know it's got caramel tastes great um if you remember i scored the robert irvin fit crunch chocolate peanut butter i gave that a nine for taste and texture i'm going to give this one a 9.1 just a little more because it does have a caramel in there as well as the chocolate as well as the chocolate and peanut butter combo i guess this one gives you little chunks of peanuts in there instead of peanut butter but you still have you know the creaminess of the chocolate the cookie crunch you have the chunks of peanuts in there and then you have the you have the gooey caramel in there so that's pretty good so 9.1 on taste and texture and uh overall score i'm gonna give this a 5.1 i gave the chocolate peanut butter a five i'm going to give this one just a little edge more 5.1 simply just because it has chocolate peanut butter and caramel um so that's the review for today hopefully this helps you out everybody at the grocery store so you don't you know waste your money on buying a dud um you know choose wisely

delicious right now cuz we're gonna go out I have a four loko which I don't want to drink but um maybe I'll vlog at the party or something where is it don't worry though mm-hmm it's delicious this is cool we have this proof that Sylvia's alive [Music] [Applause] oh my [ __ ] so today is August 24th it's the next day we are getting ready to already know I have wearable more edibles and me and stills are gonna eat a little bit more because we're gonna go out and we figured out well we were like let me let me eat retrack let me let me track their steps and like think about how much we made and we realized the Fruity Pebbles had more marshmallow icing thingy on it so this one was hella stronger but yeah if you do this just be cautious of how much you're eating and yeah try to be careful but this one is bomb and so is this one the Oreo one I brought both just in case the only thing is they do get too sweet so like it's really hard to like keep docile me now cuz we cut them up really big so you gotta eat a lot and it just blows it it was kind of a good look for like once in a while so we put the buns this way they're her long kumtak we turn him that way that we estimated that each part was like baby milligram we think it was like a hundred milligrams each so yeah but they're so good and as soon as you take them like 20-30 minutes later and hits and then you feel high and yeah usually takes two hours for animals to hit so we're like an hour two hours to hit but this is really quick ah well you can see they're hella coated in the marshmallow icing I guess it's a month bomb to an edible during my first article mukbang and we made them that's gonna be this video yeah okay I'm eating a little bit of this that's my last piece because I'm gonna be too hard on it but we're checking into ours so this is probably gonna eat here soon yeah oh yeah I'm gonna go get water [Music] you", "6RLzBnAk8nA": "today kevin and i are going to be trying some new cereal bars for you i have the frosted flakes and i have the froot loops guess which one we bought at walmart guess what maybe the value pack because that's all they sell is big boxes at walmart it was 3 47. you know what you might be getting a better deal it was uh i wish we knew do you have your phone with you kevin's to figure it out kevin's my mathematician okay so it was 347 for 18 bars 347 for 18. that's 19 piece okay these were 249 for six oh yeah that's 40 cents 41. so double wow so walmart's got it going on i i you know i make fun of them for having the big boxes but then when you're saving that much money because that was that 249 was it kroger yeah kroger is typically uh i love kroger but they are typically more expensive on those things yes so we're going to try that what we think is going to be the planer one of the two um i'm gonna it wants you to open it this way but to have it stored up in the cabinet it's better to open it from the end for our cabinets at least yeah um it just works out better so these feel like these feel like um about the size of one of those quaker is that what they're called i'm thinking about all the other cereal bars they have they're about the same size yeah they make cheerios bars and uh they make the lucky charms uh three pebbles oh and those um those count chocula bars that are delicious that come out at halloween and those are really really good okay so frosted flakes cereal bars it's only 100 calories no wonder it feels the same what are you looking for oh okay so 100 calories here we go people i think you're going to like that yeah it's good it's good sweet tastes like frosters wipes it has a a hint of a vanilla flavor to me that's probably the water the milk on the bottom yeah it tastes it has a vanilla uh hint to it but let me tell you for me what seals the deal is i love the texture yeah that texture is incredible it's crunchy but also kind of chewy yeah almost almost like a rice krispie treat where it's kind of marshmallow that's what i was i would compare it to i would compare that to a rice krispies except it's not marshmallow it's probably it's probably some kind of honey or something because i get a hint of that honey flavor um there's not a lot of ingredients it is corn syrup sugar vegetable oil fructose non-fat milk it really corn soap is probably what's holding it together probably but these these are very very very very good i mean not expecting to be super exciting because they are frosted flakes but if you like frosted yeah if you already like it sweet frosted flake and that's what you're getting yeah frosted flakes uh are it's terrific so it's great did you get that but i don't expect i mean they're not fruit flavor or you know anything like that they're frosted place they're great okay here is the froot loops cereal bars six of these and did he did the toucan say anything was there anything that he a catchphrase that he had sure there is i haven't seen one of these fruit loops commercials in so long commercials no i remember him flying around it seemed like through a jungle or something with lots of trees and it seemed like he may have had a catchphrase i just don't remember uh these are 90 calories more they're so they look they look like they're a little looser put together you know because the the frost flake was pretty dense since these are loops i think they're they're looser put together not as densely packed they'd have to ground those up these do have four ounces um the uh frosted flakes are 0.8 the fruit loops are point uh seven yeah so it has an ounce more but kevin's right it did it's like they didn't pack them as there's more air in between each of those fruit loops that's why they work whereas the frost flakes are very dense but if you like fruit loops if you like that it they have always had a lemony flavor to me um citrusy kind of yeah so if you like that lemon flavor then you're gonna like it in bar form and it's easier to eat you know you could buy a box of these and eat it in your car on the way to work whereas you can't do that with a bowl of cereal or a sweet after dinner if you eat dinner and you want something sweet after you've eaten which sometimes i do um that would be a good 90 calorie sweet but this one for 100 uh yeah this one is uh i think the frosted flakes is going to appeal to more people i like the frosted black one better i do too that's the one i would choose out of the two i think that's going to appeal to more people just because it's a general flavor that's not really really specific to certain people this does taste like has that lemon flavor and some people aren't going to like that lemon flavor you know also the texture difference between the two because the the frosted flakes is a more dense chew in it yes whereas the froth the fruit loops is more loose and it's a softer cereal yes so it's not like they're stale feeling but they're it's a softer feel like you would feel like you got more yeah in the the frosted flakes and i mean you are you're you know you're getting some more calories at least um but i agree for me the frosted flakes wins everything texture flavor everything yeah nothing wrong with fruit lip once just if we had to pick one we would right exactly and if you can get them at walmart that is your best bet we've proven that at least yeah you paid twice as much at least at kroger yeah at least at cro yeah they had these they also had these but we had already bought this box and frankly i'm glad we did because we got we got a good value um and this is definitely something we'll hang on to yes we will keep these because 100 calorie snack i think that's awesome uh so i hope you enjoyed the video i'll have a picture for you at the end and thanks for watching [Music] bye", "YMw9iyAWWmE": "hey team what is up happy sunday today i am taking the time to try all these different protein bars that i wasn't able to eat during prep so i'm really excited we have about seven different protein bars here that i've collected throughout the past couple of weeks and i have my beautiful mama here today to help me try them out so the criteria that i was looking for when looking through these bars was dairy free gluten free low sugar and if it was low carb that was just a bonus for me um i know there's a bunch of different bars out there so if you're watching this video and you want to send me a few suggestions or send me a bar to try please definitely do that because i would love to try them so with that being said let's go ahead and get started um i may have said this already before but we have seven different bars here um and we'll just kind of go through it and just taste test each one yeah and i think what we're looking for was um first like what what criteria it's gotta look appealing it's got to taste good um it also has to have good nutrient value and then the texture i think for a lot of people texture matters a lot so let's with with that a scoring on a count of 10 yeah out of each for each category all right and we have a bunch of different flavors and they all smell pretty good this one we'll start with first so this is primal kitchen dark chocolate almond um so it is paleo we got this one at whole foods so already looking at the texture it is a little bit hard to break like you can kind of see the knife it's still trying to break if it can there we go all right reminds me of a traditional like power bar i think this is really hard it's tasty though you think so i mean i've been eating so bland right so wow has um a few nuts in it so if you're um allergic to nuts you don't want to watch out for that but i just think it's it's a little too hard for me to look hard yeah and then to enjoy the flavor that flavor explosion is not it's not there it's definitely stuck into my cheese it does contain eggs so if you are so you can completely beat them yeah you can't eat this but paleo yes wow it's really sticking to my teeth okay so score for appearance hold it up what would you say what would you give it appearance one through ten ten being the highest probably set go score 10 out of 20. wow all right how about taste i kind of like the blandness it is dark chocolate almonds so just kind of have that bitter that's true okay ready mm-hmm three two one score oh we both said seven okay okay okay and then texture texture oh texture i'm gonna give it two [Laughter] it is really and we're not trying to like um like diss these protein bars we just want to be completely honest with you guys because i know it's hard to try it but it's too sticky it is very sticky on your teeth you are going to need some water to bring it down all right let's move on so the next one we have is a bulletproof bar again i think we got this one from whole foods it is lemon flavor um opening this up oh my gosh it smelled so yummy it was already kind of cracking a little bit so you can kind of see it there um we anticipate it to be dry i don't know it's already kind of crumbling a little bit here's a little piece that's a big piece it smells really good though mm-hmm it's like it smells really good lemonade if you are a starbucks fan like we don't really i don't drink coffee per day but my dad loves coffee and he likes the lemon poppy seed bell and poppy seed bar cheers okay better this tastes like a lemon shortbread cookie oh my god this is great wow a little dry and crumbly for me but yeah it does taste really good oh my god so if you are looking i just created your best breakfast did you show them what it is um this is actually really good bulletproof lemon flavored right lemon collagen protein bar huh wow that's two grams of sugar it's good so that was another thing so i've tried keto in the past i know people have a lot of different um ideas on it of what they like about keto have you done keto before no um really i i it's keto when i say keto it's really just low carb high protein high fat so when a bar does say keto i'm like okay that's just a bonus it's low carb but that means it has a lot of fiber in it this one okay so texture texture i'll give it a six i'll give it i really like the texture i'm gonna give it an eight okay all right taste ten oh okay let me let me relax i'll give it a eight as well i'll give it an eight i really like this one all right and the nutrient value pretty good yeah so 11 grams yep this is our first uh try for food so we're kind of just we're just winging it so if you guys have suggestions on how we're supposed to do it we're trying to be consistent i know finally consistent all right next let's go to the no cow bar so you guys have may have heard this one before these are actually one of my favorite ones when i started doing dairy free i did do no cal because it was one of the cheapest and the easiest to find at a local grocery store correct um i like this one because even though it is plant-based sometimes when you do plant-based protein bars there's not as much protein in it but this one is great it's 21 grams um one gram of sugar really high in fiber and again it still kind of has that sticky consistency but it is easier to break than the first one we had so this is chocolate chip cookie dough cheers oh this smells good better consistency not too chalky mm-hmm that's another thing with some vegan bars is it comes a little well i think protein bars in general it does get kind of choppy yeah so i'm trying to like stick all this protein together with with no real sugar honey or limited honey so that's another thing is that it's good that one is good this is made out of pea protein and almonds and stevia monk fruit so i like this one i've always been a no cow supporter it's so good they have so many different flavors all right so taste eight eight i will give it a seven seven and then the texture oh i'll give it an 8. i'll give it a 8 as well i feel like i'm kind of inflating my my um oh we're not going to inflate i have some things that we're looking at coming up yeah these are not there these are really i again i do like no cow bar and i'm really loving this bulletproof one and we'll rate them at the end too all right let's move on so now we have a dang bar again i think i got this one from whole foods as well it's about 210 calories again low sugar 3 grams 9 grams of protein so this would be more of a i think an energy bar for me because most of the time i knew need a lot of protein um this one looks i kind of like how the hardiness of how it looks and it just kind of breaks right in half so this is almond cookie flavor it smells really good it smells good but it doesn't smell like a smells kind of like christmas yeah i'm thinking like chinese almond cookie not quite so much oh this is good i think it's not super super sweet no but i do like it it wouldn't be a protein bar like i said it would be um oh i taste the almonds now yep an energy bar bits and pieces of almonds those do have some good flavor the rest of the bar is a nice texture not this dry yeah this is plant-based as well okay and then all of yours were plant-based some of these the this paleo one has eggs in it oh got it so some of them for for the most part all of these actually all of these are dairy free all of these are gluten-free there's coke okay so in this one there's almonds i tasted the almonds i felt the coconut coconut has a little crunchy itty-bitty like um grit to it for me and there's sunflowers this is super light i honestly like if you're looking for just kind of like a little biscuit to go with your tea type thing oh yeah so we found some breakfast things right lemon and almonds all right i like this one yeah okay ready mm-hmm that uh scored out a 10 for taste ready five i just think it was there and then take so low on sugar texture i like the texture yeah that's pretty good i'll give it a seven yeah seven for me too and then what else we what else are we about i don't know but the appearance though so it looks i like it kind of you know if you like uh multi-grain bread you're gonna like this honestly if you wanted to do like if you kind of wanted something super sweet you could like put some honey on this or like maybe some peanut butter almond butter almond butter yeah that'd be really good okay all right moving on number four number five now we have a no sugar keto bar chocolate peanut butter again i think we just picked this up from whole foods i think i just really wanted to try that flavor um what is it what flavor it's peanut chocolate peanut butter and this is completely plant-based gluten-free dairy-free so it was already kind of broken i took these already from but i kind of like the inside looks like a little bit of a reese's it does to me on the outside looks like oh it's not an old um dr atkins bar which is all keto it does kind of look like a good accent bar the outside chocolate doesn't smell like chocolate it smells like that that fake and road chocolate either i haven't had sugar oh i haven't but this is so good the texture is like a reese's peanut butter it is the inside the inside part the outside part it's not that it doesn't have that creamy milk chocolate that you can get on reese's or like a hershey's bar or something i think i'm just sugar deprived because this is just so good it's good it's not super super sweet but it's got a nice peanut buttery flavor yeah if you're a reese's fan and you can eat peanut butter smells pretty good so taste i'm gonna give it eight yeah i'll give it uh taste wise i'll give it a i'll give it an 8. oh what is the 40 grams and then so it's only 9 grams of protein and it's 160 calories so again i think i would consider this another energy bar okay i'm gonna i'm gonna change my score i think for taste i'm gonna give it a six it's the texture i really like you guys the texture yeah so the texture i'm gonna give it an eight okay okay oh taste i still think it's eight i think it's so good texture um ate as well and then appearance i like that it looks like a reese's bar like out of all these so far like this looks like ooh ice cream or not ice cream oh chocolate bar right all right let's move on so this one i ordered online this is called an mct bar which is mct oil and it is 190 calories caramel sea salt flavor so i got like a box of different flavors um and again this one's keto 7 grams of fiber 10 grams of protein and same thing very very oh easy to break oh it smells really good okay you ready yeah so this is caramel sea salt ooh it smells good the salt that's it takes a second to the for the for the race to come in the salt comes through the caramel it's yeah it's there i think i'm tasting the whatever the almond base i'm not huge on like yeah it's almond butter based um is that what it is yep there's almonds and almond butter and and something called cocoa but yeah butter i thought it was a cookie ooh you know now i'm feeling the salty i thought the salty first oh really now i'm feeling it i'm good i kind of like that again not too chalky yeah it's put together pretty well so the texture is pretty good yeah the flavor doesn't jump out right away but it comes a little bit later i think like yeah i'm trying to figure out what the flavor is well you just had a couple bars that have some peanuts i'm gonna give the taste on this a six maybe seven yeah i would i think um i'm not used to salty things for protein bars i'll be honest i normally go for the sweeter ones so this has kind of found me off a little bit so maybe we should try um a protein bar or challenge that has like the the salty roasted turkey and beans well believe it or not all right so last one wait did we you scored it did you score it on appearance taste and texture okay taste i think like i said i'll give it a seven texture um i'll give it a seven as well okay so for a taste i would give it um probably a six it's a little slow yeah and then um for texture definitely an eight it's got it it's it's put together well it's not crumbling and it's not too hard to chew all right last one i ordered these misfits one from the uk i am so excited to try this this was actually one of my post um treat uh sugar kind of high after my wish list yeah he was on her dream list about that all the time i was just so excited to have a protein bar y'all like if you're still watching the video right now 14 minutes in i have not had a protein bar since september of 2020. so it's march 17th 18th yeah 21st yeah it's march 21st now 2021 and so i'm just on cloud nine um anyway again this is dairy free completely plant-based 15 grams of protein you can order them online three grams of sugar and y'all just check it out i think the appearance is nice the appearance is very nice it literally looks like a um candy bar this is a the white chocolate salted peanut cheers mmm this is good amazing right the flavor comes out nicely it doesn't like overwhelm you but it's not like that slow burn where i was worrying about some of the other flavors i will say yesterday i had the chocolate brownie the chalk brownie is better than this it's better than the one yeah this one um i like it because it's got some soft parts like the the um outer white chocolate is good but there's some crunchy bits in the middle so it's got nice variety wow versatility i don't know if that's a word definitely very peanutty i think i like the like again chocolate brownie yesterday was really good yes it was white chocolate salted peanut mm-hmm true to its name all right so out of the seven bars let's just kind of rate it okay this one y'all i was already appearance appearance 10. okay i'll give it a nine space eight yeah eight i do like the peanut texture it kind of feels like it's a snickers bar a little bit mm-hmm texture i don't really eat that but actually i'm gonna give it a nine i thought it was really good um i'll give it a seven as well all right so i know we're a little bit whirlwind here in our video but rating all of these highest to lowest um okay so let's just go through them one more time we have the primal kitchen the bulletproof one which is lemon flavored what do we do next we did the dang bar then we did the no cow bar which was chocolate chip cookie dough the no sugar uh reese's one we called it the mct and then the misfits so honestly i really enjoyed the bulletproof lemon cookie i just i'm a big lemon flavor and it tasted like a shortbread cookie for me um and like looking at these i'll probably end up finishing up the lemon the almond bar was pretty good too yup what did you think about the misfits misfits this fits is so good that was number one so if i don't know yeah i'm not gonna rank them but i'll get i'll you know kind of what you're saying what would you finish i would go out and buy again i would buy the misfits i would buy the no cow oh okay yeah i thought that was really good um yeah do you top three of one top three um this surprises me this surprised me quite a bit the keto because um i'm a little worried about anything that's made with a whole bunch of fake sugars or whatever but the texture was really good so i was surprised by this one um i i was really interested in this one this almond cookie one just because of the flavor it just it um if it's not a protein bar though i probably wouldn't buy it i think it's too expensive to buy stuff just for snacking i think you're right i agree with that um that's actually a really good point because we're a big protein uh fanatic in our house we as much protein as we can get for as little calories so i think you're right on that standpoint so if we were to go on a protein stand you know which one we would buy i would definitely buy the no cow again and again they have so many different flavors misfits for sure and then i'm really just loving again oh this has 20 grams of protein is it really get out no it's not it's 9 grams of protein really what does a 20 grams say 20 grams of like fake stuff about 20 of calories from protein sorry about that that one was good um but like for your big protein bars you know honestly too this dark chocolate one even though it wasn't great sticky it is very sticky it does have 15 grams of protein in it okay i would consider a protein bar to be at least 15 grams or more you remember the old power bars they were the first energy bars that's what this texture reminds me of it's really really a firm and made of rice let me take a look probably made of rice syrup i think the other ones the like the original power bars because we used to eat those a little bit mm-hmm you have to peel the you'd have to peel the wrapper off the bottom was more of that consistency got it you know but this one was just very hard on your teeth um but if you like that granola bovine collagen peptides isn't that a isn't bovine mean cow is that really primal kitchen okay so it's a paleo bar yeah this is not truly plant-based i know and most of these so you're saying not not all these are not dairy they're all these are all dairy and gluten free and low sugar okay yeah all right y'all so that was our protein bar try we did 20 minutes of that um hope you enjoyed like i said if you made it this far in the video thank you so much for watching um like i said please subscribe hit the like button if you have suggestions on protein bars that i should try or moms should try please send them my way i would love to try them out in my next um post bikini show uh with that being said thanks so much for watching and we will see you guys soon thanks for having me bye", "Ih-h0tYhj5M": "I've enjoyed the marshmallow that was sitting there before you got it here at every university we used to fish out the all the marshmallows and then we would just eat the charms I'm assuming this has a lot of sugar no I think it's made of all-natural Oh God sugar sugar golden sugar my favorite stuff what really shiny here I don't know how I feel about that marshmallows looked kind of fake they look almost plastic I would totally eat these it is like a rice krispie square so let down yeah I'm actually really disappointed okay can we talk for a minute about what the natural taste of good luck would be I have a lot of answers cinnamon toast crunch treats sure mine is all-natural and that's all artificial this looks like candy I don't think this is something kid should be eating sugars alcohols might have alcohol it's both an afternoon snack and a cocktail well there's actually just like the cereal something like what cereal I disagree it is just like the cereal this one cinnamon toast crunch definitely yeah I don't like the cinnamon toast crunch cinnamon toast crunch absolutely like charge Golden Grahams this is what I'm talking about I'm super happy about this look at that it's like a chocolate bar no you choose like the cereal well I take it back I want Golden Grahams I still like my Golden Grahams it's not chocolaty enough or marshmallow a no or golden enough time it's quite golden yep winner kids don't eat this give it all to me instead", "IusW92hc9Pk": "Hi Bold Bakers! A fun fact about me that you might not know,\nI am an impulse eater, which means when I get hungry I will eat anything around me. So I have to have good food choices close\nby, just like my homemade granola bars. They are made with ingredients that that are\ngood quality and they're good for you. As always the recipe can be found on BiggerBolderBaking.com\nand make sure you check out my website for all of my other recipes. Okay, let's get started. So this recipe is an all in one kind of a\ndealio, we have a nice big saucepan, we're gonna mix it up in here, and then we're gonna\nput it into our baking tray. Very little fuss. So into my pot, I'm going to put in my butter. So all of you know I love to use Irish butter,\nbut you can also replace this with a healthy fat like coconut oil. Next ingredient is some honey for sweetness. These guys need to be sticky so that they\nkinda firm up. Adding another sugar in here with a little\nbit of a different flavor, maple syrup. Followed by a little bit of brown sugar which\ngives it kind of a caramel flavor. And then last but not least, some cinnamon. Not only does the little bit of cinnamon make\nthese taste really good, it's also actually really good for you too. Okay so then over a medium-low heat, let all\nof these ingredients melt together. So if you want to use just all honey or even\nall maple syrup in this recipe, feel free to do that, I just like how the two of them\ngive a little bit of a different flavor. Okay this is looking good, it's melty. Smells really good. This is like a tasty glue that holds your\noats together. One your butter is melted and your mix comes\nto a simmer, you can turn off the heat. So let's talk oats, these are rolled oats\nand they work best for your granola bars. You don't want to use steel-cut oats and you\ndon't want to use 1-minute quick oats. These are the best ones. Now, oats are fantastic because they are full\nof minerals, vitamins, antioxidants and what I love about them is especially if you have\nthem in the morning, they keep you fuller, longer. So they kind of slowly release their energy\nand they kind of fight that hunger so they're a really, really great way to start your day. So this is the fun part, this is where you\nget to add in whatever you like into your granola bars. Well, whatever you like within reason, to\nyour granola bars. Nuts, seeds, dried fruit, whatever you like. So here I have some dried coconut, I adore\ndried coconut, and the best thing about it is that it's full of healthy fats. So in you go. Next up I have some chopped almonds, add in\nwhatever nuts you like, pecans, cashews, what have you. These are full of antioxidants so they're\nreally good for you too. I don't know about you but I'm already feeling\neven healthier just looking at this. Next up I have some dried cranberries, I love\nthese little guys, I always have them to hand to put into salads and different recipes. These are full of vitamin C, put in raisins,\napricots, or leave them out and double up on the nuts. That's up to you. And then last but not least, a little bit\nof salt, because you know what I'm gonna say, all baking needs salt. It just enhances the flavors of everything\nelse. And then with your spatula just mix these\nall together until it's really well coated. Just keep on stirring until you've coated\nall of your ingredients really well. This is looking really good, now here I have\nin front of me a 12x9 tray. You can use a little bit smaller if you want\nyour granola bars to be that bit thicker, I like this size. I've lined it with some parchment, got my\nbig pot of granola, and then into my tray. Oh my gosh, that smells really good. So all you want to do is just spread them\nout with your spatula and press them into your tray. When you're making this, if you're thinking\nyou're not a huge cinnamon fan, honestly, the tiniest bit in there, it adds warmth and\nkind of a depth to these granola bars, it's really, really yummy. So now like I said, get creative, if you don't\nlike dried fruit add in more nuts, add in different seeds, just follow the quantities\nthat I give on the website, all a cup of each, because you don't want to add in too much\nstuff or your granola bars will be kind of dry. This is important because it just makes sure\nthat your granola bars are nice and compact. See honestly how long did that take us? Like less than 10 minutes, and our granola\nbars are all ready to go into the oven. Bake your granola bars off at 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C\nfor roughly 25-30 minutes or until they're a lovely golden brown on top. So while they're in the oven let me just tell\nyou if you want to make a no-bake style granola bar, that's totally fine, I've got lots of\ndifferent recipes on my website, all you have to do is mix them up and pop them into the\nfridge. So here's our granola bars, out of the oven,\nthey smell amazing, and they look perfect, I can tell that they're done because they're\na lovely golden brown on top, and they look like they're nice and sticky, so we're gonna\nset these aside and let them cool down for a few minutes. Once your granola bars have cooled down you\ncan remove them from the tray. So my granola bars are nice and firm because\nthey've cooled down, so now I'm just going to cut them around 1x4, now theirs is totally\nup to you, you can cut them any size you like. I just think that it's a good portion size. So I've got my bars cut up into 18 pieces\nand here I have a bowl of bittersweet melted chocolate. Now, we're not finished here, I've got some\nreally exciting news for you. Did you know that bittersweet chocolate is\nactually good for you? It is. It's good for you and it's delicious. It is full of antioxidants and it helps you\nto release endorphins which makes you happy, and who doesn't want that? So we're gonna dip our little granola bars\nin some chocolate. Then lay them on a tray and obviously leave\ntheir chocolate side facing up. I like to dip them in chocolate until it's\naround halfway up the bar. Lovely. So once you've dipped all your bars, you want\nthese guys to set nice and fast, so what you can do is pop them into the fridge or even\nthe freezer, for around 5-10 minutes or so and let the chocolate firm up. So I took my bars out of the fridge, as you\ncan see the chocolate is nice and set, so what you want to do is flip them over, and\nhave his naked side facing up. Now I've got a little bit of reserved chocolate\nhere and I'm just gonna drizzle it over the top. You don't have to be fancy here, this is pretty\nrustic. Just drizzle over and create nice little lines. This is just a little bit of an extra kick\nof chocolate, you don't have to do this if you don't want to. But if you ask me, the reason I like to do\nis because it makes them look really professional. Check that out. Beautiful. If you want to use a darker chocolate, that's\ntotally fine, if you want to use white chocolate, that's up to you. Gorgeous. So these granola bars will keep in an airtight\ncontainer at room temperature for up to 2 weeks and if you want to freeze them, pop\nthem into the freezer and then you can take them out whenever you want them. They are great to go in lunch boxes, to have\nat your desk, or even to snack on after a cooking show. Oh my gosh. It's one of my New Year's resolutions to eat\nfood that benefits me more. Not only are these made with good quality\ningredients, they're good for you too, and they make me very happy, so it's a win-win-win. Right now what I want you to do is head over\nto my website, I've got 500 more recipes and tons of videos that you might not have even\nseen before. I'll see you back here really soon, for more\nBigger Bolder Baking.", "paKwmdJi9mU": "I've enjoyed my fellow just know that was sitting there before you got it here well remember University we used to

original shreddies and this arrives i'm like oh well yeah this is going to blow your tits off yeah this is a whole new universe yeah this looks good and you know what i love there's a game on the back

so i could record like i've heard something on the radio to like wait for it to come up again and then when it comes up record it have these little cassettes do you remember what was on the cassettes though i remember hearing i don't even know what year this came out jamilia superstar do you remember when that came out i'm googling this oh it's so [ __ ] good 2003 okay that's better i was eight

okay simpsons were good yeah are you just gonna like cook this beat up what have you written down that's what i'm curious yeah so i'm gonna go through you tell me if there's anything i'm missing about

wait a minute very easy life there's a lot of like space stuff animal stuff there's so much stuff i think what i like i like the simpsons iconic intro who's talking a lot about theme songs we make an intro like simpsons intro so what's the chord and it's like a [Music] nice hearing birds under this chicken [Music] i don't know what the [ __ ] that is but it's going in drums neptune's stuff [Music] that's what i want let's just make a little kit let's use a bunch of like neptune sounds make a little drum kit i need some kind of chords like strings by the sounds of it you like it's like the uh star wars theme song it's talking about tom and jerry that's all strings simpsons that's quite orchestral as well dr dre use a lot of strings i'm hearing strings mirroring strings and i'm thinking phil neptune's he feels [Music] let me see what have i got written down i've got golden nuggets no get nugget go nuggets chop it up don't don't talk again don't go against us that was a hole like oh [Music] sick [Music] hey dave how you doing good to see you again good to see you good to see you guys you've got some new synths over there i see a cog you got a cog oh yeah i have this is a prologue eight so on your beat i ended up using like one of the most basic but one of my favorite synths of all the sk5 you know that casio sk5 i don't know that i actually realized that it's got a whole dog setting on it um so some of the chords are like doubled in dog it's really well you can do like several dogs at once playing a chord yeah yeah like i've tried animal noises in some of my songs before and they always sound silly but you genuinely managed to get all this weirdness into a beat and like i said i just wanted to write a real song but i want to hear it now can i hear it oh no you're ashamed this is the most nervous i've ever been to play anything to anyone now i've been pretty nervous as well really in my life yeah okay are you sure you're ready i'm super do i need headphones for this how deep did you go glass animals easy life cereal bars let's go yeah yeah you make me feel so old talking bout places we used to go and have a walk around i was just a kid with nothing [Music] and of course i'm a farmer let's talk about sheep let's talk about llamas i'm a real snake charmer wheels and like siddhartha guitar wade through the jungle of cannibals cannabis and glass animals even though i've meant to all my life i always am depressed but please don't be scared of me [Music] like there you go that was that was great that was so how did you you literally incorporated every single thing we talk about i think these are really really amazing lyrics and you know what i think but like the melody at the beginning is really strong and maybe we should just release this commercially and make millions when i got when i first heard the beat i was actually sat on a train and i was like oh my god i was kind of nervous i was like right we've got to write this song that's going to be good and like this could be this could literally sound like this could be quite crazy because the list that i had to write the lyrics was all over the place and if you've tried to use that same list to make a beat i was like hello earth is anyone going to do this and i heard it and i was like this just bangs and then literally on the train i've done it all and then it's the case of getting back to my flat and actually recording that you think you'll write a song like this again where you write everything out and then just and do it but it's such a good technique i was also going to say this to you like to come in and then just to talk for like an hour and just like make notes on and it's so useful man you know half the struggle with lyrics is actually trying to like what you're trying to say whereas we'd already had all our conversations i'm blown away by how you brought in high curry and star wars cereal it's all there thank you so much for embracing the cereal the beat so well and for yeah basically just being game i i absolutely love what you're doing here i think it's wicked it's it's a lot of fun and thanks thanks for inviting me on it's it's been a real pleasure thanks man thank you very much cool man goodbye later goodbye no honey no nuts no nana playing porridge as i sit in my pajamas prada and of course i'm a farmer let's talk about sheep let's talk about llamas i'm a real snake charmer wheels and like siddhartha gatama wade through the jungle of cannibals cannabis and glass star animals", "y1gKtWyK4IY": "[Music] hi I'm Stephanie drawers gave joy baking calm today we're going to make rice krispies treats everyone seems to love these squares and they're so quick and easy to make the only thing if you've ever made these before you know that this mixture is really sticky so the trick is to either butter or spray all your bowls your utensils pots pans and then everything will work out perfectly so I'm going to use a nine inch square which is 23 centimeter baking pan now if you want because I like my rice krispies treats quite thick you could use a 9 by 13 23 by 33 centimeter pan if you like a thinner square so as you can see just spray or you could butter it and then in a large bowl I've also sprayed this bowl put 6 cups of rice krispies that's 150 grams and have that ready and then I am going to spray my spatula again and I'm going to spray we need a medium sized saucepan so I'm also gonna spray the inside of that because we're going to melt some marshmallows and we don't want that mixture to stick to the pot so the first thing we're gonna do is put 3 tablespoons about 40 grams I'm using unsalted butter and I'm just gonna put that in my saucepan and along with the quarter or just an eighth of a teaspoon of salt just a touch of salt now you could instead use salted butter you could use margarine you could use one of those soft buttery spreads if you like to use that as well and then I'm just going to melt this over medium heat and have ready a 10 ounce which is about 285 gram bag of I just like to use the miniature marshmallows because they melt fast but you could use a large marshmallows or you could even use homemade marshmallows that you just kind of cut out so just melt your butter okay and now jump in my marshmallows and then you want to stir constantly and just heat until all the marshmallows are melted and you have a nice smooth mixture okay so remove that from the heat I didn't mention but try to use marshmallows that are really fresh because they melt really nicely if you've ever used ones that are a little stale they don't melt quite as nicely as the fresh ones so then I'm just going to add a half a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract just add a little extra flavor and then just pour over your rice krispies as you can see and these are really fast to make great afterschool treat for the kids and then just stir to coat all your Rice Krispies now some people like to fold ins you know eating raisins or chocolate chips or M&M something like that or sprinkles I just like mine plain and then looks pretty good hopefully I've got it off sure you get the bottom of the bowl and then pour into your pan it's a sticky part here I didn't spray this so make sure you spray everything I'm just going to what I often do is just spray my hands and then find that the easiest I mean you could use a butter or a piece of wax paper and do that but I find it easier just use my hands okay so just press firmly and you're done so um just let these cool you know 10-15 minutes and then just use a sharp knife and cut them and they can be covered and stored for a few days so until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm [Music]", "3ngDIw_xnmY": "the making of frosted cornflakes starts in this cooker the corn kernels are cooked here for two hours and 20 minutes the corn kernels are then browned up the ground up by this endless worms group it also determines the number of kilos of kernels needed to make up a cereal recipe the ground corn is next dried in a dryer unit an important step before they're cooked to give them their nice flat shape the corn kernels are crushed in the flake roller two rollers turn opposite to each other and the kernels fall into the constricted space between them the flakes then fall onto this conveyor and the next step will be cooking the flakes arrive at the cooking oven they're shaken to make sure they will be uniformly Brown the flakes exit the oven well browned then they fall into this chute in head in the direction of the next step this

poured into a large container they will now proceed with the molding of the bars the contents of the bin are emptied onto a conveyor and then the preparation is spread out here they add chocolate chips to the preparation the mix is compressed to the desired bar thickness by this roller the bar separator then divides the mix into 35 equal strips and then a guillotine cuts the bars to their proper length the bars continue circulating this equipment is used to line up the bars and make the packaging process easier side by side the bars are here turned so that they run one behind the other

homemade cereal bars for lunches so let's go ahead and start ok guys so like the intro said we are gonna go ahead and make some homemade cereal bars today this is not my own recipe it's actually from this little magazine here umm taste of home puts out you know different seasonal magazines and this one is really old I've had this one and since what is this it says display until June 14th 2010 so very old but I'm sure you could find it if you tried and we're gonna go ahead and make it together today anyway so I will link wherever I can but we are gonna go ahead and make these here's the page here the cereal bars and they are called honey peanut bar cookies it says Jim gales from Glendale Wisconsin is the one who submitted this recipe it says I borrowed a favorite breakfast cereal as a main ingredient for this small batch of fun tasty bars these treats are not sticky cut easily and pack well and that is very true with as much honey and sugar and stuff that's in there I thought they were gonna be so sticky and hard for the kids to use they're not sticky they're amazing so I'm really hoping you guys like these quick and easy to make cereal bars let's go ahead and jump into what you guys are going to need so here are the ingredients that you will be needing to make the cereal bars you're gonna need a quarter cup of each of these so a quarter cup of peanut butter honey salted peanuts and sugar and then you're getting one and a half cups of just regular old Cheerios okay so while you're getting all of your ingredients ready and you're getting ready to cook them up you're gonna want to use some sort of spray and you're gonna want to spray a loaf pan pretty well so that you don't have any stickiness afterwards so I'm just gonna let that sit out and go ahead and get started and cooking these up okay guys so the first thing you're gonna want to do is turn it on to about medium heat in a medium-sized saucepan you're gonna want to add your sugar and your honey okay and you're basically just gonna go ahead and cook this up until all of your sugar is dissolved into the honey okay so now that that's all combined together you can go ahead and turn off your heat and you're gonna want to add your peanut butter okay I'm just mix that up until it's all kind of melded together so now that that's all mixed together you're gonna want to go ahead and add your peanut and all of your Cheerios to the mix and you're gonna want to just make sure that everything is evenly coated and mix that all together okay so once you get them all evenly coated they should look like this there shouldn't be any dry pieces of cheerio in there um you're gonna want to go ahead and take it and transfer it to your loaf pan and spread it even okay so we've gone ahead and transfer them to our loaf pan and spread them evenly and what we're gonna do now is we're just gonna go ahead and cover it up with some like sort of saran wrap or anything really you can go ahead and cover it up and you're gonna transfer it to your fridge for one hour okay guys so our cereal bars have been in the refrigerator for an hour now go ahead and unwrap them and that's what they look like so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and flip it upside down and just kind of massage it for a second and get them to fall out and I like to flip them over so I can see them and then I just cut them into however big of bars that you want go and they cut really easily there we go and they're not sticky or anything like that they're just perfect and so I put them in little snack bags and I serve them in their lunches throughout the week okay guys so I hope you enjoyed making these cereal bars with me and I hope you enjoy eating them to our family absolutely loves them while they're not may be the healthiest treat or snack option available we like them they taste really good it's a tasty treat and I know everything that's in them a lot of times when you go to the store and you pick up a

the flavor mmm I don't like their insistent thing and I don't like chewing on a sponge hmm I do like it it's that wipers excellent the flavor is very very pretty very strong clever hmm don't taste the marshmallow them it reminds me just of I haven't had fruit loops and years so this reminds me of fruit loops cereal like if you took a lot of them and you squash them all together and then you eat them all at once he reminds me of $40 I know but I've ever had for any pound balls that taste is just just like for you they are fruity pebbles so that's what it is like they're fruitier than a dozen I would like them if they're they're stronger than four bucks okay yeah they're stronger the only I don't like I guess of the texture is kind of kind of dense and kind of like a spongy like it is but you get eight bar older you get eight bars of the box and so I think that's a good deal for two dollars hmm hmm yeah I really like those I'm surprised that I like this because I thought you know that we would get them and review them and it would be something that I was like Kevin have and I wouldn't touch them so much but now only things - I really like this so if you see these I would definitely recommend rum and your kids would bright like them too so I thanks for watching", "oX2QsDGXCR8": "[Music] we're back with another raw reviews talk about lucky i get to try snacks from all over the

so far but let's pour a bowl as i said it's not a whole lot to look at just looking like a slightly glazed rice krispie but really what did you expect it kinda has a slight vanilla smell really hoping it captures a little bit of that white chocolate probably just gonna be rice krispies with a sweet vanilla taste but hey i'm down with rice krispies let's try it believe it or not it kinda has like a rice krispies treat taste nice vanilla taste a nice sweetness and i'm a fan of an og cereal like rice krispies so i like it i need to eat a million i swear it's almost marshmallowy silver i'm down with it let's add a little bit of the white you hear that i'm pretty sure that's a copyright as it all crispy cereal we gotta move pretty quick but the smell is definitely increasing and has that classic crackle let's try it let's see if it tastes more like a white chocolate let's do it really far back i get white chocolate but i mostly just get sweet vanilla that's not a bad thing it tastes

ash thanks again this is great another quick round reviews and see you guys next time", "7x74dCobN8Y": "good evening YouTube voltar to review back here again with another review I got two more General Mills cereal bars Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Lucky Charms these are the big bars a king size so hopefully I get some ample flavor in these starting off with Lucky Charms serving size is one bar at 200 calories 6 grams of fat 36 grams of carbs and 2 grams of protein so you get a pretty big bar for 200 calories oh my word it's sticky there it is not too many marshmallows but it looks like there's like a white fudge on the bottom crisping very chewy immediately get that Lucky Charms taste little hint of vanilla in there marshmallows add sweetness but no texture at all in fact they completely mesh with the coating that's holding this together I like the glaze that's on the bottom I wish there is more of it this has just the right amount of sweetness for Lucky Charms this is an outstanding bar 94 out of 100 they can improve by adding more marshmallows finding a way to differentiate them from the the glue they used to hold this together so they stay crisp and a freezer dried like the cereal that you buy in the box I like the texture the cereal bar itself just the marshmallows are throwing me a little bit now we're gonna move on to the cinnamon toast crunch serving sizes one bar at 60 grams to 250 calories 7 grams of fat 45 grams of carbs 2 grams of protein click on the love cinnamon toast crunch again it's a big bar 250 calories that could be a decent breakfast here oh look at that color I smells amazing nice chew but you still get a crispness room of cereal immediately get hit with cinnamon a little bit of brown sugar sweetness going on it's like they got the milk left over from eating the cereal condensed it down sweetened it with brown sugar made it into a sauce and glued the bar together without flavor is magnified it's amazing online complaint is not quite as crisp as the actual cereal it's a little softer but the flavor is magnified and I love the brown sugar this gets a 98 out of 100 they can approve just by making it a little more crispy this is an outstanding cereal bar I will buy this again this is the best cereal or iPad my word get yourself General Mills Cinnamon Toast Crunch treats King size this is the breakfast for you but if you want to

Corral today I'm making something really really fun because my grandkids are coming over and I just thought that the family would just enjoy these today when it is super hot outside and they don't wanna have the oven on I don't want to bake brownies I surely don't want to bake cookies or I don't want to bake a cake I always make these treats and these are so delicious these are my fruity pebble marshmallow treats they are made pretty much like you would make a rice krispies treat but I thought that I would share this recipe with you guys because I love making these so much so right now in my pot here I have a 1 stick of butter that I've been trying to melt for quite some time I actually turn the heat up finely and it is finally melting I love making these fruity pebble treats because I think they're so colorful and so fun and everybody really enjoys them because they are a little bit different than a regular rice krispies treat so since my butter is just about melted I'm gonna add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to this that's gonna just add a little extra flavor into this and make it taste really really good I'm gonna turn the heat down on this now I finally got it hot now I'm gonna add one bag of large marshmallows now you can do 10 ounce bag of mini marshmallows I just have the large on hand so I'm just gonna use those you can use colored marshmallows those are really fun to use I bought pink marshmallows before that it makes it extra colorful put the fruity pebbles go ahead and add in all of our marshmallows because we got to get these melted them all out of the bag there we go I always have marshmallows on hand this time of year because we do a lot of bonfires and so we roast a lot of marshmallows and eat a lot of some mores so that and hotdogs are a must this time of year to have in the refrigerator so I'm just going to simply melt these marshmallows and then I'll come back and I'll show you what is next you my marshmallows are pretty melted I'm gonna add in approximately six cups of Fruity Pebbles cereal can I'm going to measure that out sometimes you will need to add just a little bit more you add their cereal and fill it all kinds of pools together and you know that will set up nicely when you put it in your pants okay that's six cups right there and now you want to act quickly you want to turn the heat off and you want to get these three pebbles covered with this marshmallow mixture as good as possible now you want to have a 9 by 13 glass pan or metal and you can either butter it or you can do as I have and I have sprayed it with Pam and I'm gonna move the camera down here so you guys can see it so now I'm just going to put all of this mixture into the pan and remember this is good and hot so be careful not to burn yourself push this down what I like to do is take a little bit of wax paper and spray it with some Pam and place it over the top and press it down that way you have a nice even consistent bar so I'm going to do now I'm gonna place my wax paper that I just sprayed and I'm just gonna press this day now you can actually put your mixture into a baking sheet and I'll make it better and then when it cools you can take cookie sheets and cookie cutter excuse me and cut out really cute shapes for the kids but I'm just doing bars because I feel like this is the easiest thing to do so once I get everything all good and pressed out I just kill this off I'm gonna let this cool completely and then we'll come back and cut these in two bars don't they already look good our fruity pebble marshmallow treats are done and ready you want to keep these in a airtight container at room temperature and they will last for about three days they will not last three days in this house they will probably be all gone by midnight tonight to be terribly honest but they are super simple they're easy they're colorful there are a lot of fun all the kids that come to my house enjoy these my children still enjoy these and they're not even kids anymore and I love them as well so I hope you guys enjoyed this very simple recipe let me know if you try it if you are new to my channel please subscribe

cereal some miniature marshmallows some Reese's Pieces candy and some butter so the very first thing we're gonna do is count out six cups of our Reese's puffs cereal as well as grease a 9 by 13 inch baking pan so after you can out your cereal you want to melt four tablespoons of butter in a large pot all right so our butter is almost melted and I don't know if I mentioned earlier but you want to melt it over medium heat so now it's time to add our marshmallows and you just want to constantly stir and make sure that the butter coats all of the marshmallows and just stir until all the marshmallows are completely melted all right so as you can see our marshmallows are completely melted so you don't want to wait immediately after you want to pour them on top of your Reese's cereal you gotta kind of work a little quick here so that they don't dry up support right on in the bowl and then we're gonna and I'm just using a very large spoon to do this the marshmallows are really hot so I would say you could use your hands but the marshmallows are really hard so I wouldn't do that yet not until we pour them in the pan so just keep stirring this until your marshmallows are fully incorporated with your cereal and then we're also going to add 2/3 cup of our Reese's Pieces stir this around alright so this looks about good so now I'm going to transfer it to my 9 by 13 inch pan that I've already sprayed just make sure you spread it nice and evenly all right so after you spread it in your pan then you can go back and add more Reese's Pieces on top if you like I'm just gonna do a few all right now this is where you can use your hands to kind of press down I just find it's the best way just get your hands in there and make sure that the marshmallow should be a little cool by now so shouldn't be too big of a deal and it's just the best way to make sure that they dry evenly and that they harden evenly okay and that is it so just let these dry for about I would say 30 minutes at least before cutting into squares and I'm gonna do that and then show you what they look like when they are cut alright guys so I Ricci puffs treats have been sitting for about 30 minutes so what I did is sprayed my knife with some nonstick cooking spray just to make it easier to cut and they should cut with no problem at all so I just like to cut them into little squares and then you know put them on a cute serving tray especially if you're taking them somewhere so here is one all cut up and plated so this is super easy and takes no time at all so I hope you guys enjoyed this video and if you make this of course tweet me a picture and I will talk to you next time", "2LjobZF9r_s": "Hey guys I'm Alejandra. And I'm Caroline.\nAnd today we're making Loaded Peanut Butter Granola Bars. Whenever I've got a trip coming\nup or a really busy week, I like to make a huge batch of these just to have something\nquick and healthy to snack on at a moment's notice. You guys are gonna love how easy these\nare to make. So fun. We've got some fun ingredients for this recipe. We've got some honey, butter,\nsome Mighty Maple peanut butter that's actually been softened in the microwave a little bit,\nsome brown sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, semi-sweet chocolate chips, little bit of\nsalt, some chopped peanuts some dried cherries that have also been roughly chopped, and some\nrolled oats. All right guys, so we are gonna start by making the syrup that's gonna hold\nall this good stuff together. We've got some butter, give you that, little bit of honey.\nYou could also use maple syrup if you prefer, that would work just as well here. Ooh, delicious,\nfor a breakfast bar? Yes. Oh yeah, totally. And then we've got our Mighty Maple peanut\nbutter, which like I said we popped into the microwave for about a minute. Depends on the\nstrength of your microwave. You really just kind of want to soften it up a bit, melt it\nup a little so that it works itself into the syrup really nicely and easily. And then we've\ngot just a little bit of brown sugar. So just got this over about medium heat. You don't\nwant the heat to be to high 'cause that...the sugars in here will burn really quickly so\nyou kind of just want to keep it nice and gentle, take your time with it. All right,\nso while I'm working on this lady, if you want to help me out by getting the other good\nstuff in the bowl all ready. Sure, all right. We've got the oats and the chopped peanuts,\nthe dried cherries. We just ran the knife through the dried cherries a little bit so\nwe have nice pieces, but you could actually even use any other kind of dried fruit you like,\nso blueberries, cranberries, even raisins, whatever you prefer. Just sort of stir this\ntogether a little bit. Yeah, just kind of stir it up, break it up a bit. Ok, so this\nis completely smooth and melted, it's nice and hot. You don't want anything more than\nmaybe tiny bubbles around the edges, that's about it. So now we can turn this off and\nI'm just taking it off the heat and I'm going to go ahead and add the vanilla extract and\nthe salt which is gonna balance out all that sweetness and our ground cinnamon. Ooh, nice.\nJust get that all stirred in there. This smells like breakfast now. It's delicious, it's maple\nwith peanut butter and cinnamon and honey, so much goodness. So now into this bowl of\ndeliciousness we're just gonna pour our syrup. So easy. It's cool this is like a raw granola\nbar. Oh, totally. You don't have to bake it anymore, it's cool. Yeah, no need to bake\nit, it'll have a little bit of chew just like those little chewy granola bars you might\nremember from growing up. So now I'm just gonna toss this just to coat it completely\nin the syrup. You really just want to make sure it covers everything in there, all the\noats, no dry bits. Caroline's got our baking pan that we lined with a little bit of foil\nand you can grease it too and then that's just gonna make it really easy to pop these\nout when they're ready to go. So you just want to make sure everything's completely\ncoated. This looks awesome, I'd probably eat this with a spoon if Caroline wasn't here\nto see me. And so now if you want...I'll hold this bowl while you just kind of scrape it\ninto our prepared pan. Get that all in there. I love how easy this is. This is so fun. and\nthen once you make it once you can really play around with the flavors. So now that\nit's in here we're just gonna use that back of our spatula just to press it into the pan\nreally tightly. You just kind of want to press it all in there. Awesome. Pressure is gonna\nbe the thing that kind of holds everything together in addition to that syrup. Make sure\nit reaches all the way to the edges. All right, so this looks awesome. Now we're gonna pop\nthis into the fridge for about 20 minutes, half an hour. You just want all the syrup\nto cool, everything to set completely. Then we can take it out and cut it up into bars.\nAwesome. All right guys, we've got these out of the fridge, they look awesome and I'm just\ngonna pull them right out. That's why the foil is so important, makes it so easy. And\nnow all we need to do is just cut them. Easy. That is easy. Nice and easy, so I just want\nto go once in half. There we go, so you're going to get about ten bars from this. So\nthere you have it: Loaded Peanut Butter Granola Bars. All right so would you like a granola\nbar? Thank you. Please help yourself! Feels very formal. With our little tray. Cheers!\nCheers! Can't wait. So awesome, this totally reminds me of the ones I used to love when\nI was a kid. Totally, decadent but delicious.

We'll see you next time!", "JUlFvdMEzAA": "[Music] Bonz welcome back to another rod reviews as you guys know I love to do subscriber requests especially when they evolve to things I love that being bearish as you can tell by the smile cereal you guys know I love cereal and anytime there's a request to do with cereal send it right away and your video will be up the next day like this one it just so happened that our good friend Luke asked me to try a cereal bear by luck it's actually on sale at the moment so on my way home from work I went to grab it and said well I put it up let's shoot the video right away and put it up I'd love to show you guys products that you were interested in and personally I've never tried it today we're going to be looking at three cereal bears that I've been eyeballing for a while lucky charm treats golden gram treats and for Captain Team cinnamon cinnamon toast crunch treats let's dive right in with the Lucky Charms so in each box you're going to find five cereal bears for one bar which is 24 grams you're looking at 100 calories three grams of fat 18 car 10 sugar and one protein this is what the package looks like and this is what the bar looks like as you can tell it's just lucky charm pieces miniature versions of their marshmallows and then we have like a white chop and marshmallow a coating on the bottom it smells very similar to like your typical rice krispie square because basically it's what it is it's the marshmallow base I assume we'll probably like some sort of butter or fat just mix with the cereal simple and delicious but let's see how it works with Lucky Charms let's try it out hmmm this to me just tastes like a very square usually with Lucky Charms there's like a little tiny bit of a crunch to the marshmallow but because it's incorporated with the other marshmallow to make it a thick bar it kind of loses a bit of the texture of the lucky charm marshmallow but it does taste really good and I do really enjoy rice krispie squares Ron's gonna give this one six point five out of ten nothing I'd go in my way for what it is delicious let's check out the building grams once again we get five bears in a pack and for one bar which is 30 grams you're looking at 120 calories four grams of fat 22 grams of carbs this one has one fiber 13 sugar and one protein and this is how our package looks on this one and here's what the bar looks like as you can tell the graham cracker is strong we have two little tiny mini marshmallows with chocolate chips and a nice chocolate base I love building ramps and it I'm getting a huge smell of it so that really excites me right away and since it is summer this is gonna be awesome let's try - oh yeah right away better texture done a lucky charm one it's strong in the graham cracker but you can still taste the marshmallow in the chocolate chip this one is really good it's not all really sweet and not super crunchy so you're getting a good mixture of a slight crunch just making it just past chewy mix with an awesome graham cracker flavor and the inclusion of the chocolate and marshmallows really steps it up and gives it that s'mores bud I like this one Ron's gonna give this one a ten to ten you can see the smile captain team cinnamon let's check out the cinnamon toast crunch and for one bar which is 24 grams you're looking at a hundred calories three grams of fat 18 grams of carbs nine sugar and one protein and the package and here's what the Vera looks like the pieces actually looked more towards the golden gram typical shape then cinnamon toast crunch you can see the cinnamon drizzle mix with graham cracker pieces and on the back it looks to be a nice cinnamon bass to me it smells like a cinnamon bun in a bar there's nothing wrong with that let's buy it in see what I think oh yeah guys this is the one it is a three bears so far this one has the most crunch it's followed up with a delicious cinnamon flavor it's definitely the sweetest of the three but it's nailing that cinnamon flavor and it's absolutely delicious but I will mention that the cereal pieces in this I believe is actually Golden Grahams it doesn't look like the Cinnamon Toast Crunch pieces but it just seems like the graham crackers with a strong cinnamon flavor is absolutely delicious definitely the most prone should evolve them this is my favorite of the three although cereal wise I actually take Golden Grahams over cinnamon toast crunch I don't like the texture of the typical cinnamon toast crunch so then going with the golden graham pieces in this is actually an improvement for me Ron's gonna give the cinnamon toast the highest rating and eight point five I really enjoy this one followed by the s'mores and Lucky Charms one is good but it's not too far from your regular rice krispies square tree that's a look at the three cereal bars I'd like to once again thank Luke for a suggestion and anytime you guys got any products you want me to look at mention right away especially whether it involves cereal alright guys this has been around reviews and see you next time you", "tylrL1QHBSE": "brand sweets technologies from show : company is proud to

this far i want to say thank you i'm going to be doing a review of the kellogg's frosted flakes cereal bars now i thought this was new brand spanking new it was at publix but apparently it's been out for about a month or so so if you've seen this anywhere else let me know it was at walmart someone else did a review of it and i think it was uh what was it froot loops cereal bars but i just got these as you can see i already ate one last night i'm not gonna tell you how it is yet um it's this one is six servings at publix i think at walmart you can get 10 or 12 bars but it's 100 calories per bar 2.5 grams of fat 2 grams saturated fat no cholesterol yay 90 milligrams of sodium 17 grams of carbs so if you're watching your carbs well unless it's cheat day you know what i mean total sugars is 8 grams and 1 gram of protein it has 10 percent of iron 2 percent of calcium and for those who have food allergies or sensitivities it contains milk soy and wheat ingredients so hopefully you're not allergic to any of that so you can have yourself one now this is the bar this is the size it's 4.8 ounces so it's a small bar so if you want breakfast this may not do it you may have to have this as a snack or have some fruit or maybe like you want a late night snack but you don't want a bowl of cereal you know what i mean this is what it looks like it looks yummy and then this is on the back which is like milk let me look at the uh malt flavor salt i'm trying i'm trying to find the milk where it says it says non-fat milk fructose dectrost and non-fat milk so here's the milk so if you don't want to boil serious for a little late night snack or you grab something in the morning and you know you're going to eat later you know it won't do it like 100 calories won't do it for breakfast even though it's a cereal bar so i'm going to try it whoops this side up crunchy mm-hmm sorry i had a big bite i always eat big bites yep frosted flakes definitely except um it tastes sweeter than if you had it with milk so if you don't like extra sweet stuff you may not like this but it's really sweet but i like really sweet stuff the bottom um you can taste the milk but of course it's not quite the same as if you had regular milk in the bowl it tastes like if you added a little vanilla extract and extra sugar that's what it would taste like except of course it's dryer it'll be a little bit dry because there's no regular milk it's just they made this into i don't know what you call it they processed it so it's a little different but it's still good it's good for in between snack or on the go grab some fruit and a cereal bar because it won't be enough for i don't know i'm looking this way i don't know i'm not used to being in front of the camera that much with my cat so because you know i'm also on all my kitties so anyways but this is a good bar this is not asmr so i'm not going to eat the whole thing in front of you but it is a good bar um if you like frosted flakes if you like extra sweet if you like a little snack without you know having to go out and get something at the 7-eleven or what have you you know this is for you and publix i forgot the cost i didn't even look i don't know if it was 249 or 299 but i know walmart probably is cheaper you can get more bars so so there you have it the review of the kellogg's frosted cereal bars i'd give it a big thumbs up or five stars whichever you prefer definitely go out and get it not for the carb conscious um so if you're trying to cut down sugar the sugar isn't bad but the carbs is still a little bit high if you're trying to watch carbs but just one little bar it's good and if you like frosted flakes i think you'll really like this go out and get it wherever you can have it delivered whatever you got to do so anyways thank you for staying till the end uh let me know if you've tried the kellogg's cereal bars or the fruit loops bars i haven't tried those so let me know and if you liked the video give me a big thumbs up and subscribe you haven't already done so you know anybody who hasn't tried these bars who doesn't know about them be sure and share it out and let them know that they now have frosted flakes cereal bars and they should run down to the store immediately i'm not sponsoring kellogg's not that big but just want to let you know this is good i'll see if amazon has enough product this product is available blah blah blah i'm not saying it right but if it's available on amazon that's it video's already too long but i'm an amazon affiliate so any link you click on if you buy i'll get a very small percentage because they cut in half but you know it's better than nothing if you want to i'll see um if it's not too expensive i'll put the link in the description below so thanks for dropping by and staying and visiting with me so i'll see you next time bye", "AD7SY8G5CPw": "Hi this is Sweet The Mi :) Today I\u2019m back with Marshmallow Cereal Bars which is so simple to make. I\u2019m using the fruit ring cereal \nto give beautiful colors. You can go with any cereal you want to use. First let\u2019s make the marshmallow. Feel free to use store bought marshmallow. Put the powdered gelatin in a mixing bowl, Add cold water and Let sit for about 10 minutes. Add sugar and water and bring it to boil until \nit reaches 114\u2103(237\u2109) with high heat. If you don\u2019t have the thermometer simply turn the heat off after 1min from the boiling point. Pour the sugar mixture into gelatin mixture. Whip the mixture using a hand mixer. If you whip with max speed \nyou will end up with lots of air bubbles Start with medium speed and finish up with low speed. Add the vanilla extract and lightly mix the mixture. Add cereal in a mixing bowl then lightly stir. Now lightly brush the melted butter inside of the mold. Dust and cover with the \ncornstarch and powdered sugar mixture. Pour marshmallow mixture into \nprepared mold and gently press to flatten. I\u2019ve dusted with sprinkles for extra colorful look. Cover the top with plastic wrap and \nlet cool in the fridge for about 2~3 hours. Cut into any shape you desire and it\u2019s Done! If it sticks to your hand lightly dust with powdered sugar. There are many colorful cereal. Fruit loop or trix have lots of colors so it looks so facy. In Korea fruit ring was the only colorful cereal I could find. Sadly fruit ring only comes in 4 colors.

Back to school time does not have to be that\nbad. Today I have three Rice Krispies treats for\nyou, they are all different flavors, and best of all, they are no-bake. They make the perfect after-school treat to\nlook forward to, so let\u2019s get started. So before we get started, I just wanted to\ncheck with everybody that you all know about YouTube\u2019s community feature. Now over here I post pictures from behind\nthe scenes, sneak peeks of upcoming episodes, and I even get to ask you guys questions. It's really, really fun, it\u2019s kinda like\nYouTube\u2019s version of social media. So what you want to do is subscribe to my\nchannel, which I'm sure you already are, and have seen all of my videos, and then tap that\nbell, because that's what will notify you when I post on YouTube community, so you get\nto be part of the conversation too. Okay, now that's out of the way, let\u2019s kick\nthis all off with a snickers Rice Krispies treat. So in a large bowl we\u2019re going to add some\nbutter, and loads of marshmallows. Now you can use vegan butter and you can use\nvegan marshmallows also if you are a vegan, so that will work really well too. Now what we want to do is pop this into the\nmicrowave for two minutes for the butter and marshmallows to melt. So you\u2019ll notice when you take marshmallows\nout of the microwave they puff up really big, it\u2019s kind of cool. You can also do this in a pot over the stove,\nover low heat, and that will work really well too. So what to do is give this mix a bit of a\nmix around, just to make sure it\u2019s all combined and then we\u2019re going to add in our next\ningredient. Okay this is looking good, let\u2019s face it,\nwho does not like melted marshmallows? Now our next secret ingredient, which probably\nis not so secret, are Rice Krispies. Now feel free to use any kind of cereal that\nyou have at home, they will work really well. I just like Rice Krispies because they're\nsmall and they get coated totally in marshmallows. So in you guys go. It might look like a lot of Rice Krispies,\nit is a lot, you need them. Then once they are all in there, go in with\nyour spatula, and give it a really good stir around, and coat all the cereal in marshmallow\ngoodness. So Rice Krispies treats remind me of when\nwe used to come to Florida as kids, and as a family. We used to go to Disneyworld, used to go to\nall the centers, like Epcot center, Universal, all that sort of stuff, but I remember it\nwas the first time I ever had a Rice Krispie treat that they sold in the stores, and I\nabsolutely loved them. I remember wondering like what is in this? It\u2019s butter, marshmallow and Rice Krispies. Okay, this is all mixed up, it\u2019s really\nsticky, now we\u2019re gonna press it into our tray and start building our other layers. So here I have a baking tray, it\u2019s 7\u201d\nby 11\u201d you can also use something a little bit smaller and that will work really well. I like to get my Rice Krispies treats really\nthick, so I might not actually use the whole tray. So when your mix is still soft and squishy,\nI can actually hear it popping, snack crackle and pop, like it says on the box, go ahead\nand scoop it into your tray. Now if you're thinking to yourself this looks\nlike a regular Rice Krispies treat and where's the Snickers, stay tuned, because that bit\u2019s\ncoming next. And then just take a spatula, and flatten\nit out as best you can. So you guys know I love no-bake treats, and\nI know you do too, that's why I wanted to do something like this, I think you're really\ngoing to enjoy these, and they're so easy to make. The recipe can be found on BiggerBolderBaking.com\nso head over there for the measurements. Now I am gonna set my Rice Krispies over to\nthe side, and bring in my bowl of caramel. Now this is gonna be our next layer. So into here I am going to add in a little\nbit of milk, and then what I'm gonna do is pop these into the microwave and let them\ncompletely melt. Now if you don't have a microwave, you can\nalso melt these in a pot, that will be fine too. So it\u2019s been two minutes and my caramels\nare melted. Check that out. So now I'm gonna bring back in my Rice Krispies\ntreats, and I've got my caramel, you might want to wait until it\u2019s a little bit cooled\ndown and then just go ahead and pour it over your Rice Krispies. A nice, big layer. You\u2019re starting to see where this is going,\nyou've got caramel, we\u2019re gonna have nuts, chocolate, just like a snickers. Feel free to spread your caramel or with a\nspatula, just so you get a nice even layer. Okay, lovely. Next up, toasted peanuts. So the peanuts that I like to use are salted\nand roasted because you get that little bit of extra flavor, it works really well with\nthe caramel, with the chocolate, absolutely delicious. So go ahead and scatter them all over the\ntop and do not be shy with these, a nice thick, generous layer is what you want to do with\nthese guys. All over, until it covers the top. Now what I like to do to make sure that it\u2019s\nall even is just go in with my hand, and press down the nuts into the caramel, just so it\u2019s\na nice and even surface. Okay, great. This is already starting to set. They firm up really fast. So now don't worry, I haven't forgotten about\nour chocolate layer. Here I have a big bowl of melted milk chocolate,\nI'm just gonna go ahead and pour that all over the top. Also make sure that your chocolate isn't too\nhot when you're pouring it over so it doesn't slide around everywhere. You cannot have a Snickers without chocolate. Okay, great, and if you want, take your spatula,\nand just even it all out. There is nothing about this that\u2019s not gonna\nbe delicious. Marshmallows, caramel, peanuts, yummy. Okay so now because this has a chocolate layer\nwe need it to set, so you can actually leave it out at room temperature or you can pop\nit into the fridge and we\u2019re gonna let it set up for around an hour and a half. Just make sure the chocolate gets nice and\ncold. My Snickers Rice Krispies treat is all set\nso it\u2019s ready to be cut. So with a nice, warm knife, go ahead and cut\nnice big squares. I say big because I like everything big, you\ncan do whatever you want. And then look at that, you see the caramel\nlayer and the nuts and the chocolate on top, these are gonna be just like a Snickers. So now if you're looking for more no-bake\nrecipes just like this one, make sure you check out my no-bake granola bars, they're\ngreat for school as well and they're really easy to make. Yummy. This is so good. The reason it tastes like a Snickers is because\nthe marshmallow is kind of like the nougat of a Snickers and then you've got caramel\nand the peanuts, and a big layer of chocolate, I tell you, if you make these, you're gonna\nbe running home after school to have these, yummy. I promise you they're all gonna be as good\nas this one so let\u2019s move on to our next one. With our next flavor, the name says it all. It is a Funfetti Rice Krispies treat. Now just like the last one, in a large bowl\nwe\u2019re going to add in some butter, and marshmallows, and then just pop these into the microwave\nuntil they're fully melted. Then just take a spatula and stir together\nyour butter and marshmallows. Okay, now this is our base, now we\u2019re going\nto build on top of this. Here I have some white chocolate chips which\nI absolutely love, and Funfetti always reminds me of the flavor of white chocolate, I don't\nknow why but it does. So I'm gonna toss those in. there. Next we\u2019re gonna add in our Rice Krispies,\nbecause you can\u2019t have Rice Krispies treats without Rice Krispies. So now here is my secret ingredient, Fruity\nPebbles, this is what is going to make it really looks like Funfetti. Now if you do not have Fruity Pebbles in your\ncountry, do not worry. You can just replace them with Rice Krispies,\nyou can also throw a few sprinkles in there as well to make up for them. And then with your spatula go ahead and mix\nit all together. When you're mixing, take care not to crush\nyour cereal too much, because you want it to stay intact. Okay, perfect. This looks great, it smells amazing, now we\u2019re\ngonna press it into our tin. Scoop your Rice Krispies treat into your tin. I like how it all falls out in one big lump,\nmakes it less messy. And then with your spatula, go ahead and use\nlike the other one, flatten it out on top. Okay, so these have taken good shape, now\nhere I have some more chocolate chips, and I'm just going to scatter them on top, just\nfor a bit of extra crunch and flavor. Okay, so we got nice, even coverage there,\nof white chocolate chips, give them a little bit of a press down with your hand, so they\nstay in place, great. Now I'm gonna set this aside for around an\nhour and just let it set up. I'm very well aware that these treats look\nthe exact same warm as they do cold, but I still think it looks fantastic. When it's nice and set, with my knife, I'm\ngoing to go ahead and cut this one up too. It does help when you have a warm knife because\nit kind of cuts through the marshmallow because it can be a bit sticky. Lovely. And like I said, cut any size that you like,\nthere is no judgment here. Now I have to taste this guy as well, just\nto make sure that he's okay for you guys. Oh, do you see how gooey that is? There\u2019s so much marshmallow. Oh, my gosh, this tastes so good. The white chocolate in it, make sure you don't\nskip that step. Definitely add white chocolate into these. Oh, my gosh. This just keeps on getting better and better. Okay, now onto our next treat. So as usual I always try to save the best\nfor last, so here is a S\u2019mores Rice Krispies treat. So now just like before, I have my butter\nin a bowl, and my marshmallows, I melted them and then I've mixed them all together. Into this, I'm going to add in some Rice Krispies. So what makes a S\u2019more a S\u2019more? Well, then next thing we\u2019re going to add\nis chocolate, because you cannot have a S\u2019more without chunks of chocolate. The nice thing about this, because the marshmallow\u2019s\nwarm, it starts to melt the chocolate a little bit and you get these kind of streaks all\nthe way around, it\u2019s really lovely. So now another component in a S'more is marshmallows. Now I know we already have marshmallows in\nhere but I'm gonna throw in a few extra, just because I can. So now a S'more is made with graham crackers,\nwhich we allow and love, but I've got the second best thing here, Golden Grahams. This is a cereal that you buy that tastes\njust like graham crackers. Now don't worry if you don't have it, you\ncan always leave it out and maybe add in a little bit of cinnamon into your Rice Krispies,\njust go ahead and toss all of those in there. I have to say, this is probably one of my\nmost favorite cereals. So now all of our delicious ingredients are\nin there, now you just wanna mix it up really well together. Just look at that chocolate melting, yum. Just added extra flavor and yumminess. Once your mix is all combined, then scoop\nit into your prepared tray. Once your Rice Krispies treat is spread out\nin the tray nice and evenly, I'm gonna go over the top and add on a few more marshmallows,\nand a handful of Golden Grahams. Look at that, gorgeous. And then just like with the other ones, flatten\nthem down so those ingredients stick on the top. Gorgeous, this looks fantastic. So I don't think we could possibly add any\nmore to this Rice Krispies treat, so I'm gonna set it aside and let it firm up. So now the s'more Rice Krispies treat sets\nup really fast because you have the melted chocolate in there and it hardens, so this\nis even quicker than the other ones. Go ahead and take it out of your tin, and\ncut up your portions. So once you've made your Rice Krispies treats\nyou can store them at room temperature in an airtight container for like up to 4-5 days. They last a long time, and they stay totally\nfresh, so then you've got a good snack to go to. Now my favorite part of the job, I have made\na lot of s'more desserts on Bigger Bolder Baking, and I have to say I think this might\nbe my favorite one. So yummy, and then the toasted cereal in there,\nyum, yum, yum, yum. Just goes to show you, you can enjoy s'mores\nso many ways. If you have a little bit of extra time after\nschool and are looking for something fun to make, I definitely recommend my no-bake Rice\nKrispies treats, I know you're going to love them.

Oh, it smells actually really good.", "m3dRU46IfpU": "hi guys it's Joanne from fifteen spatulas today we are going to make some chocolate chip granola bars this is a recipe for my friend Katherine's new cookbook called delicious lunches and what I love about Katherine's book is it's full of ideas to make your lunchbox more exciting and this recipe in particular caught my eye because I ate granola bars all the time and I was a kid and this recipe is a better tasting and cheaper version of the store-bought granola bars so I'm just going to finish up adding 4 cups of old-fashioned rolled oats to a bowl here to this I'm also going to add a quarter cup of whole wheat flour 1/2 cup of toasted shredded unsweetened coconut 1/3 of a cup of brown sugar 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and half a teaspoon of kosher salt and we're just going to toss this all around with a spatula to combine to get our wet ingredients going and measuring out 1/2 cup of grapeseed oil you can do any kind of neutral oil here like canola oil or vegetable oil and to that same measuring cup I'm going to add 1/2 cup of honey we're also going to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract just for a little extra flavor and pour this into my bowl and whisk it to combine okay so we're just going to pour this all over our dry ingredients this is going to bind our bars together we're just going to stir this around until it's combined once your ingredients are combined you're just going to dump the mixture out onto a Silpat or parchment lined baking sheet and you want this to be about an inch thick so I like to take a flat spatula like this and kind of press it down into a compacted rectangle and you can use the flat edge to square off the edges this is going to go into 325 degree oven for about 40 minutes once the bars have finished baking you want to let them cool completely and then you can take a really sharp knife and cut them into individual bars I'm actually going to go in for a taste hmm these are so much better than the store bought version and it's all-natural so you can pick up a copy of Katherine's book wherever books are sold I put Amazon link in the description box below thanks so much for

Patrick's Day hope you are having an amazing day so today we are going to be making two different recipes and they're both going to involve Lucky Charms okay one of them doesn't use as much Lucky Charms but you will be excited for both so first we're going to be making Lucky Charms cereal bars so it's basically like a rice krispies treat only it's easy luck charms because they have green balls and marshmallows so let's go ahead and get started alright guys so we're gonna go ahead and get started and we're gonna put 1 cup of butter and alright so we're gonna go ahead and put that on a low heat just to kinda get that melted and then we're going to go ahead and measure 6 cups of mini marshmallows just kind of loosely just Ruth we want to just kind of continuously stir this so that doesn't burn on the bottom and just kind of make sure they'll just slowly start to melt here mmm melted marshmallows all right so we're gonna go ahead and add the Lucky Charms now that everything is melted go ahead and turn off the heat and you want to add about six cups all righty and just mix that up okay now that everything's melted and you have a wonderful slew of colors you're gonna go ahead and put it into I have a glass pan here we're gonna go ahead and throw this in here oh the rainbow colors yes beautiful so sticky all right so go ahead just kind of pack it all down get it all in there are them all the marshmallow goodness yeah all right perfect so just kind of spread it evenly throughout the pan ah all right all right so we're gonna let this set for probably about an hour just so everything kind of sets in place and then we're gonna dip it in white chocolate which makes it delicious and gives it that little extra flavor and I'll be right back all right guys so I want the rice krispies treats just set for about an hour and now all you're gonna do is I melted some white chocolate chips and I'm gonna dip the bottom in it and then kind of let the excess chocolate drip off okay and so I have over here alright so as you can see I kind of have stopped a few started I just put parchment paper on a baking sheet that way it just doesn't stick to the tray and we're just gonna finish it off these putting chocolate on the bottom and then once you have them set they're probably gonna take about ten minutes for the chocolate to cool and you can go ahead and take them off and then they'll be ready to eat all right and now for the recipe I'm most excited about let's go ahead and make the infamous share mark shape so I have some vanilla bean ice cream here and you can want to take about three scoops of this using an ice I don't have an ice-cream scoop but I'm just gonna use a spoon and I'm gonna put it into my blender here three big scoops cuz we want this to be berry ice cream like I don't even know that oh my gosh you guys I'm pretty sure it's been like 10 years since I've had a shamrock shake like you know the one you get at McDonald's or something like that but anytime you put ice cream and mint with each other I'm not going to like it because I love those flavors all right you want a cup of milk pick your flavor of milk whatever kind you want you're just gonna need one cup oh snap okay that never happened all right now that we've cleaned up that mess we're gonna go ahead and you're gonna want to put in just a teaspoon a couple drops you don't want is to be too minty you don't want it to taste like toothpaste but you want it to be delicious and then of course you need green food coloring because it's named Patrick's Day really green you can just get the droplets I just have this gel icing because I do so we're just getting is that all right let's throw this baby on the blender neutral chick-chick chick-chick chick-chick training

going to be interviewing meme rap artist jufu and we're going to be trying some very sugary cereal big shout out and thank you to the serial killer cafe for hooking us up with all the weird cereal appreciate you [Music] hello hi hello how are you good to see you man you look healthy you look like you've already you've beaten me to the game the cereal game so you know you know the show is about cereal already yes yeah it's about two two things my favorite things in the world cereal and music yes sir so we're gonna taste a weird cereal i'm gonna chat and then i'll try and use all that that we chat about to make you like a custom beat for you all right yeah do it let's go back to when you were a kid when you were like 10 years old are you still in the house that you were in when you were 10 yes so i grew up here we moved here when i was five and yeah we've been here for 15 years oh well because my first question was going to be like what you wake up and like what does your room look like but here it is this is yours what's what are the trophies for uh so i have a basketball trophy another basketball trophy karate and another karate trophy karate i also played golf for like a year yeah i i don't know anyone under the age of like 40 who plays gold please place golf was was cool my parents put me in it because like it was just a really good opportunity for scholarships i mean i will say though it is definitely a fun sport like when you actually get the hang of it it's pretty fun i'm gonna write that down because we can use that sound that like waking up you're 10 years old what is breakfast is it cereal i feel like i was probably still eating cinnamon toast crunch my dad put me on a cinnamon toast crunch i got really into oatmeal strawberry oatmeal and i would add a little bit of coffee creamer to it like and it made it super sweet and delicious i don't know about this this sounds gross you have to try it the strawberry the strawberry one with a little bit of irish cream all right i'm gonna try it i'll take it i mean just a little bit though like don't don't go crazy try let's try the cereal do you have any background knowledge of this one what i know is that this is hebrew it's from israel yeah the other thing i've noticed about it is it's like heavy it's the heaviest box of cereal i've ever had oh wow it's not even a see-through plastic it's not what right oh my god i mean this is kind of fancy i'm not gonna lie oil is a good touch like you see the shine i feel like american cereal should definitely take notes like this makes me want to like start my own cereal and like have a foil like that would you what would it be if you could start your own cereal it would be like like a chocolate chip cookie dough type of flavor for like better i used to go crazy for that i used to go crazy for that 45 cookie flavored cream on the uh ingredient it's like an oreo on the inside i didn't expect the cream to be like that it's called cookie flavored cream-filled cereal carry-out carrier that's what it says that's the name all right let's do it let's do it for real i'm gonna start with a little bit one two three wow all right let's rate it what did you give it out five ten ten out of five oh that's big um yeah ten out of five whoa this might be i'm not gonna lie of my new favorite series if not my new video i swear what was your favorite cartoon spongebob is definitely one of my favorites uh johnny test yes i used to watch johnny test every network and i was just talking about power rangers the other day i i was really into like i was really into like powering specifically spd and mystic force i was a power ranger for halloween once i feel like i was too at one point did you ever have an outfit that you were like that is that was sick my ninja outfit the ninja outfit snake guys from gi joe oh yeah gig was like my favorite movie at one point was that your first favorite movie first favorite movie was nemo for sure finding nemo finding nemo now i say it's um no country for old men it sounds i studied film in college last year we watched no country for old man is like one of the films like just to learn the way that the conan brothers use suspense and ever since we watched that for school like that became my favorite movie i perceive life as a movie like very often so i feel like it's a lot of movies play like throughout my mind in terms and that kind of like alters the way that i see life in the way that i do certain things in life you will write quite like visually you're right yeah i'm i'm miss everything i have to learn like through seeing like every i've always been a visual learner so everything's about what i can see in my head someone told me that you started playing playing guitar so yeah i started playing guitar when i was nine i was in fourth grade when i started uh i'm 20 now so it's been 11 years since i first touched the guitar and i've been doing my best to just like hold on to that skill and not lose it and i've been actually incorporating it with my music recently what was the first song you learned do you remember first song was oh to joy it's like um [Music] all right we can work with that a lot of mother music kind of uses similar like arpeggiations and yes you know canon yeah so many songs have have have used that melody and there's this one with uh adam levine that came out recently but that's definitely something we can go like i quite often start making songs like that just a little like arpeggiation that's kind of based on some like classical [ __ ] i feel like when you do things like that it makes the song more appealing and people don't realize it like it's just something about like i don't know how it works but just the psychology behind music and like the way people listen to music is super super amazing i think that's it i think that's i feel like i've got loads of ammo what's the most important thing what do you what do you look for in a beast uh i like good bass good bass all right bass i lo i'm obsessed with bass that's like my thing and i like like unique drum patterns like drum patterns that just felt right rather than like a normal trap drum pattern

the way it really like just gave me a really like good feel overall like the beat itself is really like good for tick tock i'm not gonna lie oh for real wait okay that's cool i was messing around i took like a bunch of the stuff that you'd like the golf i thought was really funny so like i tried i didn't have any golf sticks so i found this it's like a piece of bamboo that someone had chucked into my garden um i like did a little like golf swing so you can hear that in there um and then the chords the main chords were because we were talking about pachelbel's canon i felt it did you feel that right away and my head was just going like backwards into like this like feeling like i was younger like as soon as i listened to it it's perfect absolutely perfect there's a bit of cereal in there like hit the cereal bowl you can hear it in the percussion like you know i was hearing that sound and i was thinking that it was like something else in the room that i was hearing i basically want to hear it where did you go for the lyrics what was the like when you heard the beat did you like have an idea or did you have to like scrape for it what happened to be honest it was just a very light process i kind of like freestyled it with all the ideas and well not the ideas but like the topics that we talked about freestyle it said a bunch of gibberish that's usually how my recording process is and then i filled in the words after the little work play and a little tic-tac-y lyrics and just made it really fun can i hear it i want to hear it so bad really i'm excited yeah please

that you had that flow that it was like very conversational and very like casual i mean you guys are down i i'm down to turn it into an actual song dude you should and the melody at the beginning is like good it's like a good ring which bit do you think is like the one that'll that people do on tiktok the part of the beat that the part of the song that i think that people would definitely use is um the cookie crisp right yeah yeah yeah that's like especially i feel like people love when the beat drops when they when the beat goes i cut the beat by the way so um i feel like on tick tock people absolutely love that and then the b comes back in and they get to just like hit the world to it so man you smashed it that's like so far beyond oh i i'm definitely like if you if you're down and send

NOLA bar is absolutely delicious and while you're over there be sure to subscribe to best channel because she honestly is one of the best YouTube chefs I know alright so let's get started with our strawberry coconut granola bar what's cool about these granola bars is that they all have the very same base so to get started we are going to toast up some rolled oats now you can skip this step but I find toasted oats just have a much nicer richer flavor toasting our oats could not be easier we're basically just going to pour them onto a sheet pan and into the oven they go at 350 degrees for about five minutes you want to keep a really good eye on them because things you tend to burn quickly you'll know they're ready at the moment you can smell them coming from the oven next we are going to tackle the glue that holds these beautiful granola bars together for this we are using some pitted dates and all I'm going to do is pop them into my food processor and give them a really good pulse what you're looking for is a nice smooth you may have to scrape down the sides of your food processor a couple times to make sure you have all the dates incorporated the final ingredient in our basic recipe is actually some beautiful honey if you didn't want to use honey in this recipe you could definitely use maple syrup or agave nectar those would both work just as well those three ingredients really make up our basic recipe then it's time to add any sort of flavors you like let's get started with my strawberry coconut for NOLA bars for these all I'm going to do is add some beautiful chopped almonds to my oats next I'm going to add some dried strawberries that I've finely chopped if you can't find dried strawberries at your local bulk food store not to worry you could also do this with dried blueberries or dried cranberries if you prefer they would all work just as well finally we are going to hit this with a little bit of unsweetened flaked coconut I'm going to stir this all together really well hit it with a little drizzle of honey and then mix in my date paste now when it comes to mixing up these beautiful granola bars only your hands will do because they actually get really really sticky so the spoon in this case is just not going to cut it so in we go with our hands and we're going to mix this until it's well combined then we are going to pour our mixture out into a baking pan that I've just lined with the parchment paper the parchment paper is incredibly important here because I promise you these will stick to everything take my word for it all I'm going to do is to press this mixture tightly into my pan and then I'm going to pop it into the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes this will help my granola bars set so that they're easier to cut once they're set all we're going to do is turn them out onto a cutting board and cut them into whatever shape you want you can actually even do like some cool star shapes with some cookie cutters if you wanted to and there you have it some beautiful strawberry coconut granola bars what's not to love about that next step I'm going to show you my Apple Cinnamon granola bars once again I've got my toasted oats standing by in a bowl and to that I'm going to add a good helping of ground cinnamon I'm going to stir this all together well so that the cinnamon is well combined and then I'm going to add some dried apple that I've just chopped up and some chopped walnuts you can absolutely leave the walnuts out of this recipe if you want to keep it not free then it's just a matter of adding a good drizzle of honey and my date paste and then it's time to mix this baby up once again with our hands if you have kids in the house I highly recommend letting them do this part once our mixture has come together we're just going to pour it into our parchment lined baking pan and then press it really well into the freezer it goes for 15 to 20 minutes or until it's set and ready to cut these have such a beautiful fall flavor they are absolutely irresistible finally today I am very excited to show you my chocolate hazelnut granola bars and yet these do taste a whole lot like Nutella once again it's starting with my toasted oats in a bowl into that I'm going to add some cocoa powder we can mix this all together well so the cocoa powder is evenly distributed and then I'm going to adding a more chocolaty goodness in the form of some chocolate chips to that I'm going to add some chopped hazelnuts now hazelnuts can be a little pricey so if you wanted to replace these with almonds that would work just as well would you give all of this a good stir and then mix in like sticky ingredients in goes my honey and finally it my date paste we're going to mix this all up by hand turn it into our pan and into the freezer it goes after it's set we're going to cut it into bars and honestly it's like a Nutella on the go I hope you'll give these tasty recipes a try and if you do be sure to tweet

don't want a fort sorry my dad mmm another breakfast bar here this is also made by great value I reviewed one yesterday this is for the ones that like fruity and grainy kind of bars in the morning instead of like chocolate type stuff this is a mixed berry fruit and grain cereal bar naturally flavored made with real free filling this is from a great value it's the great value M is these are distributed by Walmart stores incorporated great value I think there's a Walmart tech brand I don't think they're in any other stores not that I can't remember but these are good for like I always say if you have already eaten breakfast early in the morning and you got a while till lunch and get the hungry feeling you got one of these would you help tide you over till till lunch so we've got a typical looking cereal bar also has that kind of taking you can kind of look on the back it always reminds me of pygmy so mmm okay getting a nice excuse me cereal kind of fruity aroma a little bit of a grain of an OD greeny kind of aroma it smells really good even the feeling kind of gives me the memory of that big new time waster you can tell this is fresh it's kind of weird because even the casing of the bar has that big Newton kind of texture I mean you know again taste to kind of a kind of a fig ish kind of taste in the middle even though it's Becky I mean it's berry big zarbor you know what I can't remember what kind of fruit the fig is how they grow so this has a nice berry filling and it tastes really good sweet it's not real sweet words gonna make it sick you know sometimes you get a pop card that's really really sweet and you're like uh early in the morning trying to eat that mm-hmm this ain't that bad and you can grate this with your I mean you drink this you can eat this with your coffee like I said yeah and great values not usually one that's typically considered a high quality type product but there ain't nothing wrong with the two that tried so far um so there you go fruit and grain the outer part does have a grainy it's not hard or anything crunchy back did you get that kind of grain texture too alright well thanks for watching I appreciate it mmm I mean if you've tried this one and if you liked it see you all next one thanks for watching", "WnVGAVZd1fc": "hey everyone welcome back to our kitchen my name is Emily and this is Lauren and we're two of Festival's mealtime mentors so we recognize that more and more people are becoming diagnosed with either food allergies and intolerances and we're really here to help tailor our resources and recipes to meet your needs yes so today we're excited to share an allergen friendly sweet treat that is really great for anybody um so today we're making peanut butter crispy treats and we're super excited about this recipe for lots of different reasons yeah so this recipe is not only yummy super delicious but it's also only three ingredients you know doesn't love that let's just jump right in we'll start talking about some where different greens that were using so the first ingredient of those three is Sun butter or sunflower seed butter you can find it in our natural and organic compartment and we really like this because it's free from the top eight allergens so if you don't need to eat allergen friendly you could also use peanut butter or some other nut butter but this is a really great option for a lot of different people so I'm just going to go ahead I have a pan or a pot here and I'm just going to melt our Sun butter and some butter it sounds a little different but it's actually really delicious and it has a very similar texture it has a lot of the same nutritional properties as well as a lot of the other nut butters I would just come from sunflower seeds so it's really just using a seed instead of a nut which makes it not free and peanut free and this is really thank you it really melts down pretty quickly and we're using the natural variety today which simply means that there's no added ingredients so if you were using maybe an almond butter a peanut butter we recommend using a natural variety that has less ingredients it's just going to melt actually a little bit better and we're adding an other ingredients that are going to help sweeten it up a little bit so it really doesn't need any more sweetness right and that's a great point because some of those natural nut butters or Sun butter will have some separation in the container and that's completely normal it just means that there aren't any stabilizers or other ingredients that keep it together so all you need to do is stir it up and stick it in the refrigerator upside down and you'll it'll be one solid piece just like a typical peanut butter or a nut butter some butter and so that works for your natural peanut butter is your Sun butter really anything it's an awesome trick coursing charm so the next ingredient are some puffed rice cereal and this is typical to your rice cereal but this is special because it's brown rice so it's a whole grain which we love and it's also gluten free so you can find this in our natural department and the usually comes in bags and what you want to do is make sure that if you do in fact need to eat gluten-free maybe for celiac disease that you look for the gluten-free yep the certified lizard by clean debris either verbage or a logo on there so all we need to do is just stir this up until it's nice and coated really doesn't take any time at all and this is great because this is literally our base two ingredients really simple and actually really holds them as well well emily is doing that I'm just going to start to coat our non-stick pan well it's not nonstick that's why I'm spraying it but we're using a it's a glass dish you could use an 8 by 8 pan you can use a 9 by 9 we're using a 9 by 13 really the only difference is how how deep your bars are going to be it really doesn't matter we've used a couple different ones and they work every time alright so I am just going to put these mitts on side I'll let you tell them where you're going to this dump this in here all smells so good it does gosh so just need to get it all in our pan and then we can kind of spread it out from there I got a little bit more at the top this is definitely a two-person job so get the kids involved yes definitely fun but is just a lot faster than having to microwave yeah oh definitely that should be good so from here all I'm doing is just kind of pushing it in there evening about because we have chocolate to put over the top you want to progress so today we are using enjoy life another really great allergen friendly brand it's also free from the top eight allergens and all we did was stuff in the microwave for first 30 against to get it started to melt and then we did it in 15 second increments until it was completely melted perfect so you I can pour this over the top now these remind me of like scotch aru's or really easy bars to make they're really great for a lot of those warm weather gatherings that are going to be coming up soon they're also great for school treats yes if you're allowed to make those a lot of schools are becoming not free or peanut free but these might work within your specific needs um with that I do want to make the little disclaimer that you know even though we're calling these allergen friendly we we recognize that this may not work for everyone so we always encourage you to check the ingredients and make sure that the ingredients are the products that we're recommending fit within your specific needs yeah because everybody is very different so this looks pretty good so from here what we would do is just put this in the refrigerator for about two hours so I'm just going to bring this back have some that are already done and light enough you can see here we actually use an 8x8 inch pan for this one so just to kind of give you a little bit of different these are a lot thicker but they still taste just delicious of course should give it a try and I just kind of like emember feels that you can't just like fit it right in your mouth mm-hmm I love the fun butter in here they're

remix sample reboot rearrange just redo stuff that they should like leave alone i found these frosted flakes cereal bars like why is this a thing does that even sound good and like what is this white stuff you know it should be milk but milk is liquid this is not like is it yogurt is it white chocolate give me something the box says i don't know because i didn't read it but i don't think it says anything now it does not it just says kellogg's frosted flakes of corn cereal bars but while i'm here the fun facts serving size is one bar there's six bars and a box 100 calories per bar 2.5 grams of total fat 90 milligrams of sodium 17 grams of total carbohydrates which includes 8 grams of total sugars and less than 1 gram of protein all right here we go look at that they come in individual little packet there's tony the tiger they're great at least let's hope so it's so tiny one of those moments where you get it out and it's smaller than what you thought let's hope it's good what is this it's not good it's not horrible it's bland you don't taste the sweetness of the cornflakes really at all this white stuff i still don't know what that is but it really just holds it together at the bottom not really serving a purpose it's tiny and unfulfilling yeah i don't get the point i mean just get you some cereal even some dry cereal would be better than this i was going to like dunk this in some milk because you know cereal and milk but there's no point even the white stuff wasn't good so do yourself a favor and skip this and do yourself another favor and click subscribe below so

time right here on blank this", "dS6bceyqZ8o": "hi I'm Stephanie jour ski of joy baking calm today we're going to make s'more granola bars first pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit 180 degrees Celsius and then in a medium sized saucepan put 6 tablespoons of butter I like to use unsalted because I like the flavor plus I like to control the salt in in the recipe and then a quarter of a cup of light brown sugar and then just over a third of a cup of you can either use maple syrup you could use rice syrup you could use corn syrup but I like to use the golden syrup now in the u.s. golden syrup you can usually find it in specialty food stores or either online if you want to use it I like because it gives a nice chewy texture it's not too sweet but it really makes the granola bars chewy so we're just going to put this over medium heat until it's all melted and smooth so everything is now all melted together and it's smooth so the next step is have a large bowl and then in that bowl we're going to place two cups of rolled oats I like to use the old-fashioned because it's thicker and texture than the quick cooking if all you have is is quick cooking then that's fine just use that then one cup of graham cracker crumbs or crushed digestive cookies as you can see lots of good stuff here I have a quarter of a cup of sweetened or unsweetened coconut now if you don't like coconut you can just leave that out half a cup of all-purpose white flour 1/2 a teaspoon of salt if you use salted butter then leave out the salt and a quarter teaspoon of ground cinnamon and I'm just going to stir that together and then I'm just going to pour in the melted butter mixture that we did on the stove and stir it all together so the graham cracker crumbs that we have here is the first part of the s'more and then once we put this in the pan then we'll have the chocolate and marshmallow part s'mores now we will need a 9-inch square pan that's 23 centimeter and either butter or spray it with a nonstick vegetable spray so what we're going to do is pour half of this mixture into the pan make sure you get all of it covered with that butter mixture okay so I'm just going to put about half just eyeball it as good as you can it's not critical and then I'm just going to Pat this down with my hands you could use a spoon or offset spatula but just want the whole bottom of the pan covered with the oat mixture okay and then we're going to put one cup of semi-sweet or bittersweet chocolate chips whatever you like just kind of evenly as best as you can over the top and then I'm going to sprinkle one and a half cups of mini marshmallows now this is just the ones you buy if you had your own like you had made some homemade marshmallows you could just cut them up into little chunks and use them here as well and then what I'm going to do is just take the rest of our mixture and just kind of sprinkle it over the top let's use your fingers I find that the best kind of break it up the clumps a bit as you're doing it marshmallows will melt in the chocolate all melt together say bake and then just kind of press it all down together and then we're going to just bake it for about 15 minutes just until set you don't want to over bake them or they'll be a little too hard so about 15 minutes so into the oven we go our granola bars are now done just place them on a wire rack to cool for about 15-20 minutes and then cut them into squares or bars while they're still warm now if I was to eat these today they would be quite crisp and crunchy but once you cover and store them for a day or two their texture softens and becomes quite chewy so until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm", "3gb1HlgVRIA": "[Music] hey guys blaine here for bridgeport games and today i'm joined by my chef assistant rosanna from the fun four family because today is pokemon day and over on fun for family we reviewed pokemon berry blast cereal and gave you our thoughts on how good it was um but today we are actually going to be turning that up a notch and we are going to turn these into berry blast pokemon rice krispie treats so guys we're going to have the recipe in the description below but we hope this is going to turn into a really good uh snack are you excited how excited taste that's exciting taste test excited that's pretty good so guys we're going to cut over to the stove because we got to melt some butter and mix in some marshmallows and get those melted to make the rice krispies treats which are made with uh pokemon cereal so we will see you guys in a second we're going to cut over to the stove now all right guys the first thing you want to do you're going to go ahead and get your butter melted uh so you're probably going to want if you have a non-stick pan like this one uh you're probably going to want to have a plastic spoon so you don't take any metal and rip off some of the teflon in there so we're gonna do we're gonna throw in our butter and we're gonna start letting it get nice and melted and you wanna make sure it's pretty much melted before we try and add in the marshmallows so guys we're working on medium heat you should probably actually go down to low um just because we don't really need to cook anything we just need everything to get nice and melty and kind of get to know each other all right so once you got a nice big bowl of butter soup going on you want to add your marshmallows we're going to go ahead and add our marshmallows in here all right what you want to do is really get them kind of moving around to get them to start melting and this can take a little while because these are kind of big so we need them to be nice and coated and to start breaking down until we have a big bowl of marshmallow soup basically okay so you guys want to do you really want to have them start getting to this stage here where they're really melted down they're starting to look like a real marshmallowy goo and we want to do is get down to the point they're almost like a liquid you don't want any chunks in there because needs to be as smooth as possible before the cereal goes in [Music] all right guys so this is kind of what you want to see you want to really be really more liquidy than solid you want all the chunks to be gone and we still have kind of a bit of like a batter here but the butter also is going to help it not stick which is pretty crucial so this is looking pretty good so we're gonna go over to the table and we're gonna go ahead and get the cereal in there alright guys so we have our melted marshmallow here and we're gonna go ahead and add in our cereal so we're gonna do it a little bit at a time and we're just going to keep stirring to make sure it gets all mixed up and good and you don't want it to be like totally coated necessarily you just kind of want it to be holding together nice and you're gonna notice it is real sticky and hard to work with that's actually a good sign because that means everything is working correctly if you guys are wondering why i'm sitting down for this process i'm actually so tall that we couldn't fit me in the shot if i was standing up so i'm cooking in an unorthodox way for your guys enjoyment so i hope you guys appreciate it by liking this video and subscribing to the channel so we got some interesting like spider webs going on here so i think that's probably pretty good so we're gonna go ahead is go ahead and grease your uh dish that you're gonna put your rice krispie treats into you don't want to go crazy just a light spray so it doesn't you know stick and we're going to dump this big old monstrosity out all right so then what you want to do guys you want to just kind of push it down and get it into all the corners of your dish because ultimately these are going to be bars in the loosest sense of the word so you want them to kind of have a more or less square or rectangular shape to them okay as you can see some of the pikachu marshmallows started melting down so we do have a nice yellow color throughout this which uh is perfect for a pikachu themed snack so guys um you might be tempted to try and snack on this early and uh who could blame you but you're gonna want to wait until this thing is fully cooled down because you don't want to get burned and you actually want to stay solid and for that you need the marshmallows to cool all right guys so we have our um pikachu rice krispies flattened in the pan are you excited about this so guys you wanna make sure you let this cool for about two hours it needs to cool entirely thoroughly it needs to be completely cold to the touch before you even try to cut this otherwise you're not gonna end up with bars you're gonna end up with a lot of uh pikachu marshmallow soup alright guys so our pokemon cereal treats have cooled so we're gonna go ahead and turn them out so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take a knife and i'm gonna kind of just run it along the edge because it is we did grease the pan down but it's going to stick i mean it's kind of unavoidable [Music] so we're just going to do this to kind of uh encourage it to come out of the pan on its own all right so we're going to do guys we're gonna try and pry it out of there now we have these nice pokemon bars so we're gonna cut them into roughly rectangles so now you get the four nice strips so now we're gonna cut it probably into thirds i think that would make the best option here all right so we have ourselves 12 pokemon bars and we're going to go ahead and get them plated up and we are officially happy to present to you guys our pokemon battle bars that is the term we are using for this awesome creation of pokemon cereal done in rice krispie treat form so guys uh we have rosanna back for our trial here and of course christian the other member from the fun four family oddly enough showed up for the taste testing go figure i'm sure that's a coincidence so all right guys uh let's dig in go ahead and grab guys and we're gonna see how these turned out we'll grab one we're eating at the same time oh sticky person grab one yeah yeah grab one be weird they stick on your napkin yeah i would say be a little careful with that ready treats yes okay ready yeah yes three two one dig in i think it's a little better than the cereal it's more fruity i don't know why that is but like it tastes more fruity dry than it did wet i'm trying to figure out why that is because i don't think the marshmallow or uh butter did that [Music] a little hard to eat when the more you bite the more you um bite it the more you like it kind of yeah all right guys so here's the real question would you make these again yes and you feel like this is a good treat for vocal monday yes all right well guys um we need to go and finish these or figure out something to do with these so guys please give these a try yourself and you can also use pretty much any other cereal but the ratios and stuff we have are specific for uh pokemon cereal and that is going to be down in the description below thank you guys so much for being with us here for pokemon's 25th anniversary the 25th birthday of

"y4_eRAnNTTA": "ready Kellogg's Froot Loops cereal and milk bars mmm delicious boys had such a snap to make you", "AigA-iX9MHg": "hello everyone and welcome back to fun ideas do you have a party and you don't know what snacks you can put uh for your friends well you're in luck today because guess what we're going to do we are going to do some cereal bars and all you're going to need is actually some marshmallows and some cereal so i'm going to use fruity peppers i'm going to use a fruity purple cereal and i am also going to use a pack of marshmallows sticks is optional sticks if you wanted for example squares without sticks you can do that but sticks are optional if you want to add them on a stick and i'm also going to use 65 grams of butter so grab your cereal and your marshmallows and let's get started okay everyone so i've put it here my butter and i've melted it so put your butter till it all melts melts on medium heat so after we do this we're going to add our pack of marshmallows i'm gonna add all of it till it's also mixed so i've also saved some marshmallows here for later i'm gonna tell you later why um so i'm gonna come back after these marshmallows melts on medium heat okay so the marshmallow has pretty much melted and now i'm going to add my six cups of cereal i'm using fruity peppers because i wanted mine to be colorful so i'm gonna slowly add that in i don't want to take anything out add them all in and now i'm gonna mix this up i'm gonna mix this and i'm gonna come back when i'm done okay guys so i've mixed it all now correct i told you that i saved some marshmallows i'm gonna add them now in and the reason why i'm adding these marshmallows is this is actually optional because i want the marshmallows to look like chunks when you when you we when you eat it so the marshmallows here that we added will not melt and will and when you cut it into small pieces it the marshmallow the marshmallow will look like it's uh like it's chunks which gives us a nice effect and taste so that's optional if you want to add the marshmallows so i've mixed now everything and it's time to pour it in here now i've added some oil here so um i've greased it with oil and now i'm going to add my mixture i'm gonna slowly add it let me first take here okay and i'm gonna slowly add this in here it's kind of heavy i'm gonna come back when i'm done okay so as you see i had some little help to pour this in um now i am going to take some baking sheet and i'm going to take away my spatula for a minute i'm going to take my baking sheet add it in and press it slowly so it can turn flat from the top so i'm going to keep doing this until it's all it's till it's all in the pan nicely and so as you see it's getting squished like this so it can be neat so after i'm done um we have to leave it for 10 minutes so i'll come back okay everyone so we're done and we cut it the two pieces now uh when we took it out make sure you use um when you're using when you're uh putting in the mixture and make sure you use something that is like long so it can be thick like this it has more um so after we finished i actually cut them to squares and make sure you add oil um so it takes so it goes out easily so i've cut it each one and i've decorated and meanwhile they were resting i actually decorated these the sticks so it's actually pretty easy to do just take your stick and slowly put it here so i used this cereal because now they look colorful okay so now i'm going to put them for example on this trail so for example when you're putting them at the party or something see you can also put this as you see they're very nice to do you can also with you can also add a drizzle of white chocolate like also you see i put these with sticks these are without and they also have a drizzle of white chocolate i'll try to add white chocolate now here so let me just flatten here and add some chocolate on top just like this and you can add them white chocolate with each one like what i did you can add each a drizzle of white chocolate as you want or you can keep them just regular they're very easy to make at home and as i told you before i added marshmallows so there will be i saved some marshmallows so there will be some chunks of marshmallow which let me see if i can spot one somewhere as you see there's some marshmallow bits because i wanted to add these marshmallow chunks so it looks like it has much marshmallow inside so i'll now try one i choose this one and look when i open it wow that's very stretchy i want to try to eat it now i'm gonna keep um this sorry my mouth is full but this is very good [Music] i want to share these with my family after the video so these are how to make the cereal bars very easy to do very tasty i need some

delicious granola bars this is a study snacks collab that I'm doing with some other youtubers as well so make sure you stick around until the end to watch their videos too and the meantime let's get started first you'll need 2 cups of quick-cook oats make sure this empty rolled kind then add an a cup of rice krispies and then just mix these together I love all the rice krispies add a nice crunch to these bars it's really good switching over to a medium saucepan go ahead and add in 4 tablespoons of butter 1/3 a cup of brown sugar and a quarter cup of honey honey is pretty sticky so just make sure you get it all out now we're just going to take this to the stove to cook go ahead and place this over medium-high heat when the butter starts to melt just set a timer for two minutes you should start to see bubbles like this and it's going to get really nice and frothy after 2 minutes add in 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract and don't worry if it bubbles up a little bit after you stir this in just go ahead and take it off the heat now we're just going to pour this over our granola and rice krispies mixture and this is going to smell so good just like a butterscotch or caramel now just stir it in be careful that you don't crush your rice krispies once it's all nicely coated just pour this into a greased 13 by 9 inch pan I ended up using only half of the pan because I wanted thicker granola bars and then just press this down now I'm just going to sprinkle on some mini chocolate chips you could also stir in almonds or cranberries or whatever you like into their granola mixture then I'm going to refrigerate this for about thirty minutes afterwards I'm going to transfer this to a cutting board and with a sharp knife and dividing this into 8 equal bars if you like you can also wrap up your granola bars in some wax paper I'm just taking a little strip of it wrapping it around the back and then I'm going to tie this off with some twine go ahead and cut off the excess and there's your bar as you can see these granola bars are very easy to make and they're really good too they're almost like a rice krispies treat so I hope you guys enjoyed this video don't forget to

to open a cereal bar in Times Square featuring all of your favorite breakfast food Kellogg's is the latest corporation to use the retail experience to boost sales of its multiple brands including frosted flakes mini wheats Rice Krispies want to bring in a professor of food marketing at st. Joseph's University John Stanton John good to see you thanks so much for joining us oh it's my pleasure you think this will resonate an actual retail outlet which is called a cereal bar absolutely it's it's a great way to get some attention in a category that's dying and to make some fun out of having cereal yeah it's funny because we were just talking with Lili here joining us this morning Lee Carter and you said you're doing various polling to see how you can make cereal attractive and resonate with people what have you learned what we've learned is that people have changed their opinions on what they should be putting in their bodies and it is everybody's paying so much attention to ingredients so much attention to to all these different things that are changing behaviors and so one of the things that I think it's really important to understand how do we communicate people that these brands that these cereals are safe and healthy got past the fruit loops for John what do you think they're you think open over here yeah wife is always on carbs makes me happy John ok Johnson I think people have always thought that cereal is healthy I think that the dilemma they have is that it's boring you know you get up in the morning you have a bowl of cornflakes and you got to clean up etc and I think what they're trying to say is cereal doesn't have to be boring you can mix things together you can put different ingredients in it etc better than at least yes yeah you you want to put the readers and put them in but the idea is to create some fun and excitement and more importantly show that Kellogg believes that their breakfast cereal can be fun Kenda can be something that people would like to have in the morning I don't think this the store is really there to make a profit it's there to get people to get excited about cereal again yeah and we said we see it elsewhere in New York there's an M&M world you know playing on their on their big products there's the chobani store even Ralph Lord has a whole restaurant the polo bar is is that the way to market you know you get your best product and you create a whole sort of theme around and in many cases a retail shop well I'm not sure it's the best way but it certainly is a good way and it's it's a good way for a company whose category has been declining and you're sitting around saying man we have to get people to recognize this is a good product you know this is this can be fun what's your favorite cereal John is your favorite cereal my favorite cereal yep I like cornflakes and I like to put raisins and nuts and things like that in it I'm just curious you really think the issue is fun or if the issue is people are concerned about carbs made rather have great deal of Greek yogurt right now it is that's what I think people are afraid of sugar get over ill buy some fruit loops I mean a lot of the cereals are not just the sugary cereals and a lot of the things that they're recommending putting into the cereal are not necessarily unhealthy some of the mixes you know have the frosted flakes etc but let's be honest a bowl of frosted flakes every once in a while is not going to kill you yeah and it may make that you know the breakfast occasion just a little more interesting and a little more fun yeah all right Froot Loops has 10 grams of sugar and no Graham that's something you should be very softly is it exactly John Stanton thank you sir we will see you soon oh it's my pleasure enjoy your cereal cheers", "v6fgHX6u6K4": "[Music] and the fruit loop one [Music] how does it taste so much better now like that butter just adds a whole new new layer what's up guys welcome back for those of you who are new to this channel my name is elena welcome and for those of you who are already subscribed welcome back um we're going to be doing a video on how to infuse cereal so we're going to be doing it with both tincture and with butter this will work on pretty much any type of cereal i'm going to be showing you guys or like demonstrating it on these three these are just these props um but yeah it'll work it'll work on all of them so let's start with the tincture um because that one is a little bit more simple so i just have a pan here with some parchment paper or wax paper parchment i guess and let's do some of the cinnamon toast crunch [Music] i'm just gonna do a little bit because i already have some of these made and it's not difficult to make more as i need it [Music] and then let's also use this one [Music] which we never had this in canada for the longest time it was only in the states and then we got here and i honestly wanted to try so bad i was so excited for it before it came to canada and when i tried it i'm just like it's not that exciting like [Music] the crunchies don't taste different like so the berries don't taste different than the cap'n crunch crunches dude you know what i mean like it just like tastes the same i really want to try the cotton candy one how is that one we definitely don't have that here i remember in the states you guys had cotton candy oreos back in 2015 because i was there and i bought some of them and they were like the best oreos i've ever had hopefully they'll come back one day okay so starting with the tincture we have our um captain crunch and our cinnamon toast crunch and this would all be easier being done in something like this because partly through this we're going to need to like turn it over and it helps having in here because you can kind of just like shake it and move it around um but the problem is that i personally only have this type of size of one and i want to keep them um like as spacious as possible so i can get um as much airflow so if you have a bigger one of these that would work well or if you're just doing a small batch okay so um so i already put some of my tincture in a little spray bottle i ordered these on amazon um i'll put a link for something similar but you can use this i'm just like one from the dollar store any type of spray bottle or even those little um like ones that are made for olive oil that kind of mist when you repetitively press them um i've used those as well but kind of like this better surprisingly um yeah so i just poured my tincture into a bottle now i'm gonna spray my cereal with my tincture and then see and this is where it's tricky because you have to flip it around and like you can do it one by one which is really easy for the cinnamon toast crunches especially because they're easy to just grab and turn around but that's a lot of work for doing like larger batches but yeah you could just like shake it flip it with a [Music] flippy a cookie a spatula and then i'm just going to turn these over like this [Music] okay so i think it's actually best to spray them close together so that nothing goes on the paper and it mostly goes on the cereal so then we'll now that we've turned them we're going to spray them some more and you can use as much or as little as you want i mean if you're going to add a lot a lot i would definitely um let them dry in between so we're gonna do that anyway so now that like we have them sprayed i'm gonna spread them out so they have good airflow and then we're going to let this dry um and the alcohol will dry pretty fast especially if you have um moving air wherever you are don't put in the fridge something you want to leave it's an open area so the alcohol can evaporate so then we're just going to leave this until they are pretty dry and then we can spray them some more so we can keep repeating this step until i mean you can repeat as much as you want um it's really that easy no need to put them in like the oven or anything like that so that's how you make them a tincture now we're gonna make them with some butter so we're gonna start by melting some butter i am going to be using a microwave you don't have to you can use a double boiler because every time i use a microwave in my videos i get a million people saying not to use a microwave and i just shouldn't use a microwave but i like using the microwave and i've still had good results like yeah maybe if i use the microwave and everything turns out really weak then maybe i wouldn't use it but then maybe i'm wrong maybe using the microwave um is making them weaker and maybe stronger if i didn't use it uh but i don't really see how the microwave would make a difference i don't see heating it up using the microwave versus anadele boiler would make a difference like i don't really i don't get it so somebody wants to explain to me in the comments and give me like actually the proper explanation and not just like this is what i heard and this is why but like i don't know i'm not flipped it i just like i'm lazy [Music] so i like the microwave but i'm open to listening it's just i need some more solid proof before i change my lazy ways you know okay so i'm just cutting up some um these are this is the butter that i have in um they're in half a cup blocks and i don't want too much right now so i'm just cutting um one of mine into like [Music] so i'm going to go and take this maybe i do want a little bit more let's see how much cereal we're going to do so i'm going to be doing this one oh wait no i'm doing this one i'm gonna be mixing it in here and let's start with let's give the cinnamon toast crunch last because i think the cinnamon um coating is gonna get into the butter and we'll transfer onto the other cereal so let's do fruit loops first the colors on these are not as nice to me i feel like it's probably because they're like colored with like natural colors now or something yeah no artificial flavors of colors does it like that mistakes i feel like canada is like more strict with their regular food regulations just like a lot of stuff tastes better in the states [Music] so let's do it cheerios and then we'll do this one next but i'm gonna i'm gonna go microwave this microwave i'll be right back i'm just gonna sneak back in here and add this other half because i feel like we're gonna need it and i like my stuffed buttery okay so i melted it for about i don't know 40 seconds there's still a couple little chunks i'm just waiting for them to melt with the remaining heat in the butter and so i have my um fruit loops [Music] i'm just gonna pour some of this over and i'm gonna take some of my butter and just drizzle it over not all of it you can always add more right and i'm going to put a lid on this and shake it up sounds a little broken but i don't think they are so we put a little bit in there and we shook it up and i feel like we can add a little bit more so let's just drizzle a little more in there [Music] and shake it up again [Music] oh yeah that looks perfect [Music] sorry i just had a little photo shoot here for the thumbnail um uh yeah so i shut up my butter and um [Music] and those are all shaken up and good and actually this the butter kind of hardens a bit probably because i have the air conditioner on so well i'll show you so i have this tyrex container and i had already treated the oven to about 220 degrees i've done this at 200 degrees i've done it at 250 um i kind of just the results are pretty similar either way so then i'm going to pour that into my baking dish and you can see that the butter kind of hardened in here i'll show you [Music] like that so i'm gonna actually put this whole thing in the microwave just to melt kind of that so that i don't have to like scrape and eat it with the spoon by myself after because i don't want to waste it so yeah i'll just melt that down a bit okay so i melted a little bit of butter and now we're gonna do cinnamon toast crunch which is my favorite actually it's not my favorite i love lots of cereals [Music] and then we're going to pour some butter over it yeah see i did make a little bit too much butter but not that much maybe i'll make some popcorn after and pour that on okay and then i'm just gonna um i don't know well let me zoom in okay so i have my uh slimming tools crunch and my butter oh i'm probably screaming into the camera right now um and i'm just gonna pour that over just a little bit to start with and we're gonna shake that oh my god that was so close to spilling that i can't believe i actually saved that okay see you do this in a plastic bag whatever okay uh [Music] i feel oh this one's gonna taste so good with the butter i can already imagine i'm gonna add a little bit more just a little bit i can you guys know like what am i trying to say like have you ever had that chex mix type thing that's made with um butter in the oven and then it just has that i can't even explain how delicious this is going to be this city into a french one it's like this is what it's about like buttered bread buttered cinnamon bread okay so that's how it looks the lighting is kind of weird uh maybe i'll zoom in when it's on the in the pan i'm just gonna put that in there don't worry it's just me eating this getting my little raccoon fingers all over everything now see what should we use this for cause this is like a mix of like cinnamon sugar and butter i feel like this probably tastes good by itself yes that tastes good by itself oh that is tasty it kind of tastes like frosting but anyways we have our butter coated cereal and it kind of has like a uh textures like i don't know how you explain that let's see uh like a butter texture essentially um so i preheat the oven to [Music] 220 degrees like i said and i'm going to put this in there and we're gonna let it cook for about 10-15 minutes so let's go bring that with us from the kitchen [Music] so i'll turn the lights on and what do we have 220 [Music] and we're gonna put this in i'm going to set a timer for about 10 minutes and we're going to come back and flip so it looks like these have dried a bit but not fully um if you're more patient you can just do this for the day and just come back to it every like hour or so and just spray and then um let it dry and then just do that every hour so you can really layer it up but for the purpose of this video i'm just gonna spray it again here and like i said before you can repeat this process as many times as you like i'm just this is gonna be the last time i'm doing it just because um for the video [Music] although like probably off camera i'll probably spray some more but it just depends on how strong you want to be and this isn't a perfect dosing um method like this isn't like some fancy like exact dosage and like it's not guaranteed the same results every time um but it's just a nice way to kind of just have the little snacks on hand so we're just gonna leave this out to dry we're gonna do that so we can get some better air on it and then that is pretty much good to go once it's fully um crunchy again [Music] okay so 10 minute timer went off and bear with me because i have uh i'm doing this one hand here so i'm just gonna pull this out looking good smells good oh very cinnamony um okay and i'm just gonna like if you just had one flavor in here you could uh how do i say this like [Music] flip it you know what i mean but because i have two i want to keep them separated and this would work better if you had it in a bigger dish so that the heat could get to the more evenly these look like halloween colors that's not what fruit loops used to look like like where's the red ones is it isn't it because red food coloring is supposed to be really bad or it comes from like cockroaches or something i don't know it's like why are you bothered by eating a cockroach when people eat like meat they're just like what's the difference so put that back in and let's do another 10 minutes [Music] and then we will come see actually let's do 15 minutes again like it doesn't really matter usually i put this in the oven between anywhere between like 20 and 45 minutes um and just flip it every like 10 or 15 or so um just just try different types and see how you like it it tastes maybe a little bit different if you cook it for you know half an hour instead of 45 minutes or 20 minutes instead of 45 but you could just take um some out at 20 minutes and then takes about a half an hour and kind of just taste each one and see how you like it the best and you can kind of figure out what your favorite way to do it is um from just one round essentially okay 15 minutes is up so it's been there for a total of 25 minutes oh my god that smells so good like i'm pretty sure it's just the cinnamon stuff it smells good but it literally smells like pie something like that i don't know it's really good oh sorry camera i put that can i put that there so yeah we're just mixing that up i think maybe like 10 or a minute should be good so just throw that back in [Music] and then 10 more minutes [Music] okay now our 15 minutes is over i'm going to turn off the oven and pull these out i think these are good to go let's just bring them over i am just going to lay them out on the parchment paper just to dry i mean i'm sure they could dry in the dish as well but i feel like they'll dry a little bit better here yeah so you kind of have them mixed together [Music] the rest of that here so we're just gonna leave these out to dry i'm just gonna separate the pieces that shouldn't be in the piles there kind of annoying um yeah see there they're not like they're not fully dry but they're just about dry it's all ready oh let's try the fruit [Music] lips sorry yeah so just leave that to dry and then i don't know i think it'll be good in like half an hour and then you can pack them all up once they're fully dry and they are ready to use whether you eat them by themselves or were you for milkover obviously i'm interested in eating them by themselves they're really good but thank you guys so much for watching i hope you guys enjoyed this video please let me know if you did um i feel like i need to get a new ending because i feel like i say the exact same thing every time i hope you guys like this video and [Music] thank you guys so much for watching i hope you like this video please let me know if you did don't forget to give it a thumbs up leave a comment tell me what your favorite cereal is and subscribe thank you guys so much i hope you have a wonderful day see you guys next time i'm back because i forgot to taste the tincture ones i guess because they're not fully dry but or are they okay they're pretty much dry they can dry out for a little bit longer um honestly like not as good as the butter because well you can still taste the alcohol in a little bit like it mostly evaporates but you can still taste it a little bit and butter is there anything you can add butter to that doesn't taste good like obviously not dumplings like adding butter fruits actually you know why adding butter to fruit like in the oven is good it's like apple crisp you know but the better one's better and crunchier and buddier okay that's all it tastes kind of like reminds me of pie [Music] because the butter [Music] and the frugal ones how does it taste so much better now like that butter just adds a whole new [Music] layer", "MM3bqmmLDEY": "hi guys and welcome back today's s'more video I am bringing you this delicious s'more gram bar it is so good and so easy so let's just get right into it there's just a couple ingredients you need you need one full box of Golden Grahams cereal five cups of mini marshmallows about a bar or a bar and a half of some kind of milk chocolate whatever your favorite is I prefer meals in it is so delicious and then free to get the spoons of butter starting off in a medium-sized saucepan you're gonna melt down those three tablespoons of butter over medium high heat and then you're gonna add four of the five cups of the mini marshmallows and set the other coven aside for later and stir that down until it is completely melted once you have it all melted together you're gonna add in your golden graham cereal I like to add a bit at a time just makes it easier to completely coat it so do that in increments just mixing it together with the marshmallow and the cereal and then adding more in as you go now you're just gonna add in that last cup of mini marshmallows that you set aside before and you're going to lightly blend this in to make sure you want to work quickly so that way the mixture is not completely set up just yet in the buttered a 9 by 13 pan you can add half of the mixture and just Pat it down to completely until it covers the whole bottom and then once you've done that you're just gonna start adding in your chocolate pieces and randomly throughout the mixture add as many as you want but I actually found that it tasted better if there wasn't too many in there kind of spaced out as I've done here and then just repeat that process for more time adding in the rest of the mixture completely patting it down and then adding your chocolate pieces on top and once it looks like this you are going to set this in the fridge for a couple of hours to set up and I know I'm sorry a couple of hours I wish it would only be like 30 seconds even that seems too long but got a couple of hours in the fridge and then you can take it out and place it up I did 5 across the long way and then the shorter is it four across I don't wouldn't make these too big just because they are a very very decadent dough but you'll probably be going back for seconds regardless program just cut those up as you see fit and then plate them up and they're so delicious I hope you guys have been enjoying my s'mores videos make sure to check out my other ones if you haven't already we did we never talked up some ores and the small part and I'm going to be having another one coming so hope you guys are enjoying this and I will see you guys soon", "1SRfPTKjXVs": "okay right today I wanted to show you how to make cereal bowl first with some of the various grains and flakes that are on the market because you don't need to use just porridge oats with these there's a whole range of different ones which all have some different nutritive values and that you can use instead and I divided these up into two groups these three here all contain certain amounts of gluten not as much as wheat does but they do contain gluten so if you're making this for somebody who was a celiac or gluten intolerant then you know obviously you would miss out you know these three and that includes jumbo oats which are slightly larger and porridge oats so again body flakes rye flakes which I haven't got here but a very similar to body flakes and the third one is just ordinary porridge oats and as I've kept those things separate now the ones that don't contain any gluten a once which you may be or may not be familiar with the first one here are buckling creates actually the member of the rhubarb family but the flakes work extremely well in you know flat track tight recipes and news Lee's is completely gluten-free and you can also buy it as a flower and use it instead of other flowers in cooking as well this one here are bryan brown rice flakes which I don't tend to use very much in this recipe but I do I use it as a very small quantity otherwise I find if you use a high amount of this in a recipe you end up with a flavor of bit like sort of polystyrene ups or rice cakes you know which is not my particular favorite texture third one here are millet flakes again gluten-free slightly more yellow in color than the others but again you know it's a very good recipe of I'm going to use in this particular recipe now the fourth one is called quinoa it's spelt q UI n OA what you think be pronounced quinella it's actually pronounced quinoa and you can buy it as a flake you can also buy it in a flower form and you can also buy it endif or granules in seeds that it comes in which could be cooked exactly like rice use the exactly same rows you would use rice I quite like it when I've cooked it's about 15 minutes and then you can mix it in with grated beetroot and a French dressing or you can work it like at a ballet and add lots of parsley and mint to it's in the French dressing but clean wise a very special grain it's actually classes of fruit and it comes from Peru like Paddington Bear and its protein content is much much higher than any of the other grains it's almost equivalent to eggs so it's a very good source so if I didn't protein to the diet so I do use it quite a lot in grain and as a flower and in its natural seed form as 12 right now cereal bars in the bowl here I've got a hundred grams of softened butter and you don't want to use it straight from the fridge or otherwise it's impossible to try and mix in all the ingredients together if you wanted to use a dairy-free spread for those who are avoiding during their diet you could use that and i have used half butter and half of a mild olive oil before now and that's worked equally successfully as well as 100 grams of butter and then in here i've got 75 grams which is the onion melted sugar that's gone into the recipe of dark and molasses sugar or you could use muscovado sugar as well you do need to watch this because if you've had the pancake the packet open for a length of time then it does tend to dry out your forms little hard lumps and if you're not careful you mix it into ingredients you get this little hard balls of sugar you know I'm mixed into the mixture it does get somewhat hard then you can warm it up in a low oven oral or as gentle microwave just to try and get rid of the lumps in the sugar sometimes even when you bought it in a supermarket wives do is give the packet to squeeze and if they feel nice and soft inside then I'll bite if it feels rock card then I leave it on the on the shelf so at 75 grams of the dark muscovado sugar in here and then mix that in with a wooden spoon they might need to find you need to sort of squash it out the side of the bowl to try and incorporate the sugar into the butter and also if there are any little lumps of the then you can sort of squashing the skates aside as well you're not trying to be air into this mixture as if you'll make a victorious sandwich you're just trying to make the ingredients amalgamates again it's now cream together and you can then add all your other ingredients now in here I've got a mixture of three different grains which I'm going to use in this recipe but as I said before you can change and adapt these to whatever you've got in the food cupboard I've got 75 grams of porridge oats 50 grams of buckwheat flakes and 50 grams of quinoa flakes so you've got 175 grams of flakes or together and that goes into the bowl other extras on the night of this is 50 grams of desiccated coconut and then I've got some seeds which I'm also going through add to this I'm going to add a tablespoon of all of these seeds into here now the advantage of using grains and seeds is it using it in its seed form and it contains lots of nutrients in that seed ready for the plant germinate and grow before it starts to develop leaves and grow roots they can get its own nutrients you know from the soil so if we use seeds in their natural state then we can use all those natural and nutrients that are in the seeds as well so I've had a tablespoon of each of these I've got sunflower seeds pumpkin seeds and golden linseeds I do tend to use organic with the seeds as much as I possibly can and simply because you know the smaller the grain that you're using in the bigger its surface area and the more it absorbs pesticides and herbicides so if you use it in this organic form and you've got you know a much lower density of pesticides that are allowed to be added into the actual plant and then you've got a choice of flavors now I'm going to use some chopped chocolate and some raisins but you could use any dried fruit or nuts in with this as well you want to put a total of about 125 grams or together I've got 50 grams of raisins and 75 grams of chocolate which I've already previously chopped up you can use chopped chocolate chips if you wanted to and but personally I find that lots of the chocolate chips are in the markets aren't always a very good quality chocolate so I tend to avoid those and usually buy you know good quality dark chocolate there's got at least seventy percent to cocoa solids and use that and just chop it up beforehand and then to this I could add two eggs which will help to bind ingredients together and then just mix those in with Orden to it's well mixed together really is as easy as that then what you can then do is find yourself a tin I prefer to line this completely with silicone paper but it makes it much easier to get it out of the team the team uses a shallow one it's about 23 centimeters square be the Jews you know a rectangular one if you wanted to sort as bounce or 20 by 30 to be absolutely fine now to learn it with these silicon paper what you'll need to do is it sister crease it into the bottom and corners take the paper out and just make a diagonal cuts into each corner and then by doing that the paper lives quite neatly in the tin because the edges all fold over each other and then you add the mixture into the team try not to take it another table and then just smooth it down so it goes into the corners don't worry if it's not completely flat because when it gets into the oven then the mixture is going to melt and if I find its own level so once you smooth it down into the tin then that goes into an oven 180 degrees centigrade which is gas mark 4 on a medium shelf not too high in the oven otherwise it'll brown too quickly and it would take somewhere around 20 30 35 minutes if you check it you know round about 25 minutes and see how it's brown in and and then you know it should be a nice golden brown when it comes out of the oven voila", "3u0J3FDBAYQ": "[Music]", "R-xGRea_iFQ": "come on in I'm Shelly good morning I'm Jimmy and today on the show we are gonna be showing you how to make your very own cereal bars just like these a cereal time bang that's a Tuesday exploded right in our face Oh destructive as a shock wave it's got me Oh hope you alright guys that's what happens we Tuesday you never know when it's gonna go off in your face yeah and excited to be here today because we're doing something I can't believe we've not done this before on the show we makin cereal bars we are we've done a bit of kind of like ways to enjoy cereal without milk before we skipped over cereal bars we did I didn't even know you could really make them yourself but apparently you can well I discovered this because I made on my youtube channel youtube.com forward slash zero zero zero one zero and some Cheetos and modeling on the screen do put the link of the food Josh because I'm actually sort of brand identity isn't it I made Cheetos in marshmallow cereal bar tire and never really kind of tasty but they look gross so I discovered that cereal bars quite easy to you to make all you need is marshmallows some cereal and some extra bits so we're gonna have a go uncle Jimmy's chocolate orange cereal bars so what's gonna go into here is some chocolate Coco Pops some orange Easter and of course the marshmallow so Jimmy's orangey stuff well people lift the uncle Jimmy's brand they thought it was trustworthy and appealing just in every way so I thought I'd bring it back to my cereal bar fair enough my foray into the world of cereal bar so we start with a quarter cup of butter in the bowl and then we want you want to melt that first right dyma don't know that fer josh is not in I mean I dove in all the same time but we'll melt the butter first I'm fine I'll give it a bit of a mix just to finish that off there we go don't want to burn your butter so then what we do if you just whack in a bag of marshmallows this is a 10 ounce bag allegedly I really do like my fellows I think marginalize a rubbish I think they're the worst of the sweet world good actually I think I think you're rubbish you don't want to fall out about marshmallows charlie how long do I give this Josh a minute to a minute and a half on your marshmallows use your instincts you just want them to be wet basically greasy bowl of marshmallows lovely okay they're not quite there so I'm gonna give it a little bit longer yeah but you just want to eat all of that right now and they look delicious kind of it reminds me a little bit of an episode of How It's Made that's what chicken nuggets insides that like all good I mean that might be there actually what do you reckon Josh you reckon that looks good all right let's do it then so what I'm going to do so you need eight cups of dry ingredients okay so I'm going to stick in about seven and a half cups of you maybe I think those bags a little light so maybe go for six or seven cups of dry berries six to seven cups of dry ingredients depending on what your Josh says josh is certainly a cereal bar expert doesn't it look lovely could you keep mixing that for me Charlie yes of course don't worry if you crush them up a bit I think that'll be too quite tasty I've got here a chocolate orange so I'm gonna grate in some real-life actual chocolate chocolate oranges are the best link I don't know if you get them in other parts of the world but there are they're a UK classic and the way you open them is by tapping to unwrap so you go maybe on that so long and it should just all fall apart in a beautiful orange e-type fashion it's not worse oh no there we go are you segments this is going to be good I think I'm tempted to give it another couple of seconds in the microwave to melt the chocolate oh now I wish for Carrie's going yeah it's not that a bit crazy okay now we're gonna put some real orange zest in there I'm just gonna have to grate this over the bowl it's like a it's made of spider webs or something Isis really aunt it is I have put some spider webs in there that's the secret ingredient it's quite the workout guys if you wonder in how you get arms like Jimmy all this stirring I think this could we might have to use separate trays actually let's let's have a look do you just you just do what you need to do Jimmy that's not so good yeah it does smell delicious actually oh my word so you can wait for these to set or you could just sort of eat it right now if you wanted to yeah probably be pretty good too you're taking up the whole tree aren't you I'm nervous we might have to do separate trays Charlie I'm really sorry that's fine I think you know put this much effort in we deserve a space it's time okay well maybe Jimmy wants to try his own wager maybe that's part of fun maybe experiment in is why we have done this I mean I am in a massive mess well there we go guys that's the uncle Jimmy's chocolate orange cereal bar so they're gonna go in the fridge now for a little bit and we're gonna try them later on uncle Jimmy's Apple Cinnamon Cheerios bars didn't sanction this recipe I mean if we check if it works then yeah sure or I can come into the umbrella brand I'm a Peter MacKay just that confidence so I've got my Amy butter and Mimi marshmallow mix right here tell us about the back story charlie cuz I like the thought process behind you oh yeah so if you've never been to if you've never been outside of the United Kingdom I think these are just available in her in like in North America I had them in Canada Apple Cinnamon Cheerios undoubtably the best Cheerios you can possibly care don't have them here I'm gonna try and recreate that vibe first by adding some Cheerios which I have here we've got multigrain Oh your seems to be stirring together quite nicely actually thank you I think it's a by virtue of having kinda like a firmer cereal yes maybe you melted your marshmallow slightly more as well maybe who's to say hey maybe em just say look I know maybe I'm just a naturally talented when it comes to Syria but I'm not a cereal bar expert like Josh over there yeah so I'm just gonna grate some Apple directly into this let's go big Oh God see this is the stage where it starts of easy yet really quickly it's already saying oh ya know it would have been good to add in all the dry stuff at once wouldn't let me yeah yeah I've been really smart let's put some cinnamon in right now actually if I'm doing the staring right as well oh sure Oh cinnamon challenge mark to sound like the color that's coming out of that that's that's what chefs talk about all the time I like how that looks with your eyes yeah exactly high is a phrase that people say is it yeah I mean not literally spent figuratively don't try and eat with your eyes guys if you've got a bowl of cereal now don't just be going like that because that's definitely dangerous get them penny with it then and then and then some like that and then just plop in like all the Cheerios I've ended up on there what's that called on the fork the run wrong oh yeah yeah wrong you've ever played a tiny game of Queens with Cheerios laughs with the coins reference in Java what was I supposed to do Josh you doesn't know no spatula stuff well no that would work much better wouldn't it look a look at that perfect that's not ly all right well I'm gonna let that sit and then once it's refrigerated I'm gonna put some icing sugar on it - because I'm fancy well let's get tasting shall we so we're gonna start off with a bit of the old Alpen cereal bar yeah this is a curveball we prepared this earlier obviously Alpen is my favorite cereal so we thought is it cereal bar herbal know if there is an album bar so Josh made this one himself I'm gonna use a fork just because the texture of that is same it's not really a bar so much as like a reset it stays in some sort isn't it let's give it a go obviously health ALPA normally the healthy choice I don't know if it is when it's covered in marshmallow that's all I mm-hmm not good never made my favourite bit I don't even taste Anthony just taste like marshmallow with bits in the margin not always the perspective that ya know fail okay alright we're gonna look at mine next so here we go come out too bad charlie a bit of icing on top okay let's see how way they've set okay not sort of okay I'm gonna give it a 3 out of 5 on the crunch factor mm-hmm okey I'm yeah the cardboard II that's a shame they've been really stale hmm weird mm-hmm all right good tip watch out for using Cheerios there's no crunch there I really like the flavor the cinnamon is coming through I'm not getting much Apple it's very sweet no go I like that I think it's a shame that that one didn't work as well as I was hoping I've spoken to the CEO uncle Jimmy and he says with a bit of development that could work okay you think it could work I'll take it home all right let's have a look at the final one came out right yeah no presentation I think I've tried

cups of miniature with a fattie spoon of vanilla extract put it all into your multi-purpose steamer and put it in the microwave for 90 seconds your marshmallows will look like this but I promise they're ready to go add in six cups of your favorite cereal either leave in the multi-purpose steamer or pour it into a lined pen and allowed to cool cut into bars and you're ready to enjoy the silicone steamer makes it incredibly easy to clean up the mess", "PxQfeZ4A7_c": "hey-yah I'm April McKinney and today I'm gonna be showing you how to make my no-bake peanut butter Otis if you have watched many of my videos or if you've been to my website you will see that I love peanut butter I use it in a lot of recipes I especially love peanut butter and chocolate Reese's Cups anything like that it's my favorite kind of deserved candy delicious love peanut butter and chocolate together but right now I'm just using peanut butter I'm a huge fan like I said and this recipe is so quick it's no bake you know I try to squeeze in workouts and nap times and things like that nowadays and I actually just did one and so I need something quick and easy that I can just grab you know so I can go feed maverick or do whatever I've got to do and this is perfect for that and I'm telling you you can make it in like five minutes it's so easy so let's get started but the first thing I have is some natural peanut butter now this is not the stur kind nothing wrong with the stir cod but you really probably don't want to use it for this recipe because it's a little too runny this is actually a natural Jif peanut butter it's like one of my favorites alright so get that in there next is some honey and the sweetness with honey and I'm gonna add a half cup of it this is my little trick this is what I did with the peanut butter honey you know it's really sticky and so when you measure it out it sticks to the measuring cup so what I like to do is just take some cooking spray and spray it on my little measuring here and then I'll just go ahead and pour in 1/2 cup of honey and you can make these you know if you don't want quite so much honey you don't have to use so much but it's you know it needs quite a bit we're adding a lot of oats to this I'm using peanut butter that doesn't have you know added sugar in it so this is the only way this is going to get sweet and I'm telling you kids are going to just go crazy over these bars and they're gonna be good for them so it's great alright so I've got my honey in there's some space here and the next thing I'm going to be using is some coconut oil and I'm using two tables of coconut oil you can just get this with a regular grocery store where the other oils are if you don't have coconut oil or you don't want to use coconut oil you could use butter or you could use some type of canola oil you know any kind of oil worked we're just needing something to kind of give this some moistness but coconut oils really good for you so I would recommend getting some and you can use it to cook with and it's really good in place of butter if you're trying to cut out butter in a lot of recipes so give coconut oil a try alright let's put the top of my honey here and you can add salt the peanut butter that I use that natural Jeff it actually has some salt already in it so I'm not going to have any but if you're using just a completely you know organic all-natural all it has is peanut butter in it peanut butter then you can add you know a couple pinches of salt because it really brings out that sweetness what I'm going to do now is I'm just gonna pop this in the microwave for about 30 seconds to a minute just until the coconut oil melts and we can just kind of mix it together here we go this is the cooking part of this recipe alrighty so it is done and I put it in there for like I said about a minute and you can see it's sort of loosened up all that honey and everything is just melted together with the peanut butter so I'm just going to stir this a little bit perfect consistency YUM you could just eat that by the spoonful in that I'm gonna fit in my toilet these are old fashioned oats I'm using 3 and a half cups some but you can go ahead and get these in here and just stir it all together until all those are nice and did okay you are almost done with this I've got to start up really well all the oats are coated in the peanut butter goodness so what I'm gonna do this show them that I could not make something with peanut butter then it's like an oat bar type thing without adding something mix in I was kind of just do dried cranberries for this but I didn't have a full third of a cup so I added some chocolate chips and I've got some semi-sweet chocolate chips in here use dark chocolate chips and that's going to be better for you than using like a milk chocolate less sugar it's the darker the better for this and so I'm just gonna stir in a third of a cup of mixed in so I'm using a combo of dried cranberries and chocolate chips you could use all cranberries you could use raisins you can do just chocolate chips whatever you want to do or you could do no mix-ins at all if you don't have the ingredients in anything extra don't worry about it just just do the peanut butter in the oats and you'll be good to go nice and stirred up so you're going to get a little bit of the chewiness or chocolate enos and every bite all right if I have here a 9-inch dish and what I've done is just lined it with some regular aluminum foil and you just want to press it in and this way we're not gonna dirty up this dish and we can just pull this out and then cut up the bar so it just makes it really easy and I'm all about easier right now so what I'm gonna do is just put my oat mixture right into the dish there all right now if you're using chocolate chips and you put them in like I did it right after it's come out of the microwave then you melt a little bit which I'm totally fine with it just means a little bit of melted chocolate going through out your bars which hey I don't know any that would complain about that so now I'm gonna do is just press this in and you really want to press it in pretty well what I like to do with this kind of thing when it's kind of sticky like this and everything off the spatula is I actually just put my fingers under the some water some cold water so I just did that and it makes it easy it makes it not stick to your hand so much just want to get it really nice and compact in this dish all right so I've got this really nice and pressed down here so what I'm going to do it's still kind of warm so if I tried to cut them now they may not stick together really well I'm gonna pop it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes and it's gonna chill then I'll show you what they look like they're so good doesn't leave me licking my fingers here peanut butter chocolate hose my favorite snacks okay so the oat bars have had time to chill for a little bit and they are ready to be cut into squares so this is really cool just this is why I do this why I didn't get an aluminum foil thing people like I do is just pull it right out and didn't even dirty up this dish so that's really convenient so now let's just cut it into squares no way to try it you'll see how easily this cuts up and perfect and you can see how well they stay together here just like so easy I mean literally this took I mean no time to make and they stick together so it's just like the easiest you know levar you've ever made in your life tons of protein tons of fiber like I said great pre-workout post-workout snack and for me with breast feeding right now I'm hungry a lot so I need things like this that I can grab that are gonna be good for me and satisfying and that's exactly what this is so I hope you give these a try make sure to check out on my website if we're making any comment if you like this recipe you want to see more videos you just click on my face right

one of these before so I'm gonna try this out hopefully everything works out the way I have it in my head so let's get right into the video guys without further ado today is going to be actually a edible review so I'm not personally me myself I'm not a huge edible fan just because of how long the effects last how long they take to come on and a bunch of other factors just doesn't really make me a fan of it me personally when I like to use cannabis I like to know when I'm gonna be high for how long I'm gonna be high and you know I can plan my day around that with edibles it's kind of like once you take the edible and once it's in full effect you're kind of just basically useless as a person that's how you know heavy the effects are for metals for me personally I mean I'm speaking from my point of view everyone has a different tolerance everyone has different experiences so that's why I don't eat or use edibles that much but today's review is going to be hopefully you guys can see that on camera they're one of these shatter bars and this one is 250 milligrams of THC hopefully you guys can read that information hopefully it's focused hopefully the camera is focusing but yeah so this is a vegan shatter bar because that's the only one they had left so I just bought that one this one's two hundred and fifty milligrams of THC ten point four milligrams per square so when you open this up I'll show you guys it it's divided into little squares this one is sugar-free dark choc this one is an indica so they actually have a sativa and an indica bar I'm not sure how that affects I might have to try this a tea go on and see the difference but I've actually tried this one before and I know how it affects me so I roughly know what's gonna happen after I eat this but yeah this one is purple kush and there is 24 pieces in this bar so hopefully you guys can see that hopefully you guys can read that but yeah without further ado I'll just read like the ingredients here unsweetened chocolate sweetener cocoa butter soy lecithin natural vanilla flavor and yeah that's basically it it gives you the nutritional value here on the back it says that there is a lab test result so for the THC percentage it is 60 7.5% the THC a is zero point zero eighty percent THC V is a hunt one point twenty percent the CBN is zero point four hundred and fifty percent the CBD is zero point one thirty five percent the CBC is one point sixteen percent and the CBG is one point ninety two percent so I'll show you guys that there it's just on the back hopefully you guys can see that oh yeah let's get right into this review I'm gonna open this bad boy up show you guys what we're dealing in here and as I'm opening this up and showing you guys a lot of people might not be familiar with edibles or how they work and how they affect you I'll give you a brief rundown on how they work basically so what you have to do in order to make edibles is you have to use obviously cannabis or cannabis derived product like shatter I believe actually that's what they use to make these is they actually use shatter from purple kush or whatever it is to make the bar so you'd have to use shatter hash Keef something with a lot of cannabinoids in it obviously and what you have to do is decarboxylate the cannabis product whatever you're using the bud you know how shatter or whatever you're gonna be using you have to decarboxylate it now I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the actual science and how this stuff works but if you are interested just type in deep decarboxylation on google and it will give you a description on what it is exactly doing it has something to do with removing a carbon atom from the molecules or something along those lines I don't want to butcher the sign so I'm not gonna try and explain it but so basically you have to decarboxylate your cannabis make the edibles and what happens is it's it's different than smoking in the sense of when you smoke cannabis the witch is your smoking the THC the CBD and all the cannabinoids obviously so the THC which is known as Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is present in the plant so when you smoke that the Delta 9 THC or Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol gets absorbed into the lungs then it goes into your bloodstream and then it gets processed that way and when you smoke obviously the effects come on immediately after the thing with edibles is once you eat the Delta 9 THC when your body starts to obviously break down the food and process it and digest it it turns that Delta 9 THC into 11 hydroxy THC or 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol so if you didn't know that it actually turns THC into a totally different compound which is why edibles lasts so long and is why like their effects are very very potent so I just want to give you guys that little bit of information if you weren't aware of that and yeah I'll show you guys the bar so this is like the little wrapping that it kind of comes in here I guess that's like their little logo or whatever whatever that means I don't even know what it says but yeah so and here she is there is the chocolate bar that we're dealing with so each square is ten point four milligrams of THC the entire bar is 250 milligrams of THC so now I was thinking about this before the video but I'll just say it to you guys as well I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the entire bar or if I wanted to eat half of it I mean it wouldn't really be an edible review if you only ate half because then you're not really getting the full effects so I'm just gonna leave this camera recording I'm gonna start eating this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour and hour and a half and I will tell you guys how I'm feeling how the effects are how actually I'm gonna start eating it now and I'll tell you how it tastes as well just cuz just kind of giving you an overall review of the product itself because some edibles taste like complete [ __ ] but then the effects are amazing and then some people make like really gourmet edibles that taste amazing and also the effects are there as well so I'm gonna try it now or shut up so there's one little square I know it's chocolate you kind of technically should be sucking on it and letting it melt in your mouth but I'm impatient it's actually a really good holy [ __ ] for being a vegan chocolate bar Wow I know I'm not really a big sweets person I'm not really a big chocolate person either but this tastes really good I mean it you can taste the slight cannabis taste in the background but overall this is like wow really surprised really good job what does the company euphoria extractions really really good job definitely a really good tasting chocolate bar so alright guys so without further ado I'm gonna finish this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour an hour and a half and give you guys the effects and how I'm feeling so enjoy the rest of the video guys peace [Music] so so far so good I mean I'll give you a little bit of information so I got the Edible from a local dispensary here in Toronto and it was about I think $26 for that chocolate bar kind of pricey I mean you have to pay taxes and whatnot which is whatever I mean you got to do what you got to do right the government has to get a cut always so yeah two hundred and fifty milligrams bar $26 I mean the chocolate bar itself tasted amazing tasted like a regular like dark chocolate bar really good taste you could taste the cannabis like on the back end and yeah that's all I can really say is if right now really good experience so far and like I said I'll come back in an hour now in half and let you guys know how I'm feeling so hopefully you guys have been enjoying this video I know it's a little bit different than what I normally post but I know there are edible users out there I know people might want to see these types of videos so I said why not make this video right oh yeah like I said I will see you guys soon and enjoy the rest of the video peace guys hey what up guys I'm back and we're gonna talk about the effects and how I'm feeling after taking that edible that I was talking about earlier so it's been about an hour an hour and a half no I don't even know I haven't even checked the time but I know it's for sure it's been an hour so I'm feeling pretty much the full effects already and holy [ __ ] it is definitely some phone stuff it's just a typical indica high I mean you're just couch locked you're sedated your pain with a lot of pain relieving properties a lot of body effects relaxation no depression no anxiety and yeah you're just having munchies you feel tired you could definitely fall asleep no problem but it is definitely some pown stuff and it will definitely last a long time so that is also a plus if you're looking for long lasting effects for like medical patients as well so yeah I mean that's basically all I can really say about it it isn't edible it's not like it really has like a taste or like you know any other smells and stuff like that it's basically just a chocolate bar so my overall rating I guess for this edible out of five I would definitely say it's a high quality edible I would give it a solid four to five and definitely recommend it if you live in Toronto and you're looking for edibles like that's definitely a good company to go with I would say so yeah that's been an edible review by I'm always blazing the 250 milligram euphoria extractions vegan chocolate bar so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like comment

rice krispies with this milky whatever white properly stuff solidified milk on the bottom here we go I think I prefer these two there Coco Pops ones again the solidified milky stuff blends into the rest of the bath quite nicely it's not too bad the textures really nice crispy slightly chewy from whatever they used to hold together the cereal and yeah the Rice Krispies themselves are sweet

for st. Patrick's Day today we're going to be making cereal bar treats using Lucky Charms and I thought it would just be the perfect opportunity to use one of my favorite cereals in a cereal bar because almost st. Patrick's Day today we're going to do a very simple recipe you've got three ingredients plus some if you wish and that's about it so we're gonna get started I'm still here I have a I call it a stuck pot or saucepan you're gonna put a saucepan on the stove you want one to be deep enough to put all your ingredients in but it doesn't have to be massive you're gonna put it on the burner and turn it on to medium about medium heat next you're gonna take I have three tablespoons of shortening you can also use real butter you can use margarine or anything a butter substitute three tablespoons of shortening we're gonna let that melt and then once it starts fully melting then we will add in our marshmallows okay now that our shortening has melted I'm gonna go ahead and add in two and a half cups of marshmallows I just use playing jet puff marshmallows I like to sit to name brand because I feel like jet puff tastes much better than store-bought so I'm gonna go ahead and stir that in and allow it to melt completely before I add in the cereal okay now that the marshmallows have melted I'm going to go ahead and turn off the heat and I'm gonna add in five cups of cereal so what's great about this recipe is that you can add any kind of cereal or things I say in honor of lucky himself I'm going to be adding I'm gonna just make this up with a silicon spatula until it's well combined now that everything's that all mixed up I'm going I've prepped a nine by nine glass dish and sprayed it with cooking spray and I'm gonna go ahead and pour in just enough I'm gonna see how deep this gets I don't have a nine by thirteen but I think that would make a pretty thin stereo bar this one's probably gonna make it pretty thick cereal bar like height-wise actually yeah and what you want to do is you want to press it in don't press too hard you don't want this to be super compact otherwise people can't eat it but I'm gonna take the back of my spatula and it's pretty oily from the shortening and I'm going to just press into all right well these are setting up and what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna melt some white chocolate what I have here is a small saucepan full of water and a glass bowl full of white chocolate chips and you want to fill up the stockpot to have enough water to boil well but you don't want the water touching the bowl so I'm gonna put this on medium-high and will not allow this to start boiling and melting the chocolate okay what I have here is a bowl of melted white chocolate and it has been boiling for just a little bit as you can see the steam coming off of it I've gone ahead and turn off the burner because I don't want this to burn burnt my chocolate is the worst so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take this spoon and I'm gonna drizzle this white chocolate over the top of my cereal bars and this could get messy another option is to cut the bars and then dip them in chocolate but I feel like that might be just too much for me so I'm just drizzling the melted chocolate in a crisscross pattern now that I have all the white chocolate drizzle on top I'm actually going to take a mixture of sprinkles most of these are gold sprinkles that you can buy at Michels and probably Hobby Lobby found these sprinkles in the like single serving packs at Michael's I think they're like a dollar for a packet of sprinkles and I thought the gold sequins and star sequins would fit perfectly because of st. Patrick's Day so I'm going to sprinkle these on top you can sprinkle any kind of sprinkle you would like I have used st. Patrick's Day with ones before that have little clovers in them but I thought this would be really cute alright now that we have all of the sprinkles on top that I'd like I'm going to leave these set for a little bit so the chocolate dries will be lagging a little bit I'll cut them up into bars and present them to you okay guys my stereo bars have set and the white chocolate has set so I'm gonna just cut these up into pretty small slices and I'm using a relatively short knife and just [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "ZpivbBoeyL8": "[Music] Sara color cafe we don't just

baby you you hi guys and welcome to food review UK today I am reviewing Coco Pops snack bar sit their six in the pack cereal bar basically cocoa pod so it has like this milky stuff on the algae says chocolate toasted rice cereal and milk bar so it does claim that the bottom this bottom level is milk I would call it somewhere between milk and chocolate it's a solidified sweet milky consistency on the bottom I feel I should probably mention the white stuff on my face which may have noticed it is cream I suppose you'd call it for dry skin so I hope that doesn't put you off this video and I'm going to eat a Coco Pops bar ha there seems to be a clunk of truffle on there do you see that not so fast normal is that what they used to stick it together here we go umm the the milk stuff on the button on the bun on the bottom goes really well because when you're eating it it all blends in and it does create like a milky mouthing come passing feel as nice also helps offset the quite intense Ricci sweetness of the Coco Pops with our nice textured really good quite crispy and the text of the milk is good yeah flavor-wise it's okay ah Oh inside necessarily chooses product ever but it's perfectly nice I just wouldn't rate it super highly I'll give her very very high two stars where he's decent but just just not my thing thanks a lot for watching guys subscribe for more videos", "1gH8M_OdQCA": "hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm today we're going to make chocolate rice krispie treats and this is what they look like now this is just your regular rice krispies treat that we all love only we're going to add three different types of chocolate so the first thing we need to do is to prepare our pan I'm using a 9 by 13 inch pan which is 23 by 33 centimeters and you could just spray it with one of those nonstick sprays I'm going to brush my pan with just a little bit of melted butter or you could even brush your pan with like a flavorless oil whatever way you want to do it because if you've ever made rice krispies treats you know it's very sticky so that's why you want to make sure Japan prepared well and now so um what the first thing you need to do is get a large bowl I did just spray my the inside of my bowl with with a nonstick spray again you could use a little melted butter or a flavorless oil and what I put here is six cups which is 150 grams of rice krispies cereal or some type cereal like that different brands and now what we're going to do is you'll need about a medium sized saucepan again I'm going to spray that and I'm actually even going to spray my spatula because everything's sticky here and first thing you need is five tablespoons which is 70 grams butter now here you could use salted or unsalted butter and I've just kind of cut it up a little bit so it will melt faster and I'm just going to turn my heat on to medium and I'm just going to let that mount hey Soren butter has melted and have your heat medium medium-low you don't want it too hot here and I'm just going to add two ounces which is 60 grams of like a semi-sweet chocolate or you could use a bittersweet chocolate and I just cut it into small pieces and let that melt watch your heat and then I'm also going to add my second type of chocolate I'm going to add two tablespoons 15 grams off an unsweetened cocoa powder you could use a regular unsweetened or you could use a dutch process which whichever type you have in the house or what you like and then because I used unsalted butter I'm going to have just a pinch but an eighth of a teaspoon of salt if you use salted butter then you just leave that out and now what we're going to add is 1 10 ounce bag which is what's that book 285 grams yes 285 grams of mid I use some miniature marshmallows make sure as you can see here I'm really stirring this what the marshmallows to melt now um you I use the miniature you could use the the large ones or I mean really you could use 10 ounces 285 grams of homemade marshmallows if you have that in your house if you're buying a bag of marshmallows and I found this out the hard way when I was testing this recipe really check the expiry date when you're buying marshmallows you want fresh ones because if they're not fresh they really don't melt as easily and I find the whole mixture isn't quite as smooth as when you have nice fresh soft ones so just keep that in mind always check your bag for that when you're buying them so what I'm doing here I want to make sure nothing sticks nothing burns so as they melt just keep stirring until it's all all your marshmallows are melted okay so we are errands all melted and smooth as you can see and all I smell is chocolate in here and so I'm going to add just for flavoring about 1 teaspoon 4 grams of pure vanilla extract I mean you don't have to if you don't want that too little kind of bit of vanilla flavor so just give that a good stir oh so now I'm just going to pour that over the top I love making these so easy and they're so good everybody loves them and you're you're done in like 10 minutes we all need these kind of recipes so we can just whip them up so now what we're going to do is just coat all of our rice krispies and our chocolate mixture I find these ones because of the I guess comes the chocolate I find the mixture not quite as sticky to work with as the regular rice krispies treats which by the way if you want to make those of course we have a recipe as and a video on the joy baking website if you want to do that so now at this point I'm going to add because we miss our third chocolate I'm going to add a half a cup 85 grams of semi-sweet chocolate chips you could use bittersweet use milk you could even use white chocolate chips or whatever or if you don't want that little crunch of chocolate chips you could just leave them out or some people like to sprinkle the chocolate chips over the top once you put them in the pan so that's another option but I like mine great in there sure you get to the bottom some chocolate gets stuck down there turn it hey looks good okay now I used a 9 by 13 I like mine thin I like to cut really big squares and I like them nice and thin you could use just if you want them thick you could use like a 9 inch square 23 centimeter square baking pans some people like to do that so if you don't have this size pan don't think oh I can't make these yes you can I'm going to use my hand these aren't too hot so I'm just going to press them in here and we are done isn't that great now at this point they are a little soft and sticky these ones I made the other day and they are you know they're you can see they're really quite firm this is quite this mixture is quite soft some people love it this way my kids always like the rice krispies treats as soon as I made them so I prefer to let this sit for maybe an hour to firm up and they get a little more crunchy not as soft and chewy either way but in so I'm going to eat one now which so you can see they're quite soft sticky and good here I know where they here nice and crispy soft chewy it is just like a rice crispy the regular one you have that nice marshmallow flavor but I really like the addition of all those types of chocolate if you're a chocolate lover which so try these and until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm you", "_yAbpaIqiSM":

baking sheet you want to make an even layer next we're going to toast the cereal in a 300 degree oven for about 15 minutes you'll want to cool the toasted cereal completely before moving on to the next step you'll need a large pitcher pour in toasted corn flakes into the pitcher add in two tablespoons of brown sugar 1/4 teaspoon of salt then I'm going to take three and a half cups of cold whole milk and pour it in and then you want to stir this really well I'm going to let this steep for about 20 minutes the cornflakes will get all soggy and the milk will absorb all of the flavor once it's super soggy pour it through a fine-mesh sieve get all that cereal out you can press down on it with the back of your spoon because it does it's like a sponge and it just soak up some the milks you want to get all that milk out and then I'm going to pour this into another container to serve and that's it you can store this in a queen pitcher for about a week you can use it to make your own

in the United States which is so weird because we have Trix cereal and we have frosted flakes and we have cocoa puffs and that we have these cereals but we don't have these bars so that's totally weird so which one do you all want to try first we have wheat toast Frosty's bars cocoa puffs Bar tricks bar and a Kellogg's crunchy nut bar Thank You Vic how about the crunchy neck yeah Andrew says the Kellogg's crunchy nut bar I do not remember how much these cost the whole bar is 170 calories see if it's a chocolate and peanut you're on the food supply wars this is a chocolate and peanut more like him I'm not sure about it it looks really good anyhow I didn't fall apart or anything it just kind of looks all to the end that looks like a rosters okay take your pick yeah complan then you get some plain old peanuts mm a little bit of chocolate duck I don't mind it it wasn't bad the glaze is just this sweetness mm-hmm it's just wow it's not bad it's kind of bland I didn't know that at all I would eat that I don't packing peanuts I don't want another biomedis they are salty packing females there are other bars I would rather have for breakfast but if somebody picked that out for me then I would eat it I don't think there's anything wrong with it really you're tasting a lot of them it's like a rice krispie treat it's playing like that with some plain peanuts there's no way what well this is the wheat toast and it's made with real milk chocolate and it says 145 K Cups that's running right that's for honorariums it says it's a chocolate flavor to wheat hoop bar with a milk chocolate base you say poop it looks like chocolate rice krispies treats I see the hooves and they're they're like Cheerios they're calling on hoops they're like chocolate Cheerios actually I was how about dogs better nice wheel I don't like the chewiness and the Cyril do like the playground that's good I still like the marcelin though because I like the peanut flavor the first thing had a peanut flavor to make I think it's very very dry and I really don't like that chocolate flavor how about which one do you want right next just a little blame frost thanks Frosty's it is a hundred three calories know about it all it says toasted maize cereal and milk ball I wonder if they're great it looks good that it is it looks like two cereal it looks like frosted flakes that have cereal bars you remember them having cereal with a milk coating on the bottle milk always tastes a little strange that tastes like stale soggy sweetheart I like this my favorite so far Roy I actually like that ten it tastes just like frosted voice I like that that's very end that's a very good ball a lot of the texture I could eat one of those for breakfast okay that's a honey yes it's very good I'm gonna I'm gonna cause a picture of all these and I can't believe and you won't believe we don't get these in the United States that so what what bars doing in here but I follows the cheerio bar there's another bar that I love by fruit three petals yeah there's another one say though but I that out by all the time many grams turn the grant process or arms these are Coco Pops this is only 84 calories for this tubna pop it is chocolate flavor toasted rice cereal and milk bar so that's all you want this okay Russ crispy yummy let's see if they'll just winner then we drove we chose a toast No no it's not it sounds like that process of white one the other I don't mama it's a little wider it's not as drop the note on a chocolate is a wee bit better but still overall I mean I like I like that one I like the cocoa pop better than the wheat toast yeah that's what I'm saying yeah better than the we do stuff Oh or wait I don't I don't know do you think the windows has been of the burritos is no better chocolate oh this is the trick zero bar and it is a lot bigger than all the other ones it's 150 calories it it is a big bar and it just says it's a tricks serovar that's a Christmas tree oh it smells really good very colorful it's a very pretty bar which I think your kids would see that and probably go for it there's like oats in here some cereal it looks like some like big hunks of hold of cereal pieces where as bars here don't have those big hunks of of cereal one of them that's awful can taste verse tell you it's like a lemon got a funky lemon and it takes it's very uh get you up that trick taste which I never like tricks anyone and of troops definitely taste like they're very artificial yeah thank you for NOLA to hold it all together cause that's your yeah it's pretty bad it's pretty bad I don't like oh never to you here it's don't deserve it it's pretty to look at but yeah I don't like that the free coat ones there's a lot yeah yeah well we're so here I'm cinnamon toast crunch is one than a lie in the gram building great gold Renaissance for the only one I would give the time of day that of everyone I'm here rusty the frosty laughter I hate it at the right nose I sit down with us - yeah the Frosty's and then I like the cocoa puffs oh yeah I like that one - I like the reggienet but I would not buy the tricks or the windows again so I hope you all enjoyed getting to see they get to hear about them I will show you the picture at the end of them on the plate I'm just I still don't think it's weird that they doubt it's all in the United States because they can take all kinds of cereals that we can hear you know when they make this new finding nori cereal they can have finding Dory bars you don't know that cereal I'm shocked that they have it yet I really am i made a Captain America cereal they should have a Captain America bar because they would sell so in an in England right now the big thing over there are flapjacks we don't get black here they are a OD breakfast type bar this they're fantastic but they call on flapjacks they could put these cereals and all of those they people with love them over here I'm just shocked that they have it but anyway I hope you enjoyed the review helped you hopefully if you see these you'll know now which ones to avoid definitely avoid the tricks we all threw around that and thanks for watching", "-0KgBi8K_7w": "I'm

making protein bars you're really healthy easy do you need a few for you okay and they're delicious and a great way to get protein vegetarian protein especially so to start I'm going to take whole oats not quick-cooking oats these are whole oats and I'm gonna put them in the food processor just for 20 seconds or a toe they're too fine finely ground and now I'm gonna take them out there's only a few ingredients um but yeah we want to make sure they're done perfectly now I should take us back and Kenny can I tell you something what I was doing earlier this morning was soaking these nuts a cup

like that I like how you made that sort of deconstructed mixture and what I'm going to do is take a few seconds and stir this all up till everything is totally combined all right so now I've mixed up the mixture I'm just gonna place it on this so Pat this is you could use this is a special sheet that goes with the dehydrator and but you could also put it on a Silpat and bake it at 200 degrees for about 4 hours because what we're trying to do with this is bake it but not so much that it's truly baked it's not gonna become hard it's just like a protein bar nice and soft what blender okay hold on

things and Hannah had told me that the waffle bar was awesome so I'm going to try it and also picked out the cinnamon roll and the chocolate one as well listen how these are and eat the awful one right here in the car the waffle has 110 calories it provides 12 grams of protein 8% of the calcium 4 percent of the iron keep it open there cool sorry open this thing up see with a lift like given his hands correct Hannah said it had a different texture than what we're normally used to if it's a little bit crunch oh how pretty it has a little bit of frosting on top she's correct to feel a break because probably do this faster than I can get my knife out and cut it for you so there's the inside the waffle flavored quest bar and I will report back on how it tastes mmm it smells wonderful I'm having that on my errands I ate the quest awful flavor cereal bar on the way home it was way better than I thought it was going to be I was really expecting it to be just a really sweet sticky or difficulty in the car but it was not it has a texture of a rice krispy board that better it's not as rough as a rice krispies boria's it's a little more finely textures that which is really great the flavor is a waffle flavor with a little bit of maple flavor in it but it's not overly sweet this is a great bar to eat in the car it didn't get all over everything it didn't fall apart it didn't melt as some of them the parts that I've tested into eating in the car it's a great trouble bar great flavor I'm a fan and I don't really watch that much good Hanna was right this thing is awesome here's the beyond cereal protein bar my quest the thermal oil flavor is the hydrogen tank calories gluten-free 2 grams of net carbs and grams of fiber and program per person if you can still shop for the nutritional value this is a the bar is very attractive has a great smell so if I can snap it in to show you what the inside looks like here's the inside looks very similar to the to the waffle one and texture I'll try it in the port back create the quiz the on stereo protein bars chocolate flavor has 110 calories it's gluten free 50 grams of net carbs 7 grams of fiber programs protein and it's like the chocolate flavor it's also tracked it like the other ones or it has not as strong of a sin just the waffle and the cinnamon it looks like it's going to be the same texture and get those as a map for you kind of attractive see what it tastes like my final take on the flavors the waffle flavor was great I loved everything about it the texture on all of them was excellent the stickiness with excellent you can eat these bars in the car then I got a stick to your fingers or get droppings all over you at the place the waffle flavor was great the cinnamon oil flavor was good the chocolate flavor I was not that big of a fan of it was more of a dry dusty dark chocolate tart flavor I guess and I can get a better chocolate flavor and other items than this regarding the nutritional labeling they're all very similar I'll have 110 calories I'll have 40 calories from fat I'll provide 12 grams of protein I'll provide eight percent of the RDA for calcium and the waffle and seminole provide fork set of the RDA for iron and the chocolate provides ten percent typically things with chocolate are going to find a little bit more iron that goes with any other than chocolate in it thank you for

some brand new some not so new breakfast cereal bars here three of them i've tried the rest i haven't tried and i'm very excited to try every single one of them and see which one comes out on top number one let's get to it rice krispies cookies and cream squares well okay here's the bar a lot of cookie bits and pieces on top and a white cream base at the bottom oh this smells so good it smells of white uh sweet cream why do you say white it smells of sweet cream smells really [Music] good it's very sweet definitely on the chewy side has a great cream flavor and those cookie bits and pieces do have flavor and they look you can have it has a really good cookies and cream flavor to it i'm gonna put it um towards the very beginning of the line right here so that's two thumbs up presidents choice dipped and chewy s'mores bars here's the bar nothing much to see there's the inside of the bar there's some bits and pieces in there that's the granola it smells like sweet cream and that's a really good scent it's very chocolatey in flavor i'm not sure if i get any s'mores though s'mores supposed to have marshmallows marshmallows are typically vanilla flavored not really getting that it's very sweet really chocolaty for now i'm going to put it somewhere in the middle because i didn't really taste marshmallows and really s'mores i'm going to give it two thumbs sideways golden grams treats s'mores bars here's the bar filled with chocolate and marshmallow bits and pieces on top and chocolate covered at the bottom it smells like sweetened chocolatey graham crackers i get a lot of sweet chocolate graham cracker flavor with a hint of vanilla so i'm gonna switch places with uh the president's choice bar here put this one to second for now golden graham's extremely sweet but tasty two thumbs up tim horton's double chocolate covered granola bar here it is very simple nothing to see here's the inside of it you can kind of sort of see the granola bits and pieces it smells like tea leaves and a lot of cocoa it also tastes like sea leaves and a lot of cocoa very chewy it's not too chewy even for a granola bar i'm gonna leave it towards the end of the line right now giving this one two thumbs sideways it's the reese's puffs bar or in canada grease puffs bar here's the bar really quickly you can see the peanut butter and the chocolate on top it smells of a lot of peanut butter and some chocolate the perfect amount of peanut butter flavor half an amount of chocolate flavor perfect amount of chewiness i'm kind of hesitant about this i know definitely definitely i want to put it above golden grams not sure if i'm gonna put it above the rice krispies cookies and cream or not but for now i'm gonna leave it second place tim horton's salted caramel chewy granola bar here's the bar literally falling apart as we speak you can see the salted caramel drizzle on it it smells very sweet and of caramel it tastes very sweet i do taste the salted caramel which is good it's very dry and too chewy i'm gonna leave it second to last for now it was definitely better than the double chocolate covered tim hortons granola bar in terms of the flavor and the texture rice krispies birthday cake squares here's the bar at the top a lot of beautiful colorful confetti pieces and white cream at the bottom has the perfect birthday cake scent to it smells very sweet and creamy wow it's subtle but it's really good tastes just like birthday cake i'm gonna have to think about this a little bit and see where i'm gonna place this and who's gonna be first all right from seventh place to fourth place let's take a quick look again it's the devil chocolate covered tim hortons granola bar at seventh place it's the salted caramel tim hortons granola bar at sixth place it's the president's choice dipped and chewy s'mores bar at fifth place and it's the golden graham treats s'mores bar at fourth place third place goes to the reese puffs bars second place goes to the

do that so many times before the feds would be after you okay breathing that's true that would build prove anything but now I think that one would be cold so I'm sorry that we couldn't see our little Charlie no I gotta know where they've been the mix of marshal all that kind of God wish you what do you think of the flight they're good they're reminds me of a rice krispies treats if the cereals not rocks pursues it's just a different serial button you really don't get this strong like a marshmallow flavor but it's but yeah I agree it really is just like a rice grapefruit so if you've seen these in the store they're very sweet I think it's right snack for uh for only a hundred calories and I still like the golden brown ones better but yeah the golden gram bars are made by General Mills as well so all of those you get the Golden Grahams you get cinnamon toast crunch and those are awesome - I love those and they have these so usually I know a narwhal mark there on the very bottom shelf so I think a hundred calories great afternoon snack or something like that so thank you to Mitch Mitch force in disease I'm gonna have a picture for the end you're not going to be able to see the details like we said I hope you enjoyed it anyway and thanks for watching [Music]", "bhLfd9vG2_8": "what's teaching my friends today we are joined with Adriana and Claire we are back again taste testing and as you can see from the title when you're doing cereal bars uh-oh let's get these out here and here are the bars pink and strawberry which one all right and why did we choose blueberry are you talking about this earlier okay I've had like the nutrigrain brand is it new to thank you as a try she's a really good really all right so these are superior nutrigrain bars alright blueberry it is why do I write these per like better new to be my eyes the texture is really good I like the crunchy into like the soft like it just feels a bit on the mouth wow those are good it looks about the same except for it filling inside wow this is really good flavor that's just an apple yeah literally tastes like an apple pie in a bar form and a low fat but it tastes like an apple pie yeah oh all right we're gonna warm that all these big yeah warming them up or they may put like a scoop of ice cream on top if you like apple pie ice cream jump the walnuts chopped up kami almonds with a little caramel drizzle sprinkle of like butterscotch yeah this is for sure they knock off big name it'd be like a boozy or finger I like things I've had a couple of things if you guys want to know did you know that Higuera means fake so McGarrett Street is actually a street these taste like like the classic fig bar except a little bit softer and better in terms of taste yeah because I feel like the fig bars are too hard kind of chewy the thing bars have a lot of like breading and they really just melt in your mouth like I feel butter on a hot stove top all right next one strawberry I feel like this is the classic the og oh that's delightful on their face but I'm not gonna lie it's a pretty strong a very sweet yeah very sweet dude I think apples my favorite too but it depends on how I'm feeling if I'm feeling something sweet and I have a big sweet tooth strawberry it's gonna be top a little dish for sure say apple pie blueberry strawberry big big depends on how I feel it could be second to permanent toaster microwave they're really bursting from the steam so they're very Apple okay robbery Oh even blueberry he's like blueberry crumble it's very for the oven I think it increased it by like on stay like 1.3 you know the level of tastiness it's just like an extra added factor of melt enos in the mouth all right I'm really excited for this one I don't know what else to say this your home they're like too good you know there's like no bad flavors you can't really go wrong it's like pizza actually yeah all right I did not like pizza I trying to think of something that's like gonna be good thick is it interesting yeah I feel like maybe not as good for the pig yeah I get my medical see something maybe like brownies like brownies they're gonna taste good regardless he did strawberry I felt like blueberry tasted the best hi yeah Apple - yeah have you had the empanadas from talked about and I asked the lady at the front to give me everything I do pretty salty - if I did that yeah like they tried to stall me my friends try to stop me but I was I mean it's her birthday that's a good story though I'd say that's the way that well if you're ever going to talk about and like something that is gonna clog up your arteries definitely everything on the menu plus they're so good it's literally just like caramel apples sugar cinnamon like apple pie yeah in case in a in a deep-fried flaky pastry things so those are consensus on the bars and they're only $1.99 for six bars that's pretty valued thank you three cents per bar about so I guess by mom but if you only buy one probably Apple blueberry you really like blueberry or strawberry if you really extravagant bargaining if you really like alright thanks for watching we'll catch you at the next video today we'll probably do another bar video or whatever says of a latke so and yeah let's get these out here", "ataz2WplCAk": "I'm looking cool charlie thank hey what you got there same thing is you only different milk and cereal bars from General Mills you've got the milk in there I got milk in here it's like you need it on the run the nutrition of real milk and cereal like honey nut cheerios and a great tasting bar because if I had time I have a whole cereal with you he just did milk and cereal bars everything but the mole", "gTzkc8hByXU": "granola bars are portable convenient snack on the go but unfortunately most of the bars on store shelves have more sugar than protein or fiber the downside these bars won't keep you feeling full for long at all that's why I'm loving snack wells cereal bars they have just 140 calories and they're one of the few granola bars that actually have more protein than sugar plus they have three grams of belly filling fiber and if they look familiar that's because they're actually the old South Beach protein fit bars they're just made by snack wells now but they have pretty much the exact same ingredients the same nutritional stats careful though just because this snack wells product is nutritious doesn't mean the rest of their line is so good for you so if you're counting on a snack while snack to satisfy you to your next meal just go for their cereal bars which for now are available and peanut butter and cinnamon raisin the next time you're shopping at rouses remember to look for the choose healthy logo to help you identify your best bets

and welcome to your sugar and spice my name is melissa randall from baking with melissa and today we are making condensed milk bar cookies what you're gonna do is start off with one stick of butter and place it into your bowl next we're gonna put approximately one-and-a-half cups of crushed graham crackers you can put in another half a cup in there if you want place it into the bowl and then you're gonna mush the graham crackers and the butter together and now I have my butter and graham crackers all mixed up together now I'm going to place this mixture in nine by 13 pan I'm using nonstick foil here so it makes it easy to take the bars out after they've cooled down and I've also sprayed it with a little bit of nonstick spray now you can skip the step of the foil if you would like or you can use parchment paper either way now I'm going to place the mixture into the 9 by 13 pan and press it down onto the bottom to create a little crust now I'm going to place one can of condensed milk on top of the graham cracker and butter crust and you just want to pour it out and then you want to spread it evenly over your crust now I am going to put about one cup of chocolate chips on top now you can put whatever you want on top of this you don't have to put the traditional chocolate chips and coconut and nuts which I'm not going to do I'm just going to sprinkle chocolate chips and then I have some mini M&Ms to give it some nice color I'm just going to sprinkle that all around and then I'm going to put some salted peanuts on top as well so it's creating a nice little candy bar type of cookie bar here for you and then you just want to lightly press down everything that you put into onto the top so you press it down lightly you want to make sure you preheat the oven to 350 degrees place it into the oven for approximately 25 minutes but you might want to check it a few minutes before that so it doesn't get too golden into Brown and we'll see what they look like in just a minute and there you have it condensed milk bar cookies a wonderful sweet treat that's fun to make and easy for you to make with your kids as well thank you for joining me here on sugar and

missed my last video or maybe I mentioned out of facebook i forget but saturday quest released their cereal bars so i went to vitamin shoppe and they of course had samples out there they only had two of them out they hadn't cut up a chocolate one yet so tasted the waffle and the cinnamon roll both were pretty tasty i did buy one of each of those so i can do a proper review of them but today we're going to review the chocolate so and they're crunchy they're not like your typical quest bar chewy so it's a different texture stats are pretty good proteins not as high but uh anyway we'll go over to stats real quick 110 calories 40 from fat uh four and a half grams of fat in the bar total carbs 17 grams 7 fiber so that brings it down to 10 grams sugars is 8 grams but it uses alyuh Lohse so i was checking on that alyuh Lohse is handled differently in your body doesn't spike your sugars and everything so they count it is against the net carbs so the net carbs only two grams on a bar um 12 grams of protein and of course it's the good quality protein that quest is always used so it's a chocolate one let's open it up give it a taste see how it looks got a little frosting on it kind of thing action going there almost like a race crispy type bar or something to that effect anyway let's see how this tastes choo-choo-choo it's pretty darn good nice and chalkley really pick up the sweetness off the little bit of frosting they have on the top almost has a vanilla frosting kind of flavor to it I'm somebody it's sensitive to artificial sweeteners actually some surgery anything sweet but now this is this is really good I think this one's another home run their quest this one's really good I like the texture difference too it's almost like bordering on a chewy granola bar so not quite that sorry to use this word moist um has got a little bit of a crunch to it but uh definitely really good chocolate flavor I think it's the right balance of the sweetness another good one quest I'm a fan um like I said I did buy one of each of the others the waffle and the cinnamon roll I think I'll do a little video review of that one as well just to eat a whole one see how it tasted a little sample but chocolate really good so I don't need a ton of bars anymore so when I do I choose ones that I really like this one's on the very short list so awesome job quest another home run and watch for the future updates peace", "a0CMNP-JR24": "hey guys and welcome back to crouton crackerjacks today I'm going to show you how to make peanut butter rice krispies treats these little treats are absolutely delicious they are soft and they're sweet and they're sticky topped with milk chocolate they're just absolutely irresistible and they're super easy to make so without further ado let's get started alright because we were working with a candy of sorts we need to have everything prepared ahead of time so when we get going everything's ready for us we don't have to stop and they can start to harden up on us so I am getting my dish ready here or pan if you will it is an 8 inch by 8 inch glass pan because I like thick rice krispie treats if you like them thinner use a 9 by 13 pan and I'm just going to line my pan with some aluminum foil this is going to a facilitate easy cleanup and it is also going to help us get our rice krispies treats out of the pan because if you've ever made rice krispies treats you know what a pain it can be to get them out of a pan so and because we're working with this candy and we don't want anything to stick I'm going to grease the foil with some vegetable oil you could also use butter or Crisco you know whatever you want to use that you normally use degrees so be sure and cover all the sides of your foil all the way up the sides all along the bottom be sure and get in the corners because that's what things tend to stick and then just go ahead and take your pan and set that off to the side now to make our peanut butter candy make sure that we're going to coat our rice krispies or not right or krispies with I've got a pan over medium heat here it's actually between medium and medium-high I'm going to add in 1 cup of corn syrup this is light corn syrup caber brand if it makes any difference if you are not in the United States use glucose syrup which is pretty much the same thing but there is no alternative to the corn syrup you know it's just it's part of rice krispies treats and then you want to add in 1 cup of white granulated sugar as well as 1 tablespoon of water now the traditional rice krispies treat or a peanut butter rice krispies treat recipe does not call for water I use water because it helps to this mixture come together helps the sugar and corn syrup come together but it also guarantees that they stays soft if you've made these before using just corn syrup peanut butter and sugar you know that they can kind of have a tendency to get hard on you if you ever cook it adding the water helps prevent that so just using a spatula I'm going to mix this mixture together over medium-high heat stir this constantly while it's coming up to heat and you know it is ready when it starts to bubble around the outside of your pan once it starts to bubble get it off of heat and once you take that off heat continue stirring it kind of help to cool it down a little bit and then you want to add in 1 cup of creamy peanut butter I'm using creamy peanut butter if you want to use chunky peanut butter by all means go ahead I like mine smooth so that's what I'm using and again I'm just going to mix this until the peanut butter is mixed into the corn syrup and sugar mixture before I get going too far I'm also going to add in one teaspoon of vanilla extract as well as a quarter of a teaspoon of salt again neither of these ingredients is in the original peanut butter rice krispies treat recipe they're just what a highlight to add to mine this salt kind of helps to neutralize so it's not just so Chloe sweet at all you taste is sugar it kind of mellows everything out and of course vanilla vanilla makes everything better too you just want to mix all these ingredients together until everything is combined and you don't have any chunks of peanut butter left unless of course you're using chunky peanut butter and then you want to pour your mixture over 6 cups of puffed rice cereal the technical term not rice krispies basically if you want to use rice krispies by all means go ahead but these are not real rice krispies so go ahead and get that peanut butter mixture in there and then using a spatula you want to gently fold these ingredients together gently fold that peanut butter and sugar mixture into the rice krispies don't go all hog wild with a spoon because you're just going to break up your cereal you want your cereal to remain whole as much as possible so just gently fold this together but you need to work kind of quick because this mixture does harden up and get really sticky really quick so do the best that you can and once all your rice krispies are evenly coated go ahead and dump this mixture all into your prepared pan now you can use a spatula for this process I'm going to use my hands just because it's easy this sure is not overly hot you know you're not going to burn your fingertips or anything so don't worry about that but in order to prevent my fingers from sticking to this and making a huge mess I'm going to oil my fingertips and gently Pat this out now you don't want to press this really really hard because then you will make you know rock-hard treats you want you know those little pockets in there so be sure and get into the corners so your treats are evenly thick and then you want to go ahead and let this cool for a few minutes before you put your chocolate on top now to prepare the chocolate I'm doing this over a stovetop you can also do this in the microwave that's perfectly fine but stovetop I've just got a pan of some simmering water here and I'm going to put my bowl on top I've got two cups of milk chocolate chocolate chips in here you could also use some nice sweet if you wanted to or dark chocolate would be fine if that's your preference of chocolate and I'm just going to stir this chocolate constantly over that low simmering water but once most of your chocolate is melted you know it's about half way melt or so go ahead and take your bowl off of heat the residual heat will help melt the chocolate and you won't burn it this way so I'll just go ahead and keep stirring it until your chocolate is nice and smooth and you don't have any more chunks in your chocolate and then you can go ahead and pour your melted chocolate over your rice krispies treats again using a spatula I'm just going to smooth my chocolate out all the way to the edges cover the entire top smooth it out make it nice and even because you want an even thickness of chocolate over all of your treats and then you want to set this off either on your counter top or the refrigerator to cool completely in the refrigerator it's going to take about an hour counter top it's going to take a couple hours once they are set up you can go ahead and remove the foil from the sides of your treats this is where you will see if you greased your foil well enough or not I should just come right off and then you can go ahead and cut these into bite-size pieces or bigger pieces if you'd like I like all my pieces nice and uniform I don't like the edge pieces or the corners so I'm going to cut the edges off of my rice krispies treats before I cut them into squares and these edges are there chef's delight you get to have these all to yourself as a little reward for making these so put them in a baggie hide them from everybody else in the family enjoy them because I'm using an 8x8 inch pan I'm just going to cut this into 16 equal pieces go ahead and store these in an airtight container that will guarantee that they stay nice and fresh and soft and sticky be careful though if you put these in the refrigerator they will get hard on you if you let them come up to room temperature again those soften up a bit but yeah there you go soft and sticky and sweet delicious chocolate topped peanut butter rice krispies treats I hope you guys enjoy if you give this recipe a try let me know how you like it down in the comments below thanks so much for watching if you like this video give it a thumbs up I would greatly appreciate it and subscribe for more deliciousness thanks again for watching and we will see you next time [Music]", "WmJm166uGQI": "we started

thought would make something that's really tasty we're gonna make some golden graham krispies treats let me show you how what we're gonna do we got our saucepan here we've put it on a low medium on your dial in your kitchen if you have a electric Kevin or still be played on a four of us are off with three tablespoons of butter I'm gonna knock that down just a little bit I love these things we've tried them of course with all different types of cereals we've done the Golden Grahams we've done the cinnamon toast crunch we're done the cocoa pebbles within the fruity pebbles but this is one of our favorites we're looking at lettera butter milk for just a few moments alright our butter has some melted we're now going to add one package which is ten ounces of miniature marshmallows I kind of started this well ground melt these you don't want to cook it too fast in college I used to love rice krispies treats and one of the things I used to do when I made it there as hard as a rock and one of the reasons I found out is because I was cooking them to work too fast and too long so my friend Julie she ended up making my mush crispy treats for me most the time because her she was so nice and soft and then she finally told me what I was doing wrong so we're gonna melt this down we're not gonna melt it all the way we want a few marshmallows left in it then we give them just a little texture I love the smell butter marshmallow of this as it's cooking right to this we're going to add six cups of Golden Grahams and we'll go ahead and start adding those in now you can tell it's not quite all right cooked or the marshmallows aren't all the way Nothe that's what's been what that section if you wanted to you can add a little bit of a few chocolate chips in here to make it more like a s'mores I just want kind of plain we've turned the heat off same reason because we want that gooey texture like a few marshmallows in it we're taking that 9 by 13 inch pan dissipated with a mom kit to cook a nonstick cooking spray I can't talk too clearly today alright we're gonna take this off the heat and stick it in our pan try to get that I mean I'm really good at making messes so try not to again we don't lay down the heat for too long it will make them too hard and crispy and we also like a few marshmallows not all they melted this spread it out a little bit cool if we're lucky or let it cool for about five minutes or ten minutes before we get in start eating it even though I have a feeling we'll start a little sooner this is how you make golden graham krispie treats and we hope that you

anything else how little yeah you can eat it super sweet its Golden Grahams cereal chocolate chips mini marshmallows and go around zero so now they're saying you can make many s'mores a shoe bar yeah let me get right to this there's a trick to it you know cover up much the other screen happened let's hit chocolate on the bottom we were trying to do they they've had golden gram bars before and these are called s'mores and we're didn't know if these were different or what we couldn't find the other one so we couldn't tell yeah very chewy super sweet though mm-hmm these are 130 calories per bar low well please no take you maintain you yeah yeah you work your duels done we'll be honest I think they're great yeah I think they're great no do you think it fits like it's more of them yes there they remote maybe things like a s'more but that golden gram flavor each is so good don't rub Cyril's any good um great marshmallow flavor great chocolate flavor the golden grain flavors they're the only downside is it's very very chewy but it's also a small bar that's our 30 calories so it's gonna take a minute to eat it I mean he's not bad oh she's a bad thing I think it's a good thing it makes you work out a little bit longer those are excellent that's of morality yeah these are in Android on my bar so this is of course it's not healthy bar this is just uh pure sugar bar by hunters it's not bad actually oh that's a good breakfast bar yeah it would be it would be something you could grab forever so I think it will settle easy an afternoon snack between your lunch - your dinner kind of in the three or four o'clock range you can rent one of these and hold you over till dinner in town these are really really good if you give in you hear yeah definitely trying I think you'll really enjoy them especially if you like that golden Ram flavor cereal that you don't have golden they don't have graham crackers over in England so they didn't know what they taste like even so for those across the pond there are its hardness properties gut rot so any what you do to be a unique experience it's definitely definitely unique so I hope you enjoyed this video and thanks for watching", "PirbE9GOmeY": "hi everyone say hi Isaac today I'll be sharing a really simple recipe cornflakes marshmallow dream bar very similar to the Rice Krispies bars but I opted out the Rice Krispies because I don't have rice krispies I decided to show you guys how I make it because I'm gonna be making some for my co-workers and hope you guys try it out so far the ingredients you will need miniature marshmallows and you touch bottom work bag of cornflakes pure vanilla extract and unsalted butter very simple for dreams so the first thing you want to do is just heat um some water if you have to it is a little smile so the water is spoiled and I just have all my ingredients out and ready we're gonna be putting the marshmallows in with the butter I'm just gonna put the metal part of this book I'm gonna using this bunch of marshmallows I'm making a lot I actually use half the bay so with that I'm going to put about four tablespoons of unmelted butter I also turn the heat to low to medium low so that I'll melt the butter slowly so once the butter is all melted I'm going to be adding the marshmallows so I just laid a strip of parchment paper on the side to prepare it's all melted so I'm just going to add my mushrooms these can't pour it in and fix it so you know when it's ready when all the marshmallow is melted and gooey so once it's like this I usually add the vanilla extract so I don't really measure I'll just put like maybe a teaspoon bless you so I added in the vanilla extract yep it's done shut this off you take this out so while it's still really hot you just pour you're poor flakes in it so give it a really good stir so they definitely add more cornflakes to this so basically I really just eyeball everything it sounds really simple so you don't really need to make there any things that's your preference if you want more marshmallow just add less more flakes but if you want more cornflakes and more of the crunch keep adding more you already see that it's kind of like getting really sticky so that's when you know that everything's coated especially when you see all the corn flakes covered with the gooey goodness so next make sure your parchment area is clean which mine is on is kind of wet but anyways good I'm pouring the delicious - delicious mixture onto my parchment paper and voila it's done you could actually just use it right now the next thing that you want to do to saran wrap this so no dust and everything will get on it so now that goes down could either use up parchment paper and roll it up or if you use ceramic so I'm going to use irreverent No let's go back all this up hope you guys enjoy this video anyway I'll show you by little cute apron cuz my sister got it for me as a little bow isn't it cute my sister got it for

usually that's gonna mean that there's caffeine in it or um a lot of carbs or maybe a b complex or something like that excuse me allergies i don't really see any of that going on in here it's 220 calories for the cookie it's a 40 gram bar 13 grams of fat 11 carbs is not a lot fiber less than one protein so that's a ratio that i like to go with now here is where that gets kind of tricky um the ingredients are okay the description is high dh hydrolyzed whey protein in a cream filled bar don't know what hdh hydrolyzed is anyway ingredients proto-way registered trademark protein blend in the parentheses micropeptides trademark from high dh hydrolyzed whey protein bracket 40 di and tripeptides oh 40 die and tri peptides i don't know what that means not a clue end of bracket whey protein isolate milk protein isolate end of parentheses palm oil enriched flour oh there's wheat flour in here and here i am without an enzyme i'm going to live malted barley flour some vitamins niacin and such it does have some sugar um and i'm not gonna read every single thing it's got sucralose and stevia for the sweetening so it's got it all going on but it really doesn't have a lot of vitamins per se in there and i wouldn't think it was high enough carbs for them to call it an energy bar who knows we're gonna try it so last peak at the bar let's just go for it i'm going to rip it open i'm going to see what this is like oh it smells pretty good so ah oh no you know what it just broke like a chrome fell on my shoe so you can see the texture over the wafer i think i'm gonna need a napkin trying to get this so i can hold it and eat it at the same time so that's what the inside of it looks like and it it definitely looks like a cookie and it's like a frosting on the outside so i'm going to give it a try and see how it is hmm it has a nice texture it's just like eating a cookie it's good but i think i'm catching a little aftertaste from the something stevia maybe hmm okay so i really i like the texture it's a lot like a cookie like a frosted wafer cookie it's really good it tastes pretty good like initially it tastes very good but as you chew and about when you swallow is when you realize that you're eating some sort of nutrition bar or something it's not just a cookie there's definitely a little bit of a tiny bit of an aftertaste or something it's really not bothersome but it's kind of weird and i can't quite identify it i'm assuming that it could be from the stevia because stevia is technically a bitter herb um but most people perceive it as sweet as long as you don't go overboard and not going overboard is why it would have the sucralose in in there and maybe even a little bit of sugar to balance out that little bitter aftertaste so all in all i like this probably better in your office drawer or lunch box not so much in your car or outdoors on a warm day because i do have a little frosting on my fingers now and i'm not even done with it so i'm going to enjoy this and find a napkin but it's good and um that little bit of frosting on my fingers that i'm so politely licking off in front of you has a taste and texture just like like frosting it's actually pretty good it's just a little aftertaste that i can't identify and i know nothing about the uh the whey processing i'm not worried about it i'm just telling you that i can't tell you much about it i'll check their website if i can find some information i'll attach that below i like doing that leaving information from the brand in my uh in my videos when i can so that is it for today and if you

cherry hmm that's on my way to work or to an interview can you get me one Kellogg's nutrigrain bars now in cherry start your morning off right", "Q4j7lwdGejA": "good morning y'all it's shannon and you're on my channel oh my and today we're gonna go through cereal bars and protein bars yeah i got i don't know quite a few here i never knew that there was so many of them out there never okay so let's see how this goes i'm trying to think the only one that i have tried is going to be this one here and it's this kellogg's special k pastry crisp blueberry so i have tried that one there [Music] this is just one little bar in here and it is a hundred calories and a total of 20 carbs no fiber uh total sugar seven added sugars it's just 14 so okay honestly i don't know that's just really super little i'm not gonna open that because i'm not gonna eat it hopefully somebody will eat it and i've already tried it okay so the other ones let's let's go with the cereal bars first and then we'll do the protein pars okay so here is one it's the cinnamon toast crunch cereal bar okay i'm going to assume it tastes like cinnamon toast crunch cereal let's see 100 calories for the one bar total carbs eighteen so it's a little less than that one it's a little bigger than the special k but let's see diet dietary fiber less than one total sugars nine grams added sugars 17 so there's a lot of hidden sugars in your granola bars or so far your cereal bars um here is golden grahams okay this one this one here is 130 calories 22 carbs it's going up and dietary fiber is less than one gram total sugars oh 13 grams you guys and then added sugars is 25 oh my gosh so the added sugars are all of your hidden sugars wow that's a lot for this little bar oh my gosh that there would be like a whole meal for the whole day except for you're not getting your calories in crazy okay oh i'm sorry here's another one um kellogg's nutri grain bar this one is blueberry soft bread soft baked breakfast bar and this one here 130 calories again y'all let's see let's see let's see total carb 25 grams of carbs okay this one has one gram of fiber sugar's 13 grams and then added sugars 12 grams that's a lot and it's just so little i used to eat these just to get me going and you know oh well okay so where do we start okay we'll go ahead and start with this guy here because it is a special k kellogg special k but it is a protein bar um it's actually 12 grams of protein in this and it's a meal bar double chocolate so let's see what it has to say oh i'm looking at it all wrong okay serving size one oh this is 180 calories total carbs 22 total sugar 13 additional 12 grams of added sugar and then of course your protein you got 12 grams um we do keep um stuff like this in the truck when we are traveling and working because once we get to a job we don't leave so most of the time we'll take a salad or a wrap or something like that to eat but if we're there for you know where it's getting to where it's dipping into supper time then we have one of these to kind of get us through until we eat supper so i mean i'm not saying that we don't oh okay here's another one of the um kellogg's special k protein or the meal bars and this one is strawberry yummy okay and how many okay and it's the same thing 180 calories so it's going to have this exact same as the other one okay let me see what i've got okay okay let's go with the power bar this is a protein plus bar 20 grams of protein four grams of fiber and this is gluten free chocolate peanut butter with other natural flavor okay i'm not too sure about this you guys okay this bar here has 210 calories in it let me see oh it's got 230 milligrams of sodium that's a lot of sodium total carbohydrates um 24 grams dietary fiber 4 grams total sugars 12 11 grams of added sugars and then the protein it's 24 grams i just can't get over the added sugars it's like come on why add more sugar to it i i don't get it okay here's another power bar protein protein plus bar and it is vanilla okay and this one here okay this one here's 200 calories the chocolate one was 210 this one is 200. and let's see what was what would what we got what do we got what do we got total carbs 26 grams dietary fiber 4 grams total sugars 13 grams 12 grams of added sugar protein 20 grams so i don't know i don't know but we are gonna compare these to a honey bun so we're just gonna see what the calorie is for a honey bun and all that good stuff so if you kind of get the idea as far as are our protein bars or our cereal bars are they really that much healthier for us than a honey bun i don't know let's see okay so this is a pure protein bar okay and this one has 200 calories in it what flavor is this little booger here chocolate peanut butter okay so this one has 200 calories 17 grams of carb the carbs are 17 grams fiber is one gram total sugars or okay this one's not bad total sugars is two grams and one gram of added sugars okay okay looking a little better and the protein's 20 grams so this one's actually better for you than you know as far as the added sugar if you look in all that stuff so you have to you know you have to you know it it all depends on what you're looking for or what you're not wanting to put in your body that's all this is good honestly i could not test every single one of these because i would be sick for the rest of the day y'all okay this one here is another pure protein bar and what is the flavor of this one here it looks kind of good birthday cake getting fancy on me okay 200 calories okay it's the same as the chocolate peanut butter um carbs 18. i don't know okay this one has 17 so that's one less carb on the chocolate and peanut butter one okay fiber none now that's kind of downer total sugars three grams added sugars or two grams and the protein is 20. so it's still not bad it's still better than these others so okay now some of these cereal bars and protein pars are like 79 cents 89 cents 99 cents and they go up to you know a dollar 69 a dollar 79 so yeah a piece that's not the box these are just individuals that i picked up okay the next ones um are the cliff bar and this is an energy bar okay this one here is limited edition it's white chocolate macadamia nut i didn't like macadamia okay oh my gosh so this little guy right here which is 2.40 ounces you get it is excuse me 260 calories total carbs wow 42 grams total sugars 21 grams include 20 grams of added sugars i gotta this weather is so freaky you guys and protein is nine grams so all reality this one here the pure protein is better for you than even the cliff here's another clif bar another limited edition chocolate chip okay how many okay the chocolate chip is 260 calories but it could be a condition golly the carbs are high in these things 45 grams of carbs dietary fiber four that's good um total sugar is 21 grams 21 grams of added sugar which is 40 of your the daily recommended value and protein is nine and here's another one they're saying limited edition again crunchy peanut butter 260 calories you guys wow it just amazes me 40 grams of carbs total sugars 19 18 grams of added sugar and protein 11 grams and the dietary fiber is four grams so needless to say with me watching my carb intake because you know whatever your body doesn't use for carbs it turns into fat yeah so your carbs basically turn into sugar whatever your body doesn't use turns into fat so i really have to watch my carb intake along with my sugar intake so i'm watching both try to um and normally when you watch your carb intake and your sugar intake you're not going to take in a lot of calories um mind you it's hard to do and sometimes you know i just want to say eff it because it gets disgusting um i'm not a vegetarian i'm not a vegan so i do like um my meat every once in a while i don't eat a lot of meat i love cheese which i know it's bad for you because it's processed and you try to stay away from processed food i don't know when the last time was that i had as far as lunch me it's been a while but it's still you know it's hard to balance all that so i mean that being said okay so we're just going to compare those so if you can kind of remember the calories and the carbs and all that stuff of how high they were to a honey bun this here would put me in a diabetic shock so therefore i will not be eating it at all so i'll throw it in the candy drawer so whoever can have whatever they want yeah i got a drawer over there that i just throw this stuff in if i don't test it okay now this here is considered three servings three servings so one serving is 240 calories but for the entire package it's 710 calories never really thought about looking at stuff like this you know but when you're young you don't you you don't because you don't have the medical issues or you know you're just you're you don't have that problem yeah at that time you think you're invincible okay um let's see what does it total carbs for this whole package the total carbs is 92 grams three grams for the fiber total sugar 43 grams oh my seven grams of protein y'all hey you can't go wrong i wonder if i could just pick out the protein and eat it what do you think oh well anyways that was just a little info on your protein bars your energy bars and some cereal bars and compared it to one big old honey bun so i guess in all reality a honey bun would actually fill you up more than just this little bar or this itty bitty thing or this or that but i guess it just all depends on how you want to eat as an individual so yeah but um all this stuff oh you know what i didn't do this one here this is that's it one apple plus 12 strawberries in this fruit bar none gmo no sugar added 100 calories per bar okay this is a little tiny bar but i've never seen this and i picked this up because i was really intrigued on it because of the how it's one apple and 12 strawberries so let's see 100 calories for this one bar let's see total carbs 22 grams that kills me on the carbs 22 grams of carbs dietary fiber is four and then total sugars is 17. ingredients apples strawberries may contain occasional stem seed or pit fragment okay let's open this and it's not what i thought it'd look like y'all i'm kind of scared now that is what it looks like okay it almost smells like a fruit roll-up this one i am going to try because i was really curious about this one but i'm scared of it now because of the way it looks you ever see food and if it looks funky or something to you you're scared to eat it and smell yeah smell too back in the package all right that's not my thing no okay i'd rather have a fruit or dehydrated fruit it's not my cup of tea oh my gosh okay anyways that's it for today or for this video i should say don't forget y'all i've got a giving a giveaway going on if you go back and watch the thanksgiving giveaway this is really nasty i think i picked the wrong one to try okay anyways any water i'll get in a minute

watch the videos so you can see what the prize is until the next video y'all take care god bless and peace bye", "WaEyf-dhwjM": "I've got quite a sweet tooth and after scouring the kitchen a few times I have realized that I don't have any cookies cakes candy hi donuts danishes muffins nothing so I'm going to have to resort to drastic measures I'm going to have to do something closely resembling cookies and after taking an inventory of what I do have available on hand I have all the necessary components to make Cheerios treats similar to rice krispies treats except Cheerios so the recipe which is right here that's my kind of recipe 1/4 cup butter 8 cups Cheerios a 10 ounce bag of marshmallows and to put this all together we're going to start by melting the 1/4 cup butter in this saucepan I'm using nonstick because marshmallows get sticky 1/4 cup but we need to do this there was an incident with these particular marshmallows somebody got into him so I had to adjust my recipe a little bit but as long as you have a full bag of marshmallows you should be flying so we'll start this burner up and melt this butter in the pan that's the first step and then I'll put this remaining butter back in the refrigerator for later use this butter the butter is almost melted I have my heat set and right about medium we don't want it too hot or too cold so medium is right there now that the butter is melted I will add these mellows of Marche we're going to stir these up until it's all just one gooey block this is where the nonstick really comes in handy keeping the heat at medium to medium-low you can see down there they're starting to melt maybe I should crank this up to right about medium because I'm in a hurry I want to eat more than I want to cook okay so we're getting some nice some nice melted here a marshmallow flux that's what we're after a marshmallow flux here we go see how nice those marshmallows just resist sticking to the pan uh-oh Brown age Brown age stir I don't have a nonstick spoon so perhaps you see that caramelization that's probably bad so keep this down a little lower and probably keep keep the whole slurry just a stirring that way no one part gets too much heat should still be okay though I think that's good I don't go a little longer I don't like him sometimes you need to turn the temperature down on the stove because this step can take a little while you want your mixture to be free of lumps of the marshmallows a little bit of browning is normal is it yes oh hey hey I'm normal cooking wise okay I'm good yeah I think so okay so the next step is to pour in our pre-measured Cheerios - a couple and stir and we need to work quickly here because the marshmallow will start to harden and we want every single O to be covered in goo before that occurs so we'll just keep this spoon moving around and this is gonna be some good goo oh I didn't get out the pan we need a flat pan to put this out on - for it to cool standby we're using I believe an 8x8 brownie pan because we have a smaller mixture since someone ate some of the marshmallows believe it or not it'll taste the same regardless of pan size if you've used the full recipe you might want to use a 9 by 13 inch pan or you can leave it in the pan that pot and scoop it out with your hands oh I should have greased this should I am probably should have greased this folks so you can learn from our mistakes it will still taste the same yeah so and I'll take care of that spoon yeah nonstick I use a nonstick pan but this is going to be a real dog to clean this up afterwards in my haste I didn't think about greasing this Sam we were excited just push this in how it goes there was butter in the mixture so so for the final four the final presage of goo into the pan I'm just using my clean finger tips boom tasty treat for later thanks for watching", "_1d0rzVyQC0": "[Music] introducing oatmeal Crisp fruit and cereal bars real oatmeal crisp cereal layered with real fruit

Trader Joe's in the coming weeks I'm hoping these are better than those as tastic nutrigrain pumpkin bars so here we go there it is the smell is overwhelmingly pumpkin spice like you I simona take it out of the package so that bodes well for the flavor here we go hmm definitely better nutrigrain soft pumpkin taste is good could be a little bit stronger and actually smelled more pumpkin you actually taste it but it resembles more of a Fig Newton than a been a nutrigrain bar which is a really good thing my favorite pumpkin product Trader Joe's but worth the pick up 7y haces out of 10", "Bnhsl4zbQSE": "Hey guys, Dr. Axe here, and welcome to the\nChopping Block. Today on the Chopping Block we're going to be talking about cereal bars\nlike Nutri-Grain bars, and we will see at the end if they will pass the test and if\nthey're going to get chopped or not. Now, when I was a kid, I would eat cereal bars,\nlike Nutri-Grain bars, not by the bar, but by the box. I know my mom bought them for\nme because she thought they were made with whole grains and fruit and that they were\nreally healthy, but there are three reasons why we're going to look at Nutri-Grain bars\nhere and cereal bars getting chopped. Number one is the sugar content. I went this\nmorning and picked up a box of these bars and found there are seven different types\nof sugar in each one of these little bars. Seven different types of sugar, two different\nkinds of high fructose corn syrup, other genetically modified sugars. Actually, two of these little\nbars have more high fructose corn syrup and sugar than a can of soda. So these little\nbreakfast bars, it's like you might as well be drinking a soda for breakfast. Second problem with these bars is hydrogenated\noils. They're packed with soybean oil, vegetable oil, canola oil, these GMO oils that are highly\ntoxic, cause heart disease in adults and in children. Not something you want to be eating. And last, but not least, all the food colorings\n-- Red 40, Blue 5, Yellow 4. TBQH is a very toxic additive. Flavor enhancers, like MSG,\nthat's added into these food bars, that's on the label, and it's packed with wheat,\nwhich is very, very high in gluten, which is hard on your digestive tract and your kids'\ndigestive tract. Those are all the negatives when it comes\nto doing a lot of these cereal bars that big companies like Kellogg's and General Mills\nmarket to us and big-time market to our kids for breakfast. So, when we're looking at these\ncereal bars today, they're going to get chopped here. All right? All the way. And we're going\nto go ahead and get rid of these. Other good options are things like Larabars.\nYou've got dates. You've got nuts and seeds for your kids for breakfast. Doing my berry\nsmoothie is another great option to your kids for breakfast that's fast and on the go, or\nhey, make your own homemade bars at home. We've got some great recipes there on DrAxe.com,\nand in the \"Real Food Diet CookBook,\" of how to make your own food bars. Hey, this has been Nutri-Grain bars and cereal\nbars. They've gotten chopped here on your episode of the Chopped with me, Dr. Axe.", "xA07wuGpMfQ": "what did you eat when you're hungry and in a hurry I don't know I just like to get something crunchy and salty I'll get a coffee and like a muffin or like a lookup banana bread or something I'll grab like a little bar like something health bar health bar experts at consumer reports say if you're satisfying your hunger with a snack bar choose wisely they evaluated two dozen in strawberry chocolate and peanut butter flavors doesn't matter if it's called a protein bar cereal bar granola bar we did find big differences in nutrition and there are big differences in taste too even within brands take Clif bars for example cliff builders 20 gram protein chocolate peanut butter tasted vitamin E chalky and gritty nutritionally more than half the fat is saturated and although the far is larger than most it was the most expensive tested at a dollar 30 per serving but it's sibling the cliff crunch chocolate chip granola bar cost less than half that it rated good for nutrition and very good for taste with honey notes and crispy toasted grains when it came to the to nature valley bars they were consistent for flavor sweet and salty nut and crunchy oats and dark chocolate rated very good for taste though they weren't the best for nutrition so to make sure take a moment to check a bars label before you grab and go if you're looking for a snack bar with a lot of fiber as many people do at breakfast time pick a bar with fiber in its name Consumer Reports has found one from Kelloggs the fiber plus antioxidants chewy chocolate chip bars scored good for taste and very good for nutrition to see other stories from our partners at Consumer Reports go to our website ABC action news

packability and it's kind of smooshy this is probably not something that will survive well in your in the bottom of your hiking pack this might be something you want to carry a little bit less where it can be squished so as you see it's a trader joe's product they sell these in box packages but i thought i would give it a little tasty poo so yeah it's pretty it's pretty mangled just riding in my purse on the way so we're definitely getting some crumblies here but hey it's a cereal bar it's kind of flat i don't think it was this flat when i put it so may not be the best thing for hiking up the mountain but that is so good that's really tasty it's not overly sweet it has an apple cinnamon flavor to it but it's not just gaggy sweet yeah that's a pretty tasty unit again not great for hiking but definitely a tasty snack fairly low calorie and good for you so thanks for checking in folks and we'll be snacking with you later you", "yxthReYIz74": "hi guys welcome back to my channel this is

healthy diet and as a mother wants to make sure she passes along the same lessons to her children it's very important to me what my kids put into their body so having them be apart and having choices healthy choices is is very very important so Kim is one of a growing number of moms throwing cereal parties instead of giving kids pizza or chips and soda for snacks Kim sets up cereal bars including fresh fruits and whole grains mixed with low-fat milk and yogurt with lots of different variations it's taking that breakfast cereal that traditional breakfast meal and making it fun and making it the way you want to eat it Karen becky's is a registered dietitian with the American Dairy Association mid-east besides being healthy she says cereal bars can also be educational kids often try new foods in these situations and learn to take ownership of their diets I think when we have choices we're more likely to eat the food that we create when we can make it and design it ourselves and it's not just for kids in fact in some cities cereal restaurants are opening catering to adult palates recipes call for mixing cereals with spices like mustard garlic and even chili powder you can do a hot cereal or cold cereal and use some different kinds of herbs you can use lemon rind you can use time you can use mint you can use different kinds of herbs to infuse the different flavors it's a concept Kim appreciates not just for the taste but for helping kids form healthy habits whether they realize it or not they love it they love the yogurt they love milk they always have I want them to know that their bodies are like machines and if you don't feed your body well it's not going to work good in school and in sports if you'd like to set up your own cereal bar for your family or friends as

fitness do news reviews really quick review the quest cereal bar west west cereal bar and I don't know if you ran into it but quest launched their cereal bar about three months ago and the idea here is really to go after like a breakfast bar rather than a full-blown protein bar with 20 grams of protein what you're used to the idea here is more to go after a cereal bar like a breakfast bar that you can even give to a kid which I can tell you i'm doing and or you just eat as a breakfast low calorie high protein good macronutrient breakfast so anyway so they have i think four flavors there's to hear that we're gonna try I tried the what was it I think cinnamon roll one and I'm gonna try life now these two that I didn't yet which is what flavor very appropriate for breakfast and the chocolate flavor so the macronutrients perspective you have 110 calories per cereal bar with 12 grams of protein 17 grams of carbs only three grams net carbs which is the quest bar claim to fame and eight grams of sugar and six rounds of 50 which is again great i mean if you're looking it's not like 18 grams of fiber like you get from a regular quest bar it's six grams of fiber so you know if you eat one we're actually getting six rounds five very 12 grams of protein and only like six eight grams of sugar which is just a great balance and only 110 calories so you know you just want to eat something small in the morning and you want that breakfast thing like a serial so this is the thing so let's take a look at this thing so this is this is the structure this is the texture not the structure so you see it looks like a cereal bar and from so this is the waffle one and let's give it a shot you know what I'm going to open the chocolate one also just to show you how it looks and this is the chocolate one waffle chocolate okay so they do look like cereal bars I have to give it a quest they look like cereal bars let's take a bite hmm i don't know if it's a waffle but it's definitely breakfast ish yeah it's good this is good also I like to offer better and I can tell the cinnamon roll that I had earlier is perfect from a texture perspective they taste like cereal bars quest did an amazing job even though it's packed with quality protein blend which is actually two milk isolate and whey isolate they managed to make it taste just like a cereal bar it's aft it's not like what you're used to from quest it's really soft you know what just like a cereal bar but healthy now from a pricing perspective they launched it at a 12 bars for 2499 which is just like this quest bars it's very common to find 15 bars for 2499 when you get it on a kick-ass view you can get 15 of these for 1999 shipped if you see that I suggest you give it a shot this is really good quality I like it a lot actually tasted these two for the first time really cool so anyway quest cereal bar protein for the morning baby if this video was helpful that look before you go hit the

"OrDMRGl_sis": "hey y'all it's tosh I'm going to jump on here and do a review I don't know that i've done an official review since i've had this channel but this is going to a review of quests no cereal bars they actually sent me some samples a couple days ago and I'm not proud of me and I'm starving so I'm going to review they sent me three let me grab him I think they only have three flavors as a right angle but they sent me these are the cereal proach beyond beyond cereal protein bars and looks like they each have 110 calories 12 grams of protein and two or three net carbs apiece so they have the chocolate waffle flavored and cinnamon roll okay I'm going to do the 1 i'm the least excited about first which is the cinnamon roll I'm just I'm not a big cinnamon person i don't know i have some protein powder that's like a cinnamon latte kind of protein powder and it's really good but I don't know I'm just cinnamon roll stuff never really interested me oh it looks like a cereal bar okay I wasn't expecting then you don't show you what it looks like this is the cinnamon roll honestly I was expecting like it's like a protein bar but they were calling a serial or smells like cinnamon toast crunch mix with protein powder not horribly protein ii but and i'm sorry i've got these bangles on they keep dangling okay sorry if you hate people like eating in the videos because i'm going to give you a first-hand experience opinion that's not bad that's not bad at all it's very crunchy it doesn't get a little chewy as you haven't you own it but you know that's not bad you can totally do that and I don't look I said I don't like cinnamon so ok then I will do the chocolate I hope the fact that i just took about as i said anyone doesn't completely offer everything i sighs I didn't like that dress here is the chocolate one that's what it looks like oh my god that smells like a brownie oh man okay that's really good oh my god Ben you're a lot better than I anticipated then BAM mmm oh that's good that's really good like I don't want to stop eating that okay maybe I shouldn't do live reviews because I can't can find myself now I'm going to do the waffle this is the one I was most excited about oh good I rates to the hell packaging time mmm what that would suck smells very mapley like super nice link don't have that one's good it's really good but it's not as nearly as flavored as I expected it to be it's a very very subtle flavor which I'm glad about it kind of took a second for me to be like okay where's the flavor but it's good it tastes kind of buttery with just like a little bit of maple that's good okay i'm going to write on them 0 to 10 10 being you know absolutely fantastic and which I don't do rarely i would give the cinnamon roll like a seven Mia mr. seven I wouldn't I would definitely buy one and i would give this a good solid eight yeah a good solid eight and a half and the chocolate I would give like a nine and a half this is delicious like I'm so I kept talking and my video cut off but i'm getting ready to finish the rest of this chocolate because it is fantastic all right if you're craving something sweet and chocolaty right here right here is where it's at and the only thing that throws me off on these i'm going to sneeze oh sorry excuse me and it says on the package gluten free to net carbs seven grams of fiber twelfth protein okay on the back it says 17 carbs seven of those from fiber which cuts it to 10 and then it says zero erythritol and eight sugars so to me that makes it 10 net carbs which still is it horrible but on the bottom it says 17 carbs minus seven grams of fiber minus eight grams of a ulos which I'm not familiar with but I'm assuming that's a sugar substitute so I guess that's where it's getting the net carbs is that it's not sugar eight grams of sugar it's eight grams of sugars so it's using the how you the sugar and on the ingredients sugar is not listed so that's pretty awesome but definitely satisfied with a going to probably make a purchase tonight online so if you've not tried these beyond cereal protein bars from quest definitely worth it", "vz6JBs-lcKM": "well hello and welcome to the video

themed review two old favorites turned into cereal bars that's gonna be the frosted flakes and fruit loops cereal bars that were just introduced man these boxes bold colors it's like very nice it's like almost 3d these uh toucan sam and tony the tiger they're beautiful beautiful hd photography on their part but the cereal i've been looking forward to most this year is the chocolate chip cookie dough craving chocolate chip not cookie cookie dough themed cereal boy if you know that this exists and you're not interested i'm not sure ctc is for you because this is really outstanding look at the back ryan it has the museum of chocolate i mean there's like craved chocolate chip cookie dough security guards and museum goers and artists and all kinds of stuff this is just uh boy and the colors just go together so well this is just it's a very beautiful review um look lots of new cereals as with any new year i mean look on friday we just covered eight of them if you haven't checked out the lightning round yet you definitely should go back and do so but i do think that this is uh maybe even taking it to another level i want to start with the frosted flakes let's see how that cereal bar turned out first up is the frosted flakes cereal bars these were 2.49 at albertsons in fort worth and let me tell you they just look absolutely delicious it looks like a bowl of tiny sized frosted flakes with a base of milk frosting really really encouraged by how these look overall all right and cheers okay boy that frosted flakes flavor is bold yes bold bold bold and and unmistakable that is so frosted it also does kind of taste like milk yeah it's got a frosted flake in milk what happens to the milk when you pour the frosted flakes in it is that it takes on some of the sweetness by adding in this layer of frosting milk it really mimics the flavor that the milk makes when you pour it over the frosted flakes i'm very impressed i think texturally it's maybe even a little bit better than a bowl of frosted flakes because it maintains the crunchiness while still giving you that um that distinctive milky sweetness yeah so it's not soggy not soggy they do this they just they they know how to make a good bowl of frosted flakes in a in a bar i'll tell you let's see if they can do the same for froot loops and i think we hyped it up enough uh it's time to get into the froot loop cereal bars boy i cracked one open and it just smells like a delicious bowl of fruit you got really tiny fruit loops on this one it's even smaller than cheerios whereas froot loops are usually bigger than cheerios i also had noticed that on the frosted flakes one but i couldn't tell if it was just mashed up frosted flakes or if they made smaller frosted flakes so it looks like they made smaller frosted flakes and smaller fruit loops to put this bar together like with the frosted flakes there is that kind of milky sugary base so i found them for 2.49 at albertson's in fort worth and i am ready to try it out cheers ryan tell me if i'm going crazy it's way i might be going crazy i might we we've been at this for many many hours at this point so yes i might be um is it is it like really really really soft it's soggy your anticipation in that one is really nice yeah but like i like it like that it's suck it's not it it's soggy is just the word that comes to mind but not soggy i made a i had an hypothesis earlier with the frosted flakes one that maybe the the milky bottom the the sugar milky bottom wouldn't translate to a fruit loop that was incorrect i've been proven wrong because it's delicious it doesn't taste as close to a bowl of fruit loops as the frosted flakes taste to a bowl of frosted flakes so i guess you could say that that's a a con but i actually prefer this to a bowl of fruit loops because i just like the texture much better it's maintaining that fruity f-r-o-o-t-y taste for sure um if you love fruit loops i can't envision a world in which you don't love this i just can't but if there are things about fruit loops that you don't like i think this may kind of mitigate your risk factors enough that you can uh you can enjoy this uh i'm not a huge fruit loop fan i know that about you actually i love this ball and you do love it so i don't know uh two for two for sure but really i think where all the chips lie is in a chocolate chip cookie dough cereal so let's take a look at crave all right that brings us to the main event so uh kellogg's the pressure's on because chocolate chip cookie dough crave is next and uh the thing that i found kind of interesting is that they only put the chocolate chip flavor on the outside of one side not both sides it has like a grainy kind of texture and it's just very different from any other cereal of course it has that filled inside kind of like old hidden treasure cereal it doesn't taste specifically like chocolate chip cookie dough or really like chocolate chip at all i think really it tastes more like the chocolate chip cookie dough flavor that you add to a protein bar it's just it's not it's not like but it doesn't taste like a protein bar it just tastes like that like attempted additive of like a delicious flavor um but really the true test is going to be in milk so ryan you want to get an action shot perfect so now that we've milked it up here uh it looks like a poppy seed bagel on top on top of uh on top of some of these pieces let's see how this thing tastes i like it in milk it has some extra crunchiness but the problem is the word dough there's just nothing cookie dough about it and that's what made this particular cereal very special was that it was proclaiming to be cookie dough 3.99 at winn-dixie in metairie louisiana would i have bought it again yes i would have bought it 10 times but it's not chocolate chip cookie dough that's the unfortunate that's the unfortunate news as the cereal pieces get softer i enjoy the cereal more and more the out the outer level with the chocolate chip pieces is staying crunchy providing a good contrast and then inside it has additional chocolaty reinforcement so you're getting good chocolatey taste you're getting great texture it's a pretty well executed cereal except it doesn't deliver what the name implies so the gimmick grade um i'm gonna have to lump together both of the kellogg's cereal bars they're just their designs are identical just with slightly different colors and characters very bold designs i mean really they're more interesting than they should have been because it's just that's what great packaging will do and that's what i always celebrate and why a gimmick grade is very important because these are going to be well-remembered products that could have been forgotten if they end up going away or they're going to be you know long-standing shelf takers for a long time because people might be more willing to buy it than they would if it was just a boring old label they did a great job and for that they should be celebrated i'll give them a seven and a half out of ten gimmick grade which is about as high as these were going to get you know for making a cereal bar out of existing popular cereals the gimmick grade they are beautiful the size the square shape they're so crammed in ryan how long have i been proclaiming that small boxes are the way to go i've been just shouting it from the roof i'm pulling my hair out trying to never buy any family size boxes so yes putting them in small boxes did definitely add to the presentation and i'm sure that walmart if they get them we'll have them in 10 12 packs something like that instead of this nice convenient six-pack and it's going to make a difference and it's going to look a lot uglier but i'm judging what i have in front of me and i think it's very beautiful and really nice great great execution 10 out of 10 though for the most interesting gimmick of cereal for the year i love the idea of making a chocolate chip cookie dough cereal like i just can't express to you enough that i just never guessed that we'd ever have a chocolate chip cookie dough cereal now that's not factoring in the execution that's just the gimmick the box design is perfect the idea is ridiculous and memorable and that's what the gimmick grade is all about that might be the first 10 out of 10 gimmick rate of the whole year so uh well done to the folks at kellogg's crave for that getting into the capsule countdown as we're talking about taste as you guys may have guessed third place is going to the crave chocolate chip cookie dough cereal a brave attempt out of the box not all that interesting or tasty tasted more like a protein bar minus the health benefits which is never something that you want but in milk it was pretty darn good i really liked that it brought out two different textures just a really really solid taste so i'm still going to give it a 7 out of 10. third place on today's capsule countdown it could have been a lot worse look if it tasted like more like chocolate chip cookie dough to get a much higher grade and may have done better in the capsule countdown but it also may not have because it had two very stiff competitors second place is gonna go to the froot loops cereal bars ryan i see you nodding with a pretty adamant agreement which is um which is encouraging look it's better than a bowl of fruit loops i take it over a bowl of fruit loops any day that's about as high of a compliment as you can give a cereal bar right the texture is better and i just want to keep eating it you know it's just it's perfect it's it really is as good as it possibly could have been now that said for me about the ceiling of where this could have ended up was an eight and a half so i'm gonna go with an eight and a half and you know one a product that i wouldn't have necessarily thought that i was gonna continue eating after the lights went out here today but i will and it's it's very very good but i won't until i'm out of the frosted flakes cereal bars this one i don't even know where to where to start the texture is better the sweetness is literally perfect it's all of the best parts of the eating frosted flakes experience but elevate it a little bit it's easy it's quick it's convenient it's delicious yeah exactly i mean you can't have a bowl of frosted flakes when you're driving you know what i mean dennis reynolds dennis reynolds right i feel like i gotta give it a 10. like i'm trying to find a flaw in it and i really i just don't see a flaw and i mean when something is as perfect as it could possibly be it's really hard to not give it a 10. so i'm giving it a 10. and i don't see any i don't see any uh any disputes here from you ryan so that's true not they're on that challenge flag so that's uh that's pretty encouraging um yeah i mean for two dollars and fifty cents get yourself six portable breakfast bars that are really gonna i mean it if you like frosted flakes at all you're gonna love them you're just gonna love them probably love them more than frosted flakes i have a from the archives product for the ages for you guys today there's a cereal that exists i don't think any of us could have guessed [Laughter] this is the fred meyer z100 morning zoo flakes serial from 1990. ryan can you believe that a morning show dj cast of characters in portland got their own cereal that is amazing from a local grocery store chain now granted it's kroger owned i mean it's a big it's a big grocery store the backside has the jammin salmon's cross weird puzzle where you have to know things about the radio station its characters and the music that it plays i don't think anybody has ever completed this puzzle in human history this one is just one i was really glad to add to my collection there's an instagram account that actually subscribes to our youtube channel his name is serial stash i believe and um he reached out to me and asked me to check out his page and i actually kind of stole the idea of these from him because he posted a picture of one and i was like okay i'm buying those so i found it on ebay and ended up picking them up and it was one of the smarter purchases that i have ever made on the next volume there's no more cereals for one more for one week next week is an important one for our morning routines though because it's combining coca-cola with coffee it's all five flavors of the coca-cola with coffee line of energy drinks i don't know what do you call that soda coffee liquid carbonated liquid please come back on a monday for that and of course until next time i will miss you until i see you go and get yourself a 10. this stuff is good", "7G0A2WJNFRw": "welcome back he tours and welcome back to quest labs as some of you may know by the previous two videos we got into the quest lab we've got one of everything of the new products that they've got coming out we're trying them on the show to you know show you what's coming down the pipeline today new product we got protein crunch bars now these are supposed to be cereal bars I've got waffle I have two peanut butter and chocolate and these are 100 calorie bars something interesting about it is that on the back you know each one is a hundred calories from fat 35 total carbs 18 dietary fiber six sugars 10 but it also says down here at the bottom uh minus nine grams from a yellows now I've never heard of alyuh lows so it could be one of those weird like new things or something that we're gonna have to research but it says that you should take it away and this alone half 3.net cards it does kind of explain what alice is on the packaging so the locale calorie monosaccharides that contributes point2 calories per gram the FDA requires all Manos set set rides and I'm not saying that right sorry to be counted in the sugar section of the nutrition facts panel even though a Lilo's isn't metabolize like oh sugars there are almost 10 grams of a loose in this product which contributes less than 2 calories per mark and it tells you to learn more on the website yeah so we'll do our own research on that but let's go ahead and try these out and see what they taste like there is a bit of a calorie difference on the peanut butter one it has 10 more calories in it then a waffle I'm pretty excited about the waffle I'm really excited about sorry that we don't do these all online video because I don't want to eat all this and once I know if we ate every product it would be like four or five thousand calories just in one sitting and the next I'll enjoy going to gym do yoga except I do not want to do that all day just opening this you can just smell the the waffle you're going to get that close to smell it I can't smell it who are these scientific method good whatever oh yeah it's on the waffle yeah scientific miss it works it smells like cinnamon toast crunch I can't get my pack a few opening probably just has gone with them okay I have succeeded good drop some distracted the drone treat yeah this is pretty awesome um a little heavy on maple syrup but yeah pretty awesome I would buy these I'd buy lots of these this is like good I'm the peanut butter is really prominent what you wouldn't like it yeah um I think the only downside for me is that it's kind of crumbly yeah kind of like the chewy oatmeal yeah and I wasn't prepared for it's not a bad thing but I wasn't prepared for the texture yeah it's like cereal or yeah how I never really enjoyed cereal bars a little problem right now thanks I'm glad that you're supportive and all mine dislikes and I try by on your block woman you go anyway that's it for this episode I would definitely buy the waffle and I would buy a lot of them they come in six packs that are like 12 99 or 1499 I think for six pack um the make on that is intense it is intense they taste like legitimately I have a waffle you just wrap a piece of bacon around this go to town I mean straight up like a waffle or get a some key dough fried chicken and eat it with this and you got some chicken and waffles that'd be pretty tasty yeah anyway if you want to join the quest labs just go to the quest lab website there is a waiting list there's no telling how long it'll take to get in but until that point you can always come back here for trying new things so until the next episode we'll see you later", "Yd_9P56xlh4": "Stop! You're making me laugh! Now I have an eyelash in my eye. Hi guys, I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode\nof Laura in the Kitchen, I wnat to share a really quick and easy treat with you that's\nso perfect for this time of year, these are my fruity rice crispy treats, now I made them\nnot too long ago for a party I went to which was a first birthday party, and everyone raved! They've been around for a while, I keep seeing\npictures pop up of these and I figured I wanted to share with you because it really is the\nperfect treat to bring to a party whether it be Easter or a birthday or a baby shower\nor even a wedding shower, they're so fun and they're absolutely delicious because I make\nmine a little extra gooey and they're so good, the texture of these is just bomb diggity,\nand I think you are going to love them. You can be playful with the cereal that you\nuse but I think that this particular combination which is sort of the classic version of fruity\ncrispy treat is the best, and the combination of the extra marshmallows and stuff just makes\nthem to die for. Don't take my word for it, just make them,\nyou'll understand and when I posted the picture of these on my Instagram stories, which if\nyou don't follow me there you should, link down below, everyone, I literally got hundreds\nof people asking for the recipe so I'm going to share it with you because it's a great\none to have in your back pocket and you can have your kids help you make them and if my\nkid wasn't outside playing bubbles right now, she may be in here too, but those are way\nmore fun. The list of ingredients is very short and\nsweet, you'll need a combination of your rice cereal and your fruity cereal, now you don't\nwant to do half and half because it'll be too strong of a fruity flavor, so I do three\nquarters of the rice cereal and one quarter of the fruity, but you can do half and half,\nyou can do whatever your heart desires because you're the boss apple sauce. You need lots and lots of mini marshmallows,\nyou need some unsalted butter, then you'll need some vanilla and a pinch of sea salt. The sea salt might sound crazy, they don't\ntaste salty but it makes them - salt in sweets does the same thing that it does in savory\nfood, it sort of brings everything to life, it opens up your palette and it makes something\ntaste even more delicious. So in a big pot, we need butter, I never follow\nthe ingredients on the back of the box because they're just not gooey enough for me and that's\njust not how I roll, and I also do not put this amount of rice crispy treat mixture in\na 9 by 13 because nobody wants a thin rice crispy treat! I want a thick gooey delicious rice crispy\ntreat, so for this amount, a 9 by 9 is perfect, a 9 by 9 pan, if you use a 9 by 13 and you\nget thin rice crispy treats, I'm going to come over! Don't let me catch you do that, use a 9 by\n9 because if you're going to make a treat you might as well go all the way, right? I'm just going to wait for the butter to melt,\nI don't want to burn this and I don't want to brown it because I do love brown butter\nin regular rice crispy treats, but with the fruity flavor it comes a little bit off for\nme, so I'm just going to melt this until it's just about fully melted and then we add in\nthe marshmallows. Beautiful! Now you're going to add all of your marshmallows,\nand you're just going to cook this on medium-low heat, I don't want to burn the marshmallows,\nyou're just going to cook this until everything just melts and this is when I like to add\nmy pinch of salt. You don't need a lot, you could use regular\ntable salt but I like sea salt. And you just mix mix mix until all the marshmallows\nare pretty melted. That looks so ooey gooey. I'm going to add a splash of vanilla. Stir that in, oh it already smells so good. As soon as that vanilla hits, you're in business. Then you add your cereal. Mix that all in, I'm telling you these were\nsuch a giant hit at the party, and that's when I knew I had to share it with you because\nI mean, you just don't know. It's like a crime and it's funny because every\ntime on my Instagram if I share something in my stories, a recipe that you know could\nbe a really simple thing that I haven't shared with you here, so many people get mad at me\nthey're like you have to share it and then I'll reply and be like \"it's so easy!\" and\nthey're like \"Who cares! You're the queen of easy, we just need your\nsimple recipes and ideas\" and so no matter how easy things are I have decided I will\nshare them with you so I don't get all that. Alright, so everything's mixed, I turned this\noff. That is the best part that's stuck on the\nwooden spoon, but I'm not going to embarrass myself right now. I'm just going to get it all off of here. Oh look at that! See how ooey and gooey those are going to\nbe? Trust your girl. And then I've got a 9 by 9 inch pan ready\nand waiting, these are going to be thick and gorgeous. Now, they're really hard to spread with a\nspatula so take your hand, dip it in some water, and press them down. If it keeps sticking, just keep re-dipping\nin that water and that will make everything not stick. See? Alright, just want to pat these down as even\nas you can manage, and don't worry that it's really hot, it's warm but it's really not\nthat hot. Because once the marshmallows melted Ijust\nturned off the heat. Alright this is looking good, now these just\nneed to sit cool and set. Sit cool and set, I should have that on a\nT-Shirt.

the Cheerios and the strawberries and then now we just are harbor's using our large scoop to scoop it into the snack bar maker and then what's gonna happen is you just kind of fill it into your wells

friends and I brought together some of them to kind of come up with their own combinations and we put them on the wall and those have been the most popular items here we also serve the ice cream

determines the number of kilos needed to make up the cereal recipe the ground corn is placed in the dryer unit an important step before they're cooked again to give them a nice flat shape the corn kernels are crushed in the flake roller two rollers turn opposite to each other and the kernels fall into the constricted space between them the conveyor spirits the flakes away and transports them to the oven [Music] they're shaken to make sure they will be uniformly browned the flakes exit the oven well browned this vibrating conveyor sorts the flakes and retains only the right sized ones and a drum mixes the flakes and sprays them with a sweet solution at a scalding 230 degrees centigrade the sweet solution is drying under rake uniformly spreads out the frosted flakes on the canvas next they add the all-important vitamins the cereals are placed into this rotating drum and the vitamins sprayed onto the flakes by a series of jets the breakfast cereal is now finished and heads towards

cereal bar the honey it kind of adds like as a sweetness in there and then obviously materials it looks like it's brand-new container open that surprised my daughter Hezekiah it loves peanut butter I'm gonna okay I'm gonna save three scoops peanut butter any better sa honey anterior as you can tell it's really sticky if you make this with your child I'm sure they would love to be helping you mix it obviously don't give them a butter knife you can give them a plastic spoon and they would love to help I'm sure as you're doing it they would definitely be licking their fingers which would be a good sign but it's all about like really learning how to do it it's like always process over product and obviously like we don't want to be like wasting a lot of food during this but it's definitely a good experience for your children after you've mixed it up put it in your little container and make sure you spread it out in here obviously I need to make some more but then after it's in here and it's all made you put it in the frigerator for about an hour just enough for it to harden and then you can cut it into little bars and then you're happy to enjoy thank you for watching", "RZFltj1fF0U": "[Music] [Music] do [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "WDi0mEK5UAc": "so today we are gonna do a review that bomb on the cereal snack bar things whatever them these are the king-sized cereal bars in Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Lucky Charms and I'm really excited because I've had these before I've had this Cinnamon Toast Crunch I have not had Lucky Charms before and I'm really excited so I'm gonna go ahead and get started and just start eating all right let me put the phone down just a second let me get this open sorry about that drop the phone so as soon as you open both of these I open them from the back this is what the back looks like it's got some sort of like icing layer it says marshmallow on or I think it's supposed to have marshmallows in it remember them I thought it was supposed to be marshmallow I think this is supposed to be like the milk that's in you know the cereal bar I'm gonna smell these and show you guys what they smell like so this one is like rasuu / cinnamony cinnamon is weird cinnamony it smells so good kind of was like cinnamon rolls or like when you eat Donald's used to have Cinna bites or whatever they were what's good and then this one smells kinda like Christmas cookies it isn't smell pretty I don't know why I thought it's just marshmallows but yeah that's the closest thing I can compare it to is like Christmas cookies I'm gonna go ahead and get started and I'm gonna try this one first and save you know the new thing for last this is what the front looks like it's got like a drizzle of that icing over it zoom in and it's got little pieces of cereal it looks like some sort of maybe like brown sugar glaze on it or something it looks really good here's the other side I wish you guys could smell this right now I'm just gonna go ahead and take a bite what if we became around mmm this is so good it's alright I cut off as I was saying a little bit of icing at the bottom tastes just like somehow just cinnamon toast crunch it's Royce it makes us seasonable like you're just being plain scared she's really gonna like it's not dry but a little bit of icing that was so good I give that five out of five stars I love this one whenever I'm looking for a snack at the gas station I always choose the Seawind toast crunch bar is so good and really satisfying sorry about that guys how to put you down for a minute again alright this I'm gonna say it like a vanilla cookie or something this is what it looks like you can see pieces of cereal it's got like a sticky glaze making it stick all together and you can see all the marshmallows inside I'm actually pretty excited about this here's the other side just in case you're curious there's that same icing layer appreciates the same names like icing that's on the other one this one does not have the drizzle on top like the cinnamon toast crunch says but we're gonna go ahead and give it a go mmm mhm you know more about this is good so it is just like Lucky Charms cereal maybe sweeter actually because I've got some sort of glaze on the side and of course icing and when you bite into the marshmallows like it goes perfectly with the icing that's underneath it's just like awesome I think that's why it smells so sweet and I don't know if Anila is the right word I'm looking for but I think it's a combination of the icing and the marshmallows the marshmallows is probably what I'm smelling it is really satisfying I like it a lot out of the two I still like the cinnamon toast crunch better but this is still a really good snack bar I really like it a lot would I get it again yes I would it's really good I'm satisfied with this bar really happy I picked it up so that was my review of these two breakfast bars [Music] so again thank you guys for watching if you want go out and try these they're really good and then throw Bertha if you're hungry for a snack I hope you guys have a good day", "keMNZUpnnU4": "hi and welcome to universal interiors I'm Liz Engel stead and I get to do a little sharing today of one of those summertime treats well you definitely can make it in the wintertime because I do a lot of that my son Jay says a hockey buddies and I try to make some treats from now and then and this is by far seems to be the most popular and bonus for you super simple so what I've done is taken about a half a cup butter melted it on down and then anywhere from just about the whole package of marshmallows down to 3/4 of them depending upon what size of plate you need to put it in any house so now what I'm going to do is I've already got it melted butter and now I've melted up the marshmallows just enough so we're gonna stir that all up it's kind of like actually making rice krispies bars you don't use quite as much butter and you're gonna just stir up this little marshmallow business and have that for the bottom and you stir that up and hopefully it's melted pretty good generally it's a it gets a little big puppies today so it's a little bit but there's not a right or wrong marshmallow and anybody that knows anything about marshmallows you got to just kind of throw it to the wind if you're thinking a health food snack right now when you're looking at marshmallows but we are going to need a second in and grab spoon handy they have one more of those now melted just like a rice krispies bar but before you would put in cereal you're gonna take a good now you see that's a tablespoon and I call it a wallop does that work most of you bakers out there you know what a wallop is that's what I've just put in there so it's acting kind of like your butter and your peanut butter together and we're gonna just stir that up and get it there's the healthy parts but just like what union I always encourage you all to doodle while you do anything to hold the core in that's what I forgot to tell you right away but if you do that it's gonna be healthier for you in the long run so now it's gonna turn that melted peanut butter it's gonna be kind of just like you would having making cookies soft enough and you take to your trusted cheerio box that's what I picked here and you can do it with a few different things honey nuts or whatever you might care for and I'm just going to pour it in there you could certainly measure it like some people do do about three cups or so I just kind of keep on going until it looks like hmm that might be enough I hope you know what that means you rice krispy makers out there I don't like to go and either the kids seem to like it to be having so packed that you don't have any room for anything but a bunch of cereal so just a little bit beyond the goose stage that's where we're after so I'm going for a little bit more Cheerios right now and this seriously is so easy to do you guys one of the things in the summertime and again I'm just kind of picking on summer hence the season but in the winter kids love treats and moms I know it's tough to get time to do that but sometimes I mean kids in the kitchen for Pete's sakes my mom always let us do that once we hit maybe the middle school years you can try it a little earlier but it's best to get to about middle school and you have this great your school snack so now you see how Joey now nobody has to do this but the best part about cheerio bars is thrown in chocolate chips and getting super gooey so here I go into the bag Tucker chips I picked this up at Central Market where you can get just enough that you don't have to open up the whole bag if you want to be careful about the chocolate intake but my am I getting gooey today I feel like a little child playing in the mud or dirt or whatever you want to call it yep there we go a little while ago we got to do a show on a hodgepodge and I kind of feel like that's what I'm doing with food today but now we've mixed just enough chocolate and we're gonna stir that on up and you once this is gets in there you don't want to stir too much but once you get that all kind of blended in there you see that how it is that kind of texture well you're gonna look for is depending upon you can have a 9 by 13 pan if I had that handy I've used that or you can use a little small cake pan if you want to go thicker but what you're gonna do is just dump it right on in there and the bonus about these bars is you really don't even need to do that if you are at home and you have a couple of hungry pals you know what you do you take a big glob well glob might not be the the word for it but you know what I mean it take a big old spoonful you put it right on there and you have yourself yep cereal bars you can do it a couple of ways like ice into the pan cut them on up you can put in the fridge you can keep it just like that to work too but what I was gonna share on this issue of making treats I kind of cleaned kids treats for kids maybe your husband it's okay to treat yourself now and then but one of the things that I love to talk to kids about and grown-ups is just that we have different gifts we all have gifts and there's languages of gifts if that makes sense to you some of you may know what I'm talking about but there's love languages out there some of you desire to have gifts of touch some of them like some gifts of time or somebody might want a gift of just to serve that's how you give your gift of love and there is five again I almost hit them all one is touch when you make treats like this you can kind of combine the whole works at the same time and use all those love languages and make a lot of people happy so that's what I'm kind of doing in this part of the show again maybe you don't have to get quite this gooey to prove the point but again you can do some touch with this or service sharing it with others or time spent with your kids or just having affirmation just telling each other while you're making this in that kitchen or got something for them just because they're special maybe it's an after school schools almost underway sorry guys yep it's true kids don't want to hear me talk about that but it's true right around the corner and we can make treats it doesn't have to be hard we just really kind of have lost the art of just spending a little time in the kitchen with your kids or with a friend do something this simple and let it go you can have a treat for a day you don't have to be uptight have yourself some marshmallows that's in a while it's okay I should appreciate you guys coming listening and have a beautiful day you", "lgg7YOF940I": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] how's it going all you guys and girls the elimination time the jump aboard the loom drain this meets me it's DJ DJ DJ double J the Eliminator here the sweet one also known by almost countless other aliases and nicknames but we won't get into that right now today I'd like to do a little review on something that that I buy every now and then different flavors different things but they're from Walmart a great value of fruit and green bars these happen to be apple cinnamon they are low in calories 130 calories only 3 grams of fat the sugar content not a hundred percent queasy about that with a 24 percent of the daily sugar allowed for the day if a 2,000 calorie diet so that's not the greatest but on these right here pick them up at Walmart they have all different flavors and and and stuff like that so I thought maybe today I would review this for all you people wondering is it really worth it's about I'd say it's a bowl for four and a half inches big maybe five stretching it across the package makes it look like it's bigger but let's see how this tastes I'll show you what it looks like try not to devour the package too too much that's about half of it right there a lot of people call these breakfast bars or snack bars stuff with that definitely not granola this is one of the breakfast bars it tastes kind of like a like a soft biscuit like something like a Fig Newton but a very soft Fig Newton not those cheapy Fig Newton bars that they have but let's see what this tastes like the apple on cinnamon tastes very familiar it almost tastes like it almost tastes like the the Apple bars you know the Apple Fig Newtons book as a consistency like oatmeal without being very chunky like oatmeal I think that these are I mean for a little snack I'm a big guy so you're having a little snack like this it's mind over matter you just have to drink a lot of water that's what I do with my diet I've been true excuse me I should add some water right now I'm just talking chewing in everything that's why it's not that they're they're not drying dosti or anything they're very good but I drink a lot of water too so it kind of it fills up the stomach more but these are very it's a serving size one is a serving size I think they used to have two in a package back in the day now it's just one but you know that's life anyway these our apple fruit and green bars I think they're very good I think they were getting from Walmart you know I give these an eight out of ten when it comes to these type of breakfast bars some of them are really like I mean you need a gallon of water to get through them they're really crunchy once and I'm not a big fan of that so these I highly recommend that's about it for today I love you all take care stay safe does the illuminator and I'll be back I probably shouldn't start the roaster with my mouth but I'm a dye so [Music] [Music] I really don't mind the slop but could I at least have a clean ball", "m-p_V43DsUE": "so before you roaring out the word lion this is Nestle lion breakfast cereal which is new this yeah so the I've sinned lions I believe I've seen a lion scenario we just kind of play on the lion bar chocolate bar so they've tried to spin it up a little bit by bringing out are you cereal bar this is yep caramel and chocolate and these all the things oh good to know as well as stuff that's in it yeah and well enjoy your breakfast make sure you have enjoyed breakfast with fruit dairy and water so yes make sure you have a mixture of things now they made the barcode into a lump of grass into like some grass that's interesting this I found in pound land and they have this convenient opening is way like in the flesh mom join the flesh who not for individual sale I guess you can get these individually it kinda looks were thinkin lion bar would look like underneath without all of the chocolate on the outside based on the bottom smells are knots more cereal based than the actual chocolate bar that is for sure hmm chocolatey cereal kinda like cocoa puffs but obviously not cuz its nest name not other company let's invite so we have a very was serial based obviously cuz it's here real chocolatey a little bit caramely yeah kind of I'm gonna say bland plain kind of missing something maybe because I really would like a line bar right now a regular Lyon bar but you take what you will and sometimes you just have to have a serial based one which is still quite nice but yeah not for me it's not for me quite nice but not for me maybe it's for you you better try maybe", "tYF1dQRVS2c": "hey guys I'm Nick and on this episode of the screen one I'm going to show you guys how to make this so this cake is basically a cake version of my Saturday morning cupcakes so the idea behind those cupcakes was how you know when I was little and I don't have a TV in the house I don't do this but every Saturday morning was about watching cartoons and having my favorite breakfast cereal you could get up early I don't know why you want to get up early when you're a kid when you have to get up for school but anyway the cartoons must have been really good that's what this cake is inspired by it's a breakfast cereal cake now the good thing about this cake is you can pretty much use any kind of cereal you like you can use your favorite cereal in this cake let's get stuck into the recipe okay guys so we're going to start off by popping some cornflakes all your favorite cereal into a large jug along with some milk and you're going to let that soak give it a bit of a mix let it soak for about ten minutes you want to get that cereal nice and soft now while that's soaking want to pop your flour sugar baking powder and salt into a large mixing bowl mixer on low speed until everything is well combined then you want to add your softened butter and mix that into your rich a crumbly samo texture then you're gonna add that milk with the soaked cereal some eggs oil Greek yogurt some vanilla extract and mix until everything is really well combined now guys for this recipe actually gonna have to double the recipe the reason I've shown it in this way and instruct you to double the recipe in the written recipe is because nobody has a bowl at home big enough including me to actually make the entire full recipe so you'll need to make it in two goes now once you've mixed you want to stop and scrape down the bowl just to make sure everything is mixed in properly to see at the bottom there's a little bit of flour then you're gonna add some more of your favorite cereal I'm using something called Froot Loops one of my all-time favorite cereals when I was now guys I'm gonna fold this in this is completely optional adding more cereal because I did find that it kind of went a little bit stale when I baked it so if I was making this again I'd probably leave out that extra cereal you want to spray an 8-inch cake tin with some oil and then you're gonna pop your butter in there now I did double the recipe like I mentioned earlier and I've split this amongst three different cake tins 8-inch cake tins we're gonna bake these for about 50 minutes and then we're gonna let them cool down completely before we frost them now I actually bake these a day before I decorated and let them chill in the fridge overnight now while your cake is baking and cooling I'm gonna make a little bit of a milk paste now the reason I'm doing this is because what do we all have with our cereal milk in some formula or another we all have milk in our cereal so I want to make that frosting taste like milk so I'm gonna add a little bit of hot water into a mixing bowl and I'm gonna add some milk powder so you can use skim or full cream I'm using full cream and we're just going to add one teaspoon at a time to start with get it nice and mixed in there so everything is nice and smooth and dissolving then you're gonna keep on adding more and more and more until you get to a paste consistency now if it's lovely just keep mixing until it's nice and smooth let that cool down a little bit before you add it to your frosting I'm using a hand mixer to mix that in it takes about five minutes to actually mix in properly into the frosting so you want to start off by adding a little bit of frosting first get it mixed in and then add the rest of your frosting at cakes baked and cooled so I'm actually you're just gonna trim the top of these instead of cutting them in half again because of that cereal in there it's a little bit tricky to cut so instead of using a cake leveler I'm using a large serrated knife you want to do this nice and slowly and carefully now because this the caramelized because of that extra sugar in there we are going to use a large seven inch cake ring I kind of like a large cookie cutter I'm gonna cut that caramelization off a little dab of vanilla buttercream frosting actually that's that milk frosting that I made earlier onto your cake board and we're just gonna spread it a little bit there it's gonna help that cake you stick to the cake board we're at our first layout put some buttercream on top of that spread it nice and evenly with a small offset spatula and then that you want to sprinkle some cereal in there again completely optional add a couple of dabs of extra frosting so that the next layer can speak and you're gonna repeat this until you get to the top we're gonna frost some more of that frosting on the outside in the top spread it evenly get it nice and covered this is called the crumb coat it's going to help trap the crumbs in the first layer so they don't show in the second layer of frosting you want to chill this in the fridge for at least two or three hours get it nice and chilled before we move on to finishing it off and decorating we're gonna add some more frosting on there I'm using a cake leveler or today I learned it's also called a dough scraper and we're going to level off that frosting get it nice and smooth on the outside and the top and then what we're gonna do is we're going to add some fruity pebbles on the slide now if you're in Australia and if you're in Victoria you can find this at a store called USA foods or I'm pretty sure you can just order it online if you're in America of course it's pretty much available everywhere so we're gonna start off really heavy at the bottom and then kind of spread it out as we get to the top giving it that kind of classic this grin line look so it's kind of like an ombre of sprinkles so I'm using a French tip a Wilton 6b tip to pipe some swirls on top of that milk buttercream frosting and we're gonna finish these off with some fruity pebbles on top now guys the good thing about this cake is like I said you can use any type of cereal that you like and that's pretty much it [Music] okay guys said that was my Saturday morning cake I hope you guys enjoyed watching this video I want you guys to let me know what your favorite cereal was or is to eat and what your favorite cartoon was or is to

quite enthralled smells like a cinnamon bun there's your gratuitous shot of the bar a little bit of glaze on it and this one was in my cooler too not quite as crisp as the waffle one was yesterday but they're all pretty similar texture wise there's a shot of the inside of it kind of like a puffed rice or something like that anyway real nice cinnamon flavor not overly sweet just like the other ones man I can't decide which one I like the best they're all good let me have to get a few more yeah these are definitely definitely a winter quest keep up the great work of the regular style bars that came out this year my favorite by far was the blueberry muffin but these cereal bars I'm hard-pressed to decide which one I like the best they're all good I'd rotate them through like I said I don't

with a post halloween 2015 review of the count chocula treat size cereal bar I guess is what it is yeah that's just what I format mini that's still minnie minnie sighs i guess i just read size right it's Count Chocula the seasonal cereal you may know and love that in a cereal bar form now so Count Chocula is a general mills cereal like not this it's a serial normally like a breakfast cereal introduced in 1971 General Mills came out with Count Chocula and Franken berry I don't know if these were available overseas but they were available in in the United States and any Canada and and then they subsequently augmented the line with fruit bright sorry blueberry fruit bright and then which was discontinued and eventually replaced by yummy mummy so basically their corn cereal like a corn-based breakfast cereal with marshmallows in it so you can tell they're healthy right Count Chocula of course playing off Dracula was was one of the first ones alongside Frankenberry so jacque camp chocolate was obviously the chocolate flavor one Frankenberry is like a pink strawberry flavored breakfast cereal and and then Boo Berry was a ghost and that had blue you know bullet blueberries and then I'm tremor what yummy mummy was I think yummy moving was like a mix of different flavors yummy mummy was the one that was only around every once in a while after after some time I guess it was probably in the 90s maybe they stopped producing the serials on you know on a regular basis and they only actually produced them seasonally and they still do produce these seasonally so in september-october if you go to the grocery store you'll be able to buy Count Chocula and Franken berry and sometimes boo berry cereal but just for those months and then it's discontinued much like you know a cream egg is available only for Easter these cereals are only available at Halloween they are horribly like they're not good for the serials they're like it's like eating lucky charms I like count chocula though I thought it was okay my parents would never let me have super sugar cereals when I was a kid so haha got you back now I guess considering how much candy I eat in 2010 they General Mills came out with the count chocula cereal bars I have never seen it before now it's 2015 so I don't know maybe they were only available in the United States not available where i live in canada I know they also came up with some fruit roll-ups in 2010 as well but I don't think they had a chocolate fruit roll-up because that would be a little weird wouldn't it maybe no anyway so this is a cereal bar but a super sugar cereal cereal bar is not your typical nutrigrain you know quasi healthy cereal bar your bars I don't think generally are actually very healthy they just try to play them off as healthy so look at that so it's a chocolate cereal with marshmallows and the marshmallows and chocolate chips maybe at least in the cereal bar I think the marshmallows are in the cereal themselves are shaped like bats if i'm not mistaken what's the orange here i wonder huh just frosting maybe no hmm smells pretty good smells like super sugary let's give it a try huh mm-hmm very sugary yup oh yeah ah really cheap chocolate marshmallows delicious it's funny because not even that I had this very often because obviously like I said my parents would never let me get Count Chocula only had the actual serial a handful of times but um you know that like breakfast cereal marshmallow it's it's just this like iconic sort of like like terrible freeze-dried kind of marshmallow little flavor that you know it's just designed to like well this marshmallow is going to have a you know shelf life of 10 years tell me probably most marshmallows actually have a quite a long shelf life but boy oh boy yep yep yep yep so I thought that this was a chip but it's actually a marshmallow that that is what the marshmallows are in here they're just round blobs not like I'm bat shaped or whatever they are it's got this like it's like the kind of marshmallow that has like a like a crusted outer outer shell like super hard kind of so it won't lose its shape and then and then the inside is just like I don't know it's got a different texture than like a stay puft that's for sure the cereal around it is really reminiscent of uh of I don't know it actually has the consistency of a crispy but it's well maybe a little heavier maybe it's like corn pops that would make sense if it is a corn-based cereal right and then like I thought the frosting is just frosting hmmm it's pretty good guys I mean for what it is it's pretty much exactly what I expected and what I expected was the the count shockula breakfast cereal turned into a bar that's what this is um man put this with a glass of milk golden right be great I like it I don't think you're going to be able to find this maybe next year at Halloween keep your eyes open for it but I expect that this is just going to be a seasonal product as well that said the count chocula cereal bar I give it a thumbs up guys this is definitely like a treat don't consider this even remotely healthy but um sure why not if you're a fan of breakfast cereal and I am a fan of breakfast cereal then this is a great extension of the brand and who doesn't love Count Chocula right his fangs are are together did you guys ever notice that chuckles fangs are together like like a rabbit or some hey I love him he's great great design guys good work walking candy i was going to rate the count chocula a cereal bar I'm going to rate it a 4 out of 5 good

now I got a cereal bar that I think will absolutely love so remember our friend who's telling us about the rice cereal right I got rice cereal and I got oatmeal okay and since you said max is cool with nut allergies no problems with that I have almonds although alman is not really a nut it's really a fruit some really organic raisins so that's the dry now what I'm doing is I'm just gonna mix the dry up like this right okay and then I'm gonna now take the wet so I have brown rice syrup now if you grab that almond butter almond butter okay give me your give me a nice couple of spoonfuls right of that right inside then a little honey and then like a good bottle of wine I'll tell you when and then you're gonna turn the bottle the other way I've said okay that's good all right a little almond extract like a quarter of a teaspoon to start with now we're gonna have vanilla okay and the same kind of a little more than an almond that almonds pretty strong then we have a little nutmeg you got to be careful with this I can always give you the back of a spoon cuz you want to add about that munch okay and you're gonna add a little bit more about three times out of cinnamon okay I can handle that now we'll take that whisk and we'll start whisking that up for me is there a particular consistency that and I'm looking for you want it to be spreadable okay I'm ever so serious doubt as it whether that's gonna mix up I'm tell you some real sick but what I did is I took some parchment I just kind of did a little fold like that and i buttered it a little law canola spray again what we're gonna do now is we're gonna make like a little tunnel in here okay all right let me have it such as all good lemme yeah I have every bit of it see how it's nice and smooth like that number all right now I'm gonna fold this mixture right in its gonna make like this little ball now what's the shelf life on something like this this will be a very good an airtight container for at least four or five days at least we're gonna take the mixture we're gonna put it right inside and what we're going to do now Roy is this is we're going to press it really just press it real good and what we're going to do is we're just going to fold them over fold this over and fold it over now that I don't have anything to worry about with my hands okay I can really press this down okay then you're gonna put the oven on 350 degrees and you're gonna bake it inside of the oven for about 30 to 40 minutes and then what's gonna happen is it's gonna look just like this you let it cool a little bit peel this back and then you have this incredible cereal bar that's so healthy and so delicious", "CMLXxhC-yFE": "Dejan health food catalog was a Huggins we have nutrigrain soft baked apple cinnamon cereal bar by Kellogg's our review these because people look at this type of food and believe that it's good and this is a good nutrition ooh alternative for breakfast but as we see as we look at the back that this thing has 12 grams of sugar which is higher to start your day off it has natural artificial flavors which is both being it has a list of more than 30 items of host sodium calcium whatever that's not good I will not buy this I would not take this as a good option for breakfast when we're trying to lose weight and let live healthy thank you and join us again for seahawk is food catalog", "ggIfIS2-DEk": "is there a box top on these not to have something recording yeah we've got ourselves a little blast from the past a little nostalgia if you will there are new cereal bars and they come in the froot loop and frosted flake variety recently michelle you showed me a little bracket of sorts where people were voting on their favorite cereals and what was what was the result of that was it like honey nut cheerios one it i think it was like honey bunches of oats was the overall winner oh okay and then i think it was up against captain crunch but honey nut cheerios was definitely in in the final four and i can't remember the other thing that was in the final four but it was like a big surprise that lucky charms didn't go any farther froot loops may not have even made the list um it made the list but i don't think it moved forward right i think another one that went far was like crunch berry captain crunch berry but i think frosted flakes was the other thing that was in um the top four all that being said we have here some cereal bars not the actual cereal so anybody who is of our age will remember the cereal bars that came out in the past and i can't remember what the flavors were i think it was captain crunch and i think um the honey nut cheerios and i don't i can't remember if like lucky charms was one of the og's too that remind i think you might be right on that but you know we'd have to go back and do research anyway kellogg's has come out with some new cereal bars and i'm guessing that that milk layer is going to taste very similar to how i remember it before which is kind of like a frosting that's the best way to describe it not exactly a frosting but kind of a frosting um so yeah should we just pop these open and give them a try sure there is no box top on these big disappointment okay let's go with the froot loops first okay i am kind of surprised on the color of the froot loops that they chose and they're usually like a blue yeah where the heck is kind of green right yeah they have those colors and i think i think everything except for blue has been represented so here is what they look like they are very small as you can see but i'm sure they are still sugar filled i wonder if they're smaller than when we had them yeah i remember something much bigger so i now you might remember better than me i used to think that it was in the middle um i i think i remember it being on the bottom but it was definitely like one layer this looks like they just kind of like quickly dipped it and that was it yeah because you can kind of see gaps on the bottom of this too now it definitely smells like froot loops oh yeah so let's see how this tastes this does not remind me of that layer before but i might be going crazy so let's just try it and see all right so let's rate our fruit loop one in three in two in one and rate oh oops oh that's okay so we oh i'm having fruit loop withdrawal we both are going indifferent on this and my reason well michelle why don't you give us your reason first um yeah i kind of had high hopes for this because i really do like fruit loops but they're kind of soggy all it tastes like to me is froot loops i do not think that that bottom thing added anything and like michelle said it's not really crispy like froot loops so um it's also kind of messy so as we've done some stuff before where we could say well on the go this would probably work on the go you're probably gonna have sticky fingers unless you just eat it out of like the packaging yeah sticky fingers and crumbs everywhere right yeah so i i have to go in different it does taste like fruit loops but it's not something you have to go out and try if you've had fruit loops you know what this tastes like again that bottom layer it's basically just there to try to hold the bar together and it doesn't even do a great job yeah and like i said i feel like the ones before like it was like a solid layer of that not just like a quick dip and like yeah okay yeah agreed like yeah i remember that too like it was actually a thing like you know it wasn't like they just had a liquid that was sitting there and like the machine dips and then the next one comes in yeah it was like they laid it on and yeah it formed to the bar exactly all right well let's go ahead and try these frosted flake ones we'll see if this tastes any different like this one's even smaller okay so this the bottom of this one looks a little bit more of what i remember um they've packed it on a bit more here yeah no where the last one smelled just like froot loops this one smells like nothing very odd maybe frosted flakes don't have a distinctive smell though i don't thought they did but yeah we ready to rake these frosted flakes cereal bars this is a tricky one i think in three in two in one rate i'm kind of middle almost up okay i'm going thumbs down because what it reminds me of is a like rice krispie treat but i think rice krispie treats are better so for that we don't even like rice krispie treats i do not so for that reason that's why i'm kind of giving it a thumbs down the first few bites of it were very strange and then and maybe that was because i just ate the froot loop one but then i was able to get a bit more of like that frosted flake taste but again that bottom layer is not really doing anything except holding it together and probably just adding the sweetness and the calorie count up which i know doesn't really matter for this channel we don't care about that but if it's not adding anything to me then i don't really see the point of it so i'm gonna go thumbs down for that reason so i was actually a little bit different because this one compared to the froot loops one reminded me more of the ones we had back in the day um but i'll have to agree like the first bite or two it was kind of like almost no taste and then the more you ate it like i really got that frosted flake flavor um yeah cause like right now i'm i'm getting a frosted flake like aftertaste and it's very distinct but it was weird it was a weird first couple bites your brain was trying to process what this is is this a rice krispie treat like what am i eating so yeah i mean maybe because i do like rice krispie treats that's why i'm more on the positive side but yeah i like this one better than the fruit loops one i have to say and there you have it our take on the new cereal bars maybe they'll come out with those old ones again i'd love to see those old lucky child's ones i know lucky charms is out actually oh okay so i don't know if you want me to go pick those up yeah pick those up let's grab them all let's bring in the lucky charms and see what we think we'll have our own bracket yeah our own bracket of cereal just between us because if anyone really cares yeah we got that's going to be the next big improvement to the studio is a big old white board that can be the bracket so anyway look forward to that peace bye", "vZc9mz1vL1Y": "fruity pebble roll-ups hello everyone start off with you'll need a large bowl and four cups of miniature marshmallows add to that three tablespoons of butter put this in the microwave for about one minute to one minute thirty seconds until the marshmallows are all puffy and the butter is melted and then stir it together to get something that's nice and smooth if you don't want to do this in the microwave you can do it in a large pot on the stove on low heat now you add in your fruity pebbles that is six cups of fruity pebbles which are basically like fruit flavored rainbow rice krispies if you can imagine that it tastes a lot like Froot Loops stir that in until all the little fruity pebbles are covered with marshmallow mixture and then turn it out into a large baking dish that's been greased or in my case I used a cookie sheet covered with a silicone mat and spread it around into a very large rectangle about 13 by 9 approximately Pat it down using greased fingers or a greased spatula until it's nice and even and then allow it to cool for about 10-15 minutes and this is what the fruity pebble box it looks like if you're wondering now you're gonna add some filling now the original recipe on the website that I found this used buttercream frosting but I didn't think buttercream frosting would be very good so what I did is I used marshmallow fluff instead and then I added some rainbow sprinkles to give it a little extra touch and then you need to roll it up you can roll it up for whichever end that you want to I started from the narrow end and it just roll it all the way up and then you're going to let it harden and then cut it up into slices I put mine in the refrigerator just to hurry up that last portion of the recipe if you cut it into 1-inch thick slices you'll get about a dozen servings per roll and there it is as you can see those little rainbow sprinkles I put on there are completely lost you can't really see them so you don't have to put those in the other thing is I used marshmallow fluff in these and that made them very good they're delicious they taste like fruity rice krispie squares the problem is that they are very messy to eat people were getting marshmallow fluff on their fingers and on their lips and just really messy so I would recommend if you don't want something super messy I would use buttercream frosting in the center as the filling instead hope you give them a try now because Fruity Pebbles have all the colors of the rainbow I've included them into my rainbow playlist where you'll find everything from a rainbow bread to a rainbow cheese cake if you want to see the videos in this playlist go ahead and click right on your screen or see the link to the playlist in the About section

everything from scratch we make it in small batches as you can see and everything is really fresh and delicious and there's very minimal processing so I just thought today I walk you through that process and show you how it's done so to start out we have two main ingredients these are the two base ingredients that we use in all the bars first we have our organic cashew butter in all this is its organic dry roasted cashews ground down into a into a cashew butter it's it's a really awesome product very clean it's organic it's just a delicious flavorful product then come over here and we've got our organic date paste there's no added sugar you know any of our products there's no added sugar pecan bars we've really rely on the natural sweetness of the organic date paste for all the products so that's that so to start off this is the protein powder we use it's the ascent native way unflavored protein powder it's a really awesome clean product [Music] [Music] that's already been really nicely mixed up so we're gonna just add this is ready to go we're gonna roll it over to our mixer we're gonna mix it up into the [Music] [Music] when you bite into a macaw bar that's the that's the texture that you're getting right there it's just perfectly that's what we want so those are ready to go so you can see there's very minimal processing from start to finish literally just mix up the the raw ingredients down there and then we creamed down here to extrude them into protein bars it's very little processing involved there's no baking these aren't gonna go into the ovens or anything it's just the ingredients your sauce mix up there into the perfect consistency and then loaded into our extruder and we extrude them out into delicious gourmet protein bars that's at night

on Instagram I believe she just sent me the picture of the birthday cake but then Kevin pointed out that they had chocolate chip banana charged it these were 298 at Walmart and they were only a hundred calories of our so I think that's pretty awesome they have eight grams whole grains this has real chocolate chips no high fructose corn syrup - ba-bah Ursa Major is well so which one should we charge let's try the birthday cake I've been disappointing this birthday cake thing well I don't like the Quaker brand and I'll show you this one side is not that great at all and the other side is I've gotta do yeah one side has four goals one side desert there's a sod and is the top and there's the bottom I was good they watch just tell you why that tastes like a regular bar oh man it's good and chewy it's all coconut really mm-hmm I would not call that bark they could I swear it has like a raspberry coconut E okay coconut just takes OD daeho's Brunell love that all right corn syrup I don't know it's okay it's bar it's just a bar you know I don't think dried coconut yeah right there dried coconut yeah it's just it's nothing spectacular just Lauren I said I think it's just our bar regular bar you get anywhere I don't think it's always this point you know like intimate little mini cupcakes they have birthday cake this does not taste like that it's not bad it's just false advertising okay this is the banana chocolate chip so my question for these is it gonna taste like real banana or is it gonna have that fake banana I think it's gonna taste like real banana just because it is a healthy type bar taste our Roblin mm-hmm but it tastes like the brown banana mm-hmm a brown banana almost where you get thrown away mm-hmm not bad it does have a very strong banana flavor but it does taste like if you don't like that flavor of that brown banana you're not gonna walk down no nobody had something else researcher very recently that had that but it was too much yeah it was all gonna be wrong already yeah yeah no really it was it was like a banana this is right there but it's not rotten these I can tolerate yeah it's still some spectacular no but you can definitely taste the chocolate you taste the oats yeah it is the banana you can taste it is what it says it is this is not birthday cake so if you're buying this for birthday cake you're gonna be very very disappointed the only thing great about these is that they're decorated for kids kids will like that they're colorful I can obviously say that I like that better oh you do I do not like them overly ripe banana flavor right I don't like that flavor puts me a little bit I don't have just the plain old granola bar flavor food in that banana flavor well you feel like you're eating something that's oh oh yeah you feel like you really do you feel like you want to check the date on the box to make sure you didn't grab a bad batch he's right out of the - I would definitely rather have the birthday cake I just want you to know that if you're buying it for that for the flavors yeah for those fibers I would now would go ahead and buy your kid the intimus little mini doughnuts or some like that there are more calories but at least you're gonna get what you paid for and not something that doesn't taste like birthday cake at all so we wouldn't buy either one of these guys probably no no no I do think it's cool the amount that you get 400 calories one of ours is produced I think that's nice it's a nice little pick-me-up you can put it in your purse or your backpack or whatever and have it with you if you need something but I won't be buying again for our family so hopefully you enjoyed it links getting to see them out of the package and thanks for watching", "8ll3f_VntGA":

back to my channel my name is Tyler if you're new here and you should totally subscribe if you haven't yet because what the heck are you doing no but you should do it I'm really excited about today's video because I love rice krispie treats I just think they're so delicious and they're like really really easy to make it takes a few ingredients and they're so delicious I don't think they get enough credit so I wanted to try make rice krispies treats but with out rice krispies so I got these variety packs of some of the most popular breakfast cereals I'm going to be using these instead of rice krispies we're gonna see how they come out I'm not gonna be like crushing them up or anything we're just gonna keep them in their true form but should be interesting to see how they come out I'm hoping man's at being like a really yummy marshmallow dessert bar but who the heck knows yeah so I'm gonna try make these and we're gonna test them all out I'm gonna let you guys know which ones are good which ones aren't hopefully they're all good I guess we're gonna find out alright guys so let's get cookin so the first cereal that I decided to do was fruit mousse so for the full recipe you would take 3 tablespoons of butter and melt it in a pot over the stovetop once the butter is melted then you're gonna add 4 cups of marshmallows and mix those around in the pan until they're melted now you want to make sure that you don't have the heat on the stove up too high because then it's gonna burn the marshmallow in the butter you also want to make sure that you go back and stir it kind of frequently so that it doesn't sit there and burn it all once the marshmallow is melted you're gonna add 6 cups of your favorite cereal into the mix and shut the heat off on the stove now keep in mind I minimize this recipe to a smaller scale so that I would be able to make a bunch of different marshmallow treats without wasting a ton of cereal so just keep that in mind it's gonna look like it's a lot more when you're actually doing the full recipe then you're gonna mix up this cereal and marshmallow with a spoon and once it's all mixed you're gonna place it into a pan now just for this experiment I used a cupcake pan just so that would separate the different cereals that I was trying but normally you would put the whole mix into a brownie pan or whatever rectangular pan you would like and then cut them into squares then spray the back of your spoon with some nonstick cooking spray and flatten the cereal ow [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys as you can see I finished making all of the Rice Krispies cereal barcel\u00f3 treat things I'm just waiting for a couple of them to cool completely down what they looks like then I'm gonna take them out of the pan put my plate and we're gonna try them to see what they taste like so I'll be back in a sec okay I'm back and I'm ready to eat these yeah they were pretty easy to get out of the pan I used a nonstick cupcake pan I think I'm a marshmallow on my tongue Bowl not the cleanest of jobs I'm also not the neatest person ever so I had marshmallow literally everywhere overall it's really simple these are all of the ones that I made so I'm just gonna go in and pick one and just start start trying them these are frosted Cheerios so I did frosted cheerios honey nut cheerios and regular Cheerios because I felt like I needed to try them all all right so I'm guess I'm just gonna go in and try it um it's good it's good but I need to try the other Cheerios to come there so let me get like a rejection plate okay so the frosted Cheerios were good but I don't have anything to compare it to so let me try this is the regular Cheerios and I think this might be kind of weird because like regular Cheerios are not sweet at all so having like sweet marshmallow with not speed might be kind of weird but let's see I don't know I definitely like the frosted Cheerios better because it is trying to we're having like a bland cheerio wispy marshmallow egg not my favourite not my favourite it's not horrible that's not my favorite these are honey nut cheerios and I think this might be good because honey nut cheerios are my favourite kind of cheerio you're gonna add their kind of sweet so it's alright I think that the honey flavor with the marshmallow flavor is kind of weird my god I'm never drink water I'm jogging today definitely the order of the Cheerios for me is frosted Cheerios honey nut cheerios regular Cheerios the frosted was deafening the best weird and also I wasn't a huge fan of the texture because they kind of got like chewy and I don't know I think I'm just used to the little regular Rice Krispies but next I'm gonna try Froot Loops I love a good fruit as if there's bad Froot Loops um yeah I love four loops I'm curious yep and this is probably why the fruity pebbles are so good because they taste like this but they're not as like difficult to chew no wonder people make those all the time this is amazing also our fruity pebbles and Froot Loops the same flavor like can someone please tell me that because I'm pretty sure I had it debate with somebody over this and I they're the same flavor to me fruity pebbles and food loops are the same thing they're just in a different form am i right am I wrong please let me know these are the questions I need answers to all right oh I'm so over sweet stuff like alright now I'm just gonna go with the good ol cocoa pebbles I'm interested to do these because they are literally a chocolate Rice Krispies and it was definitely the easiest to make and mix up and take out of the pan these look like legit rice krispies treats but chocolate and I am ready definitely my favorite so far they're just a better texture it doesn't feel like your teeth are getting pulled out it's just a good flavor I don't know chocolate marshmallows not uncommon thing so yeah okay next let's go with Trix now I've actually never had Trix I think that's frowned upon Trix are for kids which I'm not so but I also didn't have them as a kid anyway so these are tricks I don't know ooh they smell for Rudi and not like a fruit loop like a difference Brewis mother can do loans I don't know if I'm ready for that I don't know let's just see all right it is sweet however if you like sweet stuff it is really good it's actually it's actually tasted really good I'm gonna have to eat tricks from now on I'm not mad at that I'm not mad at it I think of it I might like it more than the three loops but I don't want to go that far because I love Froot Loops and I feel like I'm cheating on them such decisions why am I being exercised like why can't drink a lot because I'm filming a video next I'm gonna do corn pops because I don't really care about Clinton pop I don't actually think I've read corn pops either but they look boring they look bland you know this marshmallow looks like frickin cheese and unlike cheese bang screw you corn perhaps look really boring to me I don't know weird look cloth I've never had them by themselves I don't think so I feel like the cereal hearted I feel like it's so hard give me the other one no no I do abductors are coming right to freak out no no to be honest with you the taste isn't horrible though the taste isn't horrible it's actually pretty good but it's just so hard like you feel like your teeth are getting pulled out it's very chewy extremely difficult yeah no no please don't attempt that if you have any loose teeth next I'm gonna do cocoa puffs are these like the same as cocoa pebbles just in puffs I would assume but they look so different look at how much darker that cocoa puffs are I'm so concerned I thought that I thought that cocoa pebbles and cocoa puffs we're the same thing just in a different form and why is this so much darker anyway see nah am I crazy the 20 says I'm a stalker we know I don't know I thought it was on to something I don't know we're just gonna try it no no it's not no definitely the cocoa pebbles because I think it's just the fact that these are like balls like it's just not meant for this which was the whole point of doing this I just wanted to see like what the different importance we're gonna be but I definitely don't like the balls like that some of them family hanging them yeah it's just not meant for this the cocoa pebbles are the way to go for gonna do it like that hang on there little guy hey next I'm gonna do Golden Grahams and some Fritos crunch so these are the Golden Grahams I feel like they're kind of similar ish I know like the Golden Grahams aren't like a cinnamon sugary as some Mentos crunch let's try the Golden Grahams mmm it tastes really really good the squares are kind of awkward cuz they kind of just like miche's together when you bite down on it come on weird come chewy actually very chewy very good but the taste is good I like them better than the cocoa puffs let's try cinnamon toast crunch it tastes like a snickerdoodle I love snickerdoodles kind of chewy yes but manageable I like this a little bit better than the Golden Grahams but next is Lucky Charms contrary to popular belief I don't think that the marshmallow pieces in Lucky Charms are that good I'm sorry I know that they make like marshmallow only Lucky Charms but I just can't get into it I think it tastes like chalk I just want to go out of my way to buy Lucky Charms but I think this is gonna be interesting since there is like these mo pieces I think it's actually gonna taste good so let's see I have a bit of an issue it's the freakin marshmallow again look look at that it looks like top okay I like to just suck on the marshmallow pieces in my lucky charms and let them dissolve in my mouth and I think maybe they're better in milk than they are dry because they do probably dissolve a little bit just eating them dry like this I'm biting into it like there's me a bit of a texture issue I mean if you don't have a texture issue that it does taste really freaking good last but not least we are doing frosted flakes frosted flakes are a classic I love frosted flakes they're more than good they're great I shouldn't seriously just stop talking we haven't had a corn flake yeah we haven't had like was like cereal oh this is exciting ready guys okay I wanted to like it more but I just don't it's really really really really really hard to chew almost as hard as the Corn Pops I don't know take something like a hundred percent either and I thought frosted flakes but maybe it's just this whole marshmallow thing I don't know frosted flakes shouldn't be this texture I don't know how to describe it but they're not crunchy and they're not mushy they're just like difficult I don't know that's really depressing somebody says so out of all of these honestly like the cocoa pebbles for sure like mate Lucky Charms I would make if you like Lucky Charms marshmallows also the cinnamon toast crunch I like and the Froot Loops that I would do fruity pebbles does that make sense I'm sure that would be really good all the other ones like and and if you're gonna do Cheerios do the frosted trios but I mean regular rice krispies treats are honestly better I don't know if I'm disappointed or I think it's kind of what I expected definitely give it a try for yourself though and see which ones you like let me know in the comments if there's any other cereals that you want me to try this with I know there's like literally a million cereals I went down the cereal aisle on the supermarket and I was like what the heck like hostess makes

"fAmyj6ixnxU": "hello there and welcome to this unboxing video and which is going to look at the differences between contents versus the size of the books which contains the contents and for this demonstration we have the cooperative truly irresistible cranberry macadamia and raspberries cereal bars now this example isn't limited to this particular product there are other products out there that have a similar kind of a problem as it were and not picking on the cooperative this just happens to be one that I've just bought and stood out particularly now let's have a look at this give it give it a little shake first of all so this this box contains four bars let's open the box and compare Gary on the air on the hand here compare the size of the bars to the box as you can see the size of the bar is considerably smaller than the box unnecessary packaging or what but even worse than that it makes you think you're getting a bigger bar for your money when you're not that's just it let's just measure these so we'll take a a bar out of the whipping there we are and we'll measure the size of the box which is how big is that 14 centimeters and the size of the actual bar itself which is 99 in a similar situation applies to the width actually the girth of the bar two and a half box yeah we're one and a half so a whole centimeter of them of girth hitch he's actually missing there now obviously the the bar needs some room to maneuver and no doubt the barbel stretch and contractor and as heat affects it during transit but I'm sure it doesn't need that much space to move I think you", "hP_zLcLaM70": "Logan and here on marks remarks we're gonna be looking at the testicle everyday value to get the wording six fruit and nut cereal bars no artificial color flavors or preservatives now fruit nut bars these those like bars of fruit and nut and cereal and all kinds of okay well anyway it reads all about chewy cereal bar mixed with raisins and hazelnuts and the ingredients are glucose syrup oat flakes crisped rice I guess that's Rice Krispies raisins 9% pull flakes and then cereal flakes hazelnuts two and a half percent okay so I'm gonna get this six x 21 grams okay there we are sir I can feel this quite salt anyway hmm I asked you buddy go hmm very crispy it's um it tastes a lot of yeah you know like cereals and Wheaton remembers wheat in it but it's uh yeah it does taste like cereals in a in a bar it's um I think the most turn the one most striking taste of it is I mean you get the you get the consistency of the the not poppy but there's some kind of sticky a thing to hold it together into a bar shape you get that crisp rice container yeah yeah and there's different there's all the cereals in it there's not so much rated so actually yeah I could see a lot of axiom they're all on the top for some reason they're not exactly on the bottom where I'm from my angle and facing the bomb yeah oat flakes that's probably what I'm tasting a lot of crisp rice raisins corn flakes it is kind of crunchy I mean if I'm if I'm honest is not big on flavor you know if you want it flavor you can get chocolate-covered ones of these not many novice brand but it's a if they wanted to end up in a flavor they think they could put a bit of chocolate in there a few cherries perhaps but it cuz it really doesn't taste of you know fe80 I think you're eating this for the goodness you know of the ingredients not for the soft flavor and it says here it says on the on the front our products our products face more taste test with more British tasters than any other supermarket and they don't reach our shelves until they pass well maybe they only give me a belt because I I don't some I yeah I mean drunk Aramis you know it's a very it's very edible very chewy it actually tastes good for now you know what would all the but we'll only way of going on these or cereals and the Wheaton raisins and cornflakes yeah the raisins I just got a hit of raisins there they are they're quite tasty yeah I think if somebody was sweet this should be for the bigness factor not the I mean you know don't be wrong it doesn't taste like doesn't taste bad this doesn't taste much of anything you know like a bit of chocolate a few a few few few cherries in there with drivers either you know liven this out there but you know I don't you know I must say yeah I've got a stack of receipts here um which I don't know I don't know which one it jeez oh wait biscuit know where Jesus I don't know but they're not bad give them a go I mean that they're not too bad there's not

marshmallow cereal bars here I'm just showing you the ingredients we need cinnamon toast crunch marshmallows butter and cannabutter let's get started step 1 it's simple put the butter inside the pot add the can of butter inside the pot and melt it down when it's hot and if you're anything like me a true pie you'll add a little bit more Cana butter just add the right amount of rightness and then after that you want to go ahead and add the marshmallows in with the mixture nice and simple easy melt that down and this is what you get a smooth nice little batter if you will and all you guys do now is add the cereal simple as abc123 add the seal maybe a little bit more syrup can never go wrong all that cinnamon toast crunch look at the gooey gooeyness of it all as I just churn away it's getting big it's hard to even turn oh my goodness after that you won't put them in some trays drizzle on whatever toppings you want to add so with me personally I'm adding a little sweet to it so I'm gonna go ahead and add some caramel caramel Jesus Patricia she has the chance that she has a drizzle and boom cereal bars to grab one ago", "8VEFOztqwYc": "the fig cookie is one of life's sweet mysteries who hasn't wondered how they get the figs in that seamless pastry wrap it turns out that the automated system for producing fig cookies actually dates back to 1891 and it's what makes the fig cookie a snacking success fig cookies are a modern way of packaging of fruit which has been consumed for millennia making the fig cookies pastry rat begins with bags of sugar which they empty into a big mixer a couple of buckets of corn syrup follow then they add an emulsifier called lecithin and some vanilla flavoring the bowl tilts up for a quick mixing a worker adds organic bread flour and leavening ingredients to the mix they reactivate the mixer which blends everything into a thick sticky batter once properly mixed they transfer the batter into a large holding tank meanwhile they prepare the fig filling a worker loads big blocks of figs into a mixer then adds a generous amount of crumbled cookies for texture and flavor they mix the two ingredients then pour in corn syrup to add moisture and sweetness they add some salt and give the batch and other quick mix they sweeten the fig mix some more by adding plenty of sugar and now the jam for the center of the fig cookie is complete the fig jam in the pastry are now positioned for a merger it will be a neat trick and a special piece of equipment makes it possible it's essentially a funnel within a funnel rollers press the jam through the inner funnel while pushing the pastry through the outer one encasing the fig filling in a seamless pastry jacket here's the process in action the system generates long rows of fig filled dough and that's how they get the fig jam in the pastry next a technician carves through the dough and removes a few uncooked fig cookies it's time for a quick weigh-in this confirms that this batch of fig cookies will be exactly the right size now let's into an oven that's longer than a bowling alley it bakes and browns the fig filled ribbons of dough here a roller compresses the bake cookies so they'll fit into packages later an ultrasonic frequency makes this blade vibrate for a clean cut as it carves the rows of fig filled pastry into cookies the faint cookies are still a bit warm from baking so they now chill out on a trip through a freezer this cool down avoids condensation problems after packaging preventing mold growth the trip through the freezer also firms up the fake cookies so they're less likely to crumble during handling as she packs them this worker examines each fig cookie for imperfections and there's not one reject in the lot the next step is packaging where a machine parcels up the snacks it moves trays full of fake cookies into a sleeve of metallic films finally rotating jaws heat seal the package at both ends it's taken about an hour to make this package of fig bars and it's about time for a snack break if the crowd is hungry the whole package could be gone in minutes but that's the way the cookie crumbles you", "xJYW7ZN7L0Y": "a sub YouTube

subscribe my channel turn that bounder notification on to get you know but we need a new video dis upload so bye bye", "pyT3p1UjjQk": "all right today is a review video which you already know because you saw the title of the video and you clicked on it Karina is with me today you look you look different you don't have ice cream all over your shirt true Karina loves quest bars and I when quest bars first came out I really like the quest bars then they change the recipe and I haven't been a fan ever since but bus has a new product line and also a few potential new flavors for the regular protein bars so we have all of them here to sample the the new potential flavors our blueberry muffin I don't know why others yeah I don't know why I'm showing you this it's just a it's just an unmarked blueberry muffin and oatmeal chocolate chip and this one actually has a label that says quest on it but that is rocky road so you have those three bars to try and then they also have these new protein crunch bars which are like cereal bars these are 100 calorie bars so we'll try these too they come in in strawberry waffle which I'm gonna assume is like maple syrup peanut butter chocolate chip no peanut butter peanut butter chocolate and this one is just a plain chocolate and then we have SCIM so which wish we start with the regular bars OD protein the Crunch Bars this your I would start with the cereal bars since those are actually okay so which one which wanted to do it first okay so we have chocolate so these are a hundred calories per bar for what was the peanut butter one is 110 right so four grams of fat eighteen carbohydrates six fiber 12 grams of protein I could show it before you cut into it I guess I could that would be a good idea so it's just a just a little cereal bars gots like some some icing on it say - you thought she was gonna get to try it - so inside this is kind of tenant doesn't even look like it has like little I was I was expecting like a little rice krispies kind of things so I feel like that's pretty good it is good it doesn't taste like a protein bar because now it's a little dry though milk would be good all right so let's do strawberry if you want to go ahead probably an iron really I don't like it that much but you like chocolate more than I do this is the strawberry doesn't look like strawberry at all actually does it so chewy speed it up hurry it up spit it out like this one better I like this one better it does have it does kind of have an artificial strawberry flavor to it but it's way better than the quest strawberry protein powder cinnamon and they say there's cereal flavored protein bars each one of these gets a little more difficult to open cinnamon I can smell cinnamon you smell that this one doesn't have any ice yeah that's not exciting what you think the cinnamon roll would have that would be the one that would have icing on it yeah definitely smells like cinnamon now there's a little hint of cinnamon to it I still I like this one but I don't like that chocolate one not a fan on that chocolate one that was definitely yours I gave a seven this one a seven oh you know what did you rate the strawberry cuz you know everyone's at five alright so how about chocolate peanut butter now this one was the one that's 110 calories this one has I guess you would expect it if it's chocolate peanut butter I'll give you the piece that has more chocolate on thanks Dan no this smells like it smells like it smells like peanut butter but it it's smell I can't it not a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup but this one's my favorite you know like this one really this one's my favorite salty oh maybe that's why I like I actually like that one a lot this one's good by Karina doesn't all right last one waffle see this one has some icing on the two so the cinnamon roll was the only one that didn't have icing I wonder if they just forgot to put it on there definitely zero that one's good 8.5 so this is your second favorite after the chocolate this is my second favorite after the chocolate peanut butter alright so that is it for the cereal bars and I have them all over the place alright so protein bars this one I think I'm rocky road see I'm just I'm not a big fan of of chocolate really when it comes to anything so I know I'm expecting pure joy looks like has a little chunks of marshmallow in there well I'll have to say this just from cutting into it it's chewy like the original bars that I used to like I don't think it's that bad actually I was expecting it to not taste as good as it does maybe I mean I don't like chocolate in protein bars like this because it's always got that weird that artificial yeah it does but but the chocolate isn't real overbearing which is I guess why I kind of like it yeah but I'm not tasting that aftertaste right now are you yeah you are they bad hmm that's weird I give that like a three all right so we have we have two left and they're both on unlabeled we don't know which is which so pick one oatmeal save oatmeal chocolate chip I'm excited about the blueberry one because I love mine Chris so it looks like just like the chocolate chip cookie dough you're doing with the big chunks of chocolate because that's not our official chocolate to uni hold me on flakes in this though oh yeah you were hoping there would be like little what what is that right now I guess there is yeah there's little pieces oh maybe make 3 at 1:30 here I&J Stovall that's alright so compared to the regular chocolate chip cookie dough all right last bar blueberry guess what Rep red velvet red velvet would be good Quest Green has said that before red velvet so this one's interesting blueberry muffin you can see there's pieces of blueberry and pieces of muffin don't smell like anything this one's probably the best I agree of these three and you don't think you're gonna like this one I mean it still has artificial blueberry taste to it but so blueberry won't be on chocolate chip and then rocky road I agree so we agree on the regular protein bars and I should mention two so this one 180 calories this is the blueberry 180 calories 22 carbs 14 fiber and 7 grams of fat oatmeal chocolate chip 180 calories 8 grams of fat 22 grams of fiber protein is in 15 15 22 carbs 15 fiber 20 grams of protein and rocky road is a 200 calories so this one's a little higher 10 grams of fat so there's more fat in this 122 carbs 13 fiber 20 grams of protein and these are for weight watcher points - that's what we learned today if you're tracking that way so do you like the cereal bars stereo bars are good but they're very dry they are very dry so you need a glass of milk kirino's not like the way I say because I say milk there's no e in milk there's it's milk so anyway comments and questions

there's the package it says on the back you'll love the delicious taste of Reese's Pops cereal in a chalky chewy convenient bar and I can't wait to try it and there's the back of the wall there's the top that looks they used to have I don't know what brand it once it started with K when they were candy bars great I don't remember and they had snicker granola bars and all kinds of different flavors

little I was like stale cereal if you ever had sales there yes that is exactly with its stale cereal peanut butter on top I like the taste of it but if you have dentures I don't think you could eat

definitely him oh definitely deep these there's not as good as my go-to peanut butter the peanut bars idea but if you want to change the base a little bit I would get these they these are the same

tea - tea tea tea tea tea - tea Oh are we are we edgy we're gonna use it - like the number - oh yeah okay now I'll make sure we change that in post now but this is like our second episode of tiny taste do anything imposed we can yep we have the power we can put in two - we could based on the last one Jeff yeah we got something really really exciting here yeah we have I saw these at the store and it's clearly clearly somebody needed to open these early but I haven't tried them I can't though what happens when you like it you get a rip like this like you're just so hungry [Music] these are what are these exactly Jeff you tell me because you've got the box what the Reese's puffs treats Reese's probably like cereal bars but with like Reese's puffs Reese's puffs are the best cereal I don't really like cereal yeah I think I'm not a huge fan of love Reese's puffs but ya know if I'm gonna eat cereal Reese's puffs is one of the few that I would eat there are my top three favorite cereals they are probably my I like frosted flakes I like Reese's puffs that's about it that's it yeah that's it those are the new one was there like doesn't the only two things I like I like raisin bran no no but I like I like cereal bars like that Reese's puffs fizzles I didn't know they never made some point these are new that cereal bars yeah other stuff like cinnamon toast crunch and stuff this these kinds of things I like these like this is what I prefer over a bowl of cereal yeah it is like they get like that gun smell flavours something or it's better it's delicious so let's open these up for you okay number one they look like a cereal bar they look like a cereal part but there's like a layer like look at this there's a layer of peanut butter on the bottom you know it looks like it looks like they got all this cereal and mush it up it dis extrude it through like a sausage it grew up they just came on fire there's no it's like it's kind of what it is you gotta smell it first we always smell it cow no reason you know here's the part Jeff here's the here's the sad part about smelling this it smells just like every other like granola bar or a cereal bar or whatever those like one of those nature bellies does but it doesn't really smell like Reese's or pee it kind of smells like peanut butter my disappointment smells are highlighted my smells are disappointed is what I meant to say well obviously I had a stroke I mean I said the count oranges today so you what what what happened anyway Jeff you ready to take your first bite I took the rest for later okay I'm just gonna eat the whole thing right now do you ever put stuff in your pocket like thinking you'll remember them later and it just melts you get excited when you get them yeah I'm waiting for you yeah I don't know I'm late you gotta warn me that's terrible now we feel it you can sleep disappointed I'm getting the vibe of badness here I'm gonna try this it's bushed oh it's like this they came up with this because somebody at Reese's puffs factory accidentally put me look at a bunch of reasons buffs and it made it soggy I oh shoot what do we do with this now okay this is just like a crushed up soggy Breezies pump it's not good could be crunch here all right a little bit it's they won fair like chewy Nature Valley flavor when they should call it crunchy nature value right which are really different kinds of things this is kaya it's yeah it's mushy I feel like a hint of like British pop you know what this is got it okay crispy crispy what I call it crispy and you've tried those Reese's those Reese's Crunch Bars that they sell at like gas stations that are like like just Reese's but they're kind of like the Butterfinger like a butterfingers of his free C's no they're like Reese's crunch and they're like candy bars that's like the ins this is like the inside of that without the crunch this is Rice Krispies 100% I'm gonna say is Rice Krispies this is Rice Krispies there's a Reese's peanut butter on it yes and some chocolate on it too it's not good I've quite disappointed what do you get out of them I give it to what is it no like my roaches are a - let's put it this way I like last week's taco cheese it's better I see what you did there I give this a 3.5 out of time okay wait wait you put cockroaches at two and this is only a 1.75 five above it there's a clear line there's a clear line all right all right since you said that maybe a fork went by okay I stopped what's what's a base line five out of ten for you this was just across the board five out of ten for you like a regular good granola bar that's a five out of time to find your scale I mean I just like other things more like hot wings or hot wings there are ten good hot wings what about Chipotle it's like a nine out of ten oh my gosh what's a one out of ten for you cheese Jesus like I'm eating this Jeff and I feel like it's just a waste of calories what's why are you still eating I don't know are you a relative so what so one out of ten is cheese or bugs or buzz yeah same thing I put the Engel at equal value would you rather eat it enter a piece of cheese I'd rather eat a single ant I got enough same size ants as a cheese single I really eat a slice of cheese then slice the cheese has to be above a 1 all right fine it's at a 1.1 I think we guys thanks for watching time to taste I'm Dave Moore that's Jeff Daly if you guys enjoyed this if you guys want to try these they're and grocery stores I don't know why eat I wouldn't recommend them and if you love Reese's puffs you love what is very suppose you're under that level what's happening at my mouth you're not gonna be happy you're gonna be slightly disappointed I think thanks for watching guys hit that subscribe button if you guys like these thanks for watching t2t with JD and hey guys Johnny casino here and oh man uh I went out to dinner tonight I'm on the road so I went to a restaurant I sat by myself it's a really weird thing for me to go anywhere and sit by myself so I said at the bar also helped him plan on having a beer now looked at the menu and there's chicken and waffles and I have never had chicken and waffles and I've had a number of people recommend it to me from this specific restaurant so what did I try to do I tried to eat chicken and waffles this place doesn't a little bit different maybe I don't know how it is traditionally but they have kind of a sriracha sauce that goes in with the syrup if you've never had or seen chicken and waffles I put a picture of it up on Twitter here but they basically take a piece of fried chicken or in this case two pieces of fried chicken and put them on top of the like belgium waffles and then they put syrup on it holy crap guys it was so good it was so good um it was a lot I'm stuffed I can barely move I was gonna take this video while eating it while taking that first bite but this place is just I don't know I felt weird I kind of lost my nerve I chickened out if you will but oh my god it was so good so I took that first bite you know I cut into the chicken and made sure had some waffle had some chicken and the syrup on it and I tasted it and man that syrup just does something for that chicken now let's talk about the waffle part for a second do you really need a waffle to go with this I mean health-wise obviously not right this is maybe the most unhealthy meal I've ever eaten but to me do you need a waffle to go with your chicken if you had the chicken and the syrup in the sriracha sauce which give it that little bit of heat then you be said and I was thinking about this while I was eating and then I took a bite and I was kind of savoring it just a little bit and I realized if the waffle itself has just a little bit of sweetness to it and that little bit of sweetness was amazing so it's the whole thing it's the chicken the waffle the syrup this case the sriracha mixed in oh man it was amazing uh but like I said I'm hurting I am stuffed off this my other concern going into this was that I was gonna be having a beer with it and beer and sweet stuff beer and breakfast I mean for some people beer breakfast goes hand-in-hand for me mayera breakfasts not hand-in-hand so I was concerned but the beer I was drinking was a coffee milk stout and so it actually paired with it quite well I I didn't realize that when I ordered the beer they ordered before I decided what I was gonna eat but it paired well it worked great I had a great meal I wish I could have videoed the first thing of you know me taking the bite but nope not gonna do that not gonna shoot a video like this in the middle of a restaurant even though it's into the bar not gonna happen uh anyways if you haven't a chance fried chicken waffles try some chicken and waffles find a good place that does it if you've got a place there's a sriracha sauce with it do it it's the way to go thanks guys out some more great discussions hit that subscribe button or visit forget being cool calm", "1LEiZcXbr6E": "hi guys welcome to Cheryl some cooking so let's get started welcome to Cheryl's home cooking and today what I'm going to show you is my fruit loop crispy treats they're really really good so let's get started so I have eight cups of fruit loops in a bowl I have my baking dish that I sprayed with cooking spray I'll place three tablespoons of butter in my pot I'll lower it down to medium-low to the butter I'll be adding in ten ounces of the mini marshmallows you want to mix it quick because you don't want it to burn you want to melt the marshmallows till it's nice and creamy and for the fruit loops I picked up the fruit loops with marshmallows so just keep stirring it it's almost melted all right that's nice melted now I'll turn my burner off now let the marshmallow is melted good and the butter is melted into the marshmallows I'll take my 8 cups of fruit loops and like I said I picked up the fruit loops with the marshmallows you want to mix it quickly this is going to be so good all righty now you can use a spatula or I put on some gloves I'll take the mixture put it into my grease pan I find it to be easier with this spoon and a spatula rather than the gloves it was sticking too much to the gloves I figured it would be easier but it's not so you just want to flatten it all down make it even once it's cool then I'll cut it into squares now that I flattened it all down I'll take a cup of white moreso smelt them and then I'll drizzle it all on top so I placed the one cup of plate morsels in my microwave I'll melt it down and once it's done that's not drizzle at all on the top now I'll go check on the morsels now the white morsels have melted I'll just take it you know kind of drizzling it on [Music] take it off the spoon and I'm using my knife I'm actually spreading it rather than drizzling yet this is going to be really good this way here everyone gets a piece of the fruit loop crispy treats with white chocolate on it so now I'll place this off to the side I want the white chocolate to harden up on the fruit loops and I want the fruit loops to get nice and firm before I slice them into squares now that the fruit loops have firmed up and the chocolate has firmed I'll slice them into squares and give them a try I'll cut a piece oh yeah look at that now look at how good that looks you see the white chocolate on top and the fruit loops all stuck together with the marshmallow so now I'll give it a try so I'll take a bite mmm-hmm so good nice and crispy in that white chocolate on top mm-hmm really really good I highly recommend making each for the kids they're gonna love them it was quick and easy too really good you can see once you cut them how colorful they are it's really really good I know the kids will

channel as you know we recently started launching a series that we call travel junkies where we travel coast to coast america state by state in depth as much depth as we can um we have some big plans for that the first season didn't go exactly as planned as we wrap up finishing launching that series uh swing by check it out leave us some feedback on that in that endeavor we were lucky enough to have some brands affiliate themselves with us and so we have a few products here to try out and show for you today now these are from a brand called aloha so they're entirely vegetable and plant-based no soy gluten-free it's 100 vegan and i've never had anything from them have you no what's that um this is organic protein drink it is coconut plant-based protein made with creamy coconut milk there is 18 grams of protein 5 grams of sugars um 10 grams of carbs there's a total of 160 calories per container is it like a meal shake it's a protein drink okay i'm nervous for this because i don't like cooking up that much i like coconut in some things it depends on what it is the brand is aloha as you can tell did you mention that yeah all right let's try it and it says to keep it refrigerated until you drink so we popped it in the refrigerator last night well best served chilled yeah doesn't smell bad no it's not bad at all i like it i don't like coconut very much but i would drink this this would be good to have like on the road it's really smooth yeah it's not harsh and it's all plant-based for being plant-based it's pretty good that would be i would keep those with us on the road as like in case we don't have time to stop for lunch you just drink that you know yeah it's like a meal replacement oh it has electrolytes too so it says we believe the best ingredients come straight from the earth our proprietary blend of peas and brown rice is paired with delicious coconut milk to create a perfectly crafted balance of flavor and nutrition i think it's pretty good it says it's full of everything your body needs and free of anything it doesn't recommend trying it i'm not even yeah like i said i don't even like coconut i like this isn't that i don't know you can probably add it to like protein drinks or smoothies maybe i think we need to refrigerate it longer it's it's really good they go quick bad kind of quick though because this is it's march and these go bad the first week of may yeah so they don't last very long it's kind of why we're shooting the video now and then they also sent us a sample pack of their protein bars so we're going to rip these open and give these a shot i don't even know what flavors are in the same sample pack so what's the front say sampler pack no stevia no sugar yeah it says organic non-gmo gluten free dairy free soy free vegan nothing artificial no stevia and no sugar alcohols and then when we open it oh it's pretty and colorful oh gosh so let's see it was pretty powerful have [Music] oh chocolate fudge i call that one what there's a mint there's several different kinds how long do you go for a big sample pack i don't know if you guys can see all these oh these are good till next january so these are good for almost a year should we just try a few of them and save some yeah i want to try other chocolate chips wait what i want to explain what what they have okay so they have six different types of bars they have caramel sea salt chocolate chip cookie dough peanut butter chocolate chip chocolate fudge brownie that sounds like ryan vanilla almond crunch chocolate mint and they all feel pretty smushy so they're not like crunchy they're hard they're not hard yeah i don't like crunchy girls yeah either dubai and they all look like they have 14 grams of protein and they range from about this is the highest one i've seen 260 calories this one's 220. this one's 220. so not a ton not this isn't a good product for you if you're like allergic to nuts or dairy because everything's made of trees and right but other than that very good road snack for especially if you're like vegan or vegetarian [Music] yeah like the chocolate fudge brownie it says it contains tree nuts cashews it smells like thin mints brown rice protein pumpkin seed no is it good you have to try that it's like girl scout cookies wow that's good i honestly like somebody told me somebody gave that to me like without the wrapper okay so the mint is peppermint oil if someone gave that to me without the wrapper and said eat this and then they said you're eating something that's totally plant-based i wouldn't buy it like i wouldn't believe them that's good okay so they're pretty much all made of cashew butter oh that that has a kick of peppermint to it man yeah the peppermint oil should we try one more which one let's say we try the sea salt caramel or do we want well we just kind of had a chocolate one do the sea salt i'm not really a huge fan of sea salt caramel because i feel like i love it i feel like everything over does it i feel like everything that does this is just way too salty what their bars look like i don't know if you can tell well the wrapper super thin they're chewy like they're soft you can tell that it has a little bit of and you can wash it down with a little bit of coconut milk i bet you this would be good over ice so this one actually has some crunch in it i feel like the caramel and salt's pretty well balanced on that yeah these aren't bad at all they kind of remind me almost like a mix between a fiber one bar and a cliff bar i'm sinking this bar yeah so these will come in handy um on road trips especially long road trips we don't really have the time to eat three full meals a day and i have a bad habit of buying a bunch of road snacks aka chocolate which is why i'm winded in every video but our next season uh we're planning to do the entirety of route 66 and on top of it we're gonna end in california and go from there to do the next season if we have enough to do a season out of it i don't know but up the pacific coast highway and then we're hitting the northern border from all the way back are we doing it all the way yeah so we plan to do route 66 so starting in chicago and we're hoping that one's like a like a 20-day thing we're going to like do it in detail yeah so we're gonna do route 66 starting in chicago and then we're gonna hit ending at the santa monica pier and then after we're done there i would like to stay there for at least two days to explore the area yeah okay and then we're gonna plan to hit well this is our plan it's not set in stone yet but then we plan to do uh up the coast like you said the pacific coast highway along the ocean and then uh i want to go through montana and hit glacier national park i've always wanted to go to montana um so like our first season it was rushed we're trying to hurry up and fit everything in in one week yeah we had a week between that and a michigan event that's going there's a treasure hunt throughout michigan it's called johnny's treasure quest and so we spent the later end of the summer finishing up the truck and doing tweaks and stuff so it was ready for that for the filming and then uh we it just so happens when we finally were ready to leave that flooded up against that treasure hunt that we were a part of so we had to cram a lot in a week so there's a lot we missed um but route 66 will be taking our time we'll be we don't have anything that we need to come back for for a while so we're gonna be uh taking our time with that and hitting everything in detail as much as we can we're doing research kind of mapping out where we want to go what we want to show there's a lot we want to show budget wise we might not be able to do all the stuff we want to show but we'll still throw in there like what it costs and everything if you do want to see that we do offer during the production at our patreon which will be in the link under the video we do offer live streams and private blogs and so you can come along for the ride and our highest tier for non-advertising our highest tier uh is 50 a month and that one you get trinkets alongside of everything else from the trip and this one we have some ideas for gifts that it's totally unique nobody has it there's a couple ideas that i have and just if you want to own a piece of route 66 history in this goody box sign up for the 50 tier if you want just the live streams we're going to live stream as much as we can i want to do a little bit every day but out in the desert service is sketchy i don't know what we'll be able to do but um the live streams are cheaper than a netflix subscription so and if you want to just support the show go to the travel junkies dot space website click the donate button donate anything you want every amount helps it all goes to the trip it all goes to bringing better content it all goes to helping these smaller businesses along the way of every place that we go and uh or you can go to the patreon feed and there's a one dollar donation you can put in a dollar or whatever amount you want if you just want to monthly donate to us all of it is super helpful for us to just bring better and more content to you and to kind of make you feel like you're part of it so yeah and that trip these are going to come in handy so that we're not stocking up one part absolutely personally i love granola bars warmer on the road it's quick simple easy wake up in the morning and you just grab one of these and it doesn't make it feel like you're eating like it's kind of it gives you that sweet tooth kick without the junk food it's healthy for you i mean you're not getting all that junk that you get with like a typical granola bar and the nice thing is like in preparation for a trip like that like we're planning that more in late spring early summer and these are these don't expire until january of 2022. they're best by september 27th of this year but still if you're planning a road trip months a couple months ahead stock up on them and you can just keep them ready you don't have to buy them last minute or take a last-minute trip to the store they are definitely delicious i would highly recommend you try them and for people that say that maybe they're a little bit expensive on the expensive side even i when i first looked at their website i was like oh this is kind of expensive for food but if you think about it you're granted all organic this is plant-based organic you're that's what you pay for but also think about like oh if you go to the store and spend a couple bucks on chocolate or sweets like that that kind of food is designed to trigger the brain to just want more and more and more so you're gonna end up spending more on the long run than you are of something yeah that's good for you here that actually and this is more beneficial and better for you and i have a giant sweet tooth and like for me i've only had yeah it's pretty bad but for me like even these three bites that i've had they're they're kind of satisfying my sweet tooth i haven't really eaten much all day i'm gonna say i was kind of hungry but actually just nibbling on these i'm not as hungry as it was this too this is kind of filling they're it's all really well done so keep an eye out for these in the show too um because they're an affiliate if you order through our website traveljunkies.space order through us that also helps the show we get a small percentage of your order total these are so good they're really good i'm i'm kind of shocked about it sorry yeah it was really good i was nervous about it because i'm not a fan of granola that much i like clif bars but i'm not a huge i'm picky i didn't know what to expect because they're plant-based like yeah you would wouldn't think how can you make something vegan plant-based tastes like the real deal super good i'm sorry you can continue i don't remember what i was going to say all i want is oh so go to our website go to affiliate brands and we have aloha in there and actually if you order from us if it benefits us because it does help the show we do get a cut of it but we in turn can help you out we have a 15 off exclusive coupon for this brand so they you also will get the up-to-date deals as far as like what they release on coupons and stuff but right off the bat just shopping through us you get 15 off just to get a sample pack if you want to try it for yourself so ultimately using our affiliate link it's not an extra cost to you by using it but you do get a 15 off through us so yeah i would try it yeah so i think that's pretty much it with with this there's a couple we haven't tried yet and we're gonna try we're saving those for the road trips we'll try those in the show if any of them come back that we don't like it we'll let you know we don't want to say we like it when we don't but i i wouldn't lie my face would give it away i think mine would too i was good i just they're really good i mean try them if you don't like it i mean i'm sure you try things all the time that you don't like that you spend more money on yeah yeah they're really good it's really good stuff and it's healthy it's good for you you're not putting all that other junk in your body so thanks for stopping by and checking out the video hopefully you try these if you do get them let us know in the comments or message us on our website what you think of it and um hope to see you as part of the live feeds and everything that we do for route 66 and hope to see you as a subscriber to our content thanks again thanks", "WlG50z9LwXQ": "what's up hi uh this is an intro to episode 4 of breakfast with cereal with sierra and brody myself that was one of the notes we got in our forums what is that uh one specific person wanted uh more of an intro from us it doesn't matter i don't need to call them out okay okay don't call me hi i wanna this is our intro this is our introduction welcome to our podcast thank you acid what about breakfast with cereal i need i need jeremy singing that we do need that professionally done any volunteers that would be great jeremy i'll make your next emote for you if you uh sing that song for us how was that how's that for a trade-off is this a business deal happening right now on episode four episode four okay so episode four means it's back to my turn to um come up with the guidelines and questions and things for us that will take us through this episode sounds good yay um so i guess what we're gonna start off with um is such a reoccurring a game of hypotheticals the thing i decided we should discuss okay uh you will go to sleep tonight and when you wake up tomorrow you will have a tail i will have a couch you will have a tail 100 yes okay but you get to choose what animal tail it is and it's whatever you choose before you go to sleep or whatever okay so i don't know why i'm making it so involved like there's this whole process but anyways no this is really good so yeah what animal would you choose to base your tail on like i want a zebra tail that's useless and does nothing or do you want a monkey tail am i the only tale of a bird am i the only one having a tail or does everyone else in the world also have a jail everyone will get tails oh you just you just get to pick what time see that makes me feel so much better because at first i'm like i want like a tiny little like turtle tail or something i can hide oh that'd be weird and gross yeah if i was gonna be the only one with a tail i think i'd have like a cola oh i'd want like a big old dinosaur tail oh okay chunky like i actually have a tail no i'd be so good because there aren't you know people whose like coccyx flails out on accident like just through whatever and like at the end of your tailbone like instead of curling in a little bit through whatever reason it points out and they have like a weird little nubbin that pokes through so when you look at guinness book of world records from 2005. no it looks i mean it's fine anyway i'm not i'm not shaming people who have tails uh i support all furries oh don't say that we're not propharia [Applause] of a bird tail really some kinds of feathers that would be cool first thought i was like monkey tail some type of monkey jail because those like help help them balance and things like that yeah so very useful as a utility yeah those are probably the tales i hear the most about um like actually helping some like doing stuff yeah yeah the only thing with that then would be like how big it would be in correlation because monkeytails are like the length of them if they're actually useful for them so it would be the length of me just a pow i mean you'd have to think so what would it wouldn't it like do a little curl up thing sure yeah i'm okay with that i mean this isn't boots the monkey we're talking about we're talking about actual what if i want it to be well it's not your hypothetical i don't think i don't think uh wow fake characters i don't know because and then how strong would it really be because yeah monkeys can hold themselves up by it but monkeys are like 15 pounds and four pounds of it is their tail well one minute if if the length goes by your bot your own body then wouldn't it that like strikes two i can deadlift if i shut down that's true dude you're gonna bulk up your tail yeah exactly i have like leg day and tail day yeah i don't know i think i would want something that is something i'd be cool showing off and not feel weird about yeah i guess that makes sense um so why was your first thought bird bird too i think it would act like a piece of clothing although if i got you know colors and i kept it nice or whatever it would just be oh my gosh i'm sorry but i can't i can't like just picture like you would have feathers i think so but nowhere else on your body no oh that is another another thing that is possible is just how gross if it was like a pig's tail you know it's all just yeah skin but yeah let's not talk about that that's why i almost didn't ask this question but i thought we would keep it funny yeah no i think uh i think i i'm choosing my answer lock it in monkey tail nice yeah pretty sure i think that would work we've got our tails decided yep my next question then uh would be what theme song what would be your theme song i guess and uh just to narrow it down a bit i specifically said what would your theme song be if you had to pick like a nintendo or video game soundtrack song all right um so what was your first thought okay so my first thought was of course it was uh delfino plaza mario sunshine i mean come on i love that song but then i'm thinking i'm like i don't know if that feels like my theme song like it's a great song i love it but i don't i'm not so sure it's like something that like yeah when you first meet me that's playing right i get that and i mean it's very easy to just be like animal crossing oh yeah for sure able sisters yeah or yeah any wrestling song yeah i i like crossing song from the gamecube that's like any time of day almost probably and new horizons honestly but like it's just such a it's just such peaceful music that i mean it was made to be listened to for an hour at a time so only one well i mean yeah in the game yeah oh yeah yeah i was like i i can sit and play animal crossing for more than the soundtrack 3 p.m was made to be that's all i'm saying i also along with animal crossing thought of kkk slider oh okay slider songs would be great right but then i was like i love the mama crossing song bubble gum oh i don't know i don't know why you don't but again i don't think it's like a theme song for me i don't see it yeah and then i can't think of the kk slider song now that i like so much was it kk swing i don't know i don't remember but i remember the song i just don't remember the name [Music] no i can't i also like animal crossing island night tour or whatever it's called right the one you've saved yeah yeah i don't know that i'll be able to um play music yeah probably not during this so well maybe a little like because for this uh question um it'd be hard to think of just a ton on the spot so we listened to um some before this to get like an idea of what we wanted or what our answer would be and so i have one but again i feel like if i just say it you won't like right yeah i'll try to intersperse clips like that we'll see can i just can i just play it for my phone right now no that'll sound worse so if we get taken down i'll you know put another episode up with just our audio yes that'll be fine kk cruising [Music] whistling when we listen to the playlist of you know nintendo songs i liked flower garden yoshi island yeah a lot and i thought like it just sounds nice and it sounds like something that like isn't already like i think that is the perfect song for your profile picture that you have right now like your your the one you got from the app the um hand-drawn discord icon yeah i think that's perfect for that and it fits that like one-to-one i get it i get it and i also love it like wii sports smash ultimate version yeah because i was like i love because when you played that i was like okay this kind of those kind of goes off but again it's not like a theme song like it's just like something that sounds good right and i guess too i was also thinking i mean i keep saying theme song i'm thinking more of like if your show was a sitcom what would your intro song yeah yeah you know not like your background whatever no and for that i think wii sports would be funny to have just you and your friends turning to the camera and showing your name for wii sports music but could i also do um the like sound effect of uh wii sports resort i believe it is with the sword fighting and just yes yeah that could be included i would like that i also think with wii sports right that could easily be put to words with yeah that's a good one i also love that including interspersed as well all these sound effects included if your show was a if your life was a sitcom would it get renewed for a second season there's a big a big difference well what's your story arc b then i don't i don't know trying to beat your pb right now and and bench or squats or something deadlift no i don't know what it would be maybe like the store oh oh actually you're gonna hear something funny that kind of has to do with that is bailey and i were thinking of funny names for a podcast with me and bailey and this is some of the ones we came up with um hold on it's loading first of all i said knee slappers okay like you know when you fought the funny thing she said the inside scooped with cereal and i was like oh that's good i was like breakfast with basil cereal with faith you know because that's her thing she said frosted cereal i was like uh she said cakes and giggles that's a good one she's said daughter jokes which i really like um i said daughter jokes silly stories from alaskan and a hoosier except yeah it's just funny and then she goes um anxious autistic and depressed a gen z story i'm not autistic by the way i don't know we were neither his baby a girl wait my story arc right now would be like finishing high school isn't really a big part of your life you're just kind of like yep it's there yeah most exciting thing in my life right now is that i finished 25 of high school i would say your weightlifting stuff is more exciting than that i guess that is yeah it's true yeah but again i don't feel like it's a whole story artwork well sure but whatever how was your story right now um trying to buy a house probably yeah that was good episode one we filed taxes episode two we get the return back and uh wait three months for it to be in our bank oh it's high it's 3 14. nice happy pride oh oh my gosh today is uh today's uh equal pay day really yeah so you know i thought you were going to say peyton manning's birthday is it it is it's the only thing i knew today see that's what's wrong there's too many national holidays okay national days i should say yeah i was like it's not like a holiday thing it's just equal pay day so you know can't wait to make a 82 cents for every dollar i've never heard that and i pay attention to like stuff never hurt what equal pay day yeah if you look on twitter twitter twitter look on twitter right now it's like trending probably uh no as i was on twitter right before we went live it was not it was not on there uh number one equal payday i okay i seriously looked at it less than an hour ago and it wasn't up uh listener i looked into number one politics trending equal payday during women's history month march 24th is equal payday and is dedicated to raising social awareness on the gender wage gap and two it's um i'm pretty sure number one was like sydney powell or something no it's some girl right now and then number three is santa montana because hannah montana was training yeah there are too many national days yeah 7 11 should have should be the national you know slurpy day that's that makes sense which is mill's birthday you think that's the only the only national day that needs to be yeah yeah maybe a couple others i think i i kind of like like national days or whatever because i think it's like kind of kind of funny there should be more silly ones and less serious ones yeah but if you try to do silly ones it'll be like you know 4 30 o'clock 4 30 o'clock 4 30 news and the the newscasters are being like guys it's a national telegraph yeah but i mean like national like you're not like the silly days at school yeah national crazy hair day like that's funny and that's one of the craziest yes and i want everyone when you go out to have crazy yes okay i kind of get that opportunity yes an actual yeah well no there are too many problems that would come with an actual opposite date oh yeah actually there should be a national uh breakfast for dinner today i'm sure there already is but i mean things that should just just just be yeah like if i'm going to wings etc for dinner okay i want to show up and they'd be like hey here's chicken wings and pancakes you know because it's whatever mm-hmm i'm good with that yeah i like it yeah more silly holidays i'm all for it less weird serious holidays yeah you know causes are great well this summer's nice let's we want breakfast for dinner day last breakfast for dinner day i gave you my heart i love it uh speaking of holidays yes kind of not at all this is the cicada year oh happy saluta here for our area i think so the map i saw um was most of indiana right lovely but they showed up by county and i'm like i guess 99 sure that cicadas don't abide by county lines for where they breed you know maybe i'm wrong and they're super respectful nowadays they actually go they have their own street addresses and they're like they're little bros yeah yeah but it showed um they don't they don't cross state lines right it showed elkhart and st joe um were this year the 2021. i don't know and but just north like cass county and and such and um oh what is it porter county which is out in valpo and stuff yeah uh those were 2024. and cicadas have 17-year cycles oh i hate you know there are others with shorter ones and that's why they're always around but this is supposed to be like the big one yeah we had to research mostly those ones because we didn't understand that because we're like no we have cicadas every year what do you mean they're 17. right right and it's like there are multiple broods which is just a disgusting word to be associated with at all yeah yeah i didn't know the definition of that before we had to learn about us well would it have to we were curious because they're annoying so yeah actually it probably came up because bailey had never heard of cicada before and she was like that's true what is this sound they're yeah they're very much in the midwest too um which i learned uh the article said they're not attracted to people or moving things they're attracted to sounds interesting so i don't know i can't remember enough 17 years to go to think if it was i did not understand i did not understand enough to 17 years ago i don't remember 17 years ago well enough to like remember if cicadas were a problem i'm sorry i probably messed it up no i think my the processing part of my ears and brain turned off for a moment i had to tell the dad my art my boss that i could not teach people certain things and if it's just our team of three four five people i can do that i can make that work but words don't come out of my brain properly enough to teach random employees of other businesses how to do things like online and such yeah you're good at explaining things to me though like when i when it's one-on-one and i can get a sense of what you're picking up on and not right i can try but even then it's like a whole classroom right want to go to a business and have eight people learn this thing that i know yeah and even then with you uh heck drew or tyler have to explain things a third time okay that's true tyler's good with that since he was a teacher tyler's tyler is very good at being a teacher maybe he can teach us more about cicada yeah maybe because i literally failed would have failed this class like the other year without him so i remember math in sixth grade when we were just learning the very basics of like pre-algebra and stuff for whatever reason with that sixth grade teacher is like one of my favorites too but she could not make pre-algebra click for about six or seven of us weird and she had a classroom helper which was just some kid from the high school that you know would come down for an hour yeah well he explained it to us somehow in a way that according to the teacher was the exact way she explained it but it just clicked for all of us yeah and we were like oh this is easy and she was so mad because she's like been trying for like hours and she's like losing yeah and then this kid comes in exactly yeah and probably says something completely wrong but it clicked for us right yeah so teaching is is not anything i ever want to do no matter what it's about i i am like i am passionate about a lot of things and i like to share my passion i do not like to teach things to others i don't think i have patience to ever teach anyone anything ever like i would just be like why are you getting it already you know come on it's yeah but again i don't know enough to even teach someone like i can teach you how to tie your shoes baby just watch like i don't even have anything to teach people right i mean there are certain things i'll walk you through i walked you through march madness practice like four years ago true to the point where you're like oh march madness time i know i know how to do this let me pick this and this true speaking of i should check on my thing because i actually have it in a couple days uh it's been terrible for me oh no yeah i have um one bracket i have two brackets one where gonzaga beats illinois in the championship oh okay illinois get beat by loyola i have a second bracket where loyola beat illinois and is now gonna beat gonzaga in the championship okay so it's just the one that i entered all groups in was the long one yeah iowa lost which oh i had to tell dad not to pick byu as his first pick and he's like well their stats are good because he read it on the app i guess he's like dad they're gonna lose round one okay and they lost around my two right now that are like that i've gotten wrong in the sweet 16 are i said iowa but it's oregon and i said ohio state but it's oral roberts yeah that was a huge upset yeah that there's no way they're gonna be our our kansas arkansas right i don't think so i don't think they've played that good either i just think ohio state played sloppy i also think um oregon had um a bye week basically because bcu had positive covet test so they just break so oregon didn't play a game before they played um iowa oh especially when you play you have one break of a like one day break oh so they played two games iowa that was iowa's second game and oregon's first game within four-day within two days four days yeah my percentage is 73. that's good okay cool i'm not doing good what's funny is in our work bracket chelsea who is like i don't know what's going on i'm probably gonna lose this whole thing is winning by like nine points or something like she is way better than anyone else so that's always how it is though it really is like 60 coin flips and forty percent knowledge i also don't really have much money for basketball at all so that's why i like being like oh yeah i'm actually doing okay because there's no reason for me to be doing okay like i don't i don't follow the vlog that much you read the little blurb maybe and then you flip a coin yeah maybe do i look glowy today we're in a very shadowed place i can't really tell because me and bailey did these shock things you put a needle in your face no like a drink i got my vaccine no no like a little drink thing it had like vinegar apple cider vinegar and like stuff like that and you and you look beautiful okay he's trying to escape what if it's like because he has some mission like in cats and uh cats first wait cats and dogs what's it called i just hate that you reminded me of the existence of cats and dogs it's a great movie and um i think they're making another one or unless that was just a rumor right here i hope not could be a rumor because a lot of people love that movie so it could be just like you know the last talking cat movie was kevin spacey so let's just keep away from all sorts of that yes yeah cats and dogs was terrible it just was not fun i still don't understand how fair life is still oh no i don't either i still don't understand how you told me you were going to make me that shirt that i love from from sea world from when i was like four you know mom threw it away because it didn't fit me and you still have it maybe for me so i can have another one i there are things that i will do when i am like in the moment like i need something to do i want to do something creative and that should be at the top of your list yeah i just forget about it and i i don't know it's fine i can oh we should talk about um what our merchandise i am i am stopping stuff with redbubble i've been selling you know my designs and stuff through them for a while yeah and i finally hit the point where i'm just gonna stop all together especially he's gonna stop recommending it i might leave stuff up but it's not just one thing it's it's multiple things time and time again but prints come out wrong and weird and they just don't care and send it off i got a sweater like a crew neck with our breakfast with cereal logo on it and when it arrived the white was like dark dingy gray and none of the colors were right it just looked like it had been faded like sat in the sun and faded forever yeah it looks like a vintage like this is supposed to be worn out like like an old like fan t shirt or something it just does not look right and it's faded um you know they always smell like vinegar because they have to vinegar wash it it's part of their thing so i'm used to that some people complain about that but yeah it's just disappointing and then to have their legal department write me multiple times because they just don't want to deal with things so the only things that sell are stuff that's barely skirting around um you know copyright laws and stuff yeah but when something is truly a parody and should be protected it doesn't count so all of it's just annoying and i think what we'll do um is if enough people are interested i'll just buy stuff directly through custom ink which i've also used before for work stuff and for um melon had stuff back in the day but i'll just have a sign up sheet basically that says hey i want one t-shirt we want three t-shirts whatever it is they'll all look the same but you can order whatever size you want um and we'll pick a color i don't know um embroidered hats i'll make a new logo specifically for embroidered hats maybe and with stuff like that i think you only need to order a batch of um you can buy individually but five will start to get you that lower five to seven will usually start to get you that lower price so right all we need is just people to say hey i am interested in buying this um in the price range you know yeah because that does matter because they have stinkin north face jackets that you can embroider for 120 or something like that too but don't want that okay is there anything else you want to talk about we do get comments that our episodes are a little long so i know which i was like no i wasn't offended it's a joke i know and lately i've been listening to podcasts that are like almost two hours long yeah i guess it depends so some but sometimes i do like a quick like 30 minute 45 minute podcast yeah i like i like shorter videos sometimes it just depends so uh yeah give us feedback um we really appreciate everyone that's filling out a form and stuff too yeah for sure um we'll get through some more episodes and hopefully get more regular at this and then we'll be able to um did you guess yeah and let you know uh i will be doing that too yeah that sounds good to me interesting stuff now we need an outro um i don't know what was it we said last time that was our new outro i forget i forget too it was just something i said off the top of my head i we should do a whole podcast over i can't no how about you look like a southern accent like a sweet little like southern accent i could do a southern one i think if i could i don't know if i could last that long i wanted my star wars character to have a southern draw for a while and i didn't go through with it some cats get into the cat food cat why didn't you go through with it i think i would have enjoyed that hearing you talk like this with a southern accent yeah we'll see anyway thank you guys for listening hope you enjoyed we'll be back with more next time on breakfast with cereal bye go safe square button i know that now", "woptOtbZmVQ": "alright guys we've covered a lot of different food products on a channel the the pizza crackers the Kinder Surprise

you know whatever", "bNTjuqKCcrs": "This weeks chalk art, drawn as a Butterfree Doesn't really have anything to do and I didn't want to erase it yet. So  I decided to keep it for this weeks chalk background! to one of my friends for donating toward my AIDS Life Cycle!! in the links in the description below! Hey guys!! Ray Pajar from Get Crafty Crafty!! And today we'll be making cereal bars! They're kind of like rice crispy treats but instead of using you'll be able to use any type of cereal that you want. Today we'll be using and Trix! Let go ahead and get started with todays project! for todays project include: your favorite cereal, butter, a muffin tray, a spatula, access to an oven and as an option step to put inside your cereal bars. Today I'm using First, either using some or some butter you want to coat the insides of your muffin tray so that the insides wont stick. Once you've done that set it aside. Next inside your large cooking pot, you want to take 3 tablespoons of butter and melt it. Once your butter has completely melted to a medium/ low heat, take your pack of mini marshmallows, and throw it into your mixing pot. Continue to mix your marshmallows into your butter. Once your butter and your marshmallows have completely melted you want to remove it from the heat and add all of your cereal! Carefully mix it in until it's completely coated! Once you've completely mixed your cereal, and it's been covered in it's marshmallow you want to work fast and carefully place them inside your muffin tray. Add about half a spoon full. As an optional step add a few Reese's peanut butter cups. and then add another spoonful to create a little ball! Continue to do this until you've finished all of your cereal bars. As an optional step to using a muffin tray or a casserole tray. Add your cereal treat spread it out sprinkle some Reese's peanut butter cups of your cereal treat. Make sure everything is covered and press down. You want to let your cereal treats chill for about 20 minutes before you cut into them or take them out of the muffin tray. Once your cereal bars have chilled they're ready to be eaten. You could cut them open and enjoy the gooey chocolate part on the inside and as optional step you guys could take a few extra Reese's peanut butter cups and just throw them into your bar. If you guys make this make sure you share it with me either on my facebook, instagram or twitter using the #GetCraftyCrafty hashtag and check out our last two cooking videos: the Yoshi Easter egg and the apple flower blossom. Also check out our last two other videos: the time lapse video and our I Spy jar! Get Crafty Crafty!! Come back next time and stay crafty!", "24zgq2OL9zw": "hey what is up everybody and I'm back another food tasting video and today we are going to be going over they are who tasting the special kellogg's cereal bars flavors red berries you see here muktha many calories one bar it's 90 calories so it's just okay once again I'd want to rip the packaging I already did it open yes packaging strong on this thing I already read it my gosh I'm really bad at opening up packages okay smaller than last time with that blueberry bar it's a bit smaller we open it up here's the bar RT is the wrapper and just open it like this ooh get that bit harder than that blue braid by kissing but exceed yeah the blueberry bar was kind of like a really soft taste this is really hard go hard to say coat me I think cereal bars part IDK strawberry taste then the other one is blueberry this one strawberry I'm still really good bye app state says seven and half of the blueberry part I have to give it a seven I know I just kind of liked it because consistency of the blue-gray more than this guy was like more fulfilling oh no I like the texture is kind of a field for me blood there was a poptart more yeah come on pop tart yea once again Kellogg's strawberry cereal bars and I'll see you all in my next video", "kCOdKRKYQvI": "Oh cat munch chronic toast crunch fruity Lupe's nope not your favorite childhood cereals here they're the names of marijuana edibles found in somebody's car deputies stopped a car in - fork and got a strong whiff of marijuana a drug sniffing dog checked out the car and led them to a cooler in the trunk and that is where deputies found these three people were arrested", "8sO6pCbV8SM": "let's jam crispy sope Rice Krispies cereal milk bars do they rock", "F2didyFOsuA": "mmm-hmm it was going I guess I figured I'd get on real quick and do a video for today I am going this is recorded the day before just wanted to get on and talk real quickly about I've been trying this last few days is the breach ballistic as rad-con is a BCA with caffeine and basically so I've been using it at work the last couple days instead of having my second energy drink which I usually have probably you know two three four o'clock in the morning usually last night actually I forgot my energy drink at home so I didn't have a back-up plan or this was my backup plan you know in case this didn't work for me when sometimes caffeine just doesn't work for me so this was what I had to have in order to make sure I was a weak up my weight home so I ended up drinking this and finishing around five o'clock in the morning and I leave work about 6:30 so I was good on the way home all the way home and now it's about ten o'clock at night and I'm gonna have this right now I didn't have an energy drink around five so about five hours ago I had an energy drink so this I'm just gonna step on it no reason for me to slam it down or anything like that I plan on being down in the basement you know for a few hours either working on the computer or playing on video games so plan on having this for a while I do have energy drinks for later if I need it or I can have another one of these or just drink water or crystal light I can use so next thing cereal bar told you I was in a sample these I'm that my daughter is really excited to try one of these also so I think me and her are gonna try another one for you guys tomorrow right now I'm gonna get into this rainbow breakfast one I'm not really hungry I've only had one meal today but I wanted to at least try this right now I take a couple bites and then eat the rest of it later so as you can see I'm assuming the white frosting was usually where the protein is probably at in there and then it's more colorful on this side here well now you can see the I'm assuming it's like what I say I don't know a lot of Steel so I always forget Lucky Charms I'm assuming it's like lucky cheese so I'm gonna give this track that's really looks like a good NOLA bar with frosting and marshmallows on this is really really good all right all right so yeah I definitely be getting some more of these I'm not sure I'll probably decide what flavor I like the most and then be getting more of those either for snacks or if I'm leaving the house on a goal real quick and want some breakfast I grab one of these that'd be good to go I mean I'm Riv bars you got one right here for later on tonight so I don't really have a lot of food in the house you know these can be the same type of thing the super bar is just more of a you know a through D type of thing that you would have you know earlier in a warrant a bill even though there well this is the crunchy peanut butter cup but the blueberry cobbler one more of a dessert kind of in between meals type of thing that's why I've been using them at least back at this real quick so it's kind of see it a little bit so I did a little bit of more research on this I did see some other people posting about it that there is you know a little bit of not not exactly grittiness to it but there is it doesn't mix as well you know they see 8 to 10 ounces I don't know how many I think this is 20 ounces that's how much water I've been using to make this what then it's all perfect but it does leave some residue and a little bit of you know grit right down the bottom so then a little bit of looking into it researching leucine has one of the amino acids that's in there it's hard to see at that angle but the lights just hitting it right on my side you can see the the floaties in there but it's not you know backwash you know but it's it's leucine so leucine is if it's a good protein or a girl BCA true leucine does not mix very well in water it's not water soluble so it will you don't stick to the cup or it'll be gritty when you drink it so that's how you know that it is a true really good BCA if the leucine does not mix in look for the water true leucine is not water-soluble that's what I found take it as you want that but that's what I saw and yeah all right I think I'm on this one here say is the first day if not I'm doing a video every day in April but I will be doing as many videos as I can still continue going forward just to work on that groves yeah if you like this video please give me a thumbs up please comment subscribe there will be a link to redcon as

"FzU1FQdCokE": "viewer discretion is advised ah yawn today's gonna be such a great day I got plenty of sleep last night you know maybe I'm ask for that girl's number today I think I have enough conference now just try and enjoy a serial no no dude wake up it's nine o'clock you're late for school started waking up late for school not enough time to make breakfast got cereal but no milk or if I told you there was a creation that you don't need milk but we can have cereal in this case introducing cereal balls with this you basically make all your fan favorite cereals together into little edible snacks so today we have some lucky charms these nice little Batman things for loops with shrek on them some frosted flakes and some apple jacks all we need really get started today is some measuring cups little fancy things some marshmallows butter and margarine a saucepan and then a stovetop and that's optional you have a little chef head as well but today let's get started so what we got to do is have clean hands in this case always want to stay sanitary and save so I'd like to use cucumber melon so please apply that about a drop or two and you don't scrub down under your nails take all that nasty stuff out of it germs your wands eco get too warm yeah shut the water running before noon that's okay alright guys so after I got my parents permission when you just sell top my set to medium low in this case and then we're just add our marjorine / butter if you use whatever the land lakes one I can't believe it's not butter I don't know if aunt jemima makes any but that's who this comes off alright so I understand let this spread across and let it really melt on this will basically let all the marshmallows and everything else not stick to the actual pan then from there we just wait flatten out base alright and now we should have balls in this case um I'm not exactly how much the actual recipe said so I'm just gonna add a bunch and now we have to continuously stir so marshmallows don't melt and stay on the actual pan one hour later two hours later three hours later removable join cards alright so as you can see the actual marshmallow started actually completely melt and dissolve so now we actually add actual lucky charms and I was going to turn this together someday I'll could join now we're going to place all the actual serial combination right onto this little salt baking pan that case might get all covered in that area and use a wooden spoon the bus and one because it's not gonna stick versus plastic base I'm just gonna try get all of it off and we'll get spread out across so it's even as we're patting it down it's at least gonna stay on the pan itself so then everything gets really spread across and it's gonna be even because I'll the actual marshmallow fluff gets hardened pretty quick so sorry about that guys I was in and out my kitchen my parents kicked me out they had some family over so I go let's I wasn't that cool to hang burning once the actual serial started to cool down from the pan we basically got some gloves on and we started lubricating them with some little cooking spray oil and that was able from us to actually send it to lowball from so if you take a look this is a finished product I didn't realize my phone was dead when I was actually recording this so this got least what I look like at the end so it's pretty

granola bars you can always eat the ones you buy in the store if you like chewing on particle board or you can make my easy healthy chewy crunchy granola bars and the best thing is you can customize them with all your favorite crunchy chewy things like I do mine the first thing is you have to preheat the oven at 325 degrees which I've done you prepare a nine by nine inch square pan and I I line it with parchment paper so here's how I do it I cut two strips of about nine inch wide parchment paper and you're gonna line that crosswise but here's the thing I put books on these overnight to straighten them out and they still curls but anyway so you put one sheet across like this and you put the other sheet the other way and you keep these little long edges so you can have sort of handles to pick them up when they're done so tin foil did not work for me parchment paper works the best so there it's lined up you can kind of crease a little bit in place and then you can grease it with a spray that spray stuff I don't like it because I don't like the smell so I just used my little mixture of canola oil and butter and I just reached the pan this is probably the hardest part of the recipe is just preparing the pan otherwise everything is really really super easy so you just kind of grease it all around like that and that's good to go so I'll set the pan aside okay now here's the recipe you get a big bowl and we're gonna start with two and a half cups of oatmeal this is regular oats it's not the instant ones just regular ones from the store and you don't have to measure this super exactly like you're baking a cake so just about two and a half cups of these regular oats for a nice fiber then we're going to have a quarter cup of sweetened flaked coconut and when you add the coconut kind of loosen it with your fingers because you get these little clumps of coconut and you don't want that so kind of loosen it up really well when you add the coconut and then we're gonna add two tablespoons of brown sugar and I did this originally with a quarter cup of brown sugar but to me they were too sweet but you can use a little bit more but there's one and two tablespoons of brown sugar now here's the fun part you set this aside and you're going to add your extras this is how you can customize your own this is what I use right here I prepared my extras now here we have we have some toasted walnuts we have toasted pecans we have toasted almonds we have dried cherries which I love and we have these little mini chocolate chips but there's other so much other stuff you can add if you want to or use instead of any of these you can add raisins chopped figs chopped prunes dried blueberries dried cranberries sunflower seeds peanuts pumpkin seeds anything you want even big chocolate chips dentist loves the big chocolate chips so anyway it's about 1 cup whatever your dry crunchy ingredients are it's about 1 cup so I think I've got 1 cup here we'll see how well I measured looks like just about that's close enough so we're gonna put all this into the dry ingredients and before you add the liquids you're going to stir this up and separate the coconut and all that stuff stir it up just a little bit and now we're going to add three other ingredients this is the liquids basically you're going to take a quarter cup or a third of a cup sort a third of a cup of canola oil okay now when you measure oil of course it's good to look at it at a good eye level and that's about a third of a cup and you add a third of a cup of honey and this is kind of the glue that holds it all together so 1/3 cup huh well it takes a while but it will come out you can go the bathroom and come back if you want or you can go eat a granola bar and come back or you can just what wait a minute maybe you can do it this way what is this a mistake ok have to watch your thing up to 2/3 of a cup maybe that's the better way to do it okay that's two thirds of a cup you can see it I'd I level you need one teaspoon of vanilla extract I use this good stuff I love this vanilla no artificial flavoring okay and that's it that's all the the wet ingredients now you combine it all and that's the whole recipe so kind of mix this up a little bit by putting the oil in here first it helps to keep that honey from sticking to the bottom too much so you put it in here combined it really well and make sure you use a big enough bowl because you want to have to kind of go up the sides a little bit so you'll feel it it almost gets kind of heavier as you stir it but that's good but stir it really well because you have to distribute especially that honey so that's the stuff that's going to hold it all together okay so it's all stirred up now into the prepared pan okay I have to do it so you can see it these round these spatulas are so great for clearing out bowls and stuff these soft silicon spatulas now you press it down into the pan but you have to really press it down into the pan so it's kind of a messy job so I like to use a latex glove but you can do it with your bare hand and you press down really really well if you don't think this is important I'm telling you got to press it really hard if you don't think it's important talk to the hand okay because I'm telling you you have to do this so you press down all over get into the corners turn it keep pressing I've even done this with them like at the bottom of a glass that's kind of flat or like a measuring cup that's flat you can be creative if you want anything that's kind of flat but if you press hard enough use your whole palm of your hand press really hard all the way around and that's it don't talk to this hand now it's ready for the oven it's been preheated to 325 you put it in the oven for 30 minutes and after 30 minutes you take it out okay after 30 minutes you take it out of the oven and put it on a cooling rack and here's the thing you have to cool it in the pan don't try to cut it until it completely cools that's my little secret and this is important if you don't think it's important to cool in the pan talk to the hand okay this is how they're gonna come out of the pan they're nice and cool now the paper will come off because you prepped it really well see it feel see how nice and sticky and shiny it is on the bottom now you get a good sharp knife a big knife and you cut it into bars I usually cut it down the middle first like this halfway down and then I cut it into bars and you know remember you're cutting through your nuts and dried cherries and all kinds of stuff I cut it into about seven bars like this one two three four okay six bars six or seven bars whatever size you think sometimes you can do them in squares also so that's it here's your delicious healthy crunchy crispy Carolla bars you can eat these or you can chew on particle board it's up to you", "QYEcKEqXU8E": "hello folks welcome back time filing large that's me as always the hosts about founding liars I

and I got what's called a Lucky Charms breakfast bar I was on the go I needed breakfast I went into a gas station real quick and I got this you guys know what Lucky Charms is right it's a cereal filled with marshmallows and little frosted cardboard shapes of some kind I wouldn't really recommend it if you're you know China trying to have a healthy diet you know it's probably like the last thing I'd recommend actually however I don't know I guess the colors intrigued me so I picked it up now here's the thing you might notice that it is open but it is not fully consumed why I something I think ah this isn't good something bad is happening yet again what what's going on well I think somebody's tracking my every move and due to predictive programming software that my enemies have on me they're predicting what choices I'm going to make and I think they knew I was going to pick a Lucky Charms breakfast bar this particular morning why well when I opened it take a look at this when you open a package such as this you expect to just find the food untampered which right you don't really expect the package itself to attack but look you looking look at this it's peeling off and man I am really bad at this with my left hand I think I got enough for you to see right look it's attached to it if I didn't know better in fact I didn't know better I already ate a little bit I would consume the package itself along with the food item you understand now it has nutritional facts for the the food itself none of its good as you might imagine but there are no nutritional facts about the foil itself you understand so anything could be in this in this item you understand I don't think it's good to consume aluminum but I don't even know if it's just aluminum alone this looks like this trip was strategically manufactured to be stuck on this item for consumption purposes you understand so I might be uh I might be bugged now I might have a limited amount of time to live I don't know how did they know that I was gonna grab this I don't like it maybe it's a long-term thing to make me is a little bit and poisoning like a thing poisoning I don't know but maybe it's like a thing that's like a long-term plan where I'm sick over the next 10 years and I don't suspect it's from like one food item you understand so I am just going to throw this in the trash and just I guess it's just

make ooey gooey cinnamon toast crunch bars you know it's medicated let's go ahead and get into it let's do it alright guys so today's video is being sponsored by goodies420.com that is my cannabis blog if you want to see this recipe and all the other recipes goodies420.com thank you very much all right guys so check this out it's two o'clock in the morning and i want a little treat so i went to the refrigerator went to the kitchen trying to see what's going on so i could have a little treat i said man i got a little bit of cinnamon toast crunch left i don't have any rice krispies left because i ate them what can i do so i decided yo i'm gonna make some cinnamon toast crunch bars heavily medicated so that's what we're doing what i'm doing right now is i'm putting the butter and the can of butter inside of our pot right here this recipe is very simple it's butter it's marshmallow it's cereal if you want to know the exact measurements all you gotta do is click the click the link in the description it'll take you right over goodies420.com it'll take you right over and show you exactly what i uh exactly the measurements of everything that i did i appreciate you but check this out whenever you're doing cinnamon toast crunch bars you can have them ooey and gooey like we're doing or you can make them a little bit more dry what you got to keep into consideration is whenever you're medicating these all of the medication is coming from this butter that see in this milk right that's all the medication that's where it's coming from so whenever we melt this butter and then we put the marshmallows on top of that and we melt that up that's all that's where all your medication is coming from so if you do your your cinnamon toast bars a little bit drier then they're not going to be that medicated because this is where it's all coming from right here so just keep that into consideration so once we melt our butter you're going to put your marshmallows inside of here these are the ones that we had left over from the rice krispie treats we're going to melt this down looking wonderful oh you're looking so wonderful yeah once they're uh melted down you're gonna go ahead and put in your cinnamon toast crunch like i said i had a little bit left so we just went ahead and throw it in here if you want to make them ooey and gooey remember you want to have more marshmallow and butter than you do cereal whenever you're doing like a rice krispies treat the proportions are where the rice krispies treats are for the most part a little bit more drier is i mean unless you make them like i do which i make them a little bit more gooey i like mine heavily medicated the recipe that i'm giving you right now is going to make you four bars we're using two cups of cereal this is going to make us four bars i'm putting 300 and milligrams of thc in here so each bar is going to be 80 uh milligrams of thc that's how it breaks down so once you have everything combined you know what to do it's pretty simple what i did was i went ahead and sprayed this pan and i know i wanted to do bars so because of the amount of cereal that we use we're going to fill up half of this pan and i'm going to use a wooden spoon in order to put it in the place i'm using this basically as a form because if i use it to form it up like this then i'll be able to you take a knife and cut it into the bars that i want to do but i mean it's totally up to you but this is just how i did it i'm basically using this paint as a mold and so once you do this and you let this sit for like 30 minutes depending on how much you use you know it's going to take different times to sit the more that you use as far as like the marshmallow and butter the longer it's going to take to sit let this sit for like 30 minutes 40 minutes sometimes you know if you do a little bit dryer it'll set even faster than that go ahead and cut them in the bars the bars that you want to cut them in and there you go there you go there you go i got something to eat on i got some cinnamon toast crunch bars do you want to eat with me whoa so yeah just like i was telling you guys 80 milligrams a piece cinnamon toast bars ooey gooey like like i said if you want to make them a little bit drier instead of the uh the amount of butter that i use this is a total of five tablespoons you can you know do less butter less marshmallow or do the same amount of butter and do less marshmallow however you want to do it but i want to mine ooey and gooey medicated up this recipe makes four bars there's only three here because i ate one before i shot this so i hope this video helped you make sure you click the link in the description to go to the recipe thank you so much give me the thumbs up much love guys i really

morning Kellogg's start your great [Music]", "o3APrA_Zc9A": "hello and welcome back to my channel my name is Miss Samantha if you do not know me if you do know me welcome back like I said whoa I'm getting fast at saying that intro in today's video I am going to be doing a cooking video for my preschool one classroom I used to cook once a week in our classroom with my children we made things in our instant pot blender griddle toaster microwave whatever you can think of we were doing cooking activities once a week so I'm gonna start doing cooking activities once a week as well in this video we're gonna be making yogurt granola bars it is super simple to make all you need is a pan yogurt granola and I like to add a strawberry or any type of fruit on top and then all you need is your freezer right there and we'll pop it into the freezer and then they're ready to go alright let's get cookin I assumed you in Closer that way you can see everything that I am doing to be able to make this recipe so what you need is a spoon granola yogurt and optional is fruit I only have this left because I decided to start eating some of these strawberries alright your first step is you want to get your vanilla open and you're gonna sprinkle it on to [Music] and there are some bigger pieces so I might just leave those in and kind of have some of my bars be a little bit more crunchy and thicker all around make sure it's covering the bottom of the tray all right let's spread that out and it looks like we are ready to roll we have spread all of it out I'm gonna spread just a little bit of the crumbs around all right your next step is you want to use yogurt I'm using the Chobani Greek yogurt and it's the vanilla flavor so what you want to do is open up your yogurt and then grab your spoon mix it around a little if it needs any mixing and next you want to start tapping your granola so I'm going to just put it on and put a couple scoops around and then I will start spreading all right after you've covered most of it in yogurt I just kind of did a thin layer of yogurt and my biggest tip is when I was kind of trying to spread it I noticed that it was picking up the granola obviously and it was getting like stuck to it kind of hard to spread so what I ended up doing was taking a lot of yogurt scoops and kind of just putting it on top and different spots and then once it was pretty much all covered then I spread it around and your last step that you need is you can just add your fruit remember I said that I ate some of mine already so it probably won't cover the whole thing but you can just add them wherever you like and that is all of my fruit so all you want to do is go pop this in the freezer for a couple hours and then it'll be ready to go all you need to do is pop this in for a couple hours like I said and then they'll be ready to go so you just need to put it in close your freezer and in a couple hours we will check out how they turned out okay after a couple hours of passed you want to come to back to your freezer and come pull it out and put it on the table make sure for this next step that you have a parent guardian anybody watching you somebody old enough to use a knife to be able to cut your bars into squares you all right that's it for today's video I hope you guys enjoy the yogurt granola bars and check back a next Friday for cooking fridays with preschool plan with me bye bye", "DutpAKCZkqU": "(upbeat music) - Hi, everyone, my name is Muhsinah, a consultant on the Sales\nTraining and Development Team, and I'm gonna walk you\nall through the process of making homemade cereal bars. You only need a few ingredients\nto make this happen. So you need rolled oats. You need a cereal of choice. I've chose to use Rice Krispies treats. Peanut butter, honey, and you just need a splash of vanilla. So the first thing you're gonna do is take one cup of peanut\nbutter and one cup of honey, put them into the microwave\nto get it nice and creamy. So I put this in the\nmicrowave for about a minute. You could also do it on the stove, but microwave was a little bit quicker. You want to get 2 1/2 cups\nof your favorite cereal, then you're gonna go ahead and dump that into your honey and peanut butter mix. So you're gonna stir it\nup until the consistency and they start to stick together. I'll show you how that looks in a minute. Next you're gonna add in your rolled oats, and I would say add them incrementally to make sure that it does not dry out. Let's say that your mixture dries out. You can go ahead and\nadd more peanut butter. You can add more honey to make\nsure that your ingredients are starting to stick together. So as you can see here, they're starting to stick together a bit. So I'm doing well so far. Also, I'm gonna add the\nrest of my rolled oats, because it's still pretty sticky, so it's not drying out on me. So of course, depending on\nthe amount you want to make, you can continue to adjust this. Once you're done stirring\nyour ingredients in, I'm gonna throw in my splash of, I'm gonna do a half a tablespoon, half a teaspoon of vanilla to add to that. Keep stirring, looks like I can add a little bit more of my rolled oats. I'm gonna stir those up. And then if you want to make your recipe a little bit funner, feel free to add in some chocolate chips. I might throw some of those in here. You can add in M&M's if you want. But again, if you wanna\nkeep it on the healthy side, you can stick with these few ingredients, and then you'll be ready to roll. All right, so I'm gonna\nshow you my mixture. So if you look here, all of the ingredients are\nstill sticking together well, and it's nice and warm. So the final step is to get an eight-by-eight dish, line it with parchment paper, and then we're gonna take our mixture and put it in that bowl. The key here is gonna\nbe to flatten them out. 'Cause if you think about a cereal bar, they come in squares. So you want to make sure that you flatten them out in that pan, and the parchment paper\nis gonna help to ensure that it doesn't stick to your glass pan. So I'm gonna go ahead\nand flatten that out. If you want to flatten\nit out with your hands, that might make it a little bit more fun. Of course, make sure your hands are clean. It is a little bit warm, because it came out of the microwave, but I've pressed that down. So here we are. Final step, put it in the refrigerator to chill for about two hours. Once they come out, you slice them into your cereal bars, and you're ready to eat.", "axVWxG7hhL8": "hey guys specs bargains here and right now i'm in stokes because this week nutrigrain bars are on

you see my butter is almost completely melted and I'm gonna go ahead and start putting my marshmallows inside the pin [Music] so now since I have my desired amount of marshmallows in the pan I'm just mixing them in the butter a bit and then I'm gonna start pouring into fruity couples now I like to do this before the marshmallows are completely melted because you don't want the marshmallows to overcook because they get like super hard and you're gonna ruin your rice krispies treat so now I'm just coating the marshmallows with the fruity pebbles and I'm gonna pour more of the fruity pebbles into the marshmallows until I get the desired amount and you'll know like how much to pour because if you see too much white then you know you don't have enough cereal in there so now you see the marshmallows are fully coated and they're about cooked down now so I'm just going to keep stirring them until all the marshmallows are melted down [Music] now that all the marshmallows are melted down

try in your own home enjoy today ladies and gentlemen we will be making yogurt cereal bars the materials you'll need for this recipe include a mixing bowl a microwavable bowl honey oat flavored cereal dried cranberries honey almonds a knife some yogurt peanut butter a baking pan and parchment paper let's go ahead and start with our honey and our peanut butter we will be taking well a half a cup of honey and a half no i'm sorry 1 4 cup of peanut butter if you have to use your eyeball go ahead and eyeball it now let's move on to 1 4 cup of peanut butter [Music] stir that up a little bit and then we're going to put this into the microwave for about 45 seconds while that's going on the microwave we're going to take our main mixing bowl and combine the rest of the ingredients except for the yogurt so we'll start with three cups of our honey oat cereal a half a cup of dried cranberries then a half a cup of almonds a little more for taste stop to the side and after our peanut butter and honey gets out the microwave we'll go ahead and combine this so we combined everything up and look what we have here back from the microwave is our honey and peanut butter combination so make sure we stir it around and make sure everything's incorporated and after we've done that check we're going to go ahead and combine it into our ball let's start mixing combining everything let's just get dirty the peanut butter and the honey is acting like it's our glue and after we have everything evenly coated we're going to put it on our parchment paper in our baking sheet spread it out the best we can but make sure we don't leave any gaps now when choosing your baking pan you want to make sure that you have baking pan that's not too big not too small not exactly pretty but it'll get the job done let's go ahead and get this ready for the freezer so that it can firm and when we come back we'll top it off with our yogurt it's been over an hour in the freezer and it's time to apply the yogurt on top of our cereal bar but before you do that be sure to condition your yogurt to make sure it's uh smooth so it can be spread smoothly across your cereal bar smooth it on out if you can see some lumps it becomes transparent that means you have enough night area we can move to another place you can use whatever yogurt you choose today i use honey yogurt so my cereal bar will have a additional honey taste [Music] looks like we're ready for the freezer my hours are 45 minutes in the freezer and then afterwards we'll come back and slice it into bars all right good people it's been a hour in the freezer as you can tell the yogurt has set and firmed on top of our cereal um but we can't we don't want to leave it out too long or they'll begin to liquefy again so let's without any further ado let's go ahead and slice this bad boy up and turn this thing into some cereal bars 10 cereal bars some bigger than others but at the end of the day you still have a tasty snack wrap it up and some parchment paper and put it in the freezer and when it's time to eat i go for it all right this has been another edition of no bake where we take the simple things and make it tasty and tantalizing see

carbohydrates massively if you're trained properly and hard reason for having products like this a and they will deal with some of your sweeties cravings and they just very quickly and resist seeing at home yourself these very high hundreds of real servings that's that's that's what you start generally and you can work your way up from there but remember these well the fat content is really low so they digest super fast with the fat content so those oat straw training hits you really quick only two and a half grams in the cocoa pod is even less than one point two yeah one point two so literally to pretty much just like pure Rice's bonus training system so as if every added extra there's also got smaller series you take so as an or you can add it if I like by a round of American cereal so like one reason about Cinnabon very sweet to use for cinema stuff so why I like to do is I mix 50-50 of whatever servings are supposed to have some sort of mitigating the damage if I was having pure more junky cereal I have half the Rice Krispies half this my to another one there I haven't actually tried yet just fresh mozzarella cups and he's crushed my soul with this my favourite one is actually what's that other cinnamon one golden grains oh yeah yeah yeah they're mainly good any other sweet treat ones are having their low a lot people miss you mix up in recent he's like a charm that's people on popular for I won't just bit healthy or something like to go for we to the committee so you get chocolate ones eat the fruit nut raisin ones twice with four grams 5 grams outrageous people don't pay attention to when they obviously a lot of people know now because it's more accessible or not and that you should if you're training if you're training is in in check and you're training hard that you should be spiking your insulin levels after your training session that's probably an animal against the most important meal to get your club hydrates in but what a lot of people to understand is the fat content and the fiber content play a massive role as well there's a higher the fat fiber content the more that belongs the insulin response in your system so when you're trying to choose a post-workout carbohydrate trying find one that fiber and fat content is that's the key to get the response post-workout know that down to like someone's there are we to be too quickly the other two minutes these to the actual writing of them is very low like you get a massive bowl of coke people to rush through the honey grounds yeah baba love we mix 100 grams is impressive so if you're greedy like me rice krispies Coco Pops he takes a lot longer to eat yeah he's brings like it's a lot more impressive so these are my thoughts from the post-workout cereal and
