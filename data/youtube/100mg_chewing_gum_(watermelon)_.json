description Amazon affiliate link so click on that you can help me out you can help yourself out buying it directly I think I've done a review of the watermelon gum before I'm not sure but you can never have too many video reviews on your channel you like my videos do a thumbs up subscribe like share leave a comment you want to support my channel ask for make a Pell info make sure you check out the links of the video description of God does that smell good let's zoom on in and see what that is it's smells delicious I think they sell a cinnamon gum do they sell cinnamon I don't know if they sell cinnamon I'm looking right now they saw the Bubblegum which I love they sell the spearmint they have a peppermint that I see on the screen I've never gotten the peppermint alright let's open this thing up okay so this is I thought this was the big thing this is uh what I say 10 packages of 15 so that means that we have 1 2 3 4 5 and 1 2 3 4 5 just imagine you just sauce with a package so this stuff's really good I love I can probably go on a store and buy it but for me I don't know if it's cheaper if it cost a little more money I really don't know buy this online but the convenience I just click on the thing and I've got the gum so when I run out I chew a lot of gum I swallow a mass with all of this gum that's in here 150 pieces I'm gonna swallow all of this probably within the next month I tear off little pieces of the gum and I drew it and I swallow it so I want to do a review on this I want you to see this beautiful stick of gum it smells really good now if I remember correctly I'm I have to tell you in a minute but if I remember correctly the Bubblegum was really good and it holds the flavor and it just tasted it and it's it makes a good bubble some people complain that it doesn't really make good bubbles where it doesn't last long the flavor for the watermelon if done nowadays if you're not gonna have a flavor of gum forever you don't want all that flavor and the gum because it's probably not good for your body so let's go test this out now and see how it goes all right that's what we want to do so we're shooting this at HD 2160 so this is gonna be really zoomed in on your screen here's the gum very oh just a burst of flavor delicious definitely sweetness they're not just flavor but as I'm tasting it now I am noticing there is definitely a sweetness in here they're they're not using sugar because it's sugarless but there is some aspartate or something in here watermelon yeah tastes like watermelon I wouldn't say it's a hundred percent water Melanie mostly because right now is I'm chewing it I think I couldn't be wrong but it seems like there's a lot more sweetness than this gum then there used to be maybe my oral glands are more sensitive right now and so I'm aware of the sweetness a little more but it definitely has a sweetie a sweeter taste I don't want to say more sugary but it's got a sweeter taste so there's definitely some artificial something in here we keep good gum so it's kind of thinning out right now I hope just got a message on the phone what's kind of thinning out but it tastes good normally like I said I swallowed my gum so if I take two pieces of gum which I like to do I'd like to - true two of them at once if I do that I will swallow the gun faster but I'll also make bubbles with it and it'll be a little more wild with that and it will last long with this piece of gum seems it's like any standard gum definitely causing me to salivate a lot more than normal so it is good we've been recording for about three minutes in the beginning video was probably two minutes so I'll talk for another five minutes or so I'd like to make ten minute videos ten minute and one second as I'm showing up definitely lots of taste and notice I did a little bit of Shaving before I came over on the video to record so I've got about nine videos I have to record tonight there's no way I'm gonna get to them but I figured the gum the gum is the easiest because all you have to do is put some gum in your mouth and shoe don't tell people what you think so I've been chewing this for about five minutes without chewing it now I'm just gonna keep my mouth study and my tongue and the roof of my mouth feels kind of like I've had some peppermint you know that feeling when you need peppermint when you have some hot sauce and you're the skinny you're your tongue or the roof of your mouth how's that feeling even after you've finished eating it well that's kind of how my mouth and my tongue feel right right now it feels like some type of something has been applied to that area and even though I'm not chewing the gum right now I have that feeling on my tongue and the roof of my mouth that something flavorful and different has been there and it's kind of burned into the to that area for the moment it definitely smells watermelon II maybe that's part of the what they're doing is it has such a great watermelon smell that maybe the brain is saying okay this is a very strong watermelon smell and as far as watermelon taste I don't know I'm chewing it again I'm getting a little more flavor out of it I'm gonna make a big assumption here that most of the flavor is in that outer coating of that white coating I think a lot of the flavors and that maybe some is mixed into the base of the government that's a good gun I bought it because I haven't had it in a while and I want her to do another review on it and see how I like it what I buy it again I don't know that's a tough one it's not bad I'm not saying it's a bad gun I just wouldn't say it's the greatest right now it's okay it's got a good flavor 150 sticks this will last me a month month and a half next order I don't know if I'm going to deal what did I say peppermint or spearmint I might do that you know when you buy peppermint or spearmint gum you're taking a chance all the time because some of it is really way too strong and just excessive the bubble gum the extra the chewy bubble gum they have that extra bubble gum mmm delicious and again I don't remember if they have cinnamon I'm thinking of the of another brand I think Wrigley's big red or cinnamon red or something and I don't think Wrigley's is the same as Extra gum two different companies so I want to try another flavor for my next video maybe if you have any comments or suggestions on what flavor to try in fact let's take this a step further if you want me to do a taste test suggest another brand of gum another flavor of gum and if I can get it on the big a I'll buy it and I'll do a taste test and I'll let you know what I think what are we at 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 we're at 7 minutes and let's assume that I only talked for a minute and a half so word 8 so we need to go for another minute and a half [Music] I mean I really like two pieces of gum but when I use two pieces it's just so much and when I have one piece it just doesn't feel like there's enough I feel like I have this tiny piece of gum in my mouth or I'll start tearing pieces off with my tongue let me show you how I do that here's the gulp here's the gulp right now there was and that's what I do until the gun is gone and then I go grab another one um but I'm looking for different gums I only choose sugarless now let me make a comment on that two comments I when I get my teeth cleaned normally I do really well I just have the normal build up that everybody has and for a few months I went out and I bought some different kind of gamma it was not sugarless it was sugar gum and I kept on wondering why do I have all this tartar on my teeth where is this stuff coming from it was all over just in the in the bottom inside where the salivary glands are so that's normal for anybody that this stuff was massively excessive and when I went and had my teeth clean they said yeah well what have you done differently and then I realized wow I've been chewin gum that's not sugarless and I was 200 every night and it caused a lot of lot of our target so I went back to the sugarless gum and I think in one of my video reviews from the Extra gum I was reading the label and I saw something weird and I'm like why in the world is this thing in gum I didn't know what it was and I looked it up and I was really not too happy with some of the health things that they talked about in there and I said I'd probably never buy this gum again but here I am chewing it it's delicious but again it's kind of bland it does have a good flavor it's still holding ten minutes later it's still holding the watermelon flavor it's kind of and I think the with the extra bubblegum I don't say that ever so it's really weird as I'm doing this recording right now because I have the camera facing towards me I see this little red dot right over here and I keep thinking that it's a zit but it isn't it's the camera showing that it's recording I thought I'd share that with all my viewers thanks for keeping my channel going have a good 20 20 everybody don't forget check the video description click on those links and until the next video see you people", "DR-g1_uisUE": "everyone here is a reveal now I've been chewing this bubblegum since I was a kid you can't buy this in the store anymore oh yeah maybe you can I can't find it anywhere and then when I started buying online I went wow you can buy this stuff and so I bought a couple cases that case is packed like this years ago and I just stopped chewing gum so I didn't eat the stuff but well that's what I do I swallow a lot of this so I recently started chewing gum again and when you chew gum that's not sugarless you will see massive tartar on your teeth when you go to the dentist just all over the place I couldn't believe it and then I went oh I've been chewing regular gum and I wonder so what I started buying this extra classic bubble gum that's just awesome so I'm almost done with that I got one package left and I went online and I thought let me try something else they make a whole bunch of flavors I've never tried say just got this in the mail today I know it's so weird you imagine nowadays insides bubble gum through the mail you by going through the mail just incredible but you can't get this stuff in other stores so it came in a package obviously and the package smells so good oh my gosh just incredible so I'm all excited to try this I've never never had watermelon bubble gum before smells like the watermelon hard candies that you used to get at Halloween the rancher things God smells exactly like that so I'm gonna give you my review my review is the most important thing out there and that's why I'm doing the video so if my videos help you thumbs up subscribe and a like if you have a product you want me to review let me know if I can get a hold of it I will if you want to have me if you want to donate to my channel ask for my paypal info if you want to share this on any website you know the routine and I say that all my videos so some of their packages comes this comes in 15 sticks some of them what does this come in 1015 stick packages 15 sticks some of them come in I think lass smells really good so I'm gonna give you my opinion now I'm pretty excited because what I'm gonna do after this I'm gonna go out and buy their know I think they sell a peppermint or spearmint and they get a whole bunch of different flavors so I'm gonna buy them all and look smell look good I used to chew while I used to eat watermelon all the time you know watermelons healthy and it's kind of good if you're diabetic but it's massive amounts of sugar and I was eating about one watermelon every two days every three days so I stopped eating watermelon mmm this is good this is delicious they might have to eat like one of these a day I'm kidding butts tastes really good it has the same consistency as the Bubblegum so obviously I don't know if it's a bubblegum let me see if I can pop a bubble with that probably can they're sugar-free I'm building up for a bubble the gum is kind of chewy kind of thick it's good it tastes delicious [Music] yeah I gotta watch these little bubble out of that really good gum so what do I say extra long-lasting flavor I don't know I just bought it for the first time sweet watermelon it's delicious it's really really good and it's so hard to find sugar-free sugarless gum nowadays see if you have to buy it on the internet buy it a long time this has been my favorite flavor and I'm pretty excited about this one now that's my life it's kind of slow and boring so I get excited about gobbling this stuff is delicious the end I'm gonna go post this review and if you're interested in this follow my channel subscribe to my channel after I finished this what do I have 15 sticks we have 10 packages after I shoe this hundred I swallow my gum all the time after I swallow this hundred and fifty pieces of watermelon sweet watermelon gum I'm gonna go out next to buy the peppermint spearmint and I think they have a fruity flavor I don't know if I'm gonna buy that not too much into fruity I live in Los Angeles by the beach not not around West Hollywood so but I don't know if I want to get a fruit again my review this is delicious they're really good I don't shoe the other gums that are out there when I put it in my mouth my teeth start to burn because there's so much sugar in there there's so much junk this is really tasty I don't know what they're using instead of sugar they were evil label probably stuff that 35% fewer calories than sugar gum calorie content to this size pack piece has been reduced from 8 to 5 Alois oh it's been reduced serving size one stick so there's five calories per stick two grams of carbohydrates one percent of your daily input so if you if you shoot 100 sticks of gum you would hit your carbo intake for the day sugar alcohol that's what they're doing they're using sugar alcohol produced with genetic engineering yikes I had no idea why would you need to genetic engineer down does it say oh okay here this is what I'm looking for Zorba tall I didn't know it heads orbital gum base so the main ingredient is love at all which is a sweetener then gum base then glycerol hydrogenated starch hydro hydrolysis at less than 2% of natural and artificial flavors aspartame not to throw up with that at all malic acid soil Ekta thin mannitol citric acid a seal of fame K Hydra lacks aged soy lecithin colors red 40 Lake and red 40 BHT to maintain freshness then lick lurex contains then al aloe and nin say anybody that's the scientist that's watching this video is this stuff dangerous is this stuff bad for you I don't know it tastes good tastes delicious but let me know if I'm doing some harm to myself hey thanks for watching okay I am gonna finish off the package because they just bought it not that I need you but I'm not really too thrilled with the aspartame and the fill fen phen lalala Ninh or whatever that is so I really like the gum but I'm also concerned about my health and my body and your very good chance um but just not gonna buy this stuff anymore I'll try to find something else which is better or not the government's better we're good but some of the chemicals that are in here probably not something that needs to be in here and nothing bad about the gonna bad mouth unit of the company but there's really no reason to put some of these things in here or to genetically engineer gum of all things I'm actually shocked that the package says genetically engineered for a package of gum so after this this will be the last time I'll be buying extra what I want to deal really quick go look at the same thing on the there it is on the bubble gum the exact same thing contains fenya la la Lin or whatever that is it's got the color sucralose gum base hydrogenated starch aspartame mannitol alright that's not good produced with genetic engineering so I love the gum that I don't need the gum that much and so this will be the last time that I'll be buying extra gum I'm gonna look at other packages maybe they've all got this I don't know I want to be fair maybe they all have this exact same thing in there but after this I'll just give up gum if I need to because there's really no reason to be engineering gum hey remember subscribe thumbs up like you know",

january is almost over i'm just waiting for the spring and summer to come now i don't play basketball and stuff it was actually nice today it wasn't too cold it was too hot it was kind of warm i think

we're gonna find out what the best tasting gum is to bald guys eat stuff and talk about it alright so today we have seven different brands of peppermint gum and Lee really likes gum and chewing gum and she like to peppermint the best so that's what we're gonna do a taste test on today so seven different brands we're gonna rate them on a scale of one to ten and we'll find out what the best tasting one is first we're gonna do five gum a whole stick or half a stick whole stick take a jog get tired so pretty good peppermint flavor you like the texture there's a good chewy gum so we're not gonna do a long-lasting flavor we're just gonna do right off the bat some gums can of course the flavor lingers on after a while are the ones that dies off pretty quick but right now we're just gonna taste the initial flavor uh not too spicy right you feel cold yet it's the peppermint all right all right so one out of ten where you don't give it second okay I kind of like this one I'm gonna go with an eight next up we'll do Trident gum one of the oldest gums out there it's a little bit smaller we're grading it on flavor hmm this pepper man it's almost like a mouthwash it's much different than the one we just had we think of that peppermint you don't like it it's kind of spicy so this is a much stronger peppermint flavor than the five did so all right so one out of ten what are you giving it I think it's too bad the textures not bad again it has a lot more peppermint flavor who knows maybe it's not long-lasting but right off the bat it's a lot more peppermint flavor all stick all go with the seven on that one because yeah I feel it's almost over bearing on the peppermint flavor next up we'll do orbit gum another one of the smaller pieces I hope it's not really spicy we'll see hmm this is like a cross between peppermint like a spearmint it's got a lot of different flavor to it you like that one you know like that because to pepper many so none here is like a mouthwash flavor as the Trident gum had it um I kind of liked that car scruff between the spearmint and peppermint though um we gonna give it one that one at him there was that - OH - all right and give the - I'm gonna go up to a8 I like that one pretty good next up we're gonna do it icebreakers which comes in a cube format these got the little crystals in them so of course the texture is much different than your normal stick go it's very refreshing that one seems like this they call it ice breakers that it's cold whatever it comes is mine you like that one so it becomes cold in your mouth it's a weird sensation it's been a long time so divided ice ice breakers you like that your mouth feel cold no it's the mouthfeel and this comes very different than the ones we just had peppermint flavor is still all there I kind like the texture no feeling coal in your mouth so I'll stick with an 8 on that one all right next up we'll do Mentos which looks like a Mentos this one has a harder shell on the outside so it takes a little bit to one to get through it this one again tastes like a mouthwash a lot more peppermint flavor a lot more kick and is doing the one boom if you like that strong peppermint flavor I think you'll like this one even that takes a little to chew to get through time again now who knows about long lasting this is just on initial flavor but it is too strong I'll agree with that so Mentos pure fresh tastes like mouthwash I'll give it a 6 all right next up we'll do extra does your mouth feel clean mouth feel clean you go lick the windows now huh don't lick windows hmm extras um well tone tone down flavor it's again almost got like a spearmint flavor to it too besides the peppermint pretty subtle out of all the peppermint gums up you've tried this one and the five are probably the least amount of flavor on the peppermint side for a spice level you're not spitting it out yes I listen it's good right you think this one does have a sweet flavor to it too so that probably helps Amy's grade yeah this one's pretty good it's almost like a dessert gum yeah I said bring this like to my school can you say you can share with the kids wait she probably liked it because she's kind of like that slim to me oh so this one on the package has long lasting flavors so again we're not testing long-lasting flavor today but that's what other marketing ploys is a long-lasting flavor and they gave it an eye I'm gonna do it an 8 I like this one it's a sweet not too powerful punch on the peppermint on the spice level and see this is the last one we're doing eclipse now this is winter frost flavor doesn't directly send peppermint on the label um it does taste like a cleaner you know way the texture is a little bit weird too I'll call it thicker than the other gums it's not nearly as thin whenever you get chewed up pretty good I'll give it a 6 on that one all right so trying 7 different brands today Amy I found a winner we had to tie at the top of stores specific scores so ice breakers score pretty high but Emily wanted to go with extra because she liked that sweetness to it and she wants to share with her friends so would you like about the extra go um it was played and I think I'll give you that so you can move it up to a ten so there you go so a nice crowd at a perfect ten extra go it's got long lasting flavor on the box so you might give it a try if you haven't tried extra in a while now it's the time because Amy gives it a perfect ten right two bald guys eat stuff and talk about it", "3IDoalziMBQ": "[Music] you're probably

lot of you, I\u2019ve always\nreached for a stick of gum after drinking a cup of coffee or eating some onion-heavy\ndish. I always liked gum, but I never thought I\u2019d\nend up chewing it every single day for a month! It all started when I came across this article\nabout all the health benefits of chewing gum. It can help you lose weight and burn more\ncalories? Good, I\u2019d been stacking on some extra pounds\nrecently. It protects your teeth? Uh, really? I always thought it gave you cavities, so\nI guess we\u2019ll see! It can improve your memory? Awesome, because I've been slowly turning\ninto Dory from Finding Nemo more and more every day! I figured one pack of gum a day would be more\nthan enough, and my weird experiment began\u2026 The first three days were fun. If I wasn\u2019t eating or sleeping, then I was\nchomping down on a piece of gum. I gotta say, my jaw didn't take this challenge\nwell at first \u2013 on day 4 it started aching a little from all that extra chewing. But the next day, everything went back to\nnormal. The next few days went smoothly too \u2013 the\nonly thing that bothered me was thirst. I guess all that sugar and artificial sweeteners\nwas getting to me. But it wasn't that bad either \u2013 I finally\nstarted drinking 8 glasses of water or so a day, and I\u2019m sure my doctor would be proud! During the next 10 days, chewing gum became\nsecond nature to me. I didn't even think twice about it, and any\nresistance in my jaw had gone away completely. But now I had to deal with another thing \u2013 bloating. After a little research, I found out that\nit's the artificial sweeteners to blame. Apparently, they have trouble getting absorbed\nin the small intestines. Plus, when you chew your favorite gum, you\nswallow tons of air too. Thankfully, after two or three days, the bloating\nwent away. On the bright side of things, I started to\nnotice my weight slowly going down. Well, when you're constantly chewing gum,\nyou have no time for unhealthy snacks, right? Plus, you really don't even crave them anymore,\nso it was pretty easy to avoid the junk food. Finally, the last 10 days of my experiment\napproached. You know how a piece of gum feels a bit hard\nin your mouth at first when you chew it? My jaw got so used to it that I didn't feel\nthat at all! But to be honest, by this point I was pretty\nsick of gum. It stopped being fun and became a monotonous\nthing I had to do. Other than that, I felt completely fine, though. The greatest shock to me was the compliments\nI started getting toward the end of my experiment regarding my jawline. I mean, that was never one of my strong features,\nbut now it is! I looked at pictures of myself before and\nafter the experiment, and I could see the change! My jawline got way stronger and more defined\nin just a month. I'm not gonna lie, this made me think twice\nabout stopping the experiment, but I decided enough was enough for now! I guess you're waiting for me to give you\nmy final conclusions. Let me think... I\u2019ll start with the good stuff:\n\u2022 Of course, there\u2019s the chiseled jawline thing. I like the way mine looks now! Frequent chewing gives a great workout to\nthe jaw muscles and boom \u2013 you look like Henry Cavill! Ok, well, maybe not exactly\u2026 \u2022 The weight loss was a welcomed gift. It wasn\u2019t anything too dramatic but still\nenough to feel more comfortable in my body. Chewing gum basically tricks your brain into\nthinking that you're actually eating, so you don't feel hungry that often. And with almost zero snacking, I started feeling\nbetter too! \u2022 Remember how I told you that chewing gum\ncan improve your memory? It supposedly stimulates brain activity, and\nI really think there's some truth to that! I found myself more focused at work and a\nlot less dependent on lists to remind me what I need to get done. \u2022 I also noticed that my stress levels went\ndown. I'm a big worrier, so I was really surprised\nwhen I looked back and realized that I was a lot more chill during the month. I guess that chewing motion calms the nerves\nand releases stress. Good lifehack! \u2022 And, obviously, always having fresh breath\nwas a big plus! I didn\u2019t chew mint gum the whole time, but\neven the fruity flavors gave my mouth a pleasant scent! Kind of a weird observation, but that\u2019s\nthe whole point of gum anyway, right? But it's not all sunshine and rainbows \u2013 there\nwere some downsides too: \u2022 The bloating. Yes, it went away pretty fast, but it is something\nto take into consideration if you wanna start chewing more gum. \u2022 The thirst. It went away a little bit when I changed my\nwatermelon and strawberry gums to mint ones, but I still drank a lot more water than I\nnormally do. I guess you can decide whether that\u2019s a\ngood or bad thing. \u2022 And last but not least were the headaches. I had a couple major ones hit me during the\nexperiment, and I know it had to be because of all that chewing since I never really used\nto get bad headaches. And I saw an article online linking the two,\nso chances are that was the reason. But those are just the things I personally\nnoticed. There\u2019s also tons of research out there\nsaying that chewing stimulates the flow of saliva, which basically flushes away all the\nacids produced by bacteria. This makes your teeth stronger and prevents\ntooth decay. Some gums also contain this thing called CPP-ACP. It can harden your enamel and provide extra\nprotection for your teeth. Plus, there are plenty of dentist-approved\ngums out there! Still, you should be careful if you wanna\ntry this challenge yourself. As I was surfing the Internet and doing all\nmy homework, I found that one woman from Liverpool had to have a jaw operation after chewing\ngum for about 7 hours a day. Apparently, her jaw muscles got worn out,\nand she couldn't even open her mouth more than an inch (2.5 cm)! Okay but how much gum should you chew a day,\nthen? Doctors say you shouldn't do it if you don't\nhave a good enough reason for it. The best time is after meals. Again, it\u2019s all got to do with that teeth-cleaning\nand digestion-boosting saliva production that gets bumped up. And don't forget that you have to choose sugar-free\ngums to get all these benefits. As for me, I chew gum only about 3 times a\nday now \u2013 after breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And, of course, it\u2019s still nice after a\ncup of coffee too. My appetite is better than ever, that Hollywood\njawline is still kicking around, and I\u2019m glad I did this experiment! What's the most exciting experiment you've\never conducted? Let me know down in the comments!

(upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually.

got I'm keen to do this over some more so I've come to Spain there's no one does gum like a sponge welcome to our King race now today the factory are getting stuck in and doing a run on chewy in this matching we introduce all the raw material that we need to make turndown right who's become base firstly comes to the tree now the technology at a farm and we can use a chewing gum started life is a natural product tree sap kucik like these days synthetic gum arrives at the factory in these sheets this just looks like a big piece of chewing you could you eat this now you can try but you have no taste it's really hot it's not sweet it's not labours oh that's like chewing gum hear out of your mouth for a couple of hours so I've learned all about chewing gum but where's the bubble gum and what's the difference so the production line we saw was cheering gasps so how does bubble gum differ well the main difference between both products is the cam base cam base for Sheng Gong has less amount of elastomer Ellis term is used in a synthetic rubber that add flexibility to the base so if bubble gum has more of them than chewing gum and that I want to compare them first up chewing you okay so this is can you see the difference he said last peak so that's quite different this game based a contain a bit amount of elastomers meaning it can stretch to make big bubbles which is simple right in Britain we're stuck on the stuff and it seems we've bitten off more than we could chew across the country we spend 60 million pounds a year just on cleaning up gum which is madness I've come to Leicester to meet a pioneering designer who's come up with a green solution to a sticky situation Suze I'm in the right place Anna Poulos is on a mission to give our chopped-up oakum a new lease of life hi Matt nice me and that's and you're doing think very clever with gum gum is essentially a synthetic rubber that we can actually utilize and we can recycle and we can make into all sorts of different products one of the things that we make is the gumdrop bins that's made very with recycled chinko the idea is that once that's full it can come back to us and your whole gumdrop along with the contents can then be recycled it's a genius idea once the bin is returned they smash it all up and remove any litter that gets mixed in with our secret ingredients and that like this well the pellets that we actually use the pellets are then heated up and made into a paste which can be molded into new objects as it cause what we want to be doing is actually creating products from that which can then be recycled over and over again Anna's idea is the world's first chewing gum recycling scheme I've got a few products yeah that we may I mean it's a weird thought that is showing you it is processed at really high temperatures so anything that sees is killed on you've also got these little kiddies wellington boots they're cheering you made to recycle them very light and when these boots wear out they could just be sent back here and recycled into new ones and then we've also got these as well so these breaks that we're doing it's amazing I mean this really is kind of a guilt free cheering that it's a brilliant abusive [Music]", "VSIewaSOezY": "hey guys welcome back to my Channel today I'm chewing on some bubble gum I have three flavors original up above sour blue

melon but naturally watermelon but yes but more the columellar what initial yes not watermelon but it's EMEA me so I just need a video run demo feel ice white shop messy Israel or done even the movie deserves was boring it was very long exactly are some nudity in some things but otherwise my god in our speakers message about couples and you know the feeling of boy damn awesomeness I could never live without passion without life my god that would kill me my god I can stand right especially silent treatment yeah boredom I have a repentance before being women and you know Sims II experienced a lot in his country's war yes he would make a silent treatment man because I wanted to but he needed to for himself for his sanity and I did try to understand him but I was very young guys and you know I married am i soft amber I yeah the passion was not key in everything really in everything minted that is not good I think you should go out of that relationship as early as possible before you get married and before you know we will get serious but when you are young usually would like think that yeah you will learn how to deal with the other person might change but we say guys I don't believe in that I believe yes we can change but usually that happens when something else yes voicing has to change like for example if we need to survive or that is enough you know to something else then we will change but yeah your character your personality is like it is born yes but it's also molded by your childhood buyer community yeah it's in here by the time you choose a partner so if you love feeling the passion from the start might go out but if I did that my hair will never be boy Wow so it was good it was good for Maria so whatever but yeah otherwise my god I would never be with up my son oh and life and now I can't handle silence well if you have not disguised and talkative but I can require in moments like outside in nature you know why my quiet outside especially when we're out in the real major not like here in Denmark but you know real later than me now we live near Copenhagen so a lot of mountains of money otherwise you have to you have the travel in Philippines why even when power is tapes my car the only times Michael rest from my mouth was I never we were sleeping or in bed there was when we were in nature while when we were eating and even others not whether you are using but in nature so I mean I could handle silence day but weren't reasoning health but otherwise I don't want to be a person needs like solid for weeks and weeks to contemplate on life my god I mean if I wanted a guru I would marry a girl I want someone with like finished already that is one of the reasons I never never ever ever was with someone younger than me or think each of me because especially men they don't mature until there is a loss like Tyrone 35 something less they are ripe enough to pick otherwise avoid them like playing guys or someone who is around that age or just live and labor them if they need you know if you can endure that my god I know I couldn't never never where his father was already 29 when I met him even though he was of course very mature he was a political refugee even though he was like the heart and I was very safe insecure them our life was stable my god we never many problems and I had my own monitor my god but that was not enough without passion he was super it was super manly too I love that about them I love so many things about him his qualities but sometimes I would be like I was saying how old was I when I met them they then been it because I was lagging relationship sometimes I would like contemplate the saying oh I wonder how life might be mr. relationship I know how it would be it would be boring much more boring dude kill myself no not I would not but you know I was always crying he's always always my god I like I was not happy and special even against a child you should not stay in a relationship because the child will see it it was hard but I don't want to lie to myself and not to him either you know being in relationship just because like in the movie Hydra just because it's convenient not just because of the Dacians you know not having a broken family and all these things I could you know family our family it sounds like perfect to me it was not perfect so I don't mean that you should just have passion in a relationship as I had not committed my god you might end up in jail but you should have passion in her life but I don't mean that it should be the main nature in your relationship but you should find someone who has like a passion for life also and it's not just updating other person out entertain yourself but even have why not meet my girl that would always be in my mind like finding someone who is finished with contemplating not finished but you know about him or myself and not like who's ready for life in don't need to meditate for months and months you know spirit person is not ready for the relationship when you're in a relationship you share things so I could never be with a person who needs a separate room prepares a great bedroom my god I can never and I could never accept someone who always needs like a long time like for ours and ours every day oh my god yes when I'm in a relationship also I'm like busy I mean I would have my job studies or my videos I mean I will never know just ever complain of me suffocating them it's usually the other way around I did I am passionate about the person I didn't be with them a long while but never has it happened someone has told me yourself daydreaming ah because I love working while studying but doing everything right because I want a girl I think you get bored because you're doing the same things you're not learning new things that's how I am and why I try to relax I would read books or girl or sign something some other people boys you know from work from anything I love doing I give my 100% in a relationship and if I don't nothing that aquatic version is decentering same thing in the end if the relationship seems to be perfect I have to give up Vegas I need to know both are in it usually though one person is my love's and the other like my friend is not good it's good if you can find someone or is in love it is as much as you I love em that is very high design but that would be perfect of course you manta craft is not enough I would say maybe rift 15 like is you should tell the people in the relationship things and you know but it is you know passion love for each other passion for life you know when your wizard poison you should like get energy from each other that's what I feel when I can and I were together life and also when we FaceTime you should see that just that also me that person yeah I

send you a package of gum and a letter with no return address and says just eat it if it's delicious for you I need water how does it make why is it like that there's no reason why it should produce that much saliva Oh what about these I'm gonna try this tiny one now I'm very slim it just tastes like a hall's cough drop if anything they made me cough more than they helped with the cuff oh my god these are my spout well I think it's happening again I don't know okay so it's horrible maybe I'm putting too much in my mouth let's try mango mayhem there's medicine no warning small objects like gumballs may inadvertently become lodged in the throat no it's dispensed come it's good I get it what's for that why are you who's a lie no you're the problem wait is the point of these to produce spit that's the weirdest marketing ploy of gum I've ever heard just one I'm thinking it's known for its minty flavour because they're all mint taste like nyquil if anything one is worse get back here I think the gum dissolved I think I'm just chewing on my own spit now I don't like this come it's gross you don't ever send that there's gum to me ever again oh there's something different it's not gum it's a banana chew oh here comes all of this there's no way I'm gonna swallow it if this grosses you out and click away it's not good because by the time you swallow it you just swallow them with a handful of spit and this that's gross whoever sent me the gum you're you're very smart you didn't put your name or address okay I got I got a lot of gum left and I have a lot of stamps so you are one lucky person this is just because I'm curious 800k hold it sorry sir it's not you it's me Oh didn't even start out good hmm oh he just walked by the spit puddles Oh bird oh it's Lord so hot I need there's cars coming oh my turn to go already", "q33ZkP8s91w": "[Music] hello television viewers my name is Nick thank you so much for joining me once again on my channel today we are doing a project that is very near and dear to my heart because I love chewing gum so much I could scream I'm kind of an screaming so maybe I should chill out I love gum I don't know what to tell you ever since I was a teenager I go through periods of time where I don't chew as much gum and then I go through periods of time where I'm chewing I'll straight a pack of gum a day I'm gonna be seeing the word gum in this video a lot so just get ready for that gum so what does my love of gum have to do with today's video if it wasn't already obvious today we are going to be making our own bubble gum can you even I have here the scientific Explorer bubble gum factory look at those Illustrated children they're like having a ball learning the science behind gum make fruity sour minty gum hopefully not all of those flavors in the same gum but maybe if you follow my stories on snapchat or Instagram then you saw just a few minutes ago I had three toys that I got in the mail today and I didn't know which ones I was going to play with first so I asked you guys in the story and this was your answer and I'm so excited because this is the one I was hoping you would pick so I have two other toys that I will show you at the end of this video so you can let me know what you'd like to see me play with next but if you want to be right there on the front lines with me I would definitely suggest following me on snapchat and Instagram I update that stuff every day the link to those profiles will be in the description below but today we're making gum if you're into unboxing videos crafts toys things of that nature then give this video a thumbs up so that I know to make more but if you're new to my channel please hit that subscribe button I would love to have you join the crew that helps me put these videos together by letting me know what you want to see next we have a lot of fun but now it's gum time why am i holding two beverages it's a little late to be drinking coffee let's open this guy up let me get my scissors let me get mouses you guys know how much I love using scissors it's just one of the many reasons I am like a toddler I have no idea how involved this kit is going to be blue first thing else a booklet also real quick I'm reading the nutrition information on this box serving sizes per container 44 that means that this can potentially make 44 pieces of gum that's a lot so let's see what's in here that would help us with that woo hoo powder and gum pellet that's the base itself that will either be melted or somehow kneaded into a joke that we make the gum out of flavoring packet watermelon flavor blueberry flavor mint flavor there we have citric acid for those of you who don't know that's like a sugar that's distilled from citrus fruit and it's acidic which is what gives sour candy its sourness the dust on the outside of like sour patch kids that's usually a mixture of citric acid and confectioner sugar which is also included in this kit then we have this packet of corn zero this is getting me excited because it's so fun to squeeze and knead I didn't have to go up and buy a bottle of corn syrup to play with this which I'm very happy about also just to recap that makes it officially three different forms of sugar that have been included in this kit I'm already learning something about the science of gum it's not good for your teeth I'll put the link to this kit in the description below let's not forget it comes with a science manual a booklet that tells us what to do this book that comes with the kit is really involved it gives you highly detailed instructions a brief history of gum rules like keeping it clean the science of chewing and then it gives you a series of gum recipes the basic single flavor recipes and then combinations where you can use different business powder and citric acid or powdered sugar to make things like tangy blueberry tart junkyard gum what does that mean extreme mint frosty blueberry blast so that one is mixing mint and a fruit flavor it seems like all of these recipes are scaled down so that you're just making like one or two pieces of gum per recipe so you can play around with it that's kind of cool this is going to take some time involved kneading the gum mixing the other things melting them so I guess we'll make the three basic flavors but I'll save some gel from each of them so they can make some swirls as well again this book is really detailed so I'm not going to read through all of the instructions I'm just going to kind of view the process and let you know what's going on but I won't be reading this word forward because I will take me until the day that I turn 79 years old which is tomorrow I think it's super cool that this toy came with such a detailed instruction but I think after reading through some of them I get the idea and it seems like a lot of the flavoring and measurements things of that nature are not exact it's a lot of eyeballing it and doing it to taste so it's going to put the gum pellets in the cup and then cover them with water that's so the water will heat up and evenly melt the wax or soften the wax so I'm going to pop this in the microwave for 15 to 20 seconds so after it is 20 seconds you can see the gum base is now soft and melty it's a dessert until it's smooth now I'm supposed to add one teaspoon of corn syrup whoo corn syrup is sticky I'm just sort of mixing the wax and the corn syrup together it says until it's smooth not readily incorporated I guess you could say they kind of want to separate from one another and cool enough to touch now it is really sticky which is why we are now going to add the confectioner sugar again we're not being too exact here basically I'm just rolling that whole blob around trying to pick up as much of the sugar as I can that I can melt it again in short little bursts it starts to get to hard to stir maybe I'll do that i heated it up for like another five seconds and now it's starting to turn into a real gum consistency I'm pretty confident we're getting there for the flavoring which one should we do I guess I'm kind of most pumped about watermelon it's at a 1/2 teaspoon of flavoring god it smells just like four loko which is the alcoholic energy drink or you could have in college it was disgusting don't drink kids it's not worth it now I'm going to mix that in what just got it all over the place now that I've softened it up a little bit again in the microwave I'm incorporating that watermelon flavoring most of the confectioner sugar has been absorbed I'm now supposed to take more confectioner sugar and now I'm using that as sort of like the flour that helps me knead this dough and it says the more you knead it the chewy R it will be so I'm guessing I'm going to need this for probably like 10 minutes and this is also where I'm going to add food coloring so it's going to be red I guess for watermelon what I'm deducing is that the science of gum is at the dough I'm doing this puts a lot of air in the dough and that is why when you first chew gum it's soft you can bite it it's because there's air in it does that sound about right I found my food coloring so let's work some color into this gum what do you serve so I'm just going to use a little bit of red gel food coloring so I'm just gonna fold it in this part is difficult working up a sweat can you tell us who that helps when I roll it like this the heat of my hand kind of softens it so that it's really hold easier I can see why they were big on hand-washing in the manual because this would be a great way for a kid to give its whole family ecoli cool we have our first piece of fully formed gum dough in a classic bubblegum pink this is so exciting got to roll it in the sugar to make sure it's not sticky it said at this point to taste a piece of the gum so that you know that you should have more flavor or not first of all cool is it definitely gum second of all it needs more flavor some more four loko watermelon we've got a real log going I'm going to taste it see where we're at it's not quite as flavorful or sweet as with store-bought gum but I think that's sort of like a good thing because there's still a lot of sugar and so just goes to show you commercial gun must be loaded with sugar so the kind of final step here is to roll it out into sugar and then cut your pieces and wrap those up or set the dough size so that we can mix it with other flavors once we get those going while we're at this stage I'm going to cut off a couple pieces of just clean watermelon and I'm just going to use my scissors for that because why not okay so there are our first two pieces of watermelon gum we'll set those aside to cool and then as for this dough I'm going to leave this so that I can use it to make hybrid flavors in a little bit same exact process was the blueberry gum which I'm doing next I was more generous with the flavoring and I added it before all the corn syrup was absorbed because I think that's going to make it easier to work with and now immediately after adding powdered sugar I'm rolling it out so now I'm adding a healthy amount of blue food coloring I'm also going to now add citric acid to make this sour blueberry so it said to use about half a teaspoon let's go for it blue fingers call me blue fingers hey what do you know I got blue fingers now call me blue fingers blue finger the wildest gunslinger in the West he's making gum with his little fingers blue fingers getting strong blueberry vibes from this gum right now major blueberry aroma happening this might be the most involved project I've ever done with you guys what do you think I'm so glad I have this food coloring because look what a sweet blue color that is let's give it a taste to see we need to add any more sugar or citric acid look definitely get the sour tang in there I love them so now I'm going to roll it out into a log so now I'm just snipping off a few pieces of blue I'm going to roll these guys and a mixture of citric acid and sugar so that they have a sour coating alright guys so we have our watermelon and sour blueberry pieces of gum and then we have the rods of dough I want to braid these two flavors together to make a swirl of watermelon and sour blueberries it sort of wants to come apart so I'm going to let it dry for a little bit like this and that way I can cut it once it's kind of parting together hopefully now let's jump into the final flavor mint that one I think could be left white because the only other food colorings I have are Oh green would work for mint right I'll use like a tiny bit of green so that it's just a slightly pastel green color this one feels grittier than the others maybe because I used so much of the flavoring that it actually was too much maybe there's no way to make this a consistent product because I'm not measuring a single thing oh my god did you see that this gum flung and then caught my computer and dragged it towards me like total spider-man couldn't recreate that if I try to if I had a group of kids that I was doing this project with it would be one thing because I could just like get all their little hands into it and everybody's grubby little fingernails would be digging into it it would be awesome but it's just me I don't have the slave labor of children what do you think of the mint green colors oh let's cut some pieces of mint and now let's cut some of our swirl pieces with the watermelon and blueberry woohoo cool these ones are so cute it's like a little pillow now that these other rods have firmed up they're a little bit easier to cut too so we get those uniform sort of pillowy shapes now I believe life is no fun unless things get a little weird so for the grand finale we're going to wrap the watermelon sour blueberry and mint into one love triangle of weird tape so same process I'm just twisting them together and I think it's going to look really pretty after double braiding the tri-colored gum I'm just sort of rolling it in my hand to make sort of like a marbled ball of gum just to give some variety to the shapes and color schemes that we're doing here gum making is serious business you guys hats off to those brave souls in the gum industry because Jesus I'm going to set these all in the fridge so that they really firm up that way we can take a good look at them and play with them and then taste them all oh my god oh right you guys we dumb can you believe it look at our bounty such massive quantities of gum like I've never seen before visually I really really like these braided pieces isn't that just the cutest the one with all three colors are kind of cool too little funky tie-dye action going on there I think the marbling is kind of fun and then as for these solid color guys once I let the dough firm up a little bit and then cut them when they were a little more firm they at least maybe kind of like artisan Chiclets shapes you know now let's try each of the flavors so first up will be the red watermelon it still has that Four Loko taste so a very artificial watermelon flavor things are going to get a little tart now with my sour blueberry here we go ooh something happened there's a lot of towers that drug acid in there very sour I have no idea what these MIT ones are going to taste like because I just threw in random amounts of powder and sugar still not super minty not minty like you would expect dente nice to be or any store-bought mint gum it kind of been more like the mint gum you would get at Starbucks where it's like really natural now let's try my favorite visual flavor which is the sour blueberry and watermelon here we go mmm mmm that one worked for me the unsub autre melon balances the extremely hyper sour blueberry and they combine to make a surprisingly delightful flavor combination but now what about the big boss we got all three colors ready the big piece of gum first of all the watermelon and the blueberry really kind of overpower the mint that's mixed in there because again the mint is very mild compared to what you would be used to form of income look what it kind of melds into when I chewed it I know it's gross to show you my tube gum but makes an interesting color so all three flavors kind of mixed together not in a bad way doesn't make sort of a tutti fruity handy tasting mess if I were to taste this and not know what any of the three individual flavors work I would not be able to tell you what was going on in my mouth and I guess I did an acceptable amount of kneading the dough for all of these because they really have the texture and consistency of store-bought gum it doesn't taste more chewy or less chewy certainly doesn't taste waxy like the gum base alone did all in all I feel like I'm really proud of ourselves we pulled this off that was easily the most involved messy to eat extravaganza we have ever done on my channel yes that was so professional and legit

"baseball at any level from t-ball and Little League to high school in college you can get a genuine taste of what it's like in the major leagues just buy a pouch of big league chew we are going to take you to the factory here in New York where it's made and show you how they do it David Beck know is in New York City's Harlem neighborhood with more on that David good morning Anita good morning it has been 35 years since the brand big league chew stepped up to the plate and in the time since it has become the Bubblegum of almost every person's childhood you can't talk about baseball without chewing on a conversation about bubblegum from Little League to the major league take some skills to do that now folks giant wads to hatrocks even a bubble at bat there is a real challenge in chewing and blowing great bubbles I mean who goes to work and gets the chew copious amounts of gum during the day I mean except for ballplayers Rob Nelson invented one of the most recognized bubblegum brands in America big league chew from the littlest leagues up to the big leagues everybody becomes a kid when they start to and Bigley to the story of how it started is on the back of every pouch sitting in a bullpen on a summer night long ago Portland Mavericks left-hander Rob Nelson came up with a fun new bubblegum idea shredded gum in a pouch Nelson bought a cheap gum kit and made his first batch I just followed the instructions it was like making brownies we had a sheet of it and we baked it and then it came out we use a round pizza knife to make them into shreds Nelson's minor-league team mate Jim Belton a former all-star for the Yankees funded the project they pitched the gum to Amer all a subsidiary of Wrigley who sold the first pouch in 1980 almost instantly it was a homerun bringing in 18 million dollars the first year late flavor and big league bubbles its big leg June Wrigley sold big league chew in 2010 to an American gum company shifting the operation from Mexico to upstate New York if you go to Akron New York it looks like they could have filmed It's a Wonderful Life there the sweet scent of gum ladder the neighborhood around Ford gum and machine company which started in 1913 you've probably paid a quarter for one of their gumballs now big league chew is their best known brand and biggest sell here comes George steggy is the CEO you have a thousand pounds of gum here and unfortunately we can't sell a thousand pound blob of gum so we have to put it into a form that people are going to buy it takes two days for a batch of big league chew to go for mixing to packaging big league chew is your most difficult gum to make yes why it's difficult to make because you have to get the consistency absolutely right otherwise it won't shred and shredding is the signature it's raitis Redinger issues Brande yep this is called a sheeter and what will happen is it will start pulling the gum and as it pulls the gum it makes the sheets thinner and thinner and thinner and big-league shoe we think is the best gum in terms of blowing a bubble and that deals with the components of the gum base that comprise big league shoe believe it or not things do get a little gummed up in a gum factory so a light dusting of cornstarch is used as a lubricant and then from here it cures and then we will feed the sheets into a shredder to actually shred the government every day about 100,000 pouches of big league chew is packaged here and they are proud to tell you it's made in America now this is fresh made today hot off the press can we are off the press absolutely hi oh we decided to try that again bubble blower I'm a bubble blower it will take however a while because actually the blow a good bubble you have to dissolve all the sugar first now that's going to take some time so we'll get right back to it what's the demographic for big-league - what's the audience it has growing so that people ages 9 to 20 and now many adults we find are coming back in because it reminds them of their childhood and I'd like to share it with their children we're doing the hundred big lead to challenge from families looking to have fun to teammates wanting to look cool let's give it a go big league chew is in a league of its own and there's no chance of bursting that bubble congratulations I'll give you an A for effort he was a good sport about that some fun facts for you per capita the state that buys more Bigley chew than any other is Utah glad that ball didn't hit me also if you're ever in a bubble blowing contest with big lead shoot the CEO says you want the original flavor because original those are bigger bubble than any other flavor Anthony have you gotten your customized big league chew pack I finally made the big leagues David thank you very

later friends [Music]", "dC6ItHJdijo": "good Oh which one would you like me to try today really they're very strong I like that on a task or get work done it's relaxing I tried", "Qrh6vqfY7Bk": "[Music] hey guys and welcome back to another foodie Friday review even though this one's technically not food per se its gum but I mean it's tough my goodness this is actually what led to the juicy fruit one a while back with I was trying to get this but they were sold out and like every flavor so I settled for that because it was like in a similar shape so I thought I'd be about the same deal this is what I actually wanted got this flavor I later ended up getting the flavor I wanted but this was a happy accident so this is the ice breakers ice cubes in Kiwi watermelon now I had a minty when ma was out at my sister's in Arizona and it was the first time in many years I'd had gum and realized hey this doesn't stick to my dental work I can chew this oh my god because I was expecting me all the chew it for a couple minutes and have it having issues with my crowns and have to spit it out no this stuff's wonderful it doesn't stick to it is great so anyways I don't believe in this stuff just saying if you're in a similar boat where you thought gum is off limits not this kind any of the ice breakers ice cubes you can handle so anyways this is like I said the Kyuubi watermelon you get 40 pieces of gum and it's sugar-free so if you have pets keep this somewhere where they cannot possibly get into it because I believe this contains yeah the first ingredient is xylitol which is highly highly toxic to cats and dogs keep it out of their reach don't have it anywhere they could get into it where a child could get into it and leave it somewhere a pet could get to it don't spit it out somewhere where a pet could get to it unless you want to potentially kill your pet so and there is your warning heat it anyways so this is a DEA accepted there we go I didn't even see that when I bought it but that's American Dental Association which helps prevent cavities when chewed for 20 minutes after eating which isn't right I bought it I bought it because it doesn't stick to my frickin crowns but um anyways enlarged to show detail they are not as big as they make it look like they're freaking sugar cubes but anyhoo 30% fewer calories since sugared gum calorie content for this sized piece has been reduced from 75 calories now for them they're serving sizes one piece when you mean you start out with like two and work your way up to maybe four or five at a time good side is how you do I was a little if you and I realized it wasn't playing watermelon and with cubed watermelon because most of my way through elementary in high school I had the kiwi strawberry Capri Suns every  day in my lunch to where to this day it makes me gag and want to just instantly spit it out and many things with Kiwi in it still have that reaction for me there are some exceptions but this thankfully I don't have that reaction with because otherwise this could have been disastrous not moving like I cannae want some gum I'm not eating it but anyway so yeah lift a little lid oh well there's two anyway it's kind of Christmas colors cuz of the Kiwi watermelon it's got these little flecks of green and red in there like I said I generally start with two and work my way up so that's what we're gonna do and naturally they feel kind of tough that's okay it says very quickly they will be soft apparently you could open it from the other side as well this time it's for if you want one piece this side which I didn't even notice till just now opens you can open the entire goddamn lid if you want to I don't want to do that like the little hole on it so I'm sorry soft shop ok flavor-wise want me first off nice soft gum consistency reminds me of bubblicious for those you who are old enough remember I don't even know if they still sell that anymore but um Bubble Yum it also reminds me of that big time and unlike juicy fruit you can blow bubbles with this I don't know if you're really meant to what you can probably pull my hair back I'm gonna do that though like I was saying flavor-wise it's mostly watermelon which makes me a very very very happy girl generally most of my life my favorite Bubblegum's ever have always been watermelon ones I believe it was bubblicious that had that watermelon one that it tasted like a Jolly Rancher they sold the bagmen I needs but oh my god there was only about like six pieces in a stick of it so didn't last very long but oh god I loved it so freaking hard but um this reminds me very much of that flavor with just like the tiniest tiniest tiniest like aftertaste of Kiwi so that's like an acceptable level of Kiwi to me is ironic my first cat's name was Kiwi and yet most Kiwi things I'm like ill maybe I'm like for my fallen Kitty brother I cannot betray you by eating the Kiwi things I just I cannot do it I cannot do anyway alright one more I feel like I should talk more about before I started doing that anyway I know I know but uh given the juicy-fruit wonder how my abused it gotten very quickly and how many requests to do more of these are my clothes you know I could do that I should probably go see who messaged me real quick and we will come back and review so hold on I'm sorry about that so anyway I paid about three something for these it's a flame which means you can probably find them for a little less than that elsewhere so I generally overpay at Safeway and I know it but it's where my dad wants to shop for groceries so it's where I get most my stuff from but I don't drive them anyway I think I paid about 350 I want to say you know 350 or 399 I know it wasn't more than that so I wouldn't have bothered one thing that does annoy me with it at least for this flavor I can't speak for the other ones because I haven't really analyzed them that closely yet for a review purposes those little colored flavor crystals in them some of them just stay hard and granulated those kind of take me up I found myself instinctively wanting you spit down but that was like wait wait don't just spit them over ever cuz um no you have a dog that could be the xylitol so um dumbass don't do that so other than that I really like the texture these containers can be repurposed which I'm a fan of I'm surprised this house the best by date on it that's as close as it is actually it's like now best by March of 2020 I mean BAM I'll pop this back in October but quiet oh god I have it right across oh there's stuff that needs to be reviewed - but I have this I have at least two other flavors of icebreakers come to review I think I have at least one of the Mentos when I find out if it's dental work friendly or not I may go back and get more but until I know that we'll probably just stay a one-off I have one that I think is identity nice or something maybe it's not dentine ice but um I did open it up and test it that one was not so dental work friendly it's why it hasn't gotten reviewed yep cuz I'm scared of popping out crown off with it so that one it sucks cuz it's really good but I can't risk that hmm and a couple of the flavor collisions of more juicy fruit because that video went over so freaking love like well caching of it I guess not up so that's why I got in terms of gum to review for you guys but um how much is there really to study about it I don't know I mean I really like this one and the flavor the flavor sticks around I'm really long time boom with just like one or two pieces hours later there's still flavor there this is probably the only watermelon gum I can honestly say that tried that that's screw up so that I like I'm gonna pull my hair back so I can show you some bubbles with it we all know that's what happy you were here for I know that's okay just don't tell me why you want to see him uh I'd rather not know I already know but anyway I can tell where the first two pieces stop from the newer two pieces start because it still has little crystals in the newer half anyway I feel like I may want to take these off to hold um just in case they're really big bubbles I don't want it to pop on them mm I don't know if this gum feels primed enough yet for bubble blowing but I can try it I take it back it's definitely not ready I'm like it's still too thick I gotta chew it longer first so I'll turn this off I'll put it back on when it feels ready and malleable enough to block so right now I'm like hmm not ready Hashmi chewed more well it's been chewed more I can get good doubles out of this one so hold on okay so I found in trying to prime it and get it ready for bubbles then well I can do them I can't consistently do big ones so there is some fail ones there's some good ones there's a no real rhyme or reason to when or how they happen so I will film and hopefully we'll get some good ones and I won't make an idiot of myself like I did on the last attempt to film this segment cuz I already tried to do this once and just deleted it cuz it just kept being tiny little stupid doubles so of course the second I turned it off oh the next time I blew big one of course cuz nobody got to see it so let's see if I can replicate that now that this is a running man hang with me this may turn out to be pointless and stupid but if it makes it into the video odds are there's probably at least one good one other ones I wouldn't have bothered adding it I probably would have just deleted it although if I try again a few more tries and keep deleting it I may end up leaving one of these and I don't know so nope not that one it sealed itself off too fast I think the problem is that I have four when I do it with two it's thinner and I can get better bubbles out of it so if you want to try and do bubbles with this gum stick to one or two pieces if you just want to chew it and keep a lot of flavor trying to get it ready mmm-hmm damn like I said I keep getting stupid little ones if I made it too thick slightly better but still kind of sucky this keeps up I will amend my former statement say it's not the best bubble blowing up I mean you can get some out of it I just won't be great unless you stick with a lesser number of pieces nope all I did was blow her house burns that time that was stupid but funny I just had to hook a couple pieces didn't I it just keeps going to either seal itself off or a little tiny hole appears at the top and between my lip and the bubble and it can't go anywhere that's what keeps happening here he's embarrassing I swear I had decent ones a lot I wasn't trying to maybe that should be the key I'll stop trying to I'll just track myself in my computer over here we'll see if something happened maybe they will maybe they won't hopefully you guys aren't too bored in the meantime if you're not here to watch me blow bubbles feel free to bounce cuz that's all it's gonna be from this point on all right is the key to it okay okay nope I'm honestly getting kind of pissed off of this I kind of want to spit this one out and just start over with two pieces to show what I've been able to do before word two so maybe I'll do that hold on I can't believe I'm admitting defeat on this I swear when the cameras not going I can do the thing but with this one every time I try to record and do it without fail I just get the stupid little ones are you been swapped to just two pieces much smaller still not have much more luck right now don't know why that is but I didn't show you these wimpy little bubbles I'm getting well no exact term but not great you saw how thin it was for how that turned out today apparently I didn't need to take my glasses off after all hmmm how strange the homos are those girls I say my mouth nothing it's so strange for the sake of science should we try the middle ground and go for three not out of four even though I've literally wasted seven pieces of this on this video I'm not holding my breath this is so dumb I'm gonna read it down just for doing this to me on camera really though it just wants to make a liar out of me that sucks at least you got us out it's fine pop anyway I don't think it's gonna happen guys this is really lame I am so sorry for wasting your time you can watch my embarrassment growth [Music] but maybe I can force it but no alas I'm trying to get at least one more semi-decent one before I call it quits [Laughter] fail an amazing fail but fail so I really tried hard to make that one work but it just wasn't happening all right we got one diesel them we got one decent one I can call it a day what straight conscience now clear conscience Franco whatever oh my god what even what even guys I'll take the hair down to but anyway I think I rate this stuff maybe like a 4 out of 5 if it didn't give me such trouble with the bubbles I want to give it a sign because it embarrass me on camera so badly I'm giving it a 4 so anyways what does taste really good this is really soft doesn't screw with dental work it's very affordable get quite a bit in there nice we used a container pretty decent fist if I could even prove one thing will be the bubbles it's the ease in blowing them so anyway sure try it one more time best try one more time rather than go out on top no let's try it one more time that one no no I'm convinced I have to stop on one it's a good one like that last one plus so that means we're just gonna try that much longer [Music] Oh keep going north right uh mediocre I'll count it well count it was big enough okay on it wasn't great but at least like a bubble that wasn't like the size of a marshmallow so let me play yeah four out of five for me on this I still buy it again to this tasty that is it from me for this one so as usual

welcome back to my channel hope you're having a great day today as always in this video i'm going to be doing a gum chewing ramble so uh got my gum right here and i guess i'll put them in right now this is strong remember the first time i uh tried this gum i was like i mean my eyes tear up because i'm into yeah let's really be talking about anything that comes to the mind i'm so shy that we had a thousand subs that's crazy i can't believe that as you might notice they got the pink lights up on the background instead of the usual blue i just want to change it up a little bit like you know my channels are basically about music um i've been getting some different artists lately like as you might know like i really liked either creator of course i mean who doesn't but i've been trying to like find artists like him they're just really unique and stuff like that and like him and steve lacy probably my because like aspirations kind of like i would love to just like make music like them that would be crazy i just next year i signed up for like a music production class and uh i'm gonna try to piano so uh i hope to learn more about the chords and uh chord progression and like how to make songs more so i could start making some bangers those guys i'm just trying to find some more artists like them and it's hard because like they're so unique but if you guys don't have any suggestions of people like that that kind of genre of music i would be uh very interested as you know i got i got uh positive so i've been in my room for like the past five days straight i don't know why of course i gotta leave to like a shower but i'm supposed to be in quarantine away from like everyone even my pets like my cab i haven't been able to like cuddle with him in so long like i don't know how i'm surviving right now honestly he's my baby oh i miss him i really just been playing like a whole bunch of xbox uh playing my guitar learning new stuff i was on minecraft for like five hours straight probably um because we got out of school early like we're online right now um but for some reason every wednesday um like we were in person a couple weeks ago like every wednesday we were good at it like one o'clock to uh i don't know why but we just got an early dismissal day in the middle of the week i think for teachers to like clean up stuff like that but we're online now and we're still having those days so today like we got out of school early another one to do so i just played some xbox and then put some minecraft of course i went on like a two-hour long mine expedition and got back and on my way back i fell into some lava lost everything even like 30 levels which is going to be like the worst feeling after like you've spent like some long on uh collecting resources in minecraft or something like that and it just you just fall in some lava and it's all over luckily i didn't bring everything with me i just brought like uh i just got like nine diamonds which wasn't too bad but like i had like 10 emeralds for some reason i was like mining under a cave pile or not gay pile uh mountain but that kind of sucked it was fun just talking with them messing around it's always fun with my my minecraft gang it's funny because like last year just at this time we were doing the same exact thing because we got out of school last time like we didn't know but we wouldn't be in school again but we decided to make a new uh minecraft world and play him and then make another world when the another update came out and uh we did that and now we made the world to play on it and we're gonna make another world when the cave update comes out so it's funny how that works we're all basically quarantined right now it's bad at my school is terrible i just hope everyone has uh recovers from it and that's safe i hope nothing bad happens anyone i'm lucky because i'm uh i'm quarantined right now and uh our school is online until the 31st and on the reverse we got out for easter break so i've had like a long break and then i'll have another one an extra one too and all night it's so easy because i don't have any sports right now like i should be doing track and basketball but okay right now so i have a lot of free time and so before i couldn't really get it like it was just hard to fit i don't work in my schedule so i was like up until like 11 o'clock every night doing it but now i'm up to 11 either on my guitar playing minecraft just because i can get my homework done fast at home and they usually go easy on us when we're online so it's like a little it's kind of a nice little break for me because i feel like i was definitely like overworking myself before we got out because like i'm doing au basketball and track so i would like go to school and then go ready to track practice after school come home eat dinner and go to basketball until like 8 30 nine ish then i would go and try to do homework rush and then fall asleep probably like one o'clock and then school the next day probably try to catch up on homework i didn't get and then just repeat like every day no days off because sundays we had basketball practice like saturdays are my day only true days off it was pretty great which is pretty crazy because now i literally have like every day off it's nice i've just been watching like a lot of lots of creator interviews really well i just won um the one on apple music and the one with the current frost there was some great interviews like he said he's a cool dude like i'm surprised that he's not more popular than he already is because like he's a celebrity that didn't let the fame go to his head or really change for people he never changed for people and his values are just i think they're so good i just like relate to them a lot and like he doesn't need like anything to be happy he's completely like drug-free and just like he doesn't bash it he just it's not for him i just think like he's a joke he's such a unique and like odd guy and and i can relate to his message a lot saying do you want like uh don't care people think and like i think like as you know if you watch my other videos like you know that i am really strong on that i want to practice it more myself like i was like a big step for me to create this channel even because like a teenage dude in high school make an asmr channel you can't imagine like what people would say but definitely if you ask me like two years ago i definitely would not be doing this it's it's working out great right now i mean i didn't expect to be welcomed with such like strong enthusiasm and like love really it's crazy how much you guys like just took me and i'm really so appreciative of that because i feel like if i wasn't so like welcome and i really wouldn't feel motivated to keep doing them so thank you guys so much again like i know i say the lava i want you to know that i truly mean it you know i'm not gonna say something i don't mean i say that a lot but yeah let me know if it's annoying i don't i'll try to stop it it's like really noticeable but yeah this gum still has flavor somehow eclipse or i want to see something oh my god i want to frame this can you imagine this just being in the background maybe they're in a frame it's a bomb picture looks pretty cool too side is just i want to get a lot more posters like that for my room like music posters split them up i would love to get something like concert posters dwight i couldn't go to a concert oh my god i just i really want to go to one of his concerts i feel like that would be incredible i would be able to sing every song i would jam out you would probably bring on some like amazing guests that like all the whole experience would just be so perfect i hope he releases an album this year he's supposed to he usually releases one like every two years i nearly see or two years ago it'll be pretty great if you release one this ramble has really just become like a tyler crater ramble i keep trying to blow bubbles but i'm like i probably won't make the best sound sounds very good making this video properly play some more minecraft that's probably the best game ever lastly like an even better game like nothing comes to mind right now i better get the minecraft um as always i hope you have a very nice night", "3TBsNLa57Fg": "take some toys that some boys its boys

Gum base so this is citric acid this is bubble gum instructions this is the blueberry flavor this is the mint flavor and this is the watermelon flavor I want the watermelon what's that? What is that? Is this honey? Maybe and this is probably sugar or something Mommy, what is this? So what do we need first? Read it Lara that is corn syrup Mommy this is corn syrup and this is sugar so what you need to get is a microwave oven, disposable microwaveable cups an oven mitt, measuring spoons rolling pin, scissors, paper markers, tape or elmers glue.. so we opened up the packages citric acid the gum base and the sugar that's the gum base my watermelon is going to be purple that smells good oh, this is actually turning into gum! that is cool! tastes awesomely good but I think it needs a little more of the watermelon flavor tastes like watermelon you don't want to try?

wouldn't miss we do it three it [Music] please [Music] [Music]", "QqyMFxJz8EQ": "good afternoon everybody Michael soothing just wanted to do quick video talking about today's favor you know I am I just like to look at skim through the articles and things see what's going on well we have two people here that I don't recognize either one of them so I won't talk about them since I I don't really know anything about them or maybe it's that I want to block it anyway um what else state looks at up to 75% of Sacramento River flow less for farms and seas you know a lot of salmon and things come up the Sacramento River sturgeon I want to fish that River so I'm kind of on the fishes side on this deal a little bit but we do have to have water for the do you know this state has not felt any major reservoir or dam in like 50 years or so and this is what and meanwhile population of course has gone up by 8 trillion percent or so you know while I'm doing this video since I still have that dry throat problem problem the vocal practice I was doing for songs I'm gonna chew on a little piece of this Bubba and see if it works any better than the that gum I did the other day up and Morrigan a couple weeks ago that I had a fail you know I think first of all I probably should chew more than just one little piece but this is watermelon and strawberry in combination see they're watermelon and strawberry I certainly like the colors nice flavor burst not very much sugar a lot better than eating a candy bar something like that settlement on sewer overtime you didn't know that sewers worked overtime did you but they do because as much as people are eating these tacks you know the sewers are overtaxed let's scratch that comment and pretend you never okay something about the debate the big long analysis which I'm not interested in reading what else really out here Sacramento County must pay 800,000 Sutter Health Hospital that Sutter Health Hospital being demolished right there demolition a Sutter Memorial Hospital on F Street in East Sacramento continued on Wednesday more than 300,000 babies were born at the vulnerable baby Hospital between 1937 and 2016 you know what I hope that they took all the babies out first before they demolish because sometimes if I saw an article yesterday a hospital back east field two patients into two different operating rooms and took out a kidney from the wrong patient for a transplant now that's scary like something out of who's that a medical or book writer can't remember his name but you know he wrote coma and all of those novels anyway it turned out those two patients have the same name you know like they were both named John Smith or something that's how the mistake okay what else do we have in Garth Brooks joins Amazon's streaming service to start I mean I don't want to say anything but isn't about 90 years old of course Hank Williams was still singing country-western songs when he was about a hundred and forty so maybe it's okay oh look Super Lotto and Powerball none of my numbers not even one Amy Schumer issues a sarcastic apology whoever she is now here's my objection on this water thing why I can't feel bad for all the farmers see this guy this is a continuation but the article about the Sacramento River here is a rice farmer okay now if you know anything about rice farming you know that you have to flood the fields constantly with water to grow rice rice farmer dawn Bransford looks over a field in Williams in May 2015 he said the proposed cutback in water supply in order to help fish would be disastrous but my question is why are we growing rice a tropical water intensive monsoon crop in the middle of a desert because that's really what California is it's a desert we get rain from November until March ok and the other seven months it's dry a desert we shouldn't be growing rice out there be growing something else but anything that is my ill-informed take on that so North Sacramento shooting quite a few shootings and things here in Sacramento County looks like I'm back to half whispered a voice in this video just like the other one wanted woman handcuffs herself before police arrived it saves time in trouble if you're a felon if you could handcuff yourself first you know also it would save the cops from having to say their favorite phrase get on the ground is there any cop alive that doesn't love to say get on the ground that is the forward phrase every cop loves the most okay also what is it about now I'm a big supporter of the police overall but what is it about their vocabulary they can never say truck or car they always have to say vehicle she exited the vehicle right but anyway let's see what this story's about it looks interesting a woman who called Sacramento police for help did officers a favor by app like handcuffs before they arrived Cana l3r 29 called police dispatchers Wednesday morning looking for help getting out of some old handcuffs maybe she was playing a game with her boyfriend and he took off that would be quite a you know trick on her wouldn't it if it turned out that you know anyway do you ever think to yourself I wouldn't want to do anything kinky with my partner and handcuffs um because or the other way around because what if your partner died of a heart attack right I guess this would apply more to women being scared oh if they're with an older guy like me and no I'm not gonna go there as far as my life but anyway say that say she's tough to the bedpost right and we're really talking about this what is wrong with me today anyway um she's handcuffed to the bed post and you know see your wife right and you die of a heart attack right and she can't get to a phone huh it would be not so good if she was stranded there for days and died of you know thirst or starvation or something just something to consider some of the dangers of the games people play I bet if we looked this up on the Internet we would find a case like that someplace but I don't want to do that research can someone else do it for me please anyway when officers arrived they found she was wanted on outstanding felony warrant so after they removed the old keyless cos they slapped new ones on her and took her to jail without having to say get on the ground first okay that part wasn't in there all right the eventful night for a career began when she was visiting a friend who was formerly a security guard aha here it comes according to police while goofing around with the friends handcuffs from his security guard days I wonder what kind of goofing around that one she accidentally handcuffed herself then we're discovered there was no key that prompted the call for help to the Sacramento Police Department when officers arrived they ran a record check on Greer and discovered she had a warrant for arrest on burglary charges out of the bail Dorado County officers thanked the woman for cuffing herself for them according to a post on Twitter she was taken to a nearby fire station where they helped to remove the old cuffs she was then taken to Sacramento County Jail in handcuffs new ones I take it belonging to the Sacramento Police Officer booked into jail oh I bet she now wishes she had found a friend with right although I doubt it will be very easy to cut through another fail a cool break from the South State swampland Oh it's been nice up here since last few days down south they're having a heat wave where they were so these folks are going into the ocean downright la oh no this is my bold County Santa Cruz they're waiting in the surf at Natural Bridges State I used to go there nice play let's see what else is going on sports the Giants lost in their series with the Cubs so your Chicago fails can be happy it looks like the Cleveland Indians are going to the World Series and I think maybe the Cubs also anything else one of my favorite NASCAR races is coming up Sunday Talladega it's the longest track the highest speeds one of the most difficult I'm so thrilled the bearded one grows into an article David what does it say wow look at this beard his other picture this is where he went to a race in Sonoma let me show you I haven't seen this photo before it's a little bit shocking yeah he looks like he could be in ZZ Top band or something big long article what is clear I'm just going to read a random paragraph he does not want and does not miss the platform provided by nightly talk show where he and Paul Schaffer his bandleader and psychic athlete show could riff on current events something about it it just left us he said the amazing world of gumball this is a long article I'll have to read it later there was a scandal 11 groping all kinds of limited questing right then left perhaps he should run for president okay I didn't really say that all those things you think I keep saying don't write me any political stuff okay you don't know where I stand Great Satan lottery I didn't know there was such a thing still timpz Iranians let's see what this is about oh that's back wa door here it is great season lottery in Tehran the ritual is becoming as familiar as the death to America chance at Friday prayers you don't is it just me or is my normal prayer life of lacking because I'm not wishing death on anyone when I'm talking with God it's just not a normal part of my prayer life but I guess in Iran it is in Tehran the ritual is becoming as the mayor it's the yearly rush to enter a lottery for the chance to immigrate to the United States I want to experience a new life in the u.s. why not send me LAN Nazari a spiky hair 29 year old okay death to America I don't care the u.s. is the most powerful country so why shouldn't I take my chance in the lottery this really says the State Department opened a five-week window for visa applications from countries that historically have low rates of immigration to the US the annual diversity Visa Lottery selects 50,000 winners who along with their spouses and children can obtain green cards and become permanent residents the US would prefer that these immigrants hate the United States and want to kill everyone there so they okay that part wasn't in there but this is the part I find disturbing because that's what it's leading to or a country of immigrants and what that meant in the past was you had compared seeking a better life to be a productive citizen in embrace America and the Constitution and live you know harmonious productive life but in the last few years that concept has morphed into something entirely different that's all I'm gonna say on that topic no I'm not so I don't want to hear it don't use me a theme or racist I will come to your home and read the entire script from an insurance salesman is brochure okay until you go insane all right experts debate how to track the safety of driverless cars that doesn't look like a Tesla to me because it's a Google car some driverless Tesla's have accidents but you know it's all very publicized and the fact is that their accident rate is still a lot lower than live drivers but speaking for myself type-a anal-retentive control freak I don't want the car making my driving decisions I want to drive myself I was born and grew up in Southern California the car culture capital and center of the universe and I don't want to get into a vehicle that's cops begging for car and have no control over what it's doing you know I enjoy driving maybe that's strange unless it's they're not you know commute traffic in which case you know I would rather be stateless bike to the ground over an anthill with honey poured on myself what's the gist of this article president okay I'm not going to read Boober says self-driving cars can help save millions of lives actually there is a flip side to this on that topic because I would like to put at least 90% of the other drivers in the road in these self-driving cars so that they're not doing terrible traffic mistakes every five seconds like drifting into my lane um and forcing me off the road when they're going yakety yak yak yak of their cell phone or playing you know pokeball you know playing poke team and go oh look there's one on the corner let's flip balls out instead of watching the road and so let's see what else the weather was kind of boring isn't it something about the lottery immigrants who came here and say we want a lot more benefits than free education okay someone named Syed Mohamed he wants a life in the US well there's not much more interest they're kind of out of it today here's an article on WikiLeaks this guy named a song you know living in the Ecuadorian embassy what's this science calm monkeys fuel new look at early human technology it does not pay to underestimate a monkey with a rock scientists studying the stone smashing habits of bearded capuchin monkeys in Brazil have found that the primates inadvertently produce stone flakes that look similar to the flakes used as cutting tools by early humans the findings published in the journal nature could snarl the links that paleo anthropologists made between early Stone Age artifacts and the emergence of primitive human technology in other words they thought that there were all these stone - implements around from early human hominid homo sapien sapien species but really they were made by capuchin monkeys okay who by the way show a higher intellectual development than about 60% of humanity what else trove of stolen data here's all the people that passed away again Raymond Tripp and they show him holding up beer bottle hmm do you think there's any job to whoever wrote this obituary I find that a little odd don't you see these other folks are really cold 85 95 whatever here we have a younger guy you know holding a beer bottle somebody's got an ironic sense of humor let's see what it says yeah he was only 57 preceded by his doesn't say what happened to him not a peep not a word of compliment or eat that's kind of sad don't you think I don't think there's anything too interesting today but this insert in the paper might be interesting that's the Sacramento Auto Show maybe I should check that out hottest new models and blah blah see I bought a new car not long ago not in the market thing and so he's calling me and there's Linda okay I'm gonna go bye bye

They\u2019re cute and they smell of bubblegum. My name is Anna Bullus, I\u2019m the managing\ndirector and founder at Gumdrop Limited. There are two sides to what we do. So that\u2019s collecting waste gum from the\npublic using our Gumdrop bins. So that goes through a clever sorting process\nwhere we\u2019re actually able to separate off the other litters from the gum in the Gumdrop\nbin and we can make all sorts of other products, like americano mugs, or pencils, rulers, shoes. So there\u2019s that sort of extra incentive\nto think, \u201cright, actually, if I dispose of my chewing gum properly, then, actually,\nit can go towards making all of these other applications where we don't have to use virgin\nmaterials.\u201d However, we also work with chewing gum manufacturers. They have a huge amount of waste, so we also\ntake their waste and we convert that into all sorts of different compounds for various\ndifferent applications and I think it\u2019s that side where we\u2019ve really got the opportunity\nto start making really quite a huge difference in terms of the type of materials that we\u2019re\nusing and being able to offer to manufacturers So we chose pink because it was the first\ncolor of bubblegum. \ud83c\udfb5Music\ud83c\udfb5 Chewing gum, actually, is a synthetic rubber,\nit\u2019s made from polyisobutylene. It\u2019s really that part that we\u2019re able\nto harness and able to recycle. But one thing about it is that it doesn\u2019t\nbiodegrade and it just lands on our streets and it stays there, so you see all of the\nsplodges on the floor and that is gum litter that has probably been there for years and\nyears and years and will carry on being there for years and years and years. To buy a piece of chewing gum, it\ncosts around 3 pence and to actually remove a piece of chewing gum, it costs up to \u00a31.50,\nso it\u2019s a huge difference in cost and it\u2019s costing councils, business huge amounts of\nmoney that could be better spent elsewhere. And I think that\u2019s, with the Gumdrop bins,\nthat\u2019s what we hope to do is to actually channel that money somewhere else and reduce\nthose bills. I notice it everywhere I go. I might be somewhere really beautiful and\nyet I\u2019m looking down, I\u2019m thinking, \u201cI can still gum litter, it\u2019s everywhere.\u201d So, I think about it a lot - I don\u2019t know if you noticed, but I\u2019m\nobviously chewing gum. I did notice, yeah. \u2013 So what is your advice for me, what should\nI do with my gum? I will give you a Gumdrop On-the-go which\nyou can takeaway with you, so you\u2019ve got your personal Gumdrop in your pocket so you\nnever have to drop it on the floor, I\u2019m not saying that you do, or in a bin, which\nmay end up in landfill. And then obviously once it\u2019s full you can\nfreepost it back to us and we can recycle it and make more Gumdrops On-the-go. \ud83c\udfb5Music\ud83c\udfb5", "_fwSrPEmnwE": "hey everybody Ricki vapor are y'all doing let me adjust the camera here a little bit got it all oh don't wait let's get this fixed him y'all see what I'm doing how's that go all right back again yeah you LSU Hat y'all see what Mississippi last week had the job across Louisiana of course so stopped in got me a new cat laws in there ain't gonna buy me new and unless I'm in state so at the sport my colors I having some good football this year and everything with LSU if any y'all keep up with college football y'all know we're doing good so that part of this weekend that's going to tell the tale though all right ah here we go guys got another gun for you the upper memory used to get that ball to mow what was it buh-buh-buh-buh watermelons nope whatever it was I think that's what it was they been making it forever oh you look pretty good you chew on it but flavor one wait about 10 minutes well this one won't let me tell you this is a good you don't like this and if you like the candy sweet ones and everything a really good bubblegum one everybody's been telling me I need to get away from the creams a little bit and do something a little more fruity or candy sauce what I'm trying to do and this a needs it is a watermelon bubblegum so let's get to us here we'll go over the the ingredients here let me get them over here where they are where's the Bubblegum I used to Capella's above go home I really like like this is pretty authentic it really is pretty pretty authentic oh my god and then the watermelon I found that I liked the the double watermelon my Capella's I've got a candy watermelon over there that ain't half bad but I think I like this a little better so I sworn I used in this no more it's still a candy watermelon but it's still I don't know a little stronger I guess you might say I don't know and then super sweet gotta put some sweetener in it in everything I use the super sweet mica palace someone that I like you the sweetener you like you use as much on this one here so last long written is the same price so let's save you some money and then also some sweet strawberry now I bought this euro flavor that's the brand name euro flavor sweet strawberry and you know what I'm gonna have to say I'm gonna go back to the Capella's sweet strawberry I really like it better so I recommend using it this is all I got today so I'm going to use it it's okay but I like to compel a sweet strawberry better you don't need to use this much and then I think it's more authentic than this one here and this one's was cheap and then they have bad I think I'll give two bucks for that big puddle so I don't know I like trying new stuff see God does and so that's kind of hid so let's get down to it guys together scales cut on and everything we're gonna make a 30 mil bottle today our ratio is gonna be 30 70 and we'll probably do what 3 milligram nicotine which is what I normally do you know so let's get right to it here well post a link there's the recipe y'all if you want to pause it and look at it but I'll push the link to it down in the description where you can go to it and print it out or make changes to it or however you want it okay let's get them to it first ingredient of course what we're going we're gonna listen there's gonna be point nine point nine zero what we're gonna put in this point nine zero now we're using them big bottles so be careful with you you're dripping because you know they come out a little more than on them a little bottle nine there we go now we got it okay got our bubble gum in there get our watermelon in there I'm going to get some more that I bet use a little bit of that the double watermelon Bhakra pelas 2.0 is what we're gonna put in this and don't forget to zero out the scale guys to point forward on our watermelon double watermelon it's what we're using today yeah mmm that watermelon smell good to me I like the smell of it two point four we're putting a little bit in listen so it's gonna be some watermelon in there you like that water for candy watermelon you know it goes real good in this in here okay got our watermelon in there next one we're gonna put in there is our super sweet you can go in any order you want beyond sweet point four or five one super sweet make it just right you know on this one here now and some of my recipes you'll notice I'll just say sweetener I won't until you sometime to cut it back about 5% if you're using super sweet or that sugar daddy I think is the other one that's real sweet if I say super sweet on the recipe that's how much you use it will specifically say super sweet and this one does you know so I've usually cut it back about 5% if you're just using the regular sweetener like stevia okay sweet strawberry 0.6 I'm about out of that guys want to get some more in there but like I say I'm gonna get the Cabela's next time so point six listen be just enough in there there we go one six one six zero there on the money I went fast on that alright let's get some bass put in it we're gonna put 4.8 to an arm propylene glycol 4.8 to and then our VG mystery don't forget Xerox kale you know I do that sometimes I go back and see what I know so you don't want to make that mistake like I did to five twenty five point three five twenty five point three five remember we're making 30 mil bottle on this refine man I could smell that watermelon coming up out of there that's a strong smelling flavor really there we go all right got that and going there now let's put a little nicotine in yep that's right guys I don't handle it alone so you want to be careful where the leak especially where it's up on the eyes okay you want to be careful I'm using I'm using 100 hundred milligram per milliliter nicotine here and this is a VG base mix team and we're gonna put 1.13 in it because I'm making three milligram juice 1.13 you can change this up in the calculator it's not hard to do closer though which is okay all right let's hold ingredients guys let's put it on the mixture get it mixing over there you know really liked this recipe my wife loves it she really really likes so crispy like you know and she used to sit like not you know even like on my previous video where I made the strawberry bubble gum not follow me calls I'm surprised because it has sweetener in it but I was really surprised call longevity is it's pretty good on that and everything so you want to worry about that too much this one here I like to let steep a little longer than that strawberry bubble gum I think it needs to take a little longer I'd give it about a week or better on the Shelf though dark play said about 77 degrees and a lot of wheat and you ready to go you can vape on it right out raw but you won't get as much as good a watermelon flavor on this one here unless you let it seep in thanks shaking there yeah never say you do that oh got my beakers naked over here I got it whizzing along pretty good all that one and everything but this is a really good fake kind of if you were wanting to get away from the creams a little bit or some other fruity stuff it's a really good switch over to you know it's a good weight that you can fake bone for several days and you know not get tired of it real fast and everything so you know it's pretty good in everything so I recommend it at all but I'll put links to their inscriptions so y'all look it up and everything and that's it for today guys I got a couple of hardware reviews coming y'all not hate them damn things so I'm gonna do them anyway to let you know what a fine couple of deals I found on some equipment you know I usually that's the only hardware reviews I'm gonna do if it's a super great deal on a good babe I'm not going to just review the newest thing coming out cuz I don't mean Smee any and I don't think if you're really into vaping you need to do the latest thing but anyway that's it guys that's all I got today try you some watermelon you look sick", "_Y3zGqLxNrQ": "today we're trying American chewing

chewable. Well, prior to World\nWar II, chewing gum was actually made of\nsomething called \"chicle\" which came from trees which\nare native to Central America. And essentially,\nchicle is a latex sap, but you can't get a lot of\nchicle from those trees. In fact, if you tap a\nchicle tree for 24 hours, it only yields about\ntwo and a half pounds of chicle which would get\nyou only a few hundred sticks of chewing gum. So not the best\nkind of ingredient to use for the long-haul. Because by World\nWar II, Americans were chewing gum like\ncrazy, all over the place. But then after the\nwar, these chemists got together and were\nlike, hey, you know what? We should think of some kind\nof chicle substitute, you know? And so they came up\nwith another kind of synthetic rubber\nanalogous to chicle. And so today chewing gum is\nmade from these synthetic rubber compounds combined\nwith things like sugar and natural and\nartificial flavorings. So to answer the\nquestion of what makes chewing gum so\nchewable, it's rubber. It's rubber. We're really just\nchewing on rubber, flavored like watermelons,\nor grapes, or candied apples, or hot dogs. No, not that one. So that's it for BrainStuff. Go ahead and subscribe, and\nlike us while you're at it. And don't forget to\nadd your comments if you've got any more\nquestions about chewing gum, or BrainStuff, or other\ncool things that you can learn. And why I'm holding\nmy hands like this-- that's a good question, too.", "KTbtFqX9ojc": "hi everyone this is mr neil reiter also known as the wax whisperer thank you for tuning in to my latest video a client here who attended with medially impacted earwax and keratins when we say medial we mean towards the eardrum the opposite of media is lateral so lateral means near the entrance and i've described this type of earwax on my thumbnail as a chewing gum type of wax and that's because it's really stuck it's impacted it's a bit elastic so imagine you've got some chewing on the bottom of your sole and your shoe and it's stuck and it's really difficult to remove really impacted and you can see there's this plug of wax just coated with some keratin so keratin is a protein keratin your hair is made up of keratin your fingernails and so it's skin and so this keratin around the wax is acting like a double-sided sticky tape not only is it adhered to the plug of wax but it's also adhered to the ear canal wall the patient denies using cotton buds but it's very apparent that they did because this wax is as i said really impacted and you can see the consistency here it's very sticky and elastic i'm suctioning it it's just rather than coming out the wax is just blocking the suction tube and also just stretching it's very elastic it's a horrible type of wax it's the worst type of wax to remove in my personal opinion and because it's so medial we can't use any of the instrumentation so we can't use an ear hook can't use a jobson horn because that will come in contact with the bony part of the ear canal which is very sensitive and very uncomfortable for the patient the only way you'll be able to do that is by administering a local anesthetic or even general anesthetic so in a moment i'm going to instill the ear with some olive oil earwax drops and typically the olive oil what i do i soak it into the ear for a few minutes and then i tilt the patient's head in the opposite direction so that the drops comes out and the main reason for that is at least whilst performing the procedure if the ear is still full of whack the drops during the procedure and you're suctioning it can blow the screen however what i did in this instance was slightly different i still had the patient's head tilted so that the drops were penetrating soaking into the ear and i actually stood up whilst the patient's head was tilted and i went back into the ear with the drops in without draining it and i found that actually it was not causing at the same level of blurriness as as it would if the patient's head was straight and i suspect that's because the dry gravity is drawing this wax deep into the air onto the eardrum which still allows me to suction you still get some blurriness of course because you're suctioning oil but not as bad as usual and you can just see the wax is really engulfed by this keratin so where i am now the glossy white substance that's just dead skin and it's attached it's lodged in the inferior recess so that's the inferior recess is the trench at the bottom near the eardrum you can see the bottom quadrant of the eardrum now and this other plug of wax is tightly adhered to the eardrum itself and also lodged in the anterior recess so near the eardrum there's a there's a narrowing and then a widening of the ear canal again and that narrowing is called the ithmus and because you've got a narrowing and then a widening afterwards you get what we call recesses and typically you get an inferior recess at the bottom near the eardrum and an anterior recess so to the front of the eardrum so in the case of the left ear on the left hand side see the patient's eardrum is fully visible there but just another plug of wax the roof of the ear canal with some keratin there you can see the keratin just to the right hand side and that's just getting suctioned up the probe the keratin and we've got to be really careful here we don't want to make contact with the bony part of the ear canal so i'm really pleased with that clear the occlusion can see the eardrum so the patient has got quite a deep inferior recess so that trench it does go quite deep and i'm just mopping up near the entrance just making trying to get as much excess oil out of the ear as possible there's a final view of the patient's tympanic membrane it's fully visible intact i hope you enjoyed that video guys and you're all having a nice evening wherever you are in the world watching this do take care and keep safe", "t-N4TakHqRA": "the only one I kind of

in the past when we've had things react very explosively well hot oil is going to burn through a plastic tarp so this seems like a better area to do that yeah here's the basic idea we found five comments of five different things that you guys want to see deep fried we're gonna try them out and let you know how it says we've looked through comments and found five things that you guys have requested for us to deep fry and we're gonna try all five of those and see what they do I think we've got some pretty fun ideas here yeah you guys seem very very interested in what can and cannot be deep-fried so we've done two of these in the past you'll notice we have a third deep fryer we've gone through three deep fryers now because we keep breaking things because the things we've deep-fried explode I don't know if anything we have today is as explosive but I am kind of curious to see what happens to it so let's get started should be interesting first off we had a video 'if we deep fried eggs in a few different ways but one thing we didn't do was to deep fry a hard-boiled egg so these are hard boiled eggs and I think we're gonna try deep-frying one with the shell on and one with the shell off and see how they react [Music] that's missing already hissing I'm pretty sure the unpeeled egg is going to pop fairly quickly or crack I just cracked Wow you called it and I jumped about seven feet not all of the shell came off but one part of it did I think that's probably the a pocket air pocket yeah or even the yolk in the inside that might have been too fast for the yolk to really start heating up that happened act like baby yeah okay old one has gotten this lovely golden fried egg coating has crust and we've definitely started losing shell off of our unpeeled hey that's a good way to peel a hard-boiled egg yeah deep fry it I want to try again like leave these going but I do want to fuse with another one and as soon as it pops I want to take it out and see how much of the shell can come off okay and let's back up a little farther because that almost threw oil at us cracked yet at all so that's strange one of them pops so quickly and then this other one has been in there for much longer and it hasn't maybe take these ones out and look at them and then we can grab the other two if we want all right so I'm gonna go ahead and say just as far as presentation is concerned doesn't look all that appetizing a new new way to fry an egg this one's kind of interesting the one that was in the shell because it's still browned but it didn't get the same crackly crust we didn't batter these guys you saw them go in as it was still soft-boiled even Wow look at that you have this crunchy this could be a thing I think one of the comments I saw asking about this suggested that it was actually a thing like a middle Scotch eggs that was called I've seen them before when I've gone to Britain but yeah battered egg and then it's fry that I believe tell me if I've got this wrong really good but it's kind of what this reminds me of here hot mm-hmm is the crunch texture on the outside nice or is it just me no I actually really like it it reminds me of just a very fried egg but I really like that crunchy texture that you get like the edges around the edge of the pan I would actually do that on purpose I would feel it first yeah I like that clam you're getting a nice even coating on the outside where is the one that had the shell on there are there parts of it that were more protected that I don't think picked up that texture as much you can see right there that still had shell it didn't come off and then this one none of the shell came off so we have inconsistent results and none of this is fried on the inside [Music] maybe the one that popped is the rare one be ammonium in there about 30 seconds whoa there we go it's only one I kind of want to think wow there's the other one of these days guys you're going to see us film an explosion where I don't scream someday someday it will happen all right so we had one egg that did not want to pop but three eggs with the show on that did but overall I think if you're gonna fry a hard-boiled egg or a soft-boiled egg it probably is best to peel it first because then you get like a soft-boiled egg with a nice crunchy outside texture and it's actually delicious eggs interesting what's next well you know there's one breakfast food next up people wanted to see a different breakfast food we've got pop-tarts pop-tarts can be cooked in a number of ways toasters microwaves it doesn't have deep-frying instructions though we're enough to make it up one two three that looks like a soggy pop-tart yeah I'm gonna save it but it also looks a lot more quick for that one next to it you can already see the difference in color there a little bit or it's just oil soaked into it yeah that is a soggy pop-tart I say let's put it in until they look nice and crisped up on the outside I don't know what time we're going for but just by a visual know that one RD I mean they come pretty looking good to me that's the other weird thing guys I don't care for toasted pop-tarts I don't want warm pop-tarts I just eat them directly out of the package I like toasted pepper I don't microwave them will I use the toaster I don't own a toaster they're floating like donuts these look like soggy pop-tarts they do that looks like it's gonna have so so so much oil in it oh it's gonna squish we're gonna try and eat it and it's gonna squish oh it's warm out it's soft but it's also still hot that seemed about the same texture as a unfried pop-tart let's let these cool down quite a bit they're still very hot to the touch and then we can try them what are we trying next Mentos I'm going in order of what we think is least likely to destroy our brand-new deep fryer to most likely to destroy our brand-new deep fryer just drop it goodbye Mentos well immediately there is no reaction okay give it some time and see if that changes I'm gonna just toss a couple more in oh it split open split open okay jumped its guts out I think the shell just came separate let's pull that out yeah that was interesting it didn't jump down in the tank it dumped its guts out we just have the Mentos shell left what all right let's see if all of them pop their guts out or if that was just a weird thing that one of them did and they don't do anything for the first like 30 seconds or so take some time that was spot that's bubbling that's where the goop was you're gonna go breaking open check that out they've all just dropped their shells right off that's bizarre okay I'm gonna regret this but this is a piece of a Mentos shell very warm windy crunchy fried oil it is very crunchy I think the shells always art but you don't really notice the crunch is much because there's a snap normally there's a goo behind it that absorbs it all but now all the goo was extracted but the crunchy part is my favorite so that's a funny way to get that all right it's very warm do but I'm gonna eat it anyway [Music] honest I think the mint is more powerful like this it really is I don't know what about is making it more powerful but like it's just almost an overwhelming amount of like mint and vapor and I just keep eating it up check out how the shell bubbled and you can see you just spit out their insides but the shell is now bumpy just popped over cut in half it's it's like a fried flaky pastry outside of a pop tart it's kind of what you'd expect it does absorb a lot of oil if you bite into needs it's like straight fry bread oil is a major component and flavor deep fry yeah it's a valid option the inside the filling definitely does get warm we've left it sitting for a bit and cooled down but it's still very warm so it would probably be way too hot when you first took it out like most things when you deep fry them and when you toast them filling can be too hot so if you like that kind of thing I'd say very valid option you can deep-fry a pop-tart personally I would stick to toasting them in a toaster Callie would stick to not cooking them at all but they're good in order of things least likely to destroy our deep fryer - most likely to destroy our deep fryer the next up I swore to never do a video with ever ever again we've got three different types of bubble gum here and I think we're going to try well all of them we're gonna see what happens to them just opening this pack of gum I was struck by a wave of strong scent so this could be some pretty intense gum this is just bazooka bubblegum pretty standard classic old brand I think although this has two flavors in and I think it used to only come up one so times are changing I think it's gonna melt right into that it might really really like that is a blue raspberry something nightmare oh I don't know if we are oh maybe in a minute we can try scraping it off that paper towel there the piece for not quite so long [Music] I think that's good it looks like a tongue let's try our other couple types of bubblegum we've got a ball and some bubble tape yep this I think actually will explode we're gonna back up for that one it's gonna pop well I just thought bubbles writing on yeah the bubble tape is fantastic that's disintegrated and gone I did not know that gum would come apart in oil most of it is just white a little bit that was near the top kind of looks like one of the eggs now yes it does oh it just seems now you got too much oil in it [Music] Tryg um I'm not very good at making bubbles apparently ports not very good but we're going gum I'm just gonna drop my piece of what we're gonna into it oh I hate this hot oil reacts to water kind of violently what you're listening to sizzle and pop there is Nate spits it's also completely disintegrated it's just gone wait kay my piece all right so bubble gum and different type this is the bubble tape yep giant chunk of it gross I think mine stuck to the bottom I don't want them getting in Oh the oils gone murky quick that's disgusting I don't think we're going to be eating anything else out of the oil at this point though so it's a good time yeah so now if you were to try something that oil it would be spit and bubble gum coated yeah yeah just what do you want I think you should probably do that as a prep before you cook a turkey in here all right I want to try some of our deep-fried bubblegum do you a little okay [Music] it actually does have that kind of classic fried texture it's crispy and light as you bite through it oh my goodness trying to just chew it and see what happens I think it dissolved a lot of the gum part and a lot of the sugar has been left behind there's really not very cohesive Ghul just like not holding itself together it's almost like a slime prove it oh you miss yummy yeah it's really squishy and disgusting so would you recommend somebody deep-fried their bubblegum definitely not there's no advantage to deep-frying bubblegum I know a lot of people planning to go out and do that but don't maybe not glow sticks glow sticks we want to see what happens if we deep-fry a glow stick a sealed glow stick mm-hmm and a cracked glow stick absolutely and then we probably need to crack a glow stick cut it open and pour the glowing fluid into the oil you're assuming that we can do that without just exploding it or however I'm worried about them exploding so we are going to be moving a fair distance away well in addition to that because I want to see if it activates the glow we're gonna move our whole fryer into a darker location so we can really see that yeah I love destruction in 3 2 1 I want to know if they're gonna expand and I'm not willing to stand close enough to see right I hear bubbling and one of them that looks like there's movement something's floating a little bit up near the top I think the plastic has opened it could still have the glass cylinders inside sealed or cylinder single well there is another experiment I want to try like I said I want to activate a glow stick then cut the top off and see what happens if I just pour the liquid directly into the fryer whoa that looks very cool so it's kind of like when we poured it onto the stove top yeah it goes very bright and then it kind of burns out guys that's it for today you let us know if you want to see anything else in our deep fryer and remember that's not all we've always got more if you see hit that box up to the top to see our most recent video and we'll talk to the next one see them you", "JZumeVu4ZN4": "hello and g'day welcome to another one of my chewing gum videos and today i'm featuring mentos dumb and i only realized recently that mentos so dumb in australia so i thought i buy a few packets and do pay do a video featuring Mentos gum now first things first i'm going to open I pack of mentos gum and there's a little sign there well of your words there anyway that say open here and there's a little perforation so hopefully if I get my fingernail I don't need that down carefully feel that around okay yeah the top comes off plastic top sort of comes off and reveals the the gum so I will and you can see there that the um the gum is in those big boobs that just like the regular Mentos so I'm gonna take that tube and I I won't say pop that in my mouth but I will say I will place that in my mouth and start chewing that's quite nice okay I'm just gonna put a little cotton ball in there so it doesn't rattle around when I know everybody is used to these chewy drag ease Mentos mints they've come in these long my skinny bets and realize that Mentos made it come as well I didn't realize until recently and the Mentos gun is the same shape as the regular Mentos well the regular chewy drag is a Mentos - okay and it's very fresh in okay Cranky's so you can see all the drag days I was kind of compare that to the regular Mentos I'll do that next time Mentos pure fresh dumb but no pure breath on that one my thirty grams fresh flavor and a similar information on the back to our breath confidence they contain soy made in China and there's a little nutrition information for the Mentos pure fresh dumb driver now as far as I can tell these are the only four flavors that are sold in Australia I did look and I could see a lot of other flavors that were available but these were the only four that I could see that were advertised for astray for sale in Australia grocery are you there we go I'll show you that there's the best before date 26th of May 20 21 that's pretty good I saw these come is this come is indictable which is pretty exciting this one has actually been laid out 14th of October 20 21 it's obviously in Australia we do the day first and then the month and then the year now the next one to try this is this beaming flavor Mentos sugar-free gum Mentos pure pure fresh let's just put that to one side I'm getting better at opening these bottles as well this time it's a white with a few green actually compared to the size that I've gotta fill in there and this is the specs on the spearmint gum so start join them I do like spearmint it gives you a sort of a yeah a burst of freshness freshness in your mouth yeah that is nice so birthdays backs I bought them and I type in them I'll do the video that's really nice I haven't really tried the strawberry flavor yet but it's my favorite there's a little viewing window again you can see the little bits of gum they called drag ease as well what your shop sugar-free gum Mentos pure fresh pure breath gum with green tea extract 30 grams and steaming flavor there we go for pure breath confidence made in China and there's the nutrition information I get into that last time I thought I might just run through some interesting facts about pentose mentos was originally invented oh it was the idea of them brothers conviction aerospace company and in 1932 they in 2001 fanmail merged with Perfetti which is the italian company and created Perfetti Van Melle was the person that or the company that makes Mentos Mentos and mentos gum and they're the third largest after Mondelez international which is the biggest in bars Perfetti Van Melle about 2005 they came up with the well introduced the gum this Mentos company to Europe 2008 the Mentos gum was introduced in to USA and I'm not sure when it came to Australia mentos is sold in a hundred countries yes oh it's uh it's pretty recognizable Brandon Mentos so yeah you should get in the little plastic individual these are an interesting shape I thought anyway other products that fan mail making chopper jumps or meet risk and there's the last time to try this is the strawberry with little flecks yeah it tasted Roby they asked what noise not quite the play the best with the split you get with the that you get with this payment it's still pretty good little viewing window so I guess you can see how many left their country with you halfway is s recorders breakup mentos pure fresh okay so it's 30 grams strawberry flavor this one doesn't have to you this program or injury extract with the strawberry not sure why but just notice that and mentos pour pure breath components something about soy a little nutrition information and it's made in China so there we go I've told you that of charge of everything that I know about Mentos come the fresh mint of flavor fresh flavor spearmint flavor which was my favorite and mentos gums that are available in Australia noise and orthos comes now so that's about it I saw a sign off now and say I hope you've enjoyed this video I hope you found it relaxing thanks for watching and good bye for now", "8eIQrwCTfqg": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to food review UK my name's MJ and today we are reviewing opal fruits chewing gum we have of course the Starbucks but if you are a younger person perhaps under the age of 25 20 maybe you don't realize Starbucks actually used to be called April fruits if I can find some packaging I'll put it on screen it's our spot one earth is going on on my nothing nice you know that bit there was icing sugar because I've just tried to replicate to Costco icing on an upcoming video you know a new Shira sure Smosh wonderpana food review cakes ponies I'm strolling because I can't get into this pocket it says tear here okay I wasn't I wasn't tearing where it said ah that's disappointing this is one of those the branding is on the packaging outer bit plasticky it stickers on the lid dice that's all counts nice little table actually although plastic a little flimsy so you can't really save it right there looks to be three colors on 100 pieces a comment if I mentioned by girlfriend or business WH Smith rather and stop it he went say Nando's is the color of the cup is not quite matching the color on the packet right so three verse not godless its the Rays flavours I'm gonna go for the green first I'm assuming they're all different flavors hmm that's interesting the nice bite-sized piece as well that is incredibly fruity um I think there might all be the same flavor based on that one cuz I can't really discern any specific flavor yellow oh no maybe not I don't know if the yellow is tricking me it must be I for that I started off with banana but they don't even do a banana April fruit and that transitioned into juicy fruit gum and that is largely what it tastes like now let's try the red red for teach that say that is my vendor shot now I'm gonna wear this mmm the red one no there are different flavors I'm gonna wear this t-shirt to the Avengers infinity war premiere the red is the best one so red a strawberry but it's the incredibly artificial strawberry I splashed puppy it literally tastes like red slush puppy which is immense that's really good mm-hmm yeah a lot let's impress me actually I wasn't expecting to be too impressed with these but right yellow yeah it's really hard to tell the yellow but definitely halfway for it definitely pivots into juicy fruit which the red one doesn't place at all like and then let's just pivot back to green you can pivot Jon oh there's definitely a hint of Apple up front in green yeah not getting much citrus from any of them which isn't necessarily a bad thing there are a few other lemony chewing gums and they're all really nice they keep their flavour quite well and their color there's the ones that I've spat out yeah quite impressed with them actually I'll take them to work and leave them on my desk they are jam packed with flavor they've got a nice texture when you you know crunch through it like you do with the sugar sugary shell gums Golf Prince Paco essence and just yeah really nice really packed with flavor I give them a loaf we'll start that's a really good chewing gum and I would say go and try it thank you very much watching everyone I hope you enjoyed this video if you did maybe think about checking out our other channels like movie review UK where I review movies a reason seesaw racing they sell a quiet place which was incredible and hey I've also got a comedy channel Michael Johnson comedy go check that out if you're in the mood to laugh see you

all began the day we saw that stupid film in school we were learning about rockets and space capsules but some grown up someplace goofs and instead they send us a movie on of all things how they make

about how wholesome everything is and how the world could never get along without his company it's all like torture to sit there with your mouth watering for all that sweet luscious bubble gum moving around by the ton when the last place in the world they'd ever let you chew is in school that afternoon a lot more of us than usual head for the candy store and there's a real run on the gum in cards

largest bubblegum factory was built over the spot i worked out a plan the film showed how every night until pretty late the whole bubble gum factory had scrubbed down and washed to be ready for the next day's work after clean up almost all the workers were away my plan was get there hide till late at night then dig for the treasure while almost everyone's gone there it was big and beautiful let's see now from the center tree one two three four i felt like the captain of a submarine sneaking into the enemy's harbor but my heart was pounding away like mad i wonder if real submarine captain's hearts pound that way too five six in a little while the treasure will all be mine yes sir i am the pirate captain and i shall capture the king's cargo ship just a few more steps 10 11 uh oh here comes a guard take cover men there were guards at every entrance to the fort but my orders were to get in there and reach the objective not really but you know what i mean the coast is clear let's go men oh boy what a place maybe i ought to tell the bubble gum people about the treasure make them my partner and give them half nope i won't tell them i'd rather keep all that pirate gold for myself and i go now a place to hide until late at night a place where no one will find me maybe down one of these rows ah part one of the plan completed [Music] late at night almost everyone's gone so on to the treasure the warehouse part of the factory was loaded with gum comics and wrappers when i'm rich from the treasure i'll send in millions of comics and get tons of prizes there were also cases and cases of things that go into making bubble gum things that all smell so sweet in the manufacturing part of the plant automatic panels and special scales control all the machines exactly the right amount of each thing goes into the gum recipe in case even the smallest thing goes wrong though there's a special panic button which immediately shuts everything down just like in the movie at school no fooling a real panic button turn a few switches and the whole place goes into action the ingredients get weighed mixed together and baked into delicious gum base the gum base later goes through wacky looking machines to form it into different shapes some machines make it into hundreds of long pieces that get cut into smaller chunks later on other machines make it into large thin sheets these sheets get cut up later to go with picture cards and other crazy machines roll chunks of gum base into thousands of gum balls neat huh the flavors and colors for the gum are mixed into a hot liquid and are added to the gum in big pots that keep tumbling at all to get it coated just right next big kettles tumble the gum pieces over and over until they're all polished and shiny another machine checks them all for size and roundness the colors get put together and are wrapped automatically only machines touch the gumballs themselves like robots other screwy looking machines automatically pack different kinds of gums gum easter eggs and my favorites baseball cards these machines can even count the number of cards going into each pack the wrappers come in large rolls the machines cut them to just the right size and wrap and seal each package some machines work so fast the wrap pieces come pouring out like rivers the conveyor belts carrying them look like super highways with rush hour traffic [Music] they come off at the end by the thousands i think i'll pack some for the workers help i can't even keep up with it maybe i can do better at this machine which puts lots of little pieces into a bag hmm this looks like more fun giant overhead conveyors i think that's what they're called carry trays of gun through the factory now it's my turn for a ride here we go higher and higher this is fun loads and loads of gum i'll buy it all when i get the treasure [Music] where are those special clean white gloves everyone uses i'll be rich rich rich all this sweet smell it all smells so sweet oh but sweet dreams [Music] take my treasure will you [Music] your stop [Music] [Laughter] your car let's get them we've got you let me go let me out of here let me alone make them into a baseball card [Music] [Applause] help oh no help help what's this oh no i'm caught no more pirate treasure no more riches to buy gum no more riches to buy baseball cards no more prizes for comics no more of anything after they put me in jail but they'll never get my treasure back while i was waiting for the sheriff to come and take me away they gave me some gum my last meal but a fate worse than the sheriff arrived mom she was so angry and upset for punishment they're making me do twice as many jobs around the house but to add to it all my folks won't let me have any baseball cards or bubble gum for this entire baseball season would you believe parents could ever be so cruel and susie keeps hanging around tormenting me because my pirate map turns out to be just an old piece of blueprint from the factory building plans and some wise guy drew a map on it and put it into a bottle at the lake also my mother's gotta go to school because my teacher sent her a note that i'm a wise guy she asked the class what we learned from that movie on how they make bubble gum and i wrote real pirate maps were not drawn on blueprints some days nothing goes right you", "hMqgeExiwaM": "so I was browsing around the internet the other day and I found out that the world record for the biggest bubble blown is by a guy named Chad fell and his bubble was 20 inches big in diameter now I think that's pretty impressive but this is moon waffles so we're gonna try to beat that record now BAM like it painted it myself each line is an inch thick so I'm actually gonna measure out Chad's bubble first and it's 20 inches so that's gonna be marked so we remember that's how big the world record is so I got some double bubblegum I know that the outside is pretty hard if you look at this do you hear that it's a look it's a rock I cannot chew the gum by myself I'm gonna have been chew the gum for me and I'm not saying he's gonna chew it I'm gonna put it in my mouth okay you're gonna see what we do he's gonna help me chew the gum and then we're gonna try to make a really really big bubble but I want to tell you guys right now chewing a lot of gum is not good for you especially double bubble gums there's a lot of sugar in here so please do not try this let us do it so you don't have to okay with that being said I went along I got 200 pieces of gum [Music] [Music] here it is guys here's 200 pieces of chewed gum before you tell me oh my god this poker lucky you touching gum that somebody else chewed we washed it and come on it's just been clearly I cannot fit this in my mouth so we went along and we got a bunt um alright so I got a little piece of our giant chunk and I'm actually gonna roll it out wrap the gum piece around the head we're gonna come over here alright here we go guys come on there's too many little air hose oh maybe the piece is just too thick and I need to warm it up because like I can barely even pull this apart and I'm guessing that like your mouth is a pretty warm place right so let's make this feel like you just took it out your mouth so we're gonna go ahead and microwave this I say it like I know what I'm doing but I don't okay it's extra squishy now you know that's what it looks like [Music] oh yeah I know there's a hole you see the hole okay so that worked so I have to warm it up a little bit now I'm gonna take all of our gum and I'm gonna put it in a microwave for about 25 seconds if you put it in for too long it just turns to like this looks mush Oh Oh before while that warms up I have this shower cap because I do not want to get gum in my hair cuz if you get gum in your hair it ain't coming out so this is because we washed it and all the it's hot all the water and the sugar is coming out I don't think this one big hole slab is just gonna work I'm just gonna split it into four we can literally do an ASMR with bubble gum watch this this is what you will do with slime it's getting more stiff so I'm gonna do is split this in half and then one half I split it into two I'll roll the sides thinner than the center because that has been working for me and wrap it around the bike pump like I did earlier there's a big old hole there it's not working there's a hit this hole down here oh because I'm covering the pump ah I'm gonna make you work it's not working there's too many little holes in it I'm not gonna give up see it's weird because when I stretch it like this like the elastic is perfect there's no holes but then if I made a hole my finger but then when I use the pipe pump but just keep making the wrong holes it's good there's a hole I ain't stuck on my hand and I got stucked and then it popped on my skin completely cover this bike pump yes my legs are cramping but I'm gonna make this beer no it looks like a lung maybe I need to just completely cover the bike pump I don't want to cover like the hole itself that's what I'm saying cover cover the tire bike pump and pump come on are you kidding these are already holes in there maybe if I use my own logic [Music] oh there's so many holes oh man oh my god okay I'm gonna take a break guys Wow our hurts and so does my soul we're so close I'm so close I've been doing this for five hours we are about to be a world record though we're just two inches away from beating him or just reaching him we're gonna get it but I just can't use my arm right now because I literally have to just hold it in place so I'm just gonna let it rest okay guys so Ben actually had to help me out with this because we think we got it we just have to hang it upside down and have the bike comb upside down and we also have to start it off first before we put it up there so Ben helped me do that so thank you so much Ben and now we get to give birth to Charlie here we go Charlie grow my child grow he's coming up so fast Charlie's doing it guys he's really growing he's 14 inches already make mama proud Charlie my arms starting to give out on me I need the trip we have three inches before we beat Chad we're coming for you Chad everything did arms on one day guys guys we reached it we reached it just a little bit more and it will be up oh my god this is so cool but so scary at the same time holy snap these bigger than me and been sent a vine oh my god and it's still going guys we are nearly two inches more than Chad take that chance oh well you can get quality content like pulling up your friends chewed-up bubble and then using it to break World Records we're still going strong like ancient like is it gonna pop any second up oh here we go yes I'm gonna keep going until I can't anymore judging by the size of this balloon I don't think I'm stopping anytime sir you can barely even see me I am so glad then didn't wanna give up because I wanted to give up four hours ago I think there's a hole somewhere but it's not like before all I see the hole I see the hole but you know what we are clearly bigger than Chad's we have defeated Chad fell we now hold the world record for the biggest bubble ever blown using bubble gum now I don't want you guys to think that we cheated and put like a balloon back here so I am gonna pop this thing now this is real euro biscuits it's gonna get on my arm hair I'm not gonna be able to get it out oh my God look at that look at that we did this we did it because of this droid yeah alright guys so we first started this project it was about 1 p.m. it's now 8 p.m. we just spent seven hours we spent seven hours trying to do this but do you know what it was worth it because we didn't give up because it move awfully we go big or we don't go home literally I missed the bus", "LaP3CkiKdp0": "[Music] [Music] chewing isn't easy i'm tired i'll leave it for tomorrow that's what i'll do well the day is

company called simply gum and um I have not tried the gum yet but before I do I want to tell you what really caught my eye this is a small little handwritten note that says hi Phaedra thank you so much for trying our gum a few things to note packaging is a prototype I like that they're new and innovative and they're thinking about it flavor is cinnamon not mint so it looks like mint what they sent me cinnamon and we included a big red as a comparison I gotta be honest I never really looked at the ingredient list of gum but I'm assuming it's got lots of chemicals in there that I probably don't need now I'm going to do a live taste of simply gum interesting look what it looks like kind of looks like a it kind of looks like a chewed up piece of gum and if we're talking all-natural we're comparing this to this which doesn't quite look as natural alright I don't love cinnamon gum but I'm gonna give it a try I'm tasting warm tomato soup going down my throat and now here comes dessert it's blueberry pie I'm just kidding that's from Willy Wonka this is very chewy as chewing gum should be here's my second-in-command gum chewer Evan that's the gum what's it look like to you clay ball clay ball it's not give it a try I have this habit or I like to try and blow bubbles even in gum that's not meant for bubbles did you see that that was amazing and I like to pop my gum too I do not look attractive when I'm doing this I didn't do that I'm still chewing it makes you hasn't lost its flavor yet it's spicy cuz it's cinnamon cinnamon is spicy I'm not ready to give this gum up yet do it but I'm gonna set it down now take my half a big red you know I never noticed before but now I couldn't it tastes a little cardboard ish to me this is more like a fireball which I've never been a fan of fireballs remember how I said I wasn't really a fan of cinnamon gum cuz this is why I just don't like it's like a spice on my tongue that yeah and I just don't care for it okay try pop I gotta get rid of the big red I'm gonna take my sticky gum back my mouth is happy really though flavor aside it's the texture that I really like it's really really nice if you are a gum chewer you might want

the the Regnier starfish comes with orange strawberry cherry and lemon flavor surprisingly for this bar of candy just at this bar of assorted four flavors of starburst has a total calorie count of 240 they're the one that I'm going to do a review on this is starburst and it has two calorie count to 20 this is the new flavors for our servers is called the Fiesta flavors it comes in peach peach guava I think right yeah peach guava tree mango strawberry pineapple and smelling very sorry I didn't really memorize it so yep so this is what it is after opening it this is how it looks like this is the cherry mango strawberry pineapple melon berry and peach guava overall my favorite is the melon which is the green color and the peach which is the orange color for those who mainly the original regular starbursts this is what it looks like the cherry strawberry lemon and orange and my favorite is a cherry so here we go on this corner regular starburst on this corner Fiesta version so I'm Dan sort of similar so we had the green in the yellow green on this one and the yellow on this one there otherwise it looks pretty much the same packaging sort of flavor-wise like I said the regular starburst cherries my favorite and yes the version I like the cherry mango the guava and the peach the shar-pei pineapple is kind of like not really that a pineapple version I'd be awesome enough so I thought I'd do another include in this review is trident watermelon twist so I'm packing up all these candies and gums in one Oh package so not to bore you with just one product right so I'm trying I've been trying lots of gum might lean cuz you know I just wanted to see which one fits me well and it's better to buy a single pack from the grocery store just in case of you're buying a big a big pack you know of ten or fifteen you're stuck with it you know so this is the watermelon twist open from here oh great I hate the one that happens when does it go not better flavor what he doesn't mention what kind of feature in there but you can see that it has watermelon over here's a cantaloupe and over there's done India melon I'm better flavor the website Trident gum calm so yeah that's about it my review of the starburst yes it's it's alright I guess you know we have four flavors pretty good so it's definitely worth a try and of course my vision I'll start at all starburst in my opinion I like sorry so any of you guys trying to the new starburst Fiesta or the original hey once you just leave a comment tell me your favorite flavor you would there's from the original flavor

look very similar a bomb squad was called in to deal with the situation after police feared the explosive substance might be too volatile to transport", "zymJCPCLew0": "hi everyone so today i'm doing a gum video but it's a gum car bomb you gotta come up with different you know different what is it different stuff for a lack of better words so what i'm going to be doing is a review of some japanese gum okay now i've never had these before i just went to the japanese supermarket or japanese store last time it's hours away so when i got the chance i just i rated all the japanese markets and korean markets when i got into town so i will chew one of these i don't know if this is bubblegum or not we'll see if it's a gum snapping video or a bubble bubble blowing bubble gum video and then i'm sure you guys all know these gums asian japanese gums these are so fruity there's the melon orange grape and strawberry and these i don't know what flavors they are but i think everybody knows there are gumballs in here four in each box and these are bubble gum so i already know and i remember when i was younger i had these before oh it's hot outside and i kind of drove around the neighborhood because you know do you see the trees right there i got tired of seeing you know our neighborhood garbage cans and our neighbors driving by i didn't want them to think i was weird so i will try this bubble gum first and i don't know how loud you can hear me i brought the mic just wanted to test it out i have to be creative right i can't just do gum videos in that same spot every day i think this is all bubblegum oh the flavor is amazing what flavor is that i'm not japanese and i don't read japanese so i have no idea what i'm doing i think this is going to be a bubble gum video because i don't think i can snap gum with any of these very flavorful you know what i've realized is all the asian gums that i've tried they're very strong in the initial flavor when you first start chewing but they run out of the flavor really quickly i brought my non-sweet drink [Music] i don't know what this is i don't know if it's an as asmr i almost forgot asmr or a mukbang i don't know what it is i'm just doing whatever because granny can do whatever and people will understand because it's granny can forget names she can forget food names she can do whatever and it's okay people you guys are so living you guys are so accepting of this flaw filled granny drinking something cold when you chew gum makes the gum hard so that it's easier to crack i have my little car table it's very small it's like this big i don't know if i can do a full meal on this table maybe like a burger but nothing on a plate nothing liquidy or anything like that and i feel like it's gonna just topple over so how are you doing i had to get out of the house right now that we have this carbon what better excuse to get out of the house than today kids i'm recording i gotta go yeah they're like where are you going can i go i have the ac on but it's still hot let's see what this cup's got i have a feeling they're all gonna be the same tasting same texture is this mic helping at all so oh this bubblegum gum is too hard because of the drink maybe i should set the gum out on the on the hood maybe it'll melt it's only 93 degrees okay it's bubble gum but the water the sparkling water made it hard i'm doing some strange things okay i wonder if i can turn this into a gum snapping gum it's so rubbery oh no it's not working this is pokemon coming never had it the flavor is really good but it's not doing any major bubble blowing maybe i need to chew more than one but it's kind of hard for bubble gum and it's too hard to do the snap it's too rubbery to do the snapping i think this might be a failed video i'm gonna give up because it's already been seven minutes but the flavor is really good i'm gonna try the now the melon gum i forgot when we got the gum when we went to the airport for angela um we stopped by the by the you know the korean market or was it the japanese japanese market guess what we chewed it granny doesn't remember these things okay we have orange but the melon gum is really popular that's why you don't see any it's really flavorful and i don't know if this blows bubbles it says bubble gum so we'll see it's little cute little orange balls like those mandarin oranges okay thumbnail this one we haven't opened and grape is one of my favorite flavors and then do we have any strawberries left no strawberries and i'll just do that and cover the steering wheel like i'm into okay oh wow i didn't even notice that there were this may be a fail video but you guys like fail videos don't you you just want to see granny fail don't you very small and soft i want this to be a snapping gum although some gums are bubble gum you can snap gum with them the size is perfect for snapping for me i snap better when i chew like i have a gum stick it's not happening today what wow one so can i get anything today this is definitely softer than this gum but it's too rubbery to snap what is going on i'm gonna combine these and just blow bubbles try to blow balls okay the taste is the best thing about these gums the japanese gums the flavors are just something i've never tasted before very tropical it's different than the american gums very flavorful it's pretty not functional though oh okay i think it's the size maybe i needed two more okay i'm gonna try this bubblegum the apple maybe this is a different texture i'll save this at the end i'll just chew everything together see what that'll create look at the odd shape what is this binoculars green apple so flavorful these japanese gums beat any other gum in flavor initial flavor but the sweetness wears out really fast but the flavors are amazing who else likes to um sit in their cars and sweat and talk to themselves i thought about this let's say i'm just stopped at some random place and i'm doing a car bomb and let's say a police officer came i think i'll let the film run and then i'll ask him to subscribe you think he will you dare me i think i'll say officer uh i i upload videos on youtube and i'll prove it to you and i'll play it back oh i can't play back on this one but i'll say look on your phone and he'll check can you subscribe before you give me a ticket can you subscribe you think that'll get me off the hook you see me doing this all the time right because my eyes get so dry and then it gets teary when it's dry i'm not crying okay okay this is gonna be soft maybe it just might be a gum chewing video um what disappointment well what what i'll put this in my fail category this is really soft and yet so chewy okay this is the finale i i should have tested this out before recording but i want to be surprised as much as you guys are so i don't think i will pre-test any of my candies or gums or anything because i'd like to surprise myself where can i get some other brands of gums i tried looking for korean gum at the korean market they don't have any well they have just like minty gum that's all just one or two different kinds i want all those korean different varieties korea has coffee gum coffee gum is really good i can't find that so i've tried mexican gum japanese gum american gum are there any other gums that i need to go look for i'm always on the search for gum okay exactly what happened in my previous fail gum video it was total fail until the very end so if you want flavor the best flavor gum is japanese gum full of flavor but that's it you can't do anything with it maybe you can i think you just have to chew a lot of gum okay i get it but i like the snap gun better it's more fun so i don't have any snapping gum in the car i have this what do you guys like me chewing more bubble gum or gum snapping gum and i'll do more of that personally i like the snapping which just satisfies me when i hear that snapping okay now the gum is getting softer and it's more it's doable now [Music] okay it's not a total fail gum is very soft okay i think that's it gotta go try to go now i'll end with the melon the melon gum that we have not tasted well not today but my favorite flavor and the boba teas i like matcha but my all-time favorite is the melon boba tea melon ice cream bar melon gum anything melon it's always good okay i'll peace out with a big bubble and that's okay on my next so may god bless you take care okay it's a cross may god bless you and maybe i'll just peace out with this the lord is my shepherd i shall not want okay he may give me lie down it looks like i'm doing an exorcism may god bless you peace out okay let's go out with a bang and it matches my shirt you", "IUEbxHZUmmc": "who can chew more gum me i can chew even more [Music] it was

shop product feature and it provided by Glee gum for review Lucky Penny shop exciting day for me Elyse because I get to work with you on a gum video this is to make your own chewing gum kit okay and we need to say thanks to Glee gum for selling us is awesome dunk it it's also ages eight plus eight plus now let me give you a little history here okay I have been working with Glee gum for many many many years in fact the first video one of the first videos was back in 2012 and Glee gum was the first company ever to send Lucky Penny shop products to try on videos that's really interesting yeah and ever since then they have set meat products and wanted to reintroduce this kit a few modifications to the inner packaging so that's what we're gonna do today learn how rainforest rubber gives gum its bounce okay here is your nutritional information in fact for anybody out there and then there is some information here I will read I'll let you read something in the back how's that okay all right ever wondered what makes chewing gum so chewy no no once I've got its texture from rainforest tree sap this SAP can be collected without harming the trees in fact it's harvest helps to conserve trees and it makes for some great sticky snappy gum nowadays most gum gets its texture from man-made materials cheaper to produce but not so eco-friendly this kit uses real natural rubber latex harvest harvested sustainably sustainably sustainably from rainforest rubber trees so try it out and change what you chew natural gum is better for the planet and fun to make to alright here is the back you don't try to read that sentence there sure this kit is simple to use with a stove or microwave right in your own kitchen and it provides food for thought alright so we get to connect create captivate it's fun to make your own chewing gum inside you will find alright let's do this okay inside you will find let me see I will take it out of the package inside you will find it and you kind of split it all up and then we will see all right so inside you will find natural gum base that's that one there okay and then confectioner sugar that's gonna be further down okay that's that one there oh no this one that's confectioner sugar okay got it and then corn syrup that's the yep that one and then to flavor packets okay pan for softening gum base that's our little pan I believe the other one had like a plastic lid on it instructions and the story of natural gum base which we have right here okay let's see and it's really easy first you soften the natural gum paste by heating it up then you add the sugar corn syrup and flavoring knead it a little and wow you've made your own gum happy chewing and it makes up the fifty pieces Wow alright so we are going to get some things set up here come back and start making gum alright we are back microwave now you take the corn syrup and you just gently put that in there so they do say for younger kids have an adult help off because there is hot stuff just like that okay then this is already starting to heat up I have it on the highest setting we need to put the gum base in here so do you want to do that okay you cut the bag watch that straight one there that you're gonna cut don't lose him can you save him so we have to melt this and guess what we're gonna use for our sir chapstick and that's what I used in the original video these could be the same chopsticks all right so now this is gonna go into here and this is starting to heat up so we're gonna get a better camera angle here come back or we're gonna watch this melt and start mixing it up all right we got a lot of heat here this burner heats up pretty quick so I will hold this to one side you go mix it around and see what we have anything happening down there not yet okay so it's been about five minutes we'll say 20 20 all right so we will keep checking back and see when it starts changing all right all right so Elise and I will be watching that but thought well let's to give us a good time for me to read some of this so you can learn a little bit more and then every once in a while just kind of move it around here okay and see if you can see what's going on start to get softer what does chewing gum have to do with the rainforest you ask Eduardo lives in the northern part of Guatemala in an area called the patent which is a rainforest it's hard to imagine how different life is there from life in the United States but you can get an idea by thinking about a deep lush forest filled with different kinds of birds animals and trees imagine that because it rained so much everything grows quickly and there are plants everywhere it is very beautiful all sorts of different colors in South now imagine being in the rainforest yeah and the rainforest is important because it's home to many different plants and animals that can't live anywhere else in the world so they only can live there for humans life in the rainforest can be difficult because it's hard to earn money or grow food to eat there in order to make a living some people chop down trees in the forest to sell them for lumber and pretty soon if all the trees are sold there won't be a forest left at all that would be sad is it hot on your hands here let me hold this container I know I'll just kind of there you go see this yeah all right here cross our sticks here so we can clean me off ain't so watch it now very hot I'm gonna turn it down just a little so he could slow down that melting yeah just leave it on the tip don't worry about it and then it says Eduardo has found a good way of earning money without chopping down any trees good for him then wireless a shoe Claro Claro that means that he collects a from all trees called Sapodilla trees he does this by tapping the trees making small cuts on the Bart so that sap will flow out he then gathers the SAP and boils it in large pots okay we're kind of doing the same thing except we're boiling in a very small pot let me hold it for you see that yeah starting to really melt imagine that's gonna be we're gonna be in our mouths in no time at all you chewing mmm chewy gum I love gum I know you love gum yeah I think that's probably one of your top favorites okay yeah let's see let me spread that out so it's a little bit better there all right we're gonna keep checking back and then maybe I'll come back and read a little bit more where we end up Oh cutting the bar okay oh that sap is called chick lay and we use it to make a brand of chewing gum called Glee gum many years ago all gum was made from cheek lay rubber or gelatin natural latex from trees right yeah I'll tell you what this is a good time show everybody what else comes since it's now this is their normal packs of gum which we have had is xylitol sweet and sugar-free bubble gum and then you have wintergreen mmm change what you chew blue club news is only natural plastic free gum base and natural colours flavours and sweetener it's like any other gum now I'm resisting actually trying to chew this right now because I want to chew Erica yeah but it's cool to see they have all kinds of different gum products all right and flavors okay we're almost there actually a little bit longer we just don't want to see lumps no lumps we don't want a lumpy gum yes okay we'll come back okay it's sticky look at that it's like little threads on my chopstick [Applause] [Applause] okay at least let me grab it for you there go ahead yeah mix it all around oh I think we're even closer now huh yes I'd say a few more minutes and I think we'll be right there that looks great huh yeah all right here yeah clean it off on the side there okay let's finish a little bit more of our story huh oh I bet you never knew that chewing gum came from trees nowadays both of chewy go me buying stores is made from chemicals and made me petroleum byproducts not latex of any sort that means that there's less work for people like Eduardo in the rainforest chicle a gives texture to the anti-choice I'm likely gum making it sticky snappy and fun to chew I can fun to chew in the make your own chewing up kit you use similar sticky stuff natural rubber latex from rubber trees like Sapodilla trees rubber trees grow wild in the rain forest they also grown on farms rubber trees can be tapped more often than Sapodilla trees and the less time to heal we call Chiclets and natural rubber latex non-timber forest products that means that they come from trees in the forest but you don't have to chop down the trees to get them maple syrup is another sweet and sticky example non-timber Forest Products give chicle arrows and farmers more reason to protect trees oh I got one more sentence where we add they also help to conserve special regions like the ring force Cheers of them and now let's make and chew some yummy natural dough all right so we're at the point now when we've softened the corn syrup prepare the kneading surface okay so we are close and then melt of the gum base yeah we actually held off on step two because we're gonna move this out of the way then prepare the surface and for using a stove do that and then mix cut the end of the pouch and squeeze the corn syrup into the gum base so we're gonna clean up here now this looks pretty good give it one more mix yeah I think we're ready okay all right so we're gonna come back now and do the next step all right at least this is our low off to the side now this is actually step two cut the bag and pour half of it on to the tabletop don't keep it all right here because I got to bring in the other thing then okay okay keep going all right while you do that now I'm gonna bring the next tray and I will dry it it's all very hot that's probably about half now very good now get ready to mix we're going to now put in the corn syrup so melt the gum base mount the gum a blah blah blah blah all the way down cut the end of the pouch and squeeze the corn syrup into the gum base and I'll get ready take the tray and use my tool okay and I'm gonna pour this in and you start mixing okay okay it's really sticky so you're gonna have to work at it there you go go ahead start they've got a big batch coming out I'm gonna get you more but I'm gonna do it over here something squish it all out look at that last little bit yeah that's gonna be hard use those muscles okay okay that's the last of it very good all right so now I dress I was so sticky my fingers stuck you keep mix in there okay now you're gonna take that and put that on your powder okay right here I'll help you with that give me the other tool let's move this in now okay now you're gonna start the kneading process so it's a little warm you're gonna yeah you can use your chopstick here to scrape it off okay there you go get it in there and I'll keep bringing some in it's very sticky there you go is it hot it shouldn't be too hot okay just get powder on your fingers and then powder on the gum just like you're I guess making slime oh yeah keep going all right so that's why they don't want you to put this in your own container because this container itself is going to get thrown out all right scrape that off oh you're gonna get sticky don't worry about it oh geez yeah just keep going catch it a little bit more there you go okay just keep working that I'll see if I can get more out here but I'm not sure I can not without getting too sticky yeah they're cool down pretty quick though didn't it a little piece for you all right keep good sir okay keep working it okay I think I got it it's all yours keep mixing now okay so now you need to mold and knead like you're mixing dough how does it feel starting to feel like go I can't get this off of my finger here take that got it yeah I'm gonna feel it yeah nice yeah I didn't want to kind of keep working in the sugar cuz that's gonna help give it the flavor we need the sweetness yeah just kind of keep pressing that sugar in there keep going yeah yeah okay I think you're close just keep doing that let me take a look at it here I'll slide it a little closer to me okay so now what we want is we want this to be like a smooth pizza dough it's close I'm just gonna scoop a bunch in here we'll mix it in okay so now it's okay that we have some extra sugar on the countertop now we're going to cut this look at it it's like a it's like a dome you know how you go with the pizza dough we Pat it all right so we're gonna cut this in half now so take you let me use my scissors they're a little bit bigger and then get ready with the flavoring okay so you're gonna take the grapes I'm gonna take this one okay so add the contents of one of the flavor packets in each part so now you're gonna take your gum spread it out okay and then this here we're gonna have to add more of this so now pour your flavoring in there yep that says the whole package yeah you can smell it mmm yes and then I'm just gonna put the rest of this on the board and we're just gonna keep kneading until we get it to where we want it and keep adding and kneading okay that's getting kind of hard is it yeah so now everyone so I'll just pull a little sugar over to your side it's gonna get harder yes cuz gum its soft but it still has a texture to it that needs that all right here's our look at all your flavouring here so you want to get that all in there keep it flat on the table okay and then take it flattening when you flatten it put some in the middle yeah that's good and then fold it over there you go keep going like that yeah I just want to stick the whole chunk right in I get a lot of sugar in my give me a little more sugar there yeah so it says keep pulling it tugging it and needing it so you could pull it like you were doing it's getting harder and harder yeah it says it's worth the hard work so don't give up I won't make it this hot water right here okay so I think what we'll do everybody is we're just gonna keep doing this and then we'll come back we're ready to roll this out and cut it into shapes okay let me check yours yeah let me work here's a little bit working out the switch sides I will be right back okay so we have cleaned the original cutting board and we're now flattening out an area here let's do this I'm gonna cut a piece of mine and then I'll cut a piece of yours and set your main gum up there now you're gonna shape it and roll it to the shape you want so you know there's flat um there's a little Chiclets kind of gum so now take that okay and take your rolling pin and roll it out okay now if you want to add like a natural food coloring you can but this is uh gonna be a natural gum right when you get it to where you want it then take a pair of scissors and cut the shape you want I'm gonna cut like a stick you know what a stick gum is you see him stick gum like that okay so there's one piece now if you have to soften this up you can actually put in the microwave for like ten seconds that makes it nice and soft so you could work with it easier we cut another piece off so now I think I'm gonna make little Chiclets shapes yes that's a good idea I'm gonna take this like this and this like this and then I'm going to cut little gum pieces here I'll tell you what I'll move them to another board we have okay and then here's where's yours put them up here okay and you could just keep making cutting any shape you want they don't even have to be perfect shapes just anything that you feel is the shape you want touch another piece and you can roll it out now you can roll out well the whole thing if you want and then take different cutter you don't want to use scissors cut with a knife you can do that too look at that I'm gonna make one giant piece of gum imagine having that is your piece of gum you would love it cuz I know how much you love gum is it hard for you to press let me see maybe it's that tiny roller here yeah you got to really push on it cuz it's so small it's Q roller though okay I've tried the big look a little more weight behind it easier yeah Wow look at that I'm gonna make it a little one long strip like that major leagues chewing gum that they have out there that's in the pouch it strips like that and pieces well everybody they now see us cutting and shaping we can do this forever because there's a lot to do and then you can store it so let's do this we won't bore everybody with our gum technique here although I'm sure they're enjoying it I think it's time to eat some so let's clean up we'll save but as you can see it says it makes was it 40 pieces or so it really depends on the shape and the size okay are you ready to taste yes I will wash our hands and come right back all right Elise is ready to chew the go no it's gonna have a little bit different taste underlying taste and what you're used to okay all right so take whatever piece you want to try I'm gonna take two or three on my strip pieces now let's try to chew quietly so we don't offend anybody and get ready here we go I have cherry you have grape yes nice flavor it's a little stiffer yeah then some gums but nowhere near as soft is all the Japanese gums yeah reminds me of a bubblicious oh yeah now let's see the bubble not yet now yeah it's got to be chewed more hmm now it's getting softer for me what about you hmm I guess I want to try your flavor starting yeah all right I'm taking that one out I want to try your flavor here we go Oh three strips huh I like the cherry yeah now I'm gonna mix Mike cherry my grape but I'm out of the two I think I like the right more oh really cuz the one you all right we're done chewy are you actually yes all right there you go that is their Glee gum chewing gum kit I would say overall not that hard to do we did it on camera here which is a challenge because you got to stop you got to go you got adjust the camera so I think if you are in your kitchen you can set up your mixing area and you have a little more room to work but overall fun yes and I enjoy being with you today thank

out a fish chew bubblegum welcome to the first ever episode of the willit fish challenge we're trying bubblegum today let's go I just got here and I'm gonna try the watermelon one first but I don't want to chew it too much because I want it to still have flavor for the fishies all right I don't think one piece is gonna do it the trick is you need it to be soft enough to have the proper action but you don't want to over chew it and get rid of all the flavor that should do it let's rig up now the first thing I'm going to try is this little net rig head here and I'm just simply gonna do like a little jig head shaky head nedra dig style bait and I'm fishing these local public gravel pits and I have never fished them before so I guess we'll see if they like chewing gum here all right we're just gonna thread that in there just like we're doing it with a worm we're gonna taper that uh this is disgusting oh yeah this is like gonna be sweet this is gonna good action look at that that's gonna kill her action and it's nice and fruity the action is garbage that gum just hardened right up and it has like no action this might not be as easy as I was hoping it would be that's okay it's a little bit more twitching we'll make it do a lot more side-to-side motion I'm imagining oh no not at all this is like the worst action I've ever seen you never know though you never know flip it around cover Vasil eat it as long as I present it in front their face all right let's keep moving I think I can catch a fish but I'm not a hundred percent confident that I will but I think I can't I guess we'll find out [Music] not even a nibble yet I just want to see a fish to make any more confident okay guys this is starting to look very bad I'm very concerned with this challenge oh goodness you know a piece of gum how many pieces of gum am i gotta chew today this is ridiculous I just got to do something really simple very Ned rigged esque small all right the time is near it's time to catch a fish guys all right it's a little more calm here I have a lot higher hopes for this area I don't really know why because the gum looks like trash down there but I believe I believe I've been fishing for probably an hour at least the waters really murky I can't tell how deep it is it seems like it's just a silty bottom I don't feel very much Rock I just kind of bumming me out I need to find a better area is the moral of the story oh my gosh I got one no no I didn't land him oh shoot that doesn't count that does not count guys I thought that was a snag I was so confused well the good news is I got a bite the bad news is I missed it you have got to be kidding me guys what the heck okay well I just proved that bass do chew bubblegum but I need to make them chew it just a little bit harder because I missed that fish it's go time boys I am a confident as ever quick update for you folks I don't think that fish like gum but I'm gonna keep trying anyways so let's do that okay there's little manners up here maybe this little piece of gum will look like a little minner and a large knife will come slurp it something tells me this little hole right here will have a fish poop on this one holy cow oh my gosh dude one rock did holy Sh dang it he swerved it dude I'm gonna catch a fish guys I have no energy I'm sure this video has been pretty lame to this point hopefully let's give it a little bit more exciting with a fish catch oh yeah yeah I just want to catch up fish I just want to catch a fish this should get interesting I love attempting to do this I don't like doing at the

wall I'm very news the texture setup doesn't work I also have no best before date now yeah but oh it's still licorice I should happy it's kind of nasty em see the licorice inside my mouth I think these are over the best before date and the shop dude sent musings you know I don't know because of the small packaging says know best before that he is a green bird green big bird anyways there's even more here on the scan of the solar also don't have a best before they simply forget to put it on but I still can show it anyways so yellow bird is pineapple soda and it tastes kinda good I just described here the taste how I experienced a while ago and jet assault light white taste and red bird Sam Scott tropical it's it's light wet or it's a pink soda actually if you think about it okay so what's left I can still open all of this Mexican a bubble gum here eyes must be tattoo but it rips apart maybe I'm opening it wrong wrong technique okay anyways there's still stuff to come here is a Christmas fruit gum okay this I could do this review forever there's so much Angry Birds oh here we go it's tastier here all over Mexico no it's not surprise for me use a normally it was made in

you soon - watching", "iqredzIQ0UM": "hello and g'day welcome to another one of my chewing gum videos and today I'm going to show you some starburst joint gum so I've got starburst Freddie burst and starburst fruity sours both in chewing gum now first things first I've come off fairly easily and there's a little tick box back here no hand up my finger in the palette so I'll place that in my mouth I am they are 31st has three different flavors original strawberry and so there's up or out some of the pellets do this hotel this is a tail on a table so that's a nice girl in town a lot of people think it's carpet but it's actually a town so yeah I'll see if I can apparatus be more be more of the yellow original flavors it's a 40 bases in every packet and they are sugar-free I now the interesting thing about these join them is they made by Wrigley's not sure we can say there but it says the retail company just say weeklies on the front and they're actually made in made in Russia it says it this I mean okay are there again there's Anza riding there it says Made in Russia for the weekly company approached amended Michigan Avenue Escalus New South Wales to zero seven seven is the postcode and also it's also for the company in New Zealand in their building fourteen six six six great South Road and Penrose Auckland in New Zealand so yeah this is sort of interesting these months because they made in Russia as well yes they made in the Wrigley Factory in Russia just to be sold in Australia and New Zealand nutrition label all part of the packaging it's not as an afterthought on some of the other dams I've shown you they do the right thing sliding think of twice telling you to put the empty packet and probably the gum as well in the starburst base sorbitol mannitol soy and sweetness as well starburst 30 bursts and nice like that original one it's got a bit of a lemony taste that original there's obviously up with the fibers strawberry apple an original which is you know it's got that sort of lemony now I better show you they gather back which of the fruity sours off the top it's coming up surprisingly chewing gum ballots on the Elena town on the table the balance might be better in that in the shot that's pretty good now these are pretty sours and we drop it off either wild cherry and dry those soon and this is the same deal it's made in Russia just for a sale in Australia and New Zealand and all the writing there is in English it's kinda similar I thought it was kind of similar to the Orient fresh chewing gum that I found that I showed you on on a video where it was made in Turkey but I think I made in the comments the fact that an IV from Jackie and I had never seen it then I think it was salt it was for export it was Manny for export and the English German Arabic might be listed to be sold around the Middle East and into Europe I suppose what I'm going to do now is I'm going to try some of these towers I'll do them in the same order as I did before the green Thurston punch this time the green is actually a lemon line rainbows apple green here is lemon mine have a screen now I've tried the the wild cherry flavor mr. joy better not survive like this here then I'll try the yellow which is the tropical driver just try to work out what flavor that might be it might be pineapple maybe it's got a few things a lot ain't goin yeah well I think I just like to add is it's actually a special factory Wrigley's factory in st. Petersburg in Russia and in 2016 Wrigley's spent 10 million u.s. dollars modernizing the factory and I think the mind I'm of that factory was to purchase camera for the Russians they were selling Stoppers all making star first Australia and New Zealand that the the Russian factory was mighty juicy fruit' minis I think they're in a similar sort of back into this they come in three different flavors I think with similar sort of size billets 40 bases in a back and finite people in the comment section often comments about how they learn things from my video as well things from my video as well as yeah enjoying and also actually went to a trivia night I think was back in December and there was a couple questions I don't need the answers because I had mentioned them in one of my videos so I thought that was pretty cool and there were questions that no one else in the group knew the answers to and they were it was there was a question about daylight savings in Germany I know what was the count the question was actually what was the first country to introduce daylight savings and it was Germany where is the salmon join these actually bought this starburst from the same shop that I bought the Orion fresh chewing gum and the penguin chocolate biscuits I think I've found covered everything I wanted to say about these stop us join us join us that was a pretty best and the Freddy Salas this is more of a yeah Sheree diced this area tastes still very nice and mighty in Russia both made in Russia all the English and Australia and New Zealand we've got a the yellow is original the green apple and the brownie sort already brown is strawberry and in the fruits ours then you've got lemon-lime flavor for the rain yellow is probable and the ready Brown is the wild cherry flavor and dimension stop this all right usually thanks or chewy chips but these ones are actually so I think everything I've talked about the fruity bastard with the 30 sours all the three different flavors and the three same colors but three different flavors as well pretty birth to pretty Samus and covered that they made in Russia and sold in Australia I'll finish up now I hope you've enjoyed this video I found it relaxing thanks for watching and good bye for now", "YIITbR_EsJk": "alright this is going to be a review of the sour patch watermelon gum bosch dried I don't know very much to say about it

day and will hold a contest to decide who can chew more gum except that it's hard to shut our mouths at this point this is a real test for our tea [Music] breaking news Dali has a new accessory it's a gum holder with teeth attached strips of foam core around the perimeter of a colored cardboard rectangle trace a silhouette of gums with hollows for teeth on pink foam paper following a template cut it out [Music] glue the piece to the foam core frame cover the sides of the box with strips of the foam paper attach a strip of foam paper to another cardboard rectangle and attach the cap to the box decorate it with a lip shaped sticker put in pellets of chewing gum to look like teeth open your mouth wide and I'll remove the front bubblegum what a creative design but that's not all yet how about we play gum darts attach the target and shoot the gum using straws aim and fire the bubblegum quickly reaches the target but hitting a bull's eye is pretty difficult blondie is winning right now she's so close to victory we shoot playing until there aren't any teeth left [Music] blondie is sad try this chewy candy I made it myself cover gelatin with coca-cola and let it soak beat an egg white with a whisk to make foam pour the rest of the coke into a cup of sugar cook it for five minutes stirring melt the gelatin in a microwave and mix it with the sugar syrup pour the liquid mixture into the egg foam and stir it thoroughly cover a flat plate with parchment paper and pour out the mixture let it set cut the heart and jelly into strips to be candies make apple juice flavor chewy candies the same way are these jelly sticks these are chewy candies with coca-cola and apple juice flavor mmm the flavor is so weird did you really cook them yourself not bad blondie is inspired by her friends cooking achievements she will make some unique gum to thoroughly need a chewing gum base add honey and some strawberry topping mix all the ingredients by kneading it with your hands add a little cornstarch so the gum doesn't stick divide the mass into parts and add different food coloring shaped balls I present the dish of the day it's some creative gum with honey and strawberry made by an old family recipe hmm it's so juicy and it smells nice now let's decide which gum is better both are very tasty it's a tie more bubble less trouble we're starting a gum lottery who will get a bubble gum with the weirdest flavor put wasabi into soft green gum knead it and roll a ball microwave wait gum for 30 seconds so it's soft add a pinch of salt knead it and roll a ball add ground ginger to microwave yellow gum mix it and shape a ball add chili powder to pink gum place the colored balls onto a plate [Music] what is it it's so hot it's wasabi hurry up chase it with water oh my tongue is burning this gum is very refreshing the next lock is a yellow bubble gum with ginger not bad it tastes spicy like you're eating ginger bread blowing bubbles out of these flavors is very weird now let's try out the white and the red ones chew oh my goodness it's so gross this is salt and I got pepper oh I can't do this blondie wins a super prize it's a gumball machine come on tell me how it works hot glue a big round button shaped bead to a flower pot it'll be the stand for the machine coat it with a few layers of acrylic paint pot glue a ball-shaped cap to a plastic lid color it with acrylic paint to match the base turnover the flowerpot and attach a ball-shaped glass base to it fill the base with colorful gumballs close it with the lid how does it work should I press the button or turn it over shake it maybe it's broken no just open the lid and take out whichever gumball you like it's not that complicated and now let's have some fun who will blow the biggest bubble let's test our powers blow harder wow this bubble is huge blondie wins we will put her bubble gum into the Guinness Book of chewing records we turn bubble gum mastery into culinary art just take a look at these sculptures they are completely made out of chewing gum need a few Bubblegum's in your hands like modeling clay put the mess into a cupcake mold press it to the walls make a hollow in the center

one of my tools video and today today i'm looking at a milwaukee 2 a precision hot tool first things first i'll ever take a piece of uh or pop out a piece of pk chewing gum and take the white pellet and pop that in my mouth now this video sort of leads on a little bit from the makita power tools video because um i had a number of comments from people saying have you ever tried milwaukee power power tools and um i thought to myself i haven't even heard of milwaukee power tools and and then i was having a clean up in the last few weeks i looked through this cupboard and i found this milwaukee precision lock tool in the cupboard and and um i don't recall ever ever buying this or ever having it so i thought it might be interesting to um to have a look at this milwaukee precision tool now i can put it like that that's okay here i've got my camera stand right sort of there in the middle which is sort of stopping me from putting this uh center in this but anyway so i need to give a shout out to andy andy warmington you asked me to do a um another power tool video and although this may not be the sort of power tool that he was thinking about and also um arizona ace who liked the uh my power tool videos and also rudy r barrow paris and real jerome now this precision knot tool you can use it to remove paint from outer edge areas form plastic re-milled adhesive shrink chipping affix embossing powder and drying and more and it's a versatile tool for home shop and hobby projects and there we go so it's sort of a craft thing more of a craft tool a fix embossing powder re-melting adhesives and shrink tubing heat shrink adapter sold separately and there it's um distributed by wagner australia proprietary limited so i might open up the box so it's kind of like an unboxing video except except that it's already opened many times in the past here are the milwaukee precisionled tool owners manual model one four five zero put the heat on tough jobs with milwaukee the leader in heat tools for over 30 years and there's some instructions instructions there in that tool but like i like most people never read the instructions well and you read the instructions when you can't when all else fails that's right that's the saying when all else fails read the instructions so when you try some everything else and you still can't get it to work then it's time to read the instructions carefully do that it's got the it's got the australian plug on it the active and neutral i think what was it again active on that side and you draw on that side perhaps if i can see any numbers there but oh sorry letters but i i know i know you're not going to see any so but no worth this time and um there's the cord coming off so it goes on one two three four five six to take the cord off and there's a little sort of a stand there a little sort of a stand to stand it up on and there's your on and off switch there like that and 240 volts which is the power in australia milwaukee mht products inc model 1450 tool made in china for indoor use only 50 to 60 hertz 360 watts and 1.5 amps for indoor use yeah so i still haven't used this one but um i thought well i might as well show it as a video it may not be a particularly long one there was some writing there to read the milwaukee precision odd tool is a versatile inline design tool for home shop and hobby projects great for trial graphs too it's powerful heat flow helps simplify many tough jobs or tedious tasks lightweight yet durable it offers the milwaukee tradition of the dual quality and i output in a compact design now speaking about milwaukee so a little bit of the history of milwaukee tools roughly sea from milwaukee in the united states and in 1918 they introduced a five pound capacity drill this was the milwaukee tool company and in 1924 the milwaukee tour company had some problems and it was brought out by albert seibert and they became the milwaukee electric tour company after albert seibert purchased the company and then in the 1930s they developed their own sanders polishes electric hammers and hand grinders and they're all they're all electric tools electric sanders and electric polishes and they were in the 1930s producing all the tools for the uh for the us navy so they got that big contract and they sort of didn't look back but uh in 1975 they were sold to amsterdam in 1986 merrill lynch brought it from amsterdam for milwaukee electric tour company from amsterdam 1995 atlas copco bought it from merrill lynch and in 2005 tektronik industries important milwaukee electric tool company from dog operations right from atlas copco and tectonic industries is a um is a chinese owned company and they also own brands like aeg ryaby hoover dirt devil and vax so i've heard of um aeg ryaby hoover and vax but i haven't heard of dirt devil i've obviously seen those brands other brands in australia but i haven't seen dirt devil and until a few weeks ago i hadn't seen milwaukee either in australia but um from the comments from the comments here people thought that um milwaukee was am a good reliable brand of tool brand so i'm not sure if there's anything else to tell you about that one it comes complete with built-in bracket for self-supported benchtop use tape and nozzle focuses airflow for precision heating which is where conventional heat tools guard i was actually um it actually would have come in handy when i was uh i was doing this table if i can just lift back these rugs this table was um all covered in white paint and i got it and i decided to take the paint off and i re-varnish it i had a bit of trouble getting a lot of the paint off but if i if i knew i had this tool then maybe i could have um used that to take the paint off and um now one thing i haven't pointed out in any of my recent videos is that these are actually floor mats you can see that's a rubber back to the floor mat i actually put down four of them now so let's save some any if i'm dropping things you don't get that kind of clanging sound on the table that i'd have to um that i have to edit out but um yeah so i've put those formats down i've got different colors i've got this sort of gray and i've got that um sort of a dark red i've got a blue and that's sort of green and then under that is a table this is a new wooden table so i've sort of got a new setup over the last few months i've got a new set up basically the same sort of setup but really on a different table i suppose but anyway i've sort of digressed then from the main topic of this video which is this milwaukee precision tool so maybe i should do it like that would be a better way to show it actually yeah that's the way i should have done it i will maybe next time these videos are all just one take edit out the things that um the bumps and burps and stuff but uh yeah you gotta learn how you go along unless you go along i suppose so i think i've told you everything that i was planning to tell you about the milwaukee tour company um i've shown you the only milk pocket tool that i have i'll have to have a look next time i'm in bunnings to see if they do have any milwaukee tools there i don't remember seeing any but that doesn't mean much and uh yeah it's all about the a little bit of the history of the milwaukee electric talk operation gave a few shout outs due to bit of bk chewing gum and um that's about it so i'll sign off now and say i hope you've enjoyed this video i hope you found it relaxing thanks for watching and goodbye for now", "KNwaO858CSo":

arms family homestead in a couple of weeks a couple of weeks hmm now a couple of weeks ago I posted a video out here in the high tunnel about moles I've struggled with moles for a long time I've tried a lot of different things to get rid of them and I stumbled across the video and then I did some research on something I read some articles that said if you use juicy fruit gum if you stick juicy fruit gum down in a mole trail they'll eat it and they will die it's it literally legitimately said you could get rid of moles with juicy fruit gum well I had to try it because that's just a very cheap test I mean how can you go wrong if it doesn't work it doesn't work so basically all I did was come here I showed that video I had moles all in my raised beds here in the high tunnel they were destroying everything so I went along and poked some holes in the little mole trails because you could see them everywhere and put a half a stick of juicy fruit gum in there of course I got a lot of people said well I can't wait to see if that juicy fruit sprouts what kind of trees that gonna grow but well so it's been 2 or 3 weeks whatever it's been now I'm not exactly sure your switch arms getting tired and everyone's been asking I've had a ton of comments lately asking about the juicy fruit experiment well I can't say for certain because moles live underground it's hard to know for sure but I will say this after I put the juicy fruit gum in all the holes in the raised beds the moles have disappeared I'm not gonna say 100% I've not seen any signs of moles at all but they were destroying everything my beets were getting just eaten off under the ground the beet would be completely gone my spinach in the bed over there they were eating all the roots up from under just pretty much everything was getting destroyed by the moles since they used the juicy fruit gum the mole activity has dramatically decreased I would say by about 90% now one thing I also took it a couple steps farther and I'll show you what I did because I talked to another you tuber here in Oklahoma named okie Rob but he's got mountains of gardening knowledge and gardening wisdom compared to me and Rob said hey you may have because I said the moles are eating my crops they're eating the root crops and things in in Rob and a lot of other people said moles are vegetarians they're only eating the worms and the grubs you might have voles following along using the same trails so I thought well if it's it could be voles it could be brats it could be mice it could be a lot of things so I took it one step farther and I bought some of these mouse trap they're just blue traps and I put a little bit of peanut butter on it and I stuck those under you know just kind of out in the raised bed in and amongst the crops thinking okay so if the moles are going underground and then the voles are kind of tunnel along because you could see the tunnels if they're sneaking around through here voles mice maybe I'll catch one on a glue trap so I've got glue traps on two different raised beds zero voles mice or rats have been caught nothing I haven't caught anything on the glue traps and I've used the glue traps from mice in the past a ton and they've always worked great and then I went one step farther because most of the mole activities in the raised beds so either in this raised bed or some of these on the other side but she would get these mole trails that would go in between so there's a little bit grass in here don't dog me for that but you would see you know they'd come along at night and dig a furrow underground but it would push up a little mound you could see where they were at so to combat that I thought well let's get some traps so I bought some really nasty medieval-looking mole traps on line these things are these are bad mammer jammers watch this thing set this down here so the concept here with this mole trap I'm not gonna put my finger up and push that pressure plate up but the moles come along underneath and you you put this on either side of their tunnel so as they're burrowing through they're constantly pushing dirt up so the theory is as that mole comes along he's going to push dirt and cause BAM being paled by that little trap so you just put these along their trails well I've been moving these around the high tunnel because there's been a couple a couple trails here and there that I found and so far I've yet to even snap a track that's not to say the moles didn't go past them that's possible but when you push that down in the ground it forces them to go under it and it's going to push some dirt up so I think if they were using those trails very much we would have caught at least one so I mean I know I know it's hard to believe I know it's not something that sounds legit but I really do think that the juicy fruit I'm not gonna say it's killed every mole in my garden I think the juicy fruit gum is working I think it has reduced the mole population at least down to a manageable level because I don't mind sharing my crops the problem runs when they don't share with me I'm gonna open the door cuz it's getting a little warm in here the problem comes when they don't share my crops with me that gets a little frustrating so I don't know try it here's the thing guys I had a lot of people say don't do that don't do that that won't work yoy still okay so a pack of juicy fruit gum is 35 cents try it if you've got moles try it if it doesn't work huh it doesn't work now one disclaimer a lot of people said make sure your dog's can't get to it because the gums not good for your dog it can kill your dog also well here's the thing mine are in my raised beds in my high tunnel the dogs don't come in here unless they're supervised with me I don't trust them in here and then it's buried in the ground so they're gonna have to dig it up they're not gonna get to the juicy fruit gum here but if it was in your yard like if I was gonna use it out here that might be a problem I'm a shy away from that so I can't say test results 100% conclusive because moles are underground and you can't see them but I'm not seeing their signs anymore hardly at all I think it worked try for yourself and let me know [Music] so then the next thing I want to address while we're out here has to do with the self wicking tubs that I built the other day I posted a video about that if you missed it go check it out these things work great I'm gonna get them all planted out really soon but I got hammered with questions I got hammered and hammered and hammered with questions the number one question being where in the world did you get those tubs these big tubs well they're nothing but a molasses tub if you live in the country or anywhere near the country this time of year farmers all through the winter farmers cattle ranchers horse farms whatever it is feed molasses protein mix in those so the tub comes filled I feed them to my to my goats but they're much smaller tub they come filled with that molasses mix it's a high-protein mix to supplement feed your cattle and horses so if you have any ranchers in your area contact them first because if you were going to go out and buy a container for gardening this size it would probably cost you thirty to fifty dollars or more maybe a little bit more decorative than this but it would cost you a lot of money so everybody want to know how big these are uh-huh I would guess probably twenty-five or thirty gallons maybe forty but I doubt it they're pretty they're pretty big but you don't have to use those I've seen Leon build the same exact concept with a five-gallon bucket so you could grow one pepper plant or one tomato plant in a five-gallon bucket using this same design now in the bottom of it you would probably just take like a six inch pot that you would get from like a garden center or something turn it upside down put a little landscape cloth over it and you're good to go so where can you get these tubs if you're anywhere in central South South Central Oklahoma North Texas Leon's got them by the hundreds he'll sell them to you but get in contact with some cattle farmers or horse ranches or something in your area they'll be more than happy to get rid of them because they're trash to those guys they feed them once and then they throw them away and then I also had a couple people asking about the corrugated pipe that goes in the bottom where you get that you should be able to get this anywhere that you could buy French drain material so if you Lowe's or Home Depot a lot of times we'll sell stuff for a French drain that'll work and it doesn't have to have holes in it the holes that are along the lines of this not these holes but the holes that are can you see them those aren't important all that's important is you have a hollow space that you can hold the air cavity in there that way your your when your water fills up you drill a hole in the bottom of your pipe the water is only going to fill up I'm gonna do this with one hand but water is only gonna fill up to about this level and that's gonna leave air space in there so don't get too stuck on that specific material the next thing was the landscape fabric the ground cover this stuff I told people not to go to Walmart and or whatever store don't have to be Walmart I'm not dog in Walmart but don't just go by the homeowner grade ground mulch because it won't last very long they said working you buy commercial ground cover or landscape fabric and that's kind of a tough one I'm not really sure where all you can buy that I would think online you could just search for commercial ground cover commercial landscape fabric should be able to buy it online I apologize I kind of slipped on that one because I have easy access to Leon and Leon sells it by the roll so I've got easy access to that yeah I've got one more thing I want to show you before in this video I know it's just kind of random ramblings trying to answer some questions help you guys out because I get a ton of questions and it's hard to respond one to each and every one of them so sometimes when I have a question that gets asked repetitively I'll just address it in a video because guys I promise you I try my best to keep up with all the comments on my channel but with the way it's been growing lately March you guys are awesome March was a record a record month by far you could probably combine any two months together and it wouldn't meet what March did in pretty much every category we had 1.7 million views in March record by far so I honestly I'm not ignoring people in the comment section I just can't cannot physically get to all of them anyways wouldn't do a little mail call because I got a package in the mail that I think you guys would really enjoy you guys this is this is cool so it came from another YouTube channel here in Oklahoma that I've kind of helped out a little bit over time they're trying to get up and going very small Channel still very small their channels called blackberry Ridge and he said my first thing he sent was a t-shirt which if you don't if you're not a fan of their channel you may not be interested in a t-shirt but cool little logo on their t-shirt that's not the main thing though that's not that's not what I'm excited about he sent me a little note the it's blackberry reads the guy's name is Josh go check out his channel if you're interested give him a subscribe like I said they're brand new to YouTube just getting started just trying to get this whole game figured out but he said hey hey Daniel this our thanks for answering my annoying YouTube questions I hope you like the jerky I have not had it myself I hope it's not terrible hopefully you can collaborate or hopefully we can collaborate on something in the future maybe even include Dutch if he'll quit the Instagram stuff on YouTube instigating stuff on YouTube I can't read I struggle anyways talk to you

believe me on the the juicy fruit gum killing the moles thing try it out for yourself what do you have to lose it's not worth fighting over it's not worth arguing over and it may not work forever but for some reason the moles have disappeared in my raised beds and I'm satisfied with that so guys thanks for watching hope you enjoyed it y'all have a great day and as always we'll see you in the next video you", "G5nu4KdmjSU": "do this too here you do it why just need it in okay but to do it over this so it doesn't go everywhere you feel let's start to get drier and more like gum consistency delicious what what what that's my ice cream this is this is not ice cream oh it's the squishy YouTube what's up guys we are turbo toys hi my name is Andy and this is my son and we do toy videos and today it's not really a toy okay it's more like a fun activity or candy okay yeah it's it is bubblegum factory's kit to make your own gamma you mean green I don't know okay so what we're gonna do we're gonna take this box over the table we're gonna show you guys it get everything out and try to figure out how to make her own gum yeah this would be fun are you ready but take the boxer and you guys come along with me and let's get this video started and a dad's face right behind it it's my beard here's the box it is by scientific Explorer we actually got this at a Children's Museum in another state wha so I look it up online if this is something that interests you this is bubblegum factory it is making double bomb next we called double bomb that's fun to say yeah all right so yeah ask little pictures of kids making their own bubble gum it says make fruity sour or minty gum which one do you want to make that's how I know you're my son boom pretty sounds good I like minty gum but fruity and sour are way more fun I think well I just I just grabbed that I like you did you I'm minke well make them all well yet we'll make something it says learn the science behind gum that it has all the ingredients listed it says our delicious fish leaf flavored watermelon mint and blueberry gum and since this is food it has the nutrition facts on the side the back of the box is the exact same thing but written in french they made this just so they can ship it to France thank you ship it to any english-speaking country in the world this is very common for companies to do this but it's the butter we don't get it back of the box like the female picture I would do but it's okay it's it it's just a box the real good stuff is inside but here's the top there's the side while you know the side and then we get the barcode which was this it's $25 you don't even need a bob good I know there's a barcode over the barcode okay so yeah it's 25 bucks I dare say if you looked up online you might be able to find a cheaper version of a bubblegum making kit but I absolutely don't mind supporting children museums so I'm not upset we spent $25 for this oh let's get it out we normally donate up stuff but this is definitely not something we're gonna be doing there's the gum it looks like fish it looks like the bottom of a fish tank doesn't it that's gonna be the gum I bet you can't what do you just get me pink this is a very straightforward kit all right so dude it's gonna go everywhere be careful all right first thing we've learned for this video is do not attack gamma okay don't punch it don't smack it don't high-five at nothing barely you got three more pokes 1 2 3 you did four okay I just want to take a second that here's write-ins nerf fortress that you still have not cleaned up and then who's underneath it cats they're like hey the dog can't fit down here we're pretty psyched peg what looks like lying on a beach okay so all this stuff really isn't that flashy and colorful and fun but it doesn't matter this packet says mint flavor this says blueberry flavor citric acid which is used in all gums that might sound weird and scary it's not watermelon flavor and then corn syrup I don't know yeah there's no malic acid sour stuff and there's confectioner's sugar whatever that is oh it looks like powdered sugar that's probably what it is mom just verified that I was correct in that assumption look the instructions come in a bag I thought there's more stuff a little random pieces of paper to make a postcard I don't know maybe put the gum on you the box was alright but it was it didn't have a lot going on and then this stuff is really plain but that's not gonna stop us having a blast making gum right taste it and then we might watch polka mama it's nice outside yeah you should chew your gum outside I heard something here's the weirdness it's not like a bird was inside I'm gonna try to get okay this is a raptor this is a dining I guess now it's a toy how the toy make the noise you have to spoil it for him did you at least one person out there thought there was a dinosaur in the instructions no dinosaurs included I'm just being a cheesy dad I'm gonna read this and learn how to make some gum TV just there's a bunch of facts in here we're gonna need a tablespoon measure teaspoon heath a half a teaspoon ask mom for tablespoons and teaspoons and she'll know I'm talking about containers like with with tops on so I read it up and I know how we're gonna do it one you need a microwave safe Bowl a teaspoon 1/2 teaspoon in a tablespoon measuring spoon juicy watermelon is gonna be a first gum that we make a tablespoon of gum base here's our gum base all right now we actually have to leave the play room which we don't usually do in turbo Troy ten videos we're gonna have to go downstairs and we're gonna need our corn syrup our powdered sugar and our watermelon flavor are you ready yeah let's go to the microwave all right so here's our microwave we're gonna need to cover this up with water okay all right that should be enough put it in here and you only do 15 to 20 seconds so let's do 18 okay close it type it 18 start we did make a gun kid very dancing to the come dance dududududu dudududududu gum do turn to go to tune dude bubble gum bubble gum alright so we get this out alright now we're gonna have to drain the water out of here okay and now we need to stir this until it's smooth okay so we're gonna use a butter knife to do this it's not sharp but always be careful with any sort of knife or pointy object right yeah so it's not soft at all all right we got to keep it do we got to do it again this is 15 to 20 seconds and this isn't remotely soft enough you can squish them so what you do is you just put water back over it and microwave it for about five to ten seconds let's try that we did it for 30 more seconds okay I'm gonna use a plastic spoon this time this is what they say let's see if we can get it well it's definitely squishing better mix it up squish it all together that looks like fungi yes it does okay so now we're gonna add the corn syrup all right so here's our corn sope we're gonna be very careful with this because it's be a sticky mess it's just stuck in the spoon get it out of there and into there oh stop alright so now we got to stir that in there okay you know it is it hard go there you go just serve as much as you can if we have to microwave it just soften it up that's fine next up is the watermelon flavor and smell how good that smells it smells so good alright yeah so we're gonna put a little or hopefully not spill this everywhere there we go and next we need powdered sugar now we add the cottage cheese don't know with powdered sugar confectioner's powder at ism all right so all our stuff is in there do you have any idea how gross cottage cheese would be in gum yeah I'm gonna put cottage cheese in your gum next time no now we just stir it okay now I got the mixing done now we're basically gonna use our hands so if you do this make sure you wash your hands because if your maid touching which ultimately goes in your mouth and it's still a little warm we might have to wait you're supposed to let it cool five minutes and I added some powdered sugar which will hopefully make it a little better so basically we need to just cut it up need it okay not need is in like I need a shirt because it's cold outside but needing it isn't newsing with our hands we need food Co and that's what we need you want to guys mom we have food glory yeah any color blue okay I'm gonna cut this in half so now there are two pieces of gum be very careful with food coloring good color stuff okay if you put this on your hair your hair would turn blue yeah I'm just gonna put some dots on there and I'm gonna need it in that is our very first watermelon bubblegum we're gonna let it cool down and we're not gonna we're gonna eat ours at the same time make this one pink so it's oh you know what I should go wash my hands making them not blue look at this my hands are still Oh still pretty blue but I'll really scrub map this they're about to be really pink let's get some dots this is gonna look so red it looks so red it's gonna be big I love a cute baby it does look a little weird do this too here you do it just need it in okay hey what it do it over this so it doesn't go everywhere you feel let's start to get drier and more like gum consistency yeah Chum if our verse go bum alright so the pink is mine and the blue is yours you ready to taste this hopefully it tastes good you ready I can eat it all three two Cheers it tastes delicious hey no no don't swallow gum no you know what this took so long that we we don't have time to experiment with all the flavors but this is something where we can donate because we've used it so we've got another kitten donate it and we would keep these and experiment with our own right there's a lot of gum I can't believe that little bit made this much just so delicious dude I'm washing my hands and this is like the prettiest it's like purple soap this is the prettiest hand watching this ever happened I'm gonna get you look at my hands they're like they are stained so if you get the food coloring make sure you're very careful with it maybe use latex gloves but I thought this was more like a toy set where they came with instruments and stuff I didn't know they were just giving us the ingredients of letting us go at it I might not have done this as a turbo toy time video if I'd known it wasn't actually a toy set no not at all and this pretty much was just like an informational video on how to how to make gum and we I didn't even follow the directions specifically how they said it I just kind of went at it but it worked out this is delicious and it tastes and feels just like normal gum it is a cool experiment so if you do this make sure you do with your parents because it can get very messy and then so you're gonna look like that if you use food coloring and don't use gloves but it is a really fun thing to do with your dad right or mom or brother big brothers sister it's a fun thing you're not talking at all I can't pick a live gum I have gum I'm just rudely chomping away and talking all right so I'm gonna go we do videos here all the time and they're mostly toy videos and games and stuff if you want

baking buddies I'm Jen John's welcome back to the channel a couple videos ago I showed you how to make homemade bubble gum and I wanted to do another recipe for you because that one was super popular and so many people watched it so what I've got today is a bubble gum themed cake it is flavored bubble gum the icing and the cake inside hiding in aside is circles for bubble gum representation then I've got bubbles and everything kind of round in pink and bubbly on the top my ho my bubble gums on the top and then it's a little bit off-center it's a little bit wacky it's hanging out here and then underneath I've got it sitting on a giant bowl full of big bubble gum balls it's a really fun cake and it tastes and smells delicious let's get started on this tutorial inside the cake we're going to have circles of color that pop out when you cut into it so I've got some prepared coloured cakes I have an orange cake and a green cake you could do as many colors as you want to and I just baked them in a round shape which will be easier to cut them to hide them inside the cake we're going to need tons of a bubblegum this one is the little tiny circles of bubblegum and then here I have a larger kind of bubblegum ball now I already have a tutorial up on the channel on how to make these edible gelatin bubbles and these are to look like you're blowing a bubble here and here I have my homemade bubble gum now the recipe for the bubble gum and the gelatin bubbles is in the eye in the corner so click on it when you're ready and here I have pink sprinkles and pink sugar candy the larger ones are bubble gum flavored and they taste delicious and here I have my bubble gum flavoring all you need to do with your bubble gum flavoring is replace a little bit of your vanilla with it you can do 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon it's super strong and super concentrated so you don't want to go 1 to 1 with vanilla you just want to substitute 1/4 or 1/2 of a teaspoon but of course you could put more if you want to so that's what I did here for my cake batter which my vanilla cake batter I just substituted about half a teaspoon of the vanilla of the butter of the bubblegum flavoring and then I did the same with these two different colors of pink icing I'll put a link in the description box for the buttercream and the cake batter recipes so we're going to be making two six inch round cakes and this is a six inch round cake pan here and I'm also going to be needing to repeat everything that I do twice with eight inch round cake pans here as well but I'm going to demonstrate how to get the circles in side your cake with this six inch round one so I'm just taking a knife into my pre baked cake here and I'm going to cut it into a wedge you want to make sure your wedge goes to the center like that and then with your knife heroes help that out there and then once you've got this out here when I'm doing the six inch round one I'm going to be going close to the center when I do the 8 inch round one I'm going to go farther out on the outside because your circle is wider and you don't need as much as that here so we're just cutting that out pop out that round circle and then just kind of like just kind of touch it back up just to get rid of any of those extra crumbs make it nice and clean and then take that over to your cake batter and I've got about 3/4 of a cup in the bottom of my pan here and I'm just placing that into my pen like that and I'm just going to repeat cut another wedge out and then cut out circles until I have the ring going completely around the inside of my cake here once you have all of the green wedges cut out what we're going to do now is take some extra cake batter and I'm you want to make sure that you cover the green additions in here completely because that's how you prevent any drawing out of your cake when you twice-baked it like this you don't have to worry about it drying out as long as you've got all the pieces covered so I'm gonna pop this into a preheated oven at 350 degrees and I'm going to bake it for about 45 to 60 minutes in this inch and sixty to seventy minutes in the 8 inch round pants once you have baked your cakes what you want to make sure you do is level them off these are my eight inch round ones and make sure that they're completely cooled before you go any further what I've got here is my dark pink buttercream and I'm just going to cover the top of the cake here with a layer of it probably gonna go about that far and then use my cake spatula to spread that around so you just want to get a little bit of a layer of buttercream in between your cakes once you've got the buttercream in between your two layers these layers remain quite thick because of that hidden circle inside so you won't have very much in between but of course you can put extra buttercream all over the cake if you prefer so I'm going to take my second layer here and then put it on top here press that down gently and then I'm going to cover the whole rest of the cake in this nice light pink buttercream and I'm going to repeat that for the six inch round cakes as well once we have our two cakes covered in our buttercream I'm going to insert into the bottom tier some supports now I'm using this these are actually Apple skewers that I use when I made my candy apples and I'm just using those for support because they're kind of like they're the perfect height almost and I'm putting the cake on this like off side here so what I'm doing is I want to support it completely so that when it does so it doesn't collapse into this bottom cake so I'm providing these ones here and I'm pushing that down I'm just using the back of another skewer there to cover that up so now I can take my 6-inch cake and I can pick it up and transfer it over here and I'm letting it hang a little ways off and I'm just going to have that like that just give it a little bit of element you're gonna have fine that it's a little bit unstable at this point so then you just want to take a large skewer and we're going to insert that through the entire six inch and then it's going to go through the cake board that it's sitting on there goes and it's gonna go down into that bottom cake below once we have the cake stacked and secured I'm going to take the little smaller gumballs of the two different kinds and what I'm going to do is just arrange them kind of like in a rainbow pattern and just go around the cake like that and so I'll just put these ones out to start and I'll show you like how to get the second layer because I'm going to go all the way up the side of the cake here so then to get the next layer of pink I'm gonna offset it in between the red and the pink and then the red in between the orange and the red ball there and just repeat that all the way up to the very top of the bottom tier once you have the bottom tier completely covered which is kind of a therapeutic experience we're moving up to the second tier and I'm only gonna go half way up this one so I'm not going all the way up this time I'm just going to go half way up once you've got all the small gumballs up here on this second tier what I've done is I'm going to put some of these bigger gumballs up there and I'm also going to clip some of my homemade bubble gum there as well you can put the little little teeny tiny ones too those ones look good up here whoops that guy's gonna run away on me you can put those ones up there like that and you can put the little teeny teeny teeny tiny ones too they'll sit in there nicely now if your butter cream has crusted in order to get your gumballs to stick a little bit better up the front here is you just have to dab like little fresh buttercream on spots where you want it so I'm going to be moving these gumballs up to the top so I just want that kind of illusion of the movement moving up here so I've got those stuck in there and then hopefully these ones I won't you need Buttercup buttercream for see if I can get them in there like that whoops I will need butter cream for those I thought they could be small enough that they would be able to hold without any buttercream but I was wrong so I'm gonna take my tweezers again there and pop that in there and so I'm just going to it's kind of space these smaller ones out throughout the larger ones here and get the teeny tiny ones that one does not want to come get the teeny tiny ones up there on here as well so the last part for decorating what I'm going to do is move up on to the top so I'm going to put some of the larger gumballs up here and also some of this regular-sized ones and the little mini ones as well and so I'm with chunks of homemade bubblegum put that up there too and then I'm going to be putting my gelatin bubbles up here at the top probably put two of them up here like that and so there's one more element of the cake design that I want to show you it's what the cake is going to sit on I'm going to show you that next and then I'm going to slice into the cake and I'm going to show you the finished product so the final element that I'm going to add to the cake the cake is going to sit on top of this fishbowl and I use this fishbowl in my finding Dory cake if you want to check that out - I made a jello aquarium using the same bowl and so what I've got here is the Jumbo bomb gumballs and I'm just going to fill up this fish bowl with them and then I'm gonna put the cake directly on top for a really cool so there you go baking buddies how to make a bubble gum a themed cake now this cake was a little bit crazy I hope you guys enjoyed learning how to make it the bubble gum flavor definitely adds a different taste to it it would be a super hit at kids birthday parties if you haven't subscribed to the channel already please make sure you do so and I will see you guys all again next time bye", "lgaMSsUbUJM": "what's going on guys welcome back to my channel its Bret maverick here I hope you all are having an awesome day so far so I make a lot of videos on ways to enhance your facial structure and in particular your jaw line and a big element that I preach is chewing and specifically chew a lot of gum but I have never actually done this on a super consistent basis I kind of do it sporadically here and there so I really wanted to put it to the test so I decided to chew a pack of gum every single day for a whole month my aim my goal is to find out if it uh enhances my jaw line if it has a significant impact if it has any side effects any danger to it so I'm gonna find out over the next 30 days so uh without further ado let's go get some gum all right we've got in the candy aisle got an array of gums to choose from how to make some choices next 30 days little bubblegum juicy fruit of course strawberry in there fire change it up all right so we've got some gum these each have three packs this one has eight actually thirty packs all together I'm gonna chew one of these every single day now I'm not sure how many pieces that is per hour or anything like that that's something that I'm just gonna have to figure out along the way but I'm definitely gonna keep you guys updated and update you probably once a week or something like that but first I'm gonna head to the other room and take some before footage just so we have something to compare the final results to so uh let's go do that [Music] [Music] all right what's up guys so with day 8 I'm a little over a weekend who's got cars driving by sorry about that but just thought I'd do a little update haven't had any problems really everything's going well it did hurt a little bit I'm like the second day but I feel like my dot is being more accustomed to the pressure that I'm putting on it and the work that I'm putting it through so just gonna keep going with it I do feel like I have why did my job it I do see some strength some gains and my master muscles on the side here maybe it's just a placebo though let me know what you guys think what do you think you think you told me but uh yeah it's gonna keep trucking along with this alright guys so it's officially been three weeks eating a pack of gum every single day and I gotta say I feel pretty good um my jaw hasn't really gotten tired lately I think I'm kind of getting immune to the chewiness of the gum I actually am kind of in a search for harder shoe here gum because it's I'm just so used to it and that is nothing now it's just second nature I found that this is the the best gum because it gets the hardest the quickest and yeah so I just been eating mad amounts of extra bubble gum and you can see I think you might be working a little bit but we'll check back in a week and compare the final results so back at it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] all right guys it's February 5th so it's officially been 30 days to a pack of gum every single day so I guess you're gonna spit that out now well yeah I just thought I'd give you a rundown on how we win and the side effects I ran into in the overall outcome of it if I recommend it or not so as far as side effects go everything was pretty smooth the first the first week it took me a little bit of time to get accustomed to the constant shooing I actually got pretty sore the first three days or so and got a little bit of pain actually up here in kind of my upper jaw area but that soon subsided after like my fourth day or something I actually did find out which comes we're best for chewing hard gum all day I really wanted to get the most out of it so I wanted the hardest gum and that was definitely not juicy fruit juicy fruit was the worst what I found to be the best was just this extra bubble gum it seems to get hard pretty quick and then it just continued to get harder pause the other gum that I tried was this extra experiment which was previously my favorite type of gum but they said tended to just be too intense you know when you have like five or six of these in your mouth at once just all that mint flavor hitting those vulnerable spots in your mouth I actually got like sores in my mouth so I couldn't really go ahead and with the extra gum I had to go buy a bunch of more bubble gum and then another thing is that towards the end of a week it was actually too easy chewing the gum I was putting more and more gum in my mouth at one point I had like 14 pieces of gum in my mouth because I just wanted to make it as much resistance as possible so I'm actually kind of looking for a harder gum that I can chew because it ended up being too easy but anyways the final outcome I think I did actually add a little bit of mass to the side of my jaw over and over here these masseter muscles it wasn't quite as dramatic as I expected it to be I expected a little more you know with going to my jaw but it's okay my theory is that I didn't give myself enough time to rest in between you know working your jaw just like any muscle you have to give it time to rest and recover so it can build back stronger and when I was just chewing and chewing and chewing constantly it's kind of like tearing down those muscle fibers not letting them grow back right but I'll let you guys be the judge of that tell me do you see any change in my jaw or change in my face at all you guys let me know in the comments below now one thing I should mention is I'm kind of hooked on gum now it feels weird if I'm not chewing gum so I actually had to have it get more gum so this is my gum supply for the next few weeks and again guys I am chewing only sugar-free gum so I don't think it's doing much damage to my teeth also it's not supremely unhealthy so yeah everyone that's it I hope you guys enjoyed the video I actually recommend shooting a lot of gum I do recommend it but probably not every single day if you guys have any other challenges you want me to tackle then let me know in the comments below let me know what you think about this one and the results if you haven't already subscribed turn post notifications on and until next time peace out [Music]", "Jo9XmqVw4LA": "and welcome to another review by genre in tonight's review we're going to take a look at another flavor by a company called envy vapors calm and they sent to me a juice called watermelon Bowl go now when you get your juices from anything vapor they'll send you a card that has their logo on it looks just like this says md vapors their shows a person beefing with a big juicy apple and that's the owner operators named joanne irwin and on the flip side it has their name with their email address MV info a MV vapors calm with their facebook and their web address wwmd vapors calm and a flavor that we're going to take a look at tonight is a watermelon bubblegum and this is what it looks like comes in 50 50 p gb g + 18 milligram as you can see the label says MV vapors calm and as logo big juicy apple and I've got it loaded in a fresh fu cartomizer which fu stands for First Union if anybody was wondering and I've got it clocked at 2.7 ohms and we're going to vape that at 6.5 wats so nothing left to do but to have a baby check out that flavor hmm pretty good it tastes just like just like we're chewing watermelon bubblegum it's very interesting because it just like watermelon and it does have that sensation like it's going you know because when you chew gum for so long it has that kind of gumminess sensation to it you know because gun has a certain like pliable taste to it you know and that's the taste that I'm getting right now so I'm going to give that I'm actually going to give that a 9 out of 10 that's pretty cool so let's check the throw hit very smooth that very fruity um very interesting it goes down he goes down very very mellow doesn't go down warm it doesn't go down cool that's the interesting thing about finding with these flavors from NV vapor is that uh they're they're not really eat they're not really too cool or not really too warm so it's very interesting to to to find a different type of juice company that isn't like most of these other Jews companies that have like cool and spicy your warm drapes and you know works like really harsh or or like super cold you know that sort of deal so this is this is very nice so um you know with a thrown in it's working well in conjunction with the taste so I'm going to give that a 9 out of 10 as well so let's check that vapor production you a very nice favorite production you know as I stated several times in my reviews you know a lot of reviewers will state that your favorite production depends upon your personal setup yes I agree with that but then I also think and and I know that this is true okay it also depends upon the VG content in the juice ambience that this is a 50-50 pdvd ratio you've got fifty percent VG so that helps increase the vapor production so there's going to be more VZ because of that so beings bees that you have to bear that in mind I'm going to give the baby production on this a nine out of ten as well so this I'm not saying is something that I could see being an all day vape which is really good it's rare to find those kind of juices so big shout out to MV vapors Thank You percent of me such great products i would highly recommend any of their juices so and once again that was watermelon bubblegum so i hope you enjoyed my review please subscribe to my youtube and as always happy vaping you", "TzkJGOSwa7s": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]

This blob of white stuff grabbed on to Nolik\nand won't let go of him! Oh... It's a piece of gum! It's my bubble gum. Thanks a lot, Tom Thomas! Now what's the plan to get me unstuck from here? Here's what we do! It's gotta be frozen. Once I sat on gum too\nand my mom put my pants in the freezer. The gum froze up and it came right off. I don\u2019t want to go into the freezer! Don\u2019t worry, Nolik. I\u2019ll stay right here with you. Just hold on! It won\u2019t take long at all. Why do I need to hold on? The gum is already holding on to me. Simka, do you know why it's so cold in the freezer\nwhen outside it's warm? I\u2019ll explain it to you. A refrigerator has a pump\nthat pushes a special liquid through a long tube. Inside the refrigerator,\nthe liquid in the tube wants to turn into a gas. To do that it takes the heat from everything inside\nand that makes the refrigerator cool. Then the pump sucks in the gas\nand pushes it out as a hot liquid into the tubes on the back of the refrigerator. That lets all of the heat collected from the inside\nescape into the air outside. I wish I was somewhere warm! Hold on! I\u2019ll go get us some warm clothes to wear. I don't want to hold on! I want to go with you! - Just hang in there!\n- I'm hanging. Tom Thomas, open up! Masiya, do we have any warm clothing to wear? Why in the world do you need it? I just do! Well! I need to know what is happening! Hurray! Tom Thomas! Simka! Open up the door! It looks like I\u2019m gonna freeze up in here for good. A Fixie is constantly surrounded by all sorts of danger. Inside a dark freezer a Fixie can lose his way\nand freeze to death. If he\u2019s not paying attention,\nhe can drown inside of a washing machine, or inside of a dish washer. And a careless Fixie is always at risk\nof getting an electric shock. Or suppose there's a short circuit\ninside of an appliance that starts a fire? If this happens you need to run away\nif you want to survive! And what about humans? Well, they don\u2019t even believe that we Fixies exist at all, so they can accidently drop something on top of a Fixie, or step on one, or kick us across the room! So, if you don\u2019t get out of the way in time\u2026 So, what I'm saying, Fixies. You need to be careful out there and pay attention. So be smart and stay safe, fellow Fixies! I don\u2019t understand this at all. He was right here! Poor Nolik! I wonder where he went? Look at this! Footprints! Nolik! You\u2019re alive! You scared me half to death! How did you get out of there? Well, you told me about how the refrigerator works. And so I found that cold tube and started crawling on it until it got hot and then I was here! Hey! There's smoke coming out of you!\nWe need to cool you down right away! Where? - I don\u2019t want to go into the refrigerator!\n- Stop! I was joking! Look how it froze! I could break my teeth on it. You are not going to chew it any more?! I'd never do that. Not after Nolik sat on it! Well, you didn't need to stick it where it doesn't belong. Hey, I apologize. I\u2019ll go and throw it away. Maybe you'll try the trashcan? Fixies go to Fixie schools\nAnd study to be masters. There's so much they need to learn\nTo save us from disasters! There isn't one appliance\nThat they don't know about. But if you meet a Fixie, please,\nDon't let their secret out! The Airbag We\u2019re going to be late! We\u2019ll make it! Oh, wow! Hey, slow down there! I\u2019m a super duper racer! Well-well, Fire. Again, risking your life! Super racers like me can always count on luck! You know, Fire, counting on good luck is stupid. It would be better if you would\nkeep your mind on safety. Actually, today Professor Eugenius\nhas something really special to show us. He's going to be testing an airbag. What's that? Digit, explain it. Everybody riding in a car has to wear their seatbelt, because if the car has to stop quickly,\nthe belt will hold the person back. But there are times\nwhen even seatbelts don't give enough protection. Like when a fast moving car crashes into something. When that happens the driver and passengers\ncan be protected by an airbag. You can\u2019t see them when they're folded up\nbecause they're hidden. But if the car is in a crash,\nthe airbags blow up very quickly, and the person bumps into the bag\ninstead of banging into the steering wheel, or flying through the windshield. Here I come. And once again,\nwhen something dangerous must be tested, Professor Eugenious tests it on himself. But Grandpus, aren't you scared\nthat it won't blow up with air? Don't worry about the air. A three, and a two, and a one\u2026 The airbag filled up in an instant! Did you notice? Yes. But how does it do it? There is a chemical inside of there that quickly burns and instantly turns into a gas\nthe moment the crash takes place. The gas fills the airbag and there you go. Did I explain that right, Professor? We've got to get him out! Stop! We'd better call for help! Professor? Do you need some help? Thank you, Elisa. Sorry to take you from your work! You're free to go. Professor, how did you manage\nto press the button from way over there? I managed to hit it on the fly! You are just astounding! To keep small children safe while they are riding in a car, they must be buckled up with a seatbelt\ninside of a special booster chair. But kids also need to be careful\nwhen they're riding a bicycle, skateboarding, roller-skating, or riding a scooter. First of all, it's best to keep off of roads\nwhere there's too much traffic. Second, put your protective gear on: for your arms and legs\nwear elbow pads, gloves and kneepads; for your head - wear a helmet. That way if you fall down, you won't get badly hurt. And third, make sure that people can see you. If you are out riding in the evening, your clothes and  bike\nmust have safety reflectors on them. They let drivers see where you are by reflecting the light from their headlights\nback at them. Remember, better safe than sorry! Here we go. Well, I hope this time I've got it. Should we call his assistant right now, just in case? Let's just wait and see. Ready, set, go! Grandpus, he needs to be rescued! Uh, no need. I made a change to it. Now the bag not only inflates automatically, it deflates itself as well! Splendid! As you Fixies say, Tideesh! - Today's lesson is done!\n- Hurrah! Come on! Where's my fixiboard?! I've got your fixiboard, Fire. Here you go. I just went and equipped it with an airbag. Really? How come?! You know I\u2019m a super racer! See? And that's why I installed it. Super racers don\u2019t need airbags. We never, never, ever\u2026 Careful! Oh wow! Is that airbag cool or what? It's a very original design he used there. That design is my own. And Fire ran the test. Professor, will you make an airbag for each one of us? You all will get them. Real soon. But even so\u2026 Caution and care make accidents rare! Can you believe that Fixies are such itty-bitty creatures? Even when they're magnified\nit's hard to see their features. They\u2019re tiny, infinitesimal, so small it makes you doubt. But if you meet a Fixie, please, don\u2019t let their secret out! The Balloon No way! You\u2019ll miss for sure! No problem! Anybody can do that! But I bet you can't do it\nif you try bouncing the ball off the floor first! Just look! Oh, what are my parents gonna do to me! Maybe we should call Simka? Simka! And what is Simka going to do to us\nwhen she sees this?! So, got yourself in trouble, ah? You shouldn't be playing with a ball inside! And now we have your lamp to fix! But how? Only my dad can reach all the way up there. Why just your dad? You have a hot air balloon over there! That doesn\u2019t fly, it\u2019s just a toy. See? It might be just a toy to you,\nbut for us, Fixies, it\u2019s absolutely real! If an object is lighter than water, it floats up to the surface. And in the same way,\nif something is lighter than air it floats upward. Did you know that hot air is lighter than cold air? Well, it is! And that means,\nif you warm up the air in a balloon, it will float up. Hot air balloons use special gas-burners\nto heat up the air inside of them so they will get lighter. And the bigger the balloon,\nthe more people it can take up into the air. I know what you're saying, but where do we get a burner? You think Fixies don't have their own burners? Sure we've got them. Bring it down here, and I'll go talk to our parents. No, no, and no! The human child must never see us! Listen now, Simka. We already don't approve of him seeing you and Nolik. He won\u2019t look! Papus, please! You're the one who told us how you dreamed of flying\nsince you trained to go into space! Yeah\u2026 For two years I waited on standby, but I never went up. And you've never flown\non a hot air balloon either, Honey. So, let's call it a deal! I talked them into it! There's just one condition \u2013 you can\u2019t watch. OK. You can come in now! Now prepare the burner! Coming right up! Permission for take off? Permission is granted! And off we go! Hurray! It\u2019s flying! Don\u2019t you peak! Turn around! Oh, it was an accident. I\u2019m going to evaluate the damage! Minding proper altitude! So, they've reached the spot! Air balloons are really awesome! I wonder who figured out how to do that? It was the Montgolfiers. The hot air balloon was invented in the 18th century by the Montgolfier Brothers from France. In those days there were no gas-burners, so they heated the air inside the balloon\nby burning straw. At first there were no passengers on their balloon, not counting the Fixies, of course, I mean, how else could a balloon\nget up in the air without them? Unfortunately, the names of the first  Fixies who took that flight were not recorded in the annuls of history. Following the Fixies flight,\nthe next passengers were animals: a ram, a rooster, and a duck. And it was not until those three safely landed\nafter flying a full four kilometers, that humans dared to fly in hot air balloons themselves. Ever since their invention,\nhot air balloons have also gone by another name: montgolfiers. Hurrah! Tideesh! Tideesh! All right! Simka, please let your parents know\nthat I'm so very thankful! OK! By the way, now you can turn around. You know, Simka? Let's fly the balloon just like them! There's no way, Nolik. We would need to use the burner,\nand kids aren't allowed to play with fire! I'll give you a ride! Look, I still need to put it back up on the shelve. So climb in and let's do it! Oh yeah! This is great, Simka! Look at us! We\u2019re flying just like the Montgolfier Brothers! What do you mean like brothers? OK then, like brother and sister Montgolfier! Fixies go to Fixie schools\nAnd study to be masters. There's so much they need to learn\nTo save us from disasters! There isn't one appliance\nThat they don't know about. But if you meet a Fixie, please,\nDon't let their secret out! Batteries Oh, my little lemon, just you wait! One day you'll be a strong and splendid tree! She\u2019s talking with a flowerpot! You scared me! Do you like it? Like what? My seedling, don't you see? It will grow into a huge tree! And there, amongst the green leaves... will be beautiful yellow lemons. Class! From that thing? Lemons? Oh yeah! It will grow into a tree! All it needs for that is to gather energy. Get energy? From where? From our Sun! The Sun? It'll be so slow. Batteries would be faster than the sun! Batteries? I really don\u2019t think so. Toola! Do you know how much energy they have?! Let\u2019s just bury a bunch of those batteries in here and you'll  be watching your lemon plant\nshoot up into a tree! Are you... positive? Absolutely! And where can we get the batteries? Over there! Professor Eugenius has a whole box full of them! Batteries, batteries! We use them every day and need them by the ton. Batteries, batteries! They give power to appliances so they can run. That does it! We'll be seeing the first lemons before the week's over! The first battery in the world was made in Italy more than two hundred years ago. When two different kinds of metal\nwere placed in salty water, electricity started flowing through a wire\nfrom one piece of metal to the other. Many years have passed since then, but batteries\nstill work in pretty much the same way. Today you can find batteries being used for electricity just about everywhere. Tiny batteries are used inside of wristwatches. While big batteries can power cars and even ships. With new batteries being produced by the millions,\nwe have to think, how should we get rid of the old ones? You can\u2019t just throw away batteries\nbecause they'll poison our soil and water. The best way to dispose of batteries is to take them\nto a special collection station that sends them to factories for recycling. Yes-yes! It's a terrible idea to bury batteries! You can kill any plants that are growing there. And this is the very reason why Professor Eugenius puts all of his used batteries in that box over there so he can dispose of them properly. Hey, where are they? Oh, my seedling! We harmed you! What? Where are the batteries? They're in... the flowerpot. How come? So the lemons would grow faster. From the batteries? Who came up with that idea? It will die! Hurry, we've got to go save it! The soil is contaminated!\nWe've got to find a new home for this seedling. But where? Over there! There\u2019s a pot with healthy soil. Let's do it! Batteries, batteries! They come in different sizes, shapes and colors too. Batteries, batteries Could be yellow, might be green, or maybe red and blue Don\u2019t cry, Toola! The seedling will be perfectly fine. It will grow big and strong with branches full of beautiful lemons! And oranges! And watermelons! It's a lemon tree, Fire. Will you ever stop going too far, like with the batteries? Well, anyhow, batteries are cool, right? Look how many appliances can't work without them! You're right! APPLIANCES can't work! Look! The seedling is coming back to life! It really is! Toola, tell us. Isn\u2019t it splendid? Splendid!", "i_77hgQ8Lwk": "[Music] snack heads what's going on it's your boy see snacks with another uh snack review check it uh big shout out to starburst yo they dropped some for the first time

let is that uh just whatever that lettuce i forget what i know i had tomatoes and onions and then ketchup and mayonnaise on it that's why it kind of reminded me of a whopper but i already don't wanna look at it maybe okay maybe not nine or eight maybe eight or seven you know it was pretty good right now right now all the fast food burgers i've ate so far i've been here so are all far um fast food restaurants i've eaten that so far i'm gonna put carl's jr at okay here's the list here's my list mcdonald's burger king carl's jr um just on the burgers i've gotten from noon here's my list here's my

Lisa I really love chewing gum so what's the truth it's chewing gum good for you or is it back beep people think of chewing gum as a kind of candy it's something that you know when you have a sweet tooth usually you'll chew it after a meal sometimes you chew it to curb your appetite so studies have actually shown that she wing gum 20 minutes after eating a meal helps to neutralize the acids from the food in your mouth and can help prevent tooth decay there are some sugar substitutes that have been proven to not cause cavities like the ones listed here when you choose your gum you want to make sure that the neck it has an ABA seal of approval if the ATA is the American Dental Association and they just review a bunch of products and they usually give a seal of approval to certain products that they have clinically tested some of the gums at the grocery store which have a DNA of people are tried in Eclipse or big ice breakers so it's chewing gum good or bad for you the verdict is it's

up guys this is a really funny one mentis has these two Cheney flavors this one is very wide around in freshman and there's another one I didn't get today as kind of low in cash just bought some Christmas stuff two flavors one package aside it's called up to you interesting this is from mentos gum Mentos did I apparently have they attempted to make some gum sort of with the outer shell and inside that juicy fruit inside it's like a gel sort of fruit gel it's okay you know the packaging is like a little small container and you pop it up and you just like a little gumball you chew it it's pretty good nowadays that you don't see it that much they still have it but not that much in stock this is mentos gum newest gum I'm maturing it for a couple days I would say this is really not bad what really gets to me is the flavors up to you to play Bruce one pack you decide your choice of either the mint or the berry watermelon does this remind you of any movie um same concept but different ah different topic I guess I don't know instead of government something else yes no maybe well for those who are still thinking or for those who do know what I'm talking about the matrix with canneries Morpheus as is neo so would you like to take the red pill or the blue pill remember that I don't know the people from mentals gum thought about this but it casts Parker question deragle or the glue gun the red gum you wake up and the Blue Gum you learn the ways of the matrix I'd be awesome though right now or maybe I think I got wrong vice versa yeah it's been a while since I've seen the matrix but that movie to remind me of us come I was like damn those people have mentioned stay probably thought about that or they didn't who knows but yeah reminds me of that uh both our really good flavors as you can see I've cooked you both they have a Facebook account facebook.com slash up to you you can like them ah this is right here give no decision to both sides maust heard ah yeah so I just like the rapping weapons like very seasonal cuz you know Christmas but this is a really interesting gum you should try I don't want to waste the last minute pieces of gum i have uh but overall i think both are really good flavors i love mint bottle of water my on the very water mountains really good both i give really good flavor it lasses for a while Gumm doesn't you know they don't last forever like the flavor the last for a couple hours or so and moreover lena like electric you two three pieces of gum this one I can chew one gum and I'm satisfied so uh Liberator 55 I know I'm keep

see will look like seeds normal problem I have a bubble gum chewing gums as they lose their flavor up far far too quickly so far you're okay and then there's a flavor phase it's going to that

Pretty cool right now some of you have probably\nseen the chewing gum video if you haven't check it out this is kind of niggly and tricky\nand stuff but I felt a little bit praised because you guys said 'Barry make bubble gum'\nand blow bubbles and also glee gum who provide the gum base tweeted me to say I was a gum\nmaster anyhow if you wanna have a go at making this hit pause on the video now it's tricky,\nit's dangerous, but this is how you do it. In a microwave proof dish that you're happy\nto wreck for the moment add your gum base, glycerene, and citric acid powder. Some of you might struggle to get citric acid\npowder in fact it says on there suitable for culinary use because it's also used for something\nvery naughty ask your chemist and tell them that you are making mulled wine or just get\nyour parents to pick it up for you and they'll think they are a drug dealer. Add your food colouring / flavouring give\nit a brief little mix and top with your syrip before slamming it in your microwave. Now put it on small bursts around 20 seconds\njust to break down that gum base keep stirring as you go. Keep mixing and heating your gum base until\nit's fully broken down, continue doing that method but gradually add icing sugar in there,\njust reserving a little bit but be very careful this gets so hot. Now here's the dangerous bit once it's fully\ncombined put the remaining icing sugar on a board, dump down 3 quarters of gum base\nthen start to incorporate it in it's gonna be really hot so sprinkle loads of icing sugar\non it, keep working it and kneading it get a rolling pin if you want just keep breaking\nit down and let that icing sugar absorb in there. Top it with some extra gum base on there keep\nworking it rolling it into a nice big batch similar to the shapes you're gonna cut it\ninto. I got mine into a strip that kind of looked\nlike a well endowed gum snake but it was cool because it enabled me to cut it into sections\nand as it was still slightly warm it made it manouverable to get it into little shapes\nas you see here, i've got like a square a cylinder, classic strip just by rolling it\nout, got a pillow got a ball and a bean i've got one in my mouth but these have gone slightly\nhard from being sat there, so you need to keep them wrapped in foil and in a little\nicing sugar too otherwise they will turn to a rock relatively quickly. So I was terrible at school at blowing bubbles\nbut in a minute i'll try and do that but that is it my friends if you enjoyed this video\ndon't forget to give it a thumbs up share subscribe and comment, that is how you make\nhomemade  bubble gum.", "oLjEbWDeGMc": "hello game youtubers this is gonna be by second can review this time I'm going to do a review on hubba bubba max strawberry

e-liquid e-juice review today we are taking a look at melon ball now melon ball is manufactured by shijin vapor it's available in these 60 ml bottles as you can see right in front of me here also in a 0 3 and 6 milligram nicotine option as well as a 70/30 VG PG ratio we got that covered here that is melon ball let's give you a quick look at the bottle the box we'll get into vaping it and talking about it and I'll give you my final thoughts on this eliquid here [Applause] this is melon ball here's the box that comes in these are taller skinny 60 mil unicorn bottles this is the box as you can see melon ball on the top this is 3 mg because that's what I'm always reviewing and vaping as you can see there's a little pink haired lady down the bottom blowing a green bubble and it says bubblegum in her little thought bubble you get kind of an idea what this juice might be so let's keep spinning this box ingredients are on the side you got 70/30 VG PG tells you all the stuff there as well as the ingredients and manufacturing and Shi Jin vapors website and instant you know Instagram tags and stuff like that then on the back something a little different a little vape crossword puzzle so that's something you can scratch around and mess around with try and answer the paper lady related questions back there oh yeah and then on the other side you got the warnings and all that stuff so that's the box and as far as the bottle goes the bottle is the same not too much different sweet looking bottle it's got everything wrapped around it just like the box does so we don't need to go over that too much the e-liquid itself is very clear very very clear really really good really good one thing I will show you about this bottle it has a nice flat tops so you don't get that juice spurting up when you're putting the cap on and off and the the pressure building up in the bottle there that's one thing I do like about companies that use these type of Unicorn bottles it also seals really good it's got a nice tight lock to it childproof cap as well so yeah that's melon ball guys and gals from Shi Jin vapor I haven't loaded up in the dead rabbit RDA like usual I got some clean or actually not clean but they have been cleaned twisted 24 gauge dual coil build in here from the other day some fresh cotton I've been vaping this since about late last night so and it's about eight o'clock right now Arizona time so almost a full day but it's it's been pretty good yep excuse me hmm small wet raw box is sitting underneath that dead rabbit we have it in direct output mode and I didn't want to beat for me there which is weird but it's in direct output mode right now and we're gonna we're gonna give it some vapes and talk about it huh so let's get into it mm-hmm guys and gals I got to tell you one one of if not probably the best tasting bubblegum ejuice I've ever had the flavor profile on this I didn't give that to you right away because I kind of wanted to beep it and described it as I gave it to you like I said on the bottle you can kind of tell it's a bubblegum vape but the actual flavor profile on this is a cantaloupe melon bubblegum now if you're unaware or unfamiliar with the this type of flavor a big Japanese flavor people in Japan they've been eating like these chewy gummies chewy candies since the 1930s I think they were called chew let's back then and then in about 1975 this company called a marinara mary mary naga came out in 1975 and reintroduced that same flavor but in a high chew it was it was called haiku so it's like a chewy candy they also have tons of these and bubble gum form over in Japan honestly it tastes just like those like not even kidding you it tastes like a cantaloupe and I'm pretty sure they just say melon but I'm pretty sure that means watermelon because that's I'm picking up like a sweetness of watermelon from this so I believe it is a cantaloupe watermelon bubblegum this is a hugely popular thing over in Japan you can find them all over the internet they're all over the place in Japan and on the internet here you can order them and stuff really really tasty but back to this e-liquid let's give you the

done a review of anything pretty much I've been pretty much sticking to my diet which is the Opera fast diet and we can only eat limited things if you want to like very low in calories low in sugar but you know how I get when I go to Target or I go to walmart I always come across some really new interesting things so hopefully all of you can bear with me there's going to be a really short review of trident layers oh yeah what inspired me to do actually you have tried n layers is I just got some new comments on some old trident gum it reviews that I've done and actually does it this is a new flavor they're coming up with new flavors pretty awesome so anyways this is a watermelon and tropical fruit have an open yet I have like three packs I already went through one so but does I have a pack member to then I should go and get ready to review feel so uh I've set on the back you know they have the hotline the packaging was made in mexico people could they have me the uh I don't know kind of like out notice saying the fifty percent fewer calories and sugar gum calories content of the stick has been reduced from 84 calories and as lesson five calories so this is a new flavor this is a dragon freedom our Mountain you guys none of me know what the tropical fruit is actually we actually is a dragon fruit it's an Asian fruit found in Asia mostly Hong Kong Singapore china so i'm going to open this package for y'all it's tightly sealed in the plastic as you can see you can open it up here and by bad you've got a picture of the watermelon and you got pictures of dragging freezer Google out dragon food they're pretty good they're very delicious not too sweet it's a very bland in flavor I can tell you they have inside when you open it it has like little dot inside any though mmm ready off the bat can smell fruity flavor porous I want to pick one out nicely sealed as always and it looks like a sandwich just like all Trident layer guns look like let's like a sandwich you have I'm presuming the dragon fruit in the middle and the one relat on top and bottom that's what it looks like it's really good flavor you know retrying flavor comes some febreeze will work some won't this level just grow on me um anyth anything relevant of this gum I can tell you pretty much nothing else okay well we can see like right there you probably can't see it it's not focusing currently my laptop camera but says dispose properly so what it means is disposed gum into the trash wastebasket a lot of why should there's only one country and I can think of which is Singapore and they don't allow chewing gum let's get er consider it like an offense can chew gum otherwise your find I'm not sure what other super punishments to do you have with chewing gum but I know for the fact they do find you it's really going to have gum in Singapore let's bring it up I mean chewing gum tomate but that would explain why all the streets are so clean well I hopefully all of you enjoyed this

you want to skip ahead to specific points in the video then check the description below for skip times enjoy hey it's Lucky Penny shop and it's time for a maker set I know it's one of your favorite things so we try to do them as quick as possible this one here is the America's original double bubble bobble gum factory make your own bubble gum and look at that it's got everything you needed right in the kit so I'm gonna make bubble gum and even has the little wrapper so I was looking at the instructions now it's unopened in the box meaning everything is still sealed you do need four D batteries let me flip it around here now these kids I always point out the happy kids he's looking a little cynical they're like yeah all right I'm gonna get gum out of this uh-huh she's looking okay she's looking okay kind of happy let the kid blow on the bubble he looks happy right so you know what we got to do we got to take it out of the box get it all clean and make us some bubble gum so let's do that like I said we found this all original unopened complete on eBay everything still sealed was one of those crazy late-night searches you know maker kit there gum kit and this one came up dump it all out right so let's take a look we're done with the box we'll have to get you the year on that later so now the box is out of here so foil packs look at that little foil cups I mean and then here is the double bubble wrappers a sticker sheet we'll have to put on a little pipette or pipette however you say it and then this looks like the gum powder and yes it's thoroughly expired by now but we're gonna use it anyway why not still sealed let's see instructions okay all right so there's all the pieces well let's get this out of the bag anyway firmly I don't bore you with that but it seems like it should be pretty easy I say that now but you know one of those things you don't know until you try there you go that slides up and it's all clear inside so you could see it there's a heating chamber in there all right that moves side to side got a couple tools here looks like a mixing device they call this the mixing stick they call this the mixing pan it's hollow on the bottom and the foil liners which we have those are the foil liners and stickers let me do this let me uh let me wash it you know take this out first let's double seal and it's in a foil bag so we'll give that a go let me take this wash wallet actually I don't need to wash anything really nothing touches it because you're using the seal bag so that's right let's get right into it then all right it doesn't even say wash usually you wash adult supervision four D batteries let's check that out so I need a screwdriver and four D batteries let me get that all right there's the four D batteries two screws now don't forget what our maker sets everybody the key points the steps are all in the description we do that because a lot of people don't want to watch every step of the process they want to get right to the end well go in that description and you'll see exactly when I stick a piece in my mouth right well you won't see it but you'll know it okay that was simple enough so let's see one I pre check the batteries because I knew I would need them back in so that was pretty painless there everybody yeah that looks good look set let's get this out of the way okay now batteries first and then applying the labels so this one here is letter A and it goes on that big sign and I'm gonna put it right there and I'm gonna make sure it's near perfect doesn't like that let's do that doesn't like that gotta go behind that okay that doesn't look like it this doesn't look like it fits perfectly in there there you go all right that's perfect okay and then sticker D is the power sticker power sticker goes right here there's a looks like a light indicator there so it goes right over that alright and then the next sticker B is the clock where does the clock go it goes in the circle here and it's just a fake looking clock they got the one down there so I'll put the line straight up and down how's that and then inside the sign I'm just trying to make sure I get it right now it's on the toy forever and then letter C is the bubble gum factory where does that go that goes right here in front nice I'm excited I get excited you can excite it when a new maker set comes in I do and then ease the little double bubble boy with the thumbs up and that goes in front here the only thing I didn't get was water I water I see it in the pictures and we've got a few more so that's it they don't show you all of the other stickers and where they go hmm and it looks like look those were missing weren't they notice that nobody put them on there so let's leave it at that I think it looks cool there you go so we're all set so let's look at these steps making bubbles Oh all right so making bubble gum right here place the foil liner inside the pan all right so looks like they got crushed in the box that will so it looks like it just sits in here I got a little a lot of wack there so should be okay though okay did that that's our pan then it says with adult supervision cut open the top of the bag of gunpowder gunpowder gum powder measure one ounce of gunpowder in the measuring cup and pour it into the oil line pan when finished with gunpowder full bag close and place in receivable bag okay let me do this let me clean up a few things here still have some cardboard on the table see cardboard the old sticker sheet in plastic get the water and we'll go the next step and actually make the gum all right okay all set got a little bit of water cuz it doesn't take much my measuring cup I have my foil pan ready the bag ready so now I just need to cut the bag and it said just an ounce now it shows you who spectacular it smells like gum two tablespoons and when I say it smells like gum I mean it doesn't smell ramps it it smells really good one ounce it said so let's get that in there little big chunks let me do this let me break the bag up in a little bit so start that over make sure we don't get that as you can see it does look spectacular in there and yes it smells like gum not rancid garbage or stale at all smells fresh like fresh air from 2002 because that's what this is from I checked online and right now I'm just kind of breaking up any pieces I just need the top layer to be where we go I get any more broken pieces I'll just break them up in there I mean big pieces there's a few in there there's another lump are you doing to me lumps okay set that off to the side let's just make sure yeah throw it right on I'm just gonna let me use this side it's like a little spatula okay so there's a lot of steps here tilt this down just a little all right let the first step is to put this into the foil pan pretty happy with that now see when I pour it in a couple little chunker's in there okay I think I'm good so now what it did say now the next step is take your pipette who says pipette your pipette I don't know pour water in a measuring cup squeeze the top of the pipette pipette then dip the tube of the pipette into the water Julie sure hold on the tube the tube will fill with water a lot about half inch of water to fill the top of the pipette as well so they want it in the tube and the top but let me just read ahead just to make sure okay aim the aim the filled pipette over the pan then squeeze the top to release the water into the pan use the mixing stirrer use the mixing stick to stir the water and gunpowder together in the pan for approximately 15 seconds so when that's happening and I guess I can read the next step so squeeze to about a half an inch so they want it in the tube and the top I would say we're good there it's not a lot first time making it here everybody okay and then mix for about 15 seconds and I'm not timing it I'm kind of 10 11 12 13 14 15 not much change there but you know you got to heat it up probably so the next thing is to put it in the loading dock so let's get that in there it's in our loading dock I don't want it to push on it you know I've never done this before anybody first time but I just hear it crinkling in the back okay move the blue sliding part shuttle this the red lever here make sure this is towards the back it says so let's do that towards the back and now it says okay slide the pant position booster all the way to the right okay you can see it in there now see it through the little door there nice nice little viewing door and when it's ready it ignites it turns to red see that little light there red so it's on now what happens is we need to okay dude your stick hole okay move the red lever on the right of the machine back to the front this will raise it ooh I can kind of see it going up so it's raising the pan underneath it to heat this up okay so now we're in the cooking position there's a hole on top here now it's there's a certain arrow into the mixing stick in the hole as the gun mixture heats up start kneading the gun with the stick so I don't know if it's starting to heat up just yet well give it a little bit there's no real time there I'll let you read when I'm reading so you can kind of see it there this whole section it says it start very slowly slice you don't make a mess start from the outside it slowly push the gum towards the middle of the tin cup make sure that you hold the handle of the pan with one hand as you need the gun with a stick need once every minute for five minutes so let me get my timer so once I get started okay so I'm gonna get started with that and there we go first minute okay so now to let that go okay so the first minute we're at a half a minute now so I just mixed a little bit for the first minute because it does say need once every minute for five minutes doesn't say need for a minute a full minute every five minutes it so it's just a little bit so it's gonna go maybe I'll give you another little shot closer in here see that in there that good okay so the first minute is up so now we're gonna do the next minute just keep going I'm not necessarily noticing any change yet I kind of feel I don't know I don't smell like it's heating up the lights on so we know that it's first time using it so I gotta kind of get a feel for the Machine now there was a ton of gum did you see that so I'm going about 15 to 20 seconds I think try not to make a mess it said don't make a mess okay so we'll let that sit a little bit prop it on the gum alright like I said this was from 2002 the gum smell great I don't think we're gonna have any problems with that so now we're at 3 minutes 15 seconds so we're gonna let that countdown let me just read ahead a little bit it says using the mixing stick start twisting the gum so that's the next step the gum will start sticking to itself so that hasn't happened yet we're only in our second minute going on our third minute right now so let me do that maybe you'd like to see a top-down view so after this I will switch the camera angle for you huh okay let me change that angle so we have some minutes to go here I'm not sure what's really happening so I'm not not sensing anything in particular if it's working or not working I'm not smelling anything the red light is still on so here we go I guess it is on the bottom a little bit it's hard to see for you to see you see if I can show you that it's definitely sticking to my cup that's for sure and it's getting harder so something's happening in there okay let's give it a second now and we'll finish up that last minute because there is a process here we have to take it out we have to actually start why we did I know sorry kneading it so well wait for that okay so after we get to that now I'm starting to smell it so it says the gun will turn from a light shade of pink to darker shade of pink and there's little specks in there but the overall color hasn't changed that much once the gums start sticking to the tin cup remove the mixing stick now mine is starting to stick but we're not done yet so that last minute is now did say the whole lot of that red handle on I see why it moves a little sometimes so yes it is starting to change I see it Tina I'm getting over my initial all this isn't working - hmm maybe it is working just needed to heat up a little more see it now okay so I think we're past the initial five minutes see that so now it says okay start twisting the gum and do that repeat this continuously for one minute let's turn that off I gotta go all the way around well how far does this thing go come on you're wasting my time okay there we go one minute now twisting what is twisting me actually still stuck everywhere twisting maybe that's twisting turning I gotta tell you it smells great I wish you could all smell it there we go almost done with that minute it looks like it's pretty well incorporated now I think when we get it out of need it will be able to really feel good but you can see the color did change in there there's twisting yeah okay get a little bit more think we're there nice I hear your timer I hear you everybody just relax it's okay I just looking at the consistency now it's very visual here okay never off okay the gun will turn from light to dark we did that once they gonna start sticking to the Tim Cup remove the mixing stick no to gum sticks to the stick scrape the side of the stick on top the red ring to remove the gum let's just get off what we can see get in there okay slide the red lever back so let me zoom out here get the camera reset okay okay so I'm moving this lever back I want to move that lever back there we go so the Heat's off slide the pan back and left shutting off the machine now you see what we have didn't have any trouble removing it so now we're going to the next step so it says flat and the file liner is shown and placed gum in center with clean hands need the gum together getting up all the bits of gum stuck to the foil let's move our machine out let's say right now that looks really cool so let me get this in here you want to see close-ups right getting all the bits I don't know about you but I'm my mouth too starting to want to just try it right now and just take this whole piece in my mouth but I will not at first you know originally I thought oh this thing's not gonna work but I'm thinking right now just things working really good okay it says with clean hands neither gum together getting up all the bits and stuck to the foil any gum pop that may not have been completely mixed in need well so I'm gonna need well kind of see the other pink there and I got some on the table stick that in there well there was a lot of gum in that powder pack so I have a lot more to make so there's a lot more fun here and yes I'm gonna try this but when it's wrapped like a piece of gum I want to get through the whole process I'm thinking now there might be a few bits in there but it sure looks like they're gum so now it says mold the needed gum into a log shape let me just show you and then take right here then take the mixing stick and cut it into four pieces of gum and then take the gum wrappers and cut them in two and a half inches and then wrap and twist so let me uh our tabletops are always clean here so don't worry everybody very clean table top I wish they would say make the log so many inches so you know it doesn't say that but I think we have a nice one here nice log look at that kind of reminds you of their gum see if we get four nice pieces out of this Oh cut one here here here and I don't like that so I'm gonna roll it out a little bit longer oops there we go back together let's do that one more time let's do that one piece to piece there we go like that a little better what do you think this one's a little small but okay so we'll form them back cuz that's what their gum looks like right alright so now I need to I'm gonna do here it's actually wash my hands and then we're gonna measure out the paper okay I'm back I've got one of my rulers on there yes I like to collect rulers this one since historic Apollo 11 moon flight Kennedy Space Center Florida pretty neat ruler so remember the wrapper they said two and a half inches so I need four of those and then we'll just cut that two and a half inches right there there's one to give you quite a bit that's a long piece three and one more and I'll just give you a quick look at the instructions so you can kind of see the pictures like I'm seeing here though it says place one pieces go in the center pull the paper around the gum overlapping images around the gum twist the sides of the wrapper as shown for extra precious store unbeaten well let's hope so wrapped gum and resealable bag okay so here's our gum and I get you a close enough shot on that I think it looks great I don't have an original one two tres test it with so here we go fold over then overlap okay wait I didn't show you that good enough let's do that again so I folded it over and I over wrapped now twist the ends look at that mm-hmm and I'm silent because I'm actually quite excited that it's working out like this anytime you start a maker set like this there's a lot of prep with the video you know as far as making sure the sets they're complete making sure you got everything you need and you're excited to start it and then you start the video there's a time-consuming process so you want it all to work out great for everybody and I think we've been pretty successful so far and one or two fails on a couple sets but you know that's just part of it so here are my four pieces of gum so as you can see someone has to eat it and that will be me so I'm gonna open my first piece and it was a little sticky so I'm sure no it's not look at that so now I get to open it look at that now I'm going to chew okay it breaks up so I'm guessing it's probably better to let it sit long but it does turn in I have gum now so I'm thinking you want to let it harden just a little and dry out I don't think I can blow a bubble yet but otherwise I am chewing gum I'm not gonna show you my chewed gum but it's in my mouth you heard me too and I can a ploy I'm sorry I cannot blow a bubble so there's the machine what do you think pretty cool design yep neat machine so there you go we did it it's the bubble gum factory bye double bubble make your own

videos that we post yes [Music] you", "LanJO4BlOmc": "hi guys I'm Dan Jones welcome back to the channel today I'm going to be showing you three different ways to make homemade bubble gum I'm going to be using jello kool-aid and candy flavoring if you guys haven't subscribed to the channel yet please make sure you do so let's get started on this tutorial our first way of making our homemade bubble gum is going to be using kool-aid for our flavoring you're going to need two teaspoons of the flavored juice crystals we're going to need three tablespoons of gum base and I'll put a link in the description box so you can find your own there and you're also going to need one tablespoon of lily-white corn syrup and we're going to be using between half a cup to a full cup of icing sugar which is also known as confectioner's or powdered sugar so I've put the gum base into a larger microwavable bowl and right now they're really hard and you can't really squeeze them at all so there we're gonna microwave them to warm them up but first we're going to put in our corn syrup here so it's got this little container it's gonna wipe that off there and then I'm going to sprinkle the flavoring and coloring on top you can add gel paste if you want a brighter color and you can also add more flavoring if you want it to be stronger so I'm just going to mix this up and then I'm going to put it into the microwave for 30 seconds after 30 seconds in the microwave the gum base is going to start to get a little bit softer you can press it down I'm choosing the back of the spatula here to kind of mix that in you want to mix in this flavor and this coloring into the gum base once you've got a decent amount of mixing done the second time we're going to pop it back into the microwave for another 30 seconds after the second set of 30 seconds it's going to be quite a bit softer so I'm just going to continue to stir it and at the end of totally mixing this up if I think that it needs another set of 30 seconds I might maybe start at 15 more because I don't have very many chunks left in here so I think that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna pop it in for 15 more seconds so I've got my mixture ready to be poured on top of some icing sugar here so I'm just going to like make a little hole in the center there and then you this is really hot at this point so you want to be really careful I'm only gonna start out mixing with my actual spatula once you get the icing sugar mixed in it will start to cool down and obviously when it's exposed to the air temperature it's going to cool off as well so it is pretty sticky and messy at this point so I'm just going to take it like this and if you have it sticky all you have to do is add more icing sugar to it so if it's sticking to my mat like that I just need to add a little bit more icing sugar here I'm just going to fold and press with my spatula to start and then as this icing sugar gets incorporated it's going to be easier to kind of knead it with my fingers so just do a couple more mixing here and then I'll be back when it's ready to be needed so once it's ready to be kneaded I'm just taking my fingers and folding it onto itself in this icing sugar it's gonna take on the color here and I'm just continuing to fold and kind of pinch and press down at the same time I want to make sure that I'm going to get to a spot with the gum where it's no longer sticky at all and then obviously it will have cooled off as well so I'm just going to continue to do this and whenever I find a sticky spot you can just press some icing sugar into that and that will solve that problem so I'm just going to continue to do this so once you've got the icing sugar mixed in it should be a nice chewy piece of bubblegum here a gigantic one if you don't want to pop that all in your mouth you can use like a like just a like a rolling pin here to roll it out and then just use a knife or even like a pizza cutter to cut your bubblegum in to little pieces so there you go how to make bubblegum with the kool-aid and this is will make about ten pieces of gum and you can just keep tearing it you can roll it into little gum balls if you choose or you can just kind of shape it into a rectangle as well for a second kind of homemade bubblegum we're going to be using jello flavoring this time so you're going to need two teaspoons of your favorite jello crystal then we're going to need three tablespoons of the gum base and we're going to be using one at tables of the lily-white corn syrup and again we're going to need half a cup to a cup of icing sugar so I have my gum base here in a microwavable bowl I'm going to add my corn syrup into that just scrape that off and then I'm going to sprinkle my flavoring and my coloring in there and then give that a stir next up we're going to pop it into the microwave for 30 seconds after thirty seven thirty seconds in the microwave the gum base should have softened a little bit so you're able to use the back here spatula it's just press those down and to squish them and then I'm going to do it as much as I can here and I'm gonna pop this back into the microwave another 30 seconds after a full minute minutes in the microwave we were going to have the gum base be quite soft now so you should easily be able to mix it and stir it in this lilac color is quite nice but if you wanted it to be a brighter purple you can of course add a little bit of gel paste into there so just like with our first guy or it's gonna make a little well in the center of our icing sugar there and then I'm going to take out my gum mixture and just get that poured in there again it's very hot so you probably don't want to touch it quite yet and even the bowl is quite hot as well you might want to use some sort of protection on your hand and it is a crazy sticky so I'm just going to fold the icing sugar into the gum until it loses some of that stickiness and it's a little bit cooler for me to be able to handle by hand once you're able to handle it you can start to feed the icing sugar in to the gum just by kneading it into there you want to try to work out any of those clumps of icing sugar that you end up in there just make sure you're giving it a nice motion of this kneading it's kind of like when you're kneading that bread dough as well so I'm just going to continue to knead this until I don't have any stickiness left to the bubblegum and by that I mean like there's nothing left sticking to my hands or sticking to the actual mat the longer you need it the chewy or the Bubblegum will be you can't / need it once the gum is nice and smooth to the touch and it's nice and stretchy you can use a rolling pin or you can roll it out or you can just rip it into pieces if you choose instead I'm using a fondant cutter here just to cut it into little shapes and I'm just going to kind of tear off a little bit and then roll that up and then using my fingers I'm just going to shape it into like a little rectangle like a piece of that really super chewy bubblegum so our third way to make our homemade bubblegum is by using candy flavors so here I have an assortment of different flavors that you can try out for some delicious gum I'm also going to put the link in the description box for those and the gum base and we need three tablespoons of the gum base we're going to be using one teaspoon here - one tablespoon of the corn syrup and then half a cup to a cup of icing sugar and for this one we're going to be using some gel paste I have my gum base in a microwavable safe Bowl here adding in my corn syrup scraping that off and then I'm just going to give a squirt of color just a little bit you can do any color that you want to and then for this gum I have got some strawberry flavor and I'm gonna pour in quite probably about half of it you do I find that this one's not quite as powerful and flavor as the other ways are so I just wanted to use a lot of it so I'm just going to mix this up and then pop it into the microwave for 30 seconds just like the other ways to make the homemade bubblegum we're stirring it after 30 seconds pressing down getting those now sought relatively soft pieces of the gum base mixed in into my icing sugar well goes my bubblegum mixture here and again it's hot be careful and the sticky and messy take your spatula and fold it in until you can touch it once your bubblegum piece is nice and smooth it will be nice and stretchy you can tear off a piece you can twist it and then tear it off or you can use a knife and a fondant cutter like I did before so then you just want to shape your piece into whatever shape you want it to be I'm gonna come back next with my thoughts on the three different ways to make the Bubblegum so there you go everybody three different ways to make homemade bubblegum so what I thought about the jello one was it wasn't enough color to it so I added a little bit of gel paste at the end and the flavor is okay not over-the-top the candy coloring here the candy flavor in this one made it a little bit stickier to work with so you had to add more icing sugar to it which makes it kind of like a harder gum to chew now my favourite one was the one with the kool-aid it made a super bright vibrant color and then it also has a great flavor as well let me know which one you think you would like and what's your favorite kind of bubblegum thanks so much for watching remember to subscribe to the channel and I will see you guys all again next time", "eFTO9K46Xnk": "bubblegum rape anything is possible in our

gum factory we're actually in the middle of a jungle with our local guides who lives on this property in this land has been in his family for generations it's gotta be seen can I Drive - just wait alright hidden nice turn they're all like oh they hired a hot girl to drive the shuttle mouth on the ride she's the new driver here come on guys get on were they you're on Mexican time again here you help me out yeah fine here pr\u00edncipe is where it's at a need to stay a whole month to know these place well it's all big I'm gonna bring binky miss I need to drown out there we're following safety regulations as always dude this is definitely my favorite resort I think that I say that for sure this year yeah behind principai is shipping it's clean we're holding on Carlos driving the shuttle your own in the back on your penny what can I say and you love that lease can I honestly I can't believe that you had it to yourself dude yeah Froy let's meet you very very sorry for the delay Carlita this is a small compliment Valentin has been working here for many years with his family the main work with these people is extraction of the chewing gum they have done it for generations okay in fact for the million people cheek clay yeah it means to chew well it in babbles yeah Milan my young Ward is Cornish for let's go after they cook the Tring gum they put it hard chewing gum in these box and wait for it to dry exactly this is old chewing gum oh this is really yeah it's hard as a rock actually we're going to start from finding the tree in the jungle did you speak Maya we want to learn I speak Maya Masha will be shovin me Chappell Chappell Chappell that means how are you at suits bless you no sorry a toy is nice though this is one of the alternative trees they cut for the resin for the gum the malum name is tuned up when they are in the jungle and they have a snake bite they mix the resin of tune up with another direction of another tree and they use it like an antidote they mix the two of them together with water and salt and you drink it SAS gob is the surface part of the limestone and what they do they used to burn it so they produce powder and they mix this powder with the resin of these trees to make their mortar or cement to school and that's what they used to build houses if you harvest completely the tree you can wreak Arvest the same tree after 14 years it so you have exactly 4 mm where's 14 years - it's a long time take the sap back again bro don't mean to carry the camera I don't care this is the chewing gum tree man acara sapota the main characteristic is that if you look the top the bark is in lines they have harvest the first part now Allen think is going to climb and it's going to start to cut rows redditors so the dummies are teaching fruity flavor girl yeah this strawberry another thing nice thing about this tree is that it's one of the hardest woods we have so it's very precious for construction for furnitures so at the end all of the coats are going to leave to the same place and then collect at the bottom of the bag yes who needs a hammer when you can use the end of a machete I mean what I love is that they're respecting mother nature and their surroundings and you can see as you said you know you're can only do so much with them or you're gonna harm them and I asked you if if the trees ever died and you said no they never die because he makes sure to take care of that they know how to do it it's crazy as I was asking him how the Mayans knew that this tree will give you gum we don't know we don't know everything about the Mayan civilization because so much of the history and the papers were destroyed it's going yes good job Troy's gonna go and get you stay there try man drop the machete to me first so Troy how many tools will you see is using its got three tools and then the rope so I guess that's his favorite part you can tell we can eat these yeah this one yes oh yeah I want to try because intensively how much is this what we do now we ain't in a diarrhea they boiled these and they drink the water please for the dairy I in we're gonna boil it down though how do we like okay look Maya now you have my favors baby oh yeah base camp resource our hands on we try to be not just by watching we not only want to see the process we want to get involved with the process and try new things and try and see how they do it so we can experience things just the way supposed to be when we travel oh nice by Troye I tell that comes Bob hmm oh is it my zebra Lisa can I just so bad it tastes of chewing gum that's been in your mouth for an hour yeah and this got a little bit nasty when there was just a big ball of gum chewing gum and everybody was touching in and it was in the girls water and everybody was dipping their hands in there and we're all just diving in and biting off pieces it was a little bit nasty Valentin was telling me a lot of stuff that I didn't know he's my yin so I want to learn as much as I can there with the amount of time that we have to spend with him and really appreciate all the information that you gave us this is what it's all about we want to see something different something most people don't get to see something most people don't think to see and any time I think I chew a piece of gum I'm gonna think about that time that I was at Sian can and learn how to make gum myself from scratch from this guy who following his traditions of his family on his land that they have lived for centuries that is the coolest story you you", "8va0Hw4faz8": "today I want to show you guys how to make this pink bubblegum inspired cake we're going to be using my favorite vanilla cake base which was colored pink with gel food coloring and we're going to be frosting our layers with an American buttercream and all the recipes that I'm using today can be found on Chelsea's comm I'm using an offset spatula to smooth my buttercream and it's important that we get a nice even layer of buttercream between our cake layers now that our cake layers are stacked I like to press down on the cake layers to make sure there aren't any extra air bubbles trapped in our buttercream next I'm going to apply a crumb coat frosting which is our first layer of frosting the spin I'm going to start at the top of the cake and then I'm going to work my way around one smooths we're going to chill the cake for about five minutes to let the crumb coat set once the crumb coat is firm to touch I'm going to apply a second layer of buttercream it's a little bit thicker and next comes a really fun part using a small offset spatula and buttercream that I've coated three different shades of pink with gel food coloring we're going to applies logs a buttercream around the cake and also to the top of the cake once the cake is fully coated with our bits of pink buttercream we're going to use a bench scraper to go ahead and smooth those blobs around the cake creating a kind of a watercolor effect once the sides of the cake are smooth I'm going to work my way on the top and go ahead and spin while I hold down my cake bench to smooth the top I also added a fun sprinkle border around the base of the cake for the bubblegum inspired bubbles I took small balloons covered in shortening and dipped them twice into pink unflavored gelatin once the gelatin has fully hardened I carefully popped and removed a balloon using a pair of scissors I then trimmed away the uneven edge around the basis of the lip the bubbles are then ready for the cake I gently arranged them in a semi-circle around the top of the cake I use the largest bubbles in the center of the cake and then work my way to the edge of the semicircle with the smaller bubbles once all of my bubbles are stacked I also added some sprinkles to the top of the cake now that the cake is fully decorated it's time for the best part we're going to come to this cake and see all those beautiful pink cake layers thanks so much for joining me today if you enjoyed this video be sure to click the like and grab button below [Music]", "aFoz-HsXwHg": "hello and today we'll be reviewing max strawberry watermelon as you can see there's

candies? chewing gum manufacturing process", "sEqv4LjTGLA": "g'day welcome to the simple cooking Channel today I'm going to make a special video because I've just reached 100,000 subscribers so I want to say a huge thank you to all my subscribers including the ones from the beginning to the last one that just subscribed in any future subscribers so today I'm going to make bubblegum you can blow bubbles with this it's quick and simple to make so let's go [Music] get a microwave-safe bowl and put in a third of a cup of gum mix now I will have a link in the description where you can buy this on top of it add glucose syrup which i think is also known as corn syrup and you want to put in about three tablespoons which would be about one to three then add 1tsp of glycerine or glycerol as it's also known sort of looks like this add about half a teaspoon of citric acid add about half a teaspoon to a teaspoon of flavoring I'm gonna be using Strawberry essence for this now just place this in a microwave for 60 seconds and then give this too and repeat that after that for 30 seconds I give it a stir until it's dawn just give all this a stir that's what we want just give it a stir and then and we'll be done just add some food coloring to it now because I've chosen strawberry flavor I wanted to have a strawberry color now what you want is 3/4 of a cup roughly of powdered sugar icing sugar confectionery sugar and put about half of it just spread it out a little bit and make a make a well in the middle pour the mixture straight into the middle so once this is sat here for three to five minutes at some of the sugar on your fingers sprinkle it over the top and start to mix it in as I said make sure it's not hot anymore as you fill yourself badly basically what we're going to do is need it this is the same way you would need bread will need dough so what you do is you keep kneading this this could take ten or fifteen minutes depends on how bubbly you want it so you keep kneading it like this over and over and once it starts to get a little sticky you add more of the powdered sugar and then you start adding the powdered sugar that you've still got left over so kneading is just basically bringing it forward and back on itself like this and then bringing it that way over the top forward back or all right the kneading parts pretty much done looks like a giant tongue so that's pretty good get a new a new surface to put this on and you can roll this with a rolling pin or you can just flatten it the way I am - this is just as effective now all you got to do is cut it up into whatever size pieces you want you can cut into long strips cut it this way so as you can see it's got the consistency of bubblegum I can pull it apart and I can stretch it and you know so looking yummy yeah you can cut them up into strips little things like that that looks pretty cool and it tastes great if you want more flavoring just add more of the flavoring you put in the essence the extract whatever you'd even had jello jelly crystals to it if you wish to add extra flavor well I hope you will enjoy this you try it so I might try a long piece I was pretty crappy one more I'll see you next time for my next meal if you want to check out some of my other videos just click on the links above and subscribe to my channels if you haven't already", "d5jwhbxlGC8": "which

would you think twice about it it's called cush the drug got a Miami Dolphins player arrested in Collier County this week and then he was cut from the team we sent NBC to investigator David Hodges to find out what it is and you know if these illegal drugs are hidden in plain sight being a big issue for parents and Peter the biggest danger is that they're far more pwned than anything parents may have seen or even tried when they were young so to help your kids we're gonna help you spot them at a quick glance you might not recognize it what does this look like to you ketchup pills that looks like marijuana syrup the final answer is correct Kush syrup found in the car of Miami Dolphins player and Collier County sold in a medical marijuana dispensary in California but not untouchable for kids in South West Florida pretty much everything through online channels you can figure out a way together Steven hill helps kids with substance abuse at Sal's care he says teens will try something like Co syrup just because it's new but I just think it's a different way to do it different and possibly more dangerous syrup has a thousand milligrams of THC the active principle of marijuana per bottle and if taken all at once 10 to 20 times what you're typically going against smoking a joy the side effects would be palpable a lot of times very erratic hallucinations and you can also get psychosis on a temporary basis so the the judgment and your behaviors are definitely impacted grown-ups don't know Lesley Robinson is founder of Street chicks and recovery which runs a marijuana adolescent prevention program in Lee County middle schools she also produces videos helping educate kids about some of the side effects of marijuana in products like Co syrup and it's so potent you're gonna be able to tell your child is high she says the best way for parents to spot these drugs is to pay attention to the new products on the market educate yourself on the other forms besides the bag and the smell the Collier County Sheriff's Office told us they don't recall ever making any arrests where this kind of syrup was down before but many of these drugs come and wave so the best advice for parents be on the lookout if you didn't buy it or authorize it question it for the NBC to investigators I'm David Hodges call email or download the NBC 2 news app and submit your tip now", "vc7L5MTYHWM": "this gun is still my favorite gum extra long-lasting flavor classic bubblegum you really can't find this in the store nowadays you might be able to find it in a couple large stores that maybe start with a W but nobody sells this stuff anymore it used to be available in the markets and the only place I can find it now is the Internet pick it up on the Amazon extra classic bubble they've got a whole bunch of different flavors I really should buy all the other flavors and try them the only thing is that when you buy it you get a whole bunch of gum and if you don't like a flavor you're probably gonna be chewing that flavor anyway for a couple months but that's okay this stuff is really good so I'm gonna be doing a review of the extra long lasting flavored classic bubble gum as I said I already get a review a couple months ago maybe six months ago when I bought the last batch for the patch before if you like my videos please do that thumbs up subscribe or like sorry about the like shadows here if somebody would donate to my channel ask my paypal info I would be able to get some lighting so I didn't have shadowing here but what can you do so if you have a product you

video or somebody chews gum for 10 minutes now if I was somebody famous and I posted this on the tuber within a couple hours this would have a million views and it would just go wild with me maybe I'll get two views in a year that's not right the only way I can become famous as if you make me famous so my fame is in your hands my future is in your hands mmm delicious tasting okay we got a long ways to go Wrigley's I didn't know Wrigley's have made extra gum I thought it was just Extra gum rickly Wrigley's extra long lasting flavor classic bubblegum 15 sticks of sugarless gum and that's why I buy this I almost swallowed this gum just now that's my problem I buy gum ever since I was a kid I'd buy gum I chew it for five minutes then I swallow it and then I go for another stick at nighttime I like to chew gum and I drink ice water the problem with ice water was when the ice water hits the gum that makes it hard kind of hard to chew gum when it's hard so break it apart swallow it then I grab another piece that's why I go through so much gum please please please don't send me messages don't leave comments without swallowing gum we heard that when we were a kid if you swallow gum it's gonna stay in your stomach it's gonna be this huge ball of gum and somebody's gonna have to go operate to take it out well nothing stays in your body like that I don't have a if that was true I'd have a ball of gum the size of a little bowling ball right now so we've got something's not right here I thought I'd press the the timer to count down ten minutes I think what I did is I put in ten hours okay I was wondering what the heck's going on here why isn't this thing going down I'm trying to talk with my mouth not moving much so I can stay into the frame of the camera so I think we've gone for four minutes almost and I was rambling for about a minute before he did the timer so we've got five minutes on here we'll go for ten minutes of gum chewing so let me look at the package we have 15 sticks of gum I'll get back to sugarless in the middle you know 15 sticks of gum and we have 10 packages total of 156 sticks so why am i back to sugarless gum well I went down to store and I bought some gum well somebody just saw my video of hedgehogs that I just posted dog Hedgehog toys one time to the store and I bought some regular gum not really thinking about it went to the den well then I started doing the flossing at night I'm wondering what the world is wrong with my teeth I got all this tartar all this build-up where is it coming from I didn't have that before I went to the dentist dentists did a cleaning and said yeah you're right you got lots of buildup there I couldn't figure out why I went home thought about it I went no wonder I've been chewing this sugar gum this regular gum all day long so it's really like just having sugar saliva in your mouth and that grows tartar and bacteria and all that other stuff that's in there so I threw that gum out I went out and I bought what did I buy I bought this Wrigley's extra long lasting flavor OOP almost swallowed again it's almost like a natural reaction with me I bought the shirt of this gum and almost overnight I noticed that all that junk wasn't building up on my teeth anymore then when I had a cleaning and the last cleaning I asked her about it and she says yeah he did a lot better than the time before so what I've been doing now is I've been chewing gum has really get to chew it's good if it's sugarless chew gum it helps create and make more saliva more saliva breaks down the back helps break down the bacteria in your mouth and when you break that down you lessen or limit your gingivitis your gum disease so chewing gum after a meal is actually really good it's better if you're flossing you brush the chewing gum is a really good thing you just got to be careful you don't want to cause yourself TMJ problems and then have jaw problem it's so don't overdo it okay I do and I know it's really annoying when people I don't like what Pablo and Clark would like oh my god that's so obnoxious so you don't want to mom when I'm grabbing you don't want to open your mouth all clapping tromping did you WAIS you women do that on the street oh god this is so nasty what other problems do they have so nice thing about the extra bubblegum is it's got a beautiful flavor and it's got an even better smell so if you just ate a burger with onions you're not gonna get rid of the onion smell but you start you on that bubblegum and people go wow that's smells so good really good if you were taking dance classes you pop a stick of bubblegum you keep them in your shirt pocket pop a stick of bubblegum in there and while you're dancing all the women go oh you smell so good they don't notice if you smell really good from cologne or scented soaps but boy do they notice this classic bubblegum smell because it reminds everybody when they were a kid you got bubblegum when you were getting your hair cut got bubblegum when you were good and it just smells really good in the dance classes they get up to you and go oh oh my god you smell so good would you like to get married and then divorced so I can have your house just kidding that was a joke there so this stuff is really awesome what do we have we are at well more people are seeing my Hedgehog video bought the rescue dog you check out my channel you see the videos on rescue dogs and lots of other stuff that I did I have posted fix-it stuff food gum and put a video on there the rescue dog and I just bought her some Hedgehog toys so that's why you're hearing messages in the background so we are now at about stuff tastes so good after I shut off the video camera I'm gonna go get ice water turn this into a really hard piece of gum and then swallow it and that is why I have to buy the big case because I go through 150 sticks all the time so we are 49 seconds away from at least 10 minutes and as I said please do that thumbs up subscribe like if

Penny shop product feature hey it's a Lucky Penny shop excited to make some bubble gum with my scientific explorer bubble gum factory this is a revisit video now I've asked in at least two videos for you to help me out and no one that I have seen so far maybe I might have missed the comments so if you did I'm sorry has updated me on things that I promised or said that I was going to do and then never got to now there's over 5,200 videos I know there's at least 10 instances where I said I would come back and do something I know there's a couple Crayola makers I need to do in a couple science kits this one of course I only made two recipes and I'll put the link if you want to go watch that first video I made the strawberry and the blueberry but there's some other fun mixes that I want to try so I will turn this around I spend more time on that first video with the Box I probably read some stuff I didn't watch the whole video I just wanted to see what I did in that one it says you can have as much fun chewing your experiment as you have making it sound weird with your bubble gum factor you'll make gobs of gum your own crazy concoctions or the fantastic flavor combinations that's what I want to do today so when I come back I will actually have everything ready to go start the kit so if you want to see all the pieces and what came with it originally go watch that first video then come back here so let's start making gum all right here we go I am all set now the other video I take more time to show you all the parts and get a little more involved on that level today I just want to make the gum so I already think sealed from the last video these are the little pieces of gum base this is what your melting so that's actually the first step so I heat one tablespoon of the gum base and then we're heading right over to the microwave so it's gonna be quick alright there's a nice tablespoon of gum base they want that in a cup that's you can throw away because you're gonna have a hard time getting all the sticky gum off so now head over to the microwave and we'll soften that up alright here we go from what I remember last time it took a lot longer then the 15 to 20 seconds and this is a different microwave so I'm actually gonna go a little bit longer than I did the last time so let's check it out let's microwave it and see how it changes all right let's check it out that was a little over 30 seconds and we'll see that says you can keep doing this now I have to okay so you see it's starting to melt alright so now I don't have the original wood stick that came with this so I'm just using the back of a spoon all right so let me cook this a little bit longer so what I'll do is I'll just get it to the right consistency come back and then we'll continue the process all right so this is the consistency we want smooth and creamy you know the corn syrup is next 1 teaspoon so you mix that in I think in the first video my corn syrup was also really hard so this is gonna be a little bit softer there we go I'm using a disposable spoon I don't want to use my other spoons that I have as I don't they don't want you to spend too much time trying to clean this all off all right here we go let's just mix this and it even says if it starts to harden up on you you can put it back in the microwave don't worry now it says you can add food coloring at this time so I'm gonna make the mint gum so I'm gonna add green for mint I don't know why Green just seems mean to me I could do blue but I made blue in the last video so I want to do a different color that was funny I think I had the lid the red lid on the green in the green lid on the red there we go I had two or three drops and if you have your own food coloring or natural food coloring or a different way to do it you sure can I could heat this up now I think it's gonna need a little bit more heating so let me do that I'm gonna heat it up come back and then next is I'm pretty sure you just add the the sweeteners so I got to add some of the powdered sugar and mix it up so I'll be back with that okay so that is set that little heating up really helped out tremendously so remember you can keep heating it up now we have some nice green gum now the flavoring all right I might have said the sweetener first but the flavoring you can put in we are gonna make what's called extreme mint so I was the gum base the syrup the three quarters of a teaspoon of mint so extreme mint and I would say mint like I'm saying mint three quarters of a teaspoon so here's half a teaspoon and then half of that smells good mix that in extreme mint mmm okay now it says add the flavor powder in the mouth call from the resident pour one tablespoon of powdered sugar over your mix and then here's where you're gonna mix it and then start kneading it and turning it into gum so this is your sweetener now okay and just mix that in then I just turn it over onto my board and I will be set and of course always wash your hands if you see my hands look discolored it's because there is green food coloring on there so once it cools it says don't forget that use your handstand either mixture much like you would do bread alright let's get this out here cool look how stringy that is you're gonna get messy there's just no other way to look in you have to get your hands dirty and sticky see this is why they want you to use disposable containers but let's see if I can scrape some of this out you gotta just get in there and dig in with your nails that's almost a whole piece of gum sitting there alright now like they say just need the gum and you could add more let me get in here now of this if you need to or your fingers and you want to try to get as much of that powdered sugar as possible lipstick it says while kneading break off a piece and taste it doesn't look nice and you can add coloring later instead too if you want to swirl the gum you can it's warm too it's almost like a it's almost like play-doh except stretchier watch nice and stretchy keep working on that extra sugar it says 10 or 15 minutes keep kneading till it's smooth and then it says after 10 or 15 minutes and minutes most of the powdered sugar should be used up the more you knead the gum the better it will be all right so I will check back I'm gonna keep kneading here I am gonna do more for you so and then I'll taste it all at the end I do want to taste a piece now let me sniff it you smell it the mint and if I wanted to make this a sour gum I would just take some of this citric acid I'll do that in the next one there's one called garbage gum or let me see there's one they are calling we won't use the other way they call it junkyard gum it's got everything in it it's got all the flavouring plus plus citric acid I will keep meeting and I will come back and then I'll be ready for a recipe number two I set this off to the side that will be back alright you know it worked good for mixing chopsticks and if you've seen my videos you know I've used them before so I am going to do a double batch this is a double batch so i can experiment a little bit with colouring I think I'm gonna try the squirrel gum today too while we're here and I'm not gonna come back and revisit this kid I promise you well if you liked it let me know in the comments okay there we go double batch which means it's gonna take more kneading I put a little extra corn syrup in there might have to heat it up again I didn't show you the microwave cuz I figured we've seen it now that video in this video at least once okay now here's what I'm going to do I am going to heat this up one more time well actually you know what I'm gonna mix in the food coloring and I'm gonna do something different here now my next one is the junkyard so I'm gonna do yellow cuz I want to try to swirl in other colors so I'm gonna turn this yellow and then I'm gonna swirl it but then also add all kinds of flavoring to it I want a nice yellow alright look at the change okay let me microwave this down so be nice I'll be right back alright look at that now it helps to have that little food coloring liquid in there it softens it up even nicer okay now the flavoring I said you can add flavoring later any time you want to add the flavoring you can do it because I can now take the gum I made here and then roll in the flavoring too to give it even more flavoring so let's see let's go back to the recipe now we are making junkyard 1/4 teaspoon of blueberry let me see another here's a half a teaspoon I gotta cut these open a little bit better I sell just half of this 1/4 teaspoon of watermelon oh that was sweet oh oh oh that was the watermelon all right quarter teaspoon of the blueberry they're all white so it's hard to tell what they are okay a little bit more on that one and then quarter teaspoon of the mint and then a quarter teaspoon of the citric acid so now I need to double since it's a double recipe there we go the powdered sugar so let's get this all mixed in I got yellow and green gum look how nice this looks so I can roll this cut this and make other types of gum pieces which I will okay let's get this all out of here for now I don't think I'm gonna do much with the flavoring I might roll that one in a little bit we'll see I remember those 1 a tablespoon of this now I need 2 tablespoons it really calls for 2 tablespoons each batch but you're using a bunch on your tabletop when you're kneading it so that's why you keep adding in the sugar it's gonna be a much bigger chunk of gum okay let's get this out here like we did last time that's so cool and stirring you look at that I still have bring down my fingers so I'm just gonna run with it now I have yellow food coloring okay I always like to scrape as much as I can but then again it takes time so I don't want to take too much time doing it look at that let me zoom in there so you can get a nice look after the gum sticky so basically I got a need in a whole nother two tablespoons technically of the sweetener now if you want to use natural sweeteners I'm sure you can just don't use the powdered sugar and try it there we go oh yeah that's gonna be good it's very warm to make sure it's not gonna burn your hands before you attempt to do this part of it I'm just squishing it in there now to make a twist that's what I'm anxious about I'm not anxious about excited about it says twisting twisting swirling shapes so you need the finished gum let's make a batch of your favorite gum do not add food coloring yet to make it solid now I wanted to add yellow because I want to add a second color that counters that so roll out the mixture flat so I got about 10 minutes of kneading here let me do that I will come back I'll try to use up as much of this powdered sugar as possible and just keep working that in there and when I'm set I will come back and then let's try this were an old technique off to grab another cutting board though all right back to cutting board one let me put a little powder down here and see a little green still on there wasn't much God says roll this flat that's a big one let me do this when I roll half of it how please think it's very pleasing to cut that oh why it just says flat it doesn't say how flat quarter of an inch 16 no niche eighth of an inch I when I watched the first video I had a really squeaky rolling pin I said I like squeaky rolling pins it's because I don't know just a unique sound when you get dead it squeaks weak weak weak weak this pin isn't doing it I still have that original rolling pin from the other video but okay there we go now using okay raw put a jaw drop a single drop of food cutting in the middle and fold it over pulling and twisting so let's say Bholu little drop right there okay fold it over pull and twist when they mean by twist do they mean this or like this wait it's coming out now I see I would think this is twisting here like this fold it over now and keep twisting and putting it's definitely got color the twisting part is not happening all right hmm roll the mixture flat again oh I don't think that worked the way I wanted it to work but let's just see what happens it's probably just gives you a striation of color in there it's also getting harder again so I don't know maybe if I soften this up a little bit in the micro which I can do let me do that and I'll be right back all right so 10 seconds made it super soft that's probably what I should have done they should have said soften up your gum a little bit before you do it now I'm gonna roll it out it says roll the mixture flat again take your cards oh so now let's just look oh yeah look so there is some nice color in there look at that scene so now that is my finished gum now I can cut that let's see so roll flat again take your cardstock out and cut some all shape so if I want to make a star gum I can look at that alright so that is yeah let me move this out of the way let's bring this cutting board and it still got powdered sugar on it a lot going on a lot going on no stuck a little on that end in the middle all right let me get something to here I'll use this okay there we go nice bed over there okay and then what I want to do with this one let's just roll this one out and make it round let's just make round gun with this one and then we'll dip it in the flavouring let's use a part of the cutting board that doesn't have green okay so now I'll have three different kinds of gum there we go all right so I'm gonna cut this in like a double bubble kind of gum it's a nice piece I want to eat a piece of gum there okay then I'll go get the green one so that one's set let me get a little temporary holder let's see they're not sticky okay so I move these into here there's gum one I'm gonna eat that little now I won't start chewing and then here was the first gum now this one is definitely hardened up which is okay it's actually retaining its shape now I'm gonna cut this into a strip I think and make it more like a Wrigley's type flat strip I think I made like a denting size square gone the last time but I want this to get really flat put a lot of pressure I don't get just to spread out and it is I don't want to put this in the microwave the microwave worked it's just don't do it for more than five seconds I did 10 seconds and it came out really soft and mushy so I had to kind of add a little powdered sugar to it to make it so I can handle it but it worked good look at that in the background doesn't look like a cool go you know be nice here a pizza cutter cut a nice strip that I don't have handy so let me go grab a pizza cutter all right so now let me make some strip gum yeah I'll do it this way gotta put my hand on this side and I'll give you a nice tight shot of the cutting okay so I'll cut this in huh that's kind of what happened my last video there about that size so let's just leave them like that oh that's a nice piece of gum so break with that close up let me do a quick lighting change here you know when you're working with different angles it's hard to always adjust the lighting correctly especially when you're not stopping there's another one all right so let me even this out here I'm not gonna definitely not gonna throw this away so worried about that gum I'm gonna make little Chiclets kind of dome oops Chiclets Chiclets I might as well just do them all like that I was thinking I get a longer strip cut but it's not working if I soften it just a little and then rolled it out it would but it's okay it's coming just eating all the scraps just eat them okay there is gum number two so I have a container I don't let me just put them all here for now I'll sort them out at the end I'm gonna come back here's some scraps let's bring this in now take a look at it okay it's hard enough really nice that in itself just looks like a cool gum doesn't it wouldn't you want to just eat that here's what I'm gonna do with this one now this one looks like a nice thin long strip of gum doesn't it you can see if I can get a few of these out of here right about here would you say that's about the size of a strip go I get one more out of this nice big one here okay I have what I need now I'll clean down come back show them all to you taste the scraps and wrap it up alright so I found my double bubble plate which was in my collection of plates not hey why not he I know it's not double bubble but and then I thought well let me organize it for you here so you can see the different comes I mean I was thinking this kind of looks like a double bubble doesn't it scraps okay now it said you can add flavoring to the outside so I brought I'm gonna bring in a little jar let me grab my scraps here so you can see what I have that I cut and remember so still edible and then let me bring in some extreme mint when I just put a piece in there and press it in the extreme mint there so now you've got that like sugary candy coating on the outside and I wanna do the citric acid oops oops there for this go look at that okay so you get that extra burst of flavor so that's my three gums for today which would you want to try the most if I was gonna do the swirl gum again I'd soften it up first but you still see that you get that swirling effect here we go I'm gonna through I'm gonna through I'm gonna chew all three I'll make a fresh piece of this so you can keep that one in your visual press that in there okay so now this is the true Ming dum minty the right you get that initial flavor which really takes over your mouth now I will say you get a little bit a hint of the gum base flavor all right that one's good let me try one of these but super sour just squishing I'm squishing it in the sour here we go whew that hits your heart mmm it's good it's like this one before that one the sour kills all the flavor so as far as being a junkyard gum I hasn't hit me yet because of the sour super-fun kid I got to tell you all right it's very tasty now the last one to strip them see the gum is still soft let's try this one here now with no sour on the outside just got the three different flavors plus sour in the gum so you get just a little hint too sour but I think what stands out the most is the mint mmm they're all pretty good for my own creation like I said though you get a hint of the gum base and the flavor can't really explain that flavor but you can taste it all right enough joy sorry I'm not gonna show you my chewed up gum but well wow it's three different colors all right forget it so there you go I

"YLbc3JCOtLA": "this was a great idea we left the foosball table out on the table that was in a box on the top shelf in your closet I know because there's in the box and they've been playing with the foosball table till 8:30 this morning show me your soccer skills or your foosball skills go way to go Kevin from the goal one point you right yeah if it doesn't have a handle you don't touch it Oh

Colton every night before sit please very night before bed in his favorite book right now is the yearbook and one of the pages and there is sister blowing bubble gum and he always asks what bubble gum is so we have some bubble gum and we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna start you're gonna open one up a little hard at first you want a four bit what are your mouth you want made nice and soft Sean thanks off don't swallow we need a lot of bubbles up sweet make a nice big bubble you know I got the papers laid out to the notions and find out his mouth first first try if it doesn't I'm gonna be very impressed so you know what you do now you do tell me you need to spread the gum over your tongue you ball [Music] give it one good blow bud little really hard maybe it'll work get right at the front your mouth right at the front of your mouth and blow if it flies out of your mouth that's okay it's not the end of the world okay it's stuck in your mouth gets stuck between his teeth I guess you didn't like it too much oh do you have to have quite so you can think yep we're boxing up the stuff they don't play with on a daily basis and they always find stuff and want to play with it then [Music]", "csCdjgWbtYI": "[Music] has that ever happened to you hi my name is dashi and I was an 88 GM now with my till you will never have to share another piece of gum again I'm closer to the camera now step number nine I know what you're wondering - you were steps 1 through 8 don't worry about that step number 9 if you have a fresh pack of gum remember to open it at home you don't want to open it at school why you ask number 1 the plastics they make a lot of noise remember when you're in classrooms all noises are 50% louder always look both ways before our wrapping our fresh pack of gum but don't make too much noise see he knows he gum see I told you now let's move on to step 38 inserting a piece of gum into your mouth now remember when you're in class everybody's watching you Dayna now better to do you like it now so you cannot just casually insert a piece of gum into your mouth you will be seen again good job looking both ways before unwrapping a piece of gum however you never open up a piece of gum in plain sight see now that mother would want a piece - looks like I was right again tisk tisk tisk now allow me to show you the proper way to insert a cup into your mouth now pay very close attention to the under the desk cam as you can see he's being very very quiet and very very cautious as he removes that gun from the wrapper now what you want to do is slowly ease that gum all the way up your body making sure that no one is looking at you okay now that you know know what's looking stick it in your mouth okay he enjoyed that a little bit too much but if done correctly you're bound for success stop stop smiling like that for real stop no I'm serious see that actually what now if you join the program I will be teaching your other techniques such as not be met again pay close attention to the under the desk and as you can see the gun is already removed from the wrapper place it on your arm raise it up slowly now place it on the desk looking around making sure no one is looking at you and there you go success does he doesn't really have to look at the camera like that after remember everyone falls asleep in school there is nothing suspicious about that now let's move on to step negative six straight up live now in this case make sure all your lives are ready to go before you get to school watch oh I can't my grandma just died there you go that's kind of [ __ ] up see it works now keep in mind most packs only common 15 pieces our research and development team has been working on a formula that would help you divide the pack so it will last you all day please know in some cases you may have to split gum in half don't believe these methods work here is a testimony for one of our clients ever since I got on the Dashie program I've never had to share another piece of gum again see it worked for him all eyes are open 24 hours a day one 800 [Laughter] you're not seeing things that's right I'm giving away all my secrets here's a bonus tip the dummy pack now in this case go ahead take your gum out front everybody put it in your mouth pause oh wait he wants peace go ahead give them one let me tell you why cuz what you just gave them was that wack gum you know the one that tastes great for like five seconds then the flavors all gone that's all right you can share down don't know but seriously why do they even make that pact I don't understand why now remember results will vary there are some times where you are gonna have to give up the gum let me show you mmm I sure would like a piece of gum right now and my breath is hot let me go ahead and take it out of the wrapper alcohol oh wait wait a minute what is that a gun yep you know you don't but go ahead give them the whole pack don't be stupid I mean yeah go taste good but it's not worth losing your life over take it from me I died two years ago because I don't want to give up the gun [Music]", "FggEKMJz_Dg": "hey guys hello hello hello this is um our gamer and welcome to this evening's bubble gum bubble gum bubble gum chewing gum ramble currently it is really hot here in the uk sweltering swelteringly hard yeah really really hot um but i wanted to sit down and film a bit of a ramble a bit of a chewing gum ramble and of course we do have a helicopter a cup with decaf decaf americano decaf americano decaf decap americano a very nice cup of coffee as well so we are going to be chewing on some extra extra peppermint gum in this 60 piece bottom [Music] and it smells particularly minty so i i just i it's one of those how many is enough usually when i have gum chewing in like a background video like it's not a gum during specific video i usually have like just one so as we're doing it specifically for country and rambling and i've just realized i can't really enjoy a cup of coffee while i'm chewing gum but we'll see so we have one yeah so after checking if the microphone was recording because i've done many a video juicing off put that back in there any more than do won't be able to chew just be sort of slocking it around but hey that's way to click clears your sinuses are strange like there's like this mindy frosty chill when i breathe for my nose randomly pretty pretty pretty pretty random random a pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty random so um yeah this is just going to be um chat about random stuff really so what's been going on to be honest today has been quite a cool day it's uh four o'clock um and all day today i've been filming a sort of day in the life of video kind of like a vlog but not really well kind of like a vlog but like i've got a day in the life of a day tomorrow so that'll be the title just because hopefully sounds catchy and you won't have seen it yet this is actually coming up for you guys i have to get in my head when you'll see each video because like so many of these videos are just scheduled for like a month in advance just like i'm trying to think okay i'm just gonna attempt them not that bad um so yeah doing a day in my life i've been filming on my phone just because the easiest way to sort of you know that sort of cringe cringey cringy so yeah all morning since i woke up woke up at nine i've just been filming what i've been up to you know editing went for a walk it's really hot so if i'll go for a walk which is really nice it's really good tapping sound is doesn't it they're quite gentle top stuff with top stuff there so yeah so i've been filming that i filmed about half of it and um it's currently rendering the first half um but it's pretty cool that really is pretty cool like so you can see kind of what i could do day to day crutch fairly routine what i've been doing but you might find interesting there is a bee update actually in that video so if you guys are interested in my beekeeping my busy busy busy busy busy beekeeping there is actually an update portion in that where we go and see the bees that's pretty cool yeah like i said really what i've been up to today um i got some more university marks back and um mixed bag mixed mixed bag i got i got the mark today was i smacked up which is i got 70 on a collection of essays which is a first so that's good and then i've gotten two two ones and then this group report i did with uh my mate we we kind of bombed it and got two dues on this timing was quite rogue anyway um so but with our universities um safety net policy where you can't get lower than your first semester's average like you can't do worse than what you did in your first semester in terms of your overall grade um unfortunately i'm i'm safe on a 2-1 that's good um i think i find out i'll start july in a couple weeks but by the time this comes out i may have already graduated actually by the time this video comes out it's the um what's a day today can i get a show now ill only i've got a timer on and that's no use um okay but i think it's the 15th i said the 16th of june it's mid-june um yeah but this won't be coming out it's coming out like the 24th of july just been like really productive um and obviously i've heard any videos so like i have to come out i was sort of like not time sensitive but yeah time sentence like i've got an unboxing coming up i'm unboxing the last of us do now obviously i want that to come out like the day after the game comes out rather than it coming out at the end of july and yeah it's been really good and it's been good because i need to start looking for flats soon i need to start looking for flats um because i start work in september i'm going into digital digital digital digital marketing digital marketing no idea why i did that embarrassing yeah and i'm i believe i'm gonna be living with an old school friend of mine who's also down in the same city uh doing a sort of uni conversion uh course for law so i'm gonna be spending my first year down there living with him that's gonna be good because like moving to a new city yeah being able to move in with like an old school friends really good flight your first gym that'll get you settled in rather than having not only like a completely new city completely new work environment and then on top of that completely new people in your house and like i did do that on my placement yeah and it was brilliant yeah it turned out really great i made some amazing people my housemates were top class but i just think it's a bigger shout like the opportunity came up so it seems foolish not to uh not do something like a flats do better flats yeah okay it's the 15th yeah so today's monday the 15th because all the shops are open now um so as our part of our sort today all non-retail stores um not all retail stores non-essential retail stores can open because beforehand it was only like essential shops so your supermarkets etc now everyone can be open pubs are still shop and restaurants because whilst it's opening up you still have to like maintain the distance you can't like stay in and congregate on and like cafes restaurants bars pubs are still unopened i think in like two weeks i think at the start of july um they'll start opening up obviously time will tell if this video is correct or not and in each of these videos where i'm filming here i go let us know down in the comments if you like this filming area but it's like i'm not gonna actually see those comments for a while and then on top of that it'll be a while before they get integrated but i do hope you like you like um like it being filmed in i've got the lamp on in the background just because it's really bright out daylight um i don't complain like you know you're burning western energy but it's it it's quite an important light because i think it provides a bit back light bulbs it softens it because uh more of an orangey orange orange orangey uh filming here because you get to see like cool like gaming uh stuff that i own yeah my wii u hm my wii u collectors editions obviously the borderlands psycho the bottle and psycho mask and then books and then obviously all the stuff on that back one but yeah it's just been yeah quite good i'm making videos i think i'm going to make a kfc mukbang video soon that will be fairly really really exciting um but again i might be filming on my phone like it's straight recently i started incorporating more filming on my phone like the drive i filmed on my phone this sort of vlog filmed on my phone and um yeah stuff in the car my mukbangs and stuff in the car i film on my phone just because it makes the most logical sense like i can't set up the camera in this in my car look a bit mental and to be fair the camera quality is really good on the iphone and the audio the microphones you know decent like okay annoying i was going through the footage that i captured from like this day in the life this morning and obviously when we went out for a walk i went out for a walk to the top of the airline like across fields and um and such but it's a little bit windy like cut out segments and try to smooth it out because it was just like proper luck but without this cover on it's like i'm really not that nice i like the quality isn't that good oh it's hot really hot interesting i'm just in soft lounge where today you know i apologize for not dressing up for you guys um i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry sorry sorry sorry finished another book today people some of you were asking about my goodreads uh goodreads is a book app where you can sort of like follow people i think but um yeah if you so this is mine i set it up at the start of um lockdown so i'm now just starting a book called the line in the unicorn this is a book um i got at christmas and i just never got around to reading it but i put it in my pile of rotation books uh where if you don't know i've got uh six books any one time in a in a stack i'm gonna finish a book i'll do a random number generator and that'll select the book out of that pile of six that i've read next and i'll whittle them down till i've read the whole pile and then i'll get a new six in and typically i pick free books from my existing book collection that i ever want to reread or i haven't i never got around to reading and then i get three new books in so half and half old and new this is one of the old ones i've actually got some new books coming that's going to be part of the unboxing video that's coming out um yeah it would have been out for a while now a couple weeks a good few weeks nearly a month actually pretty much a month before you see this one but because it's just really cool because hey you can track your sort of reading progress i haven't actually started this book so it's a zero percent but you can also track all the books when it loads of course when it loads yeah uh all the books so these are the books that i've read in lockdown if you're after any sort of book recommendations these two really really good um i like the vagabonding small giants was brilliant that was good it's difficult to read but really good super but all these books were fantastic that was actually a bit weak yeah pretty cool um i might just check something i am just i sent myself any amount this is the from now for this video what came out quite cool i used to call effect on the photoshop express app actually that looks pretty cool as a thumbnail who knows let me know um yeah that's all i've been up to really looking forward to the last let's do coming out gonna be streaming that streaming warzone tonight with subscribers that's gonna be really fun do you really enjoy doing these streams with you guys it's like a really cool way i like we've got a really good group it's just like really cool and open and stuff and like everyone just has really good crack and ridiculous conversation it's just quite a fun time um if you're new like and subscribe get your notifications for when the live streams and get yourself involved it's good fun but no like i said um it's just really nice to be able to make these videos really i'm like you guys watch him i think always i think towards the end of the stream i think in no small part because i get tired because i start streaming at 10 and i stream for a few hours at a time to like one i get quite sentiment on my own i love you guys that's addict you guys are you know spawn um i'm watching the channel and stuff so big thank you to you guys kind of think yeah there's nothing really else made you're going down um are they looking forward to playing the last of us too as we get epic um reviews the ps5 looks really cool yeah that'd be as fun i've spoken about the ps5 ps5 um one of the big things about that the console looks really cool really cool design i'm not sure what the price point is going to be obviously there's two consoles i see digital edition and then there's the normal edition where it takes physical media it's going to be really interesting to see the price point i imagine they'll be about 50 pounds 50 quid 60 dollar discrepancy between the two likely uh 50 pounds of deer to get the one that can take the physical media if i had to catch it's clearly that they're making me sort of encouraging push towards doing everything digital um i thought resident evil 8 looked really really good resident evil village that looked glass some people um i had us listen to the ign podcast and they were talking about iris north village and they were sort of uh saying it could act well it looks like fantastic as a standalone game there is clearly a heavy link to resident evil 4 you know it's clearly saying that sort of eastern european atmosphere's got the castle the village village so it could be a really cool neat way of setting up a resume before remake because they're obviously really keen on these remakes there's a remaster that has more of a remake is that a remaster they're quite different to their originals yeah with resident evil 2 and 3 remakes well it would make sense um if since resident evil 8 is going down this direction of similarities resident evil 4 but if they weren't already then it would set up nicely for a residue for remake in like i think residual eights coming out next year is it this year is it twenty twenty one twenty one i'm sure but then you know that you did the year later yeah after that you did like the remake business ideas money money money money money money money money mo la mo la la mom like i've never actually played any ratchet and clanker games so that's always nintendo and xbox growing up it looked really cool looked colourful not really lots of cool elements to do it obviously it's a kids game but look like a fun adventure game nonetheless hey and the show had lots of indie games like spider-man miles morales looked really cool i never played spider-man ps4 spider-man like my housemates did last year and they said that they they raved about it um i could only spam i i had a spider-man game when i was like a kid on the gamecube where you started off um without the full spider-man costume and then you have to do like a fight and then you became spiderman you got the full costume your web slinging web website it's good with your lights and like tie your enemies up really cool but i think it looks really really cool i have the graphics on the ps5 look slick slick slick so that really cool to check out i'm unlikely i don't think i'll get on day one i might wait for christmas get at christmas or i don't know i'll be working so it depends on my situation is yeah so unless you sell your ps4 uh to have it against the ps4 and put it against the cost of a ps5 like the price is gonna be interesting as well how much it's gonna be you know in next-gen um if you think the ps3 was like 499 when it came out and but i think sony must have learned from that because they lost that generation heavily to the xbox 360. because the xbox 360 was so much more affordable um and then because then ps4 sort of like got it right with this generation the ps4 got it right at the price point and one because i had a better experience if that's debatable for i know i've got a lot of xbox fans don't worry guys i love the xbox one i had that before the playstation yeah over to that massive xbox fan gear was my favorite one of my favorite video game series ever ever ever but just be interesting to see what the price is some of the game listings are like the 60 quid standard for games so it's like our games are not gonna be more expensive ah yeah i should probably save this for like a video game specific debate to be the conversation or video game ramble a video game ram i'll do it on the ps5 yeah i'm clearly going insane i'm doing accents okay guys i hope you enjoyed this rambo if you did please leave a like on this video it really does help uh with the algorithm and all that stuff and just let me know that this sort of video that you guys do like to see and if you're new yeah please subscribe join the team and uh yeah get notifications and stuff um because i love content and mainly guys i just hope you guys had a good one i've had a good time i know things could be stressful things have been stressful so these videos in some way can help you out you guys should chill out that's the main thing you know taking time to look after yourself to focus on here it's all right so i had to just take a step back and chill with breathe you know calmly inhale exhale so i hope you guys are all doing really really well i look forward to seeing you in that the comments and uh yeah see you soon so lots of good night", "Vszf_JaTusA": "hey everybody how you

when I'm at work I do a lot of speaking on the phone talking to customers what have you so I like to keep the breath you know feeling fresh and it also keeps them off my mouth nice and moist so you know I don't get dry mouth when I'm talking to people so just want to show you this is my absolute favorite gum I like spearmint also like the cinnamon variety comes in this handy little dispenser it's little plastic dispenser you can put this in your cup holder in your car is really handy so this is what one of them looked like and for scale I guess we can put it up against a UH a binder clip a large binder clip that's how big they are and I'll bite one in half and then you can see what's on the inside the outside is speckled and candy coated but these are sugar-free invite the middle and immediately it's just so tasty delicious and juicy oh my goodness I throw good so that's my piece for the day what I do is I have one piece that I add every day and it's so flavorable flavorful that you can actually hold on to this gum and chew it for a really long time and we'll just go ahead and reference my file we got a gun file right here and right here we're just I save it in a little plastic bag here and that's so it's pieces of gum I added one a day for the past about seven days now and you can see I mean look how juicy it is even in the bag that's insane no we're gonna go ahead and pop that in oh my god so good that's so good okay um I'm have to give it two thumbs up four Mentos sugar-free pure fresh gum now I'm pretty much at the end of my business day now so we're gonna go ahead and file that way back into the gum file as always this is Ryan for silly reviews I really appreciate everyone who watches over well over a million views now over a thousand subscribers it's great again Ryan for silly reviews.com thank you for watching [Music]", "jEZ-pAB4xvo": "hello guys so this is the Center fruit and center fresh this is the watermelon flavor liquid filled gum the prize is one rupee and one rupee so first I open the center couth watermelon flavor Black's open this so this is a watermelon flavor now we open the center", "1mikMVtWhhc": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] you hello everybody and welcome to another edition of Drew's feed reviews and today I've got another episode of Candyland it's gonna be for Easter time and maybe I'll put it on Easter who knows anyways I was in my grocery store I think it was a Walmart looking down the holiday aisle hopping down the holiday aisle and ran across these and I thought what the heck you know this is weird kind of wacky I thought it would be a fun little thing for a review I mean this is kind of unique and it seems like one year they did have edible Easter grass it was like licorice strips it was like green apple and instead of grass it was like this edible stuff you could put in the basket and just kind of weird but I found this by carousel that says Easter grass bubblegum so yeah there's a bunny blowing a bubble and it says strips of fruit flavored bubble gum and for oh wow 20 sir eight pieces is 10 calories so and what about like calorie a piece like shredded this is gonna be kind of like big big league chew but this is gonna be bubblegum so anyway give this a tear here [Applause] Wow I control you smell that all this green that's green I didn't even know that so it's like fruits dried yeah there we go little strips of bubblegum it's like green grass I guess you could put this in your Easter basket so here you go yeah and Easter grass there we go I kind of try a little bit of this Easter grass bubblegum okay it's so - we have the big league chew plantation figure out what it tastes like it's a fruit stripe but there's like a fruit punch flavor it's not sour apple it's not watermelon I'm just like a light fruit flavor kind of combination over everything I'm kind of fun you got kids or a few cop relatives maybe the kids like to have their Easter stuff in their basket this would be cool good bunny in chocolate bunnies all that stuff so let's see preach it pretty soft does make a good bubble hopefully once I get it all going here we're all close to the big league chew they still have that by the way it's like a different flavors apple grape bubble gum blueberry kind of the same way but this one's just for Easter time cute clever package with the little bunny I mean there's bubblegum goes it's fun so if I had to give a rating for this one for the novelty for the flavor for the value I think this was like a dollar so all that put together this is cute idea I'll give that one seven I have eleven coupon will come be fun to have for kids for relatives or you know just if you're someone that likes to celebrate Easter on your own so I done done a Walmart can give it a try they'll probably have a lot of it after Easter time maybe on closeout they had quite a few they go half off afterwards Oh if you're a fan of Easter candy and you want to have a little bit of fun pick up some and give it a try at least for the hop for the Easter season you know get him with a bunch of other things put in their kids Easter baskets so anyway there you go I thought that was just a fun little thing to do and I thought you guys would like to see what that was that what kind of holiday stuff they have for the Easter time and anyways so if you liked the video give a

Dru's food reviews when i'll be trying something new i'm Grassi for you put these aside and i'll try a little bit later so till next time I'll talk to you guys later and talk to you guys later [Music] you", "J0mFEpBr_gw": "[MUSIC PLAYING] You are the worst\nkind of person. Oh, wait, that's actually\nkind of a pretty lip color. Rachel, that's such\na weird thing to say. Nobody thinks like that. Hey guys, it's Rachel. What? What's going on? And I decided that\nI wanted to do DIY lipstick out of bubble gum. That's just something\nthat I wanted to do. Unfortunately, that doesn't\nexist anywhere on the internet. So I decided to\nget all scientific and make my own DIY of it. It took three packs of\ngum and two bags of gum. But I figured-- and if you want\nto get behind the scenes things in my videos then\nadd me on Snapchat. My Snapchat is rclbeauty101. [FINGER SNAP] I also just reactivated\nmy Facebook fan page. So, I will put the\nlink down below. Comment down below\nwhat color lipstick you would make if you made it. And let's get on with the video. [MUSIC PLAYING] OK, you're going\nto need some gum. I like the Double\nBubble kind, because it has a good texture\nfor this-- trust me, I used alot-- and then some\nVaseline, and food coloring. Just take two pieces of\ngum, one scoop of Vaseline-- the Vaseline is just to make\nthe gum texture not very sticky and gum-like--\nand whatever color food coloring you want. I wanted purple lipstick,\nso I'm mixed some colors and made purple. Put as much food\ncoloring as you want depending on how pigmented\nyou want the lipstick. Put that mixture in the\nmicrowave for 30 seconds. After 30 seconds, mix it up. Then put in the microwave\nfor another 30 seconds. Aloe is not patient when\nit comes to microwaves. [BLEATING] It's OK. It'll be out soon. [MICROWAVE BEEPING] See it's out now. Stir up the product, and\nthen find an empty lipstick container. And put the product\ninto the container. Put that in the\nfreezer for 5 minutes. Then take it out,\nand you're all done. You are now the only person you\nknow that actually has lipstick made out of bubble gum. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, I broke the lipstick bottle. Oh, no. I really, really broke it. It won't even twist. Got it. Ooh. [MUSIC PLAYING] This is weird. Oh. So I think I actually\nenjoyed this video. If you just [INAUDIBLE]\ntwo videos clips that's down below and\nsubscribe right over there if you're not [INAUDIBLE] ready. Love you guys so much. Bye. [BLOWS KISSES] [BUBBLE POPPED] [LAUGHTER] I'll lick your fingers, and\nI'll push this back in it after.", "A33eULzSfXg": "oh no I want gum but I don't have any money what oh look I just found this gum randomly on my table it is Lily's famous chewing gum let's see what's inside oh look they got all different flavors like cherry and grape let's try this one what so cool go check out Lily's chewing gum available at 4 Locker number hey guys it's me Lily and welcome back to my channel so today I'm going to making the chewing gum a lab and this is a kit I got so in the box it says make natural chewing gum for trees yeah it says learn about science and here says geeking company science with a little dude he's candy that's what it's gonna look like I'm super excited and I can take this school and it'll be my very own gum your snack so now we'll be opening it and here it is inside not much so it comes with the tip in here and it's a plain metal tin and you probably like decorate it yourself I bet and oh it has all the things on the back but I'm going to show you from the inside so here's the pamphlet and it is all about how to make the gum it shows you science experiments see with the gum but we won't be doing that today we'll just be making the gum tells you the history of gum it tells you all our experiments and tells you what palmer's are and this is how they get the gum from trees this is all about chewing gum and phase the phases of matter and then just how sweet is it science so it's like science about the chewing gum next thing is the sheets and this is like the wax paper there are going to be good putting our gum on next thing is this big baggy full of cherry flavored grape flavored the gum base which is these little guys so if you're gonna make them at home you gotta get all these supplies the sugar powder and oh this is so cool um we really don't know what this is what is in the corn syrup and it's so like clear and gooey my hands are it it's like slime okay next thing is the stickers to decorate your tin with and more stickers to decorate your gum packages with so here's making your chewing gum and you can pause on any part to this to get to the gum and down the next page wait a flat myself okay here's the next page and here is this over here until you how to cut it so now we're gonna get started so now I dusted my cutting board with powdered sugar now I'm going to cut open my gum base and equally distribute between the distribute it between these two goes way down the feeling dang it I'm just going to pour it on here and then down distribute it so there are two bowls because there are two flavorings there is grape in there as sherry and so this was probably gonna be grape and this one's gonna be cherry someone put that front so use containers that you're gonna throw away after because the gum base is really hard to get out of it after you microwave it which we are going to do so what you're going to use these and we're probably gonna throw them away afterwards see here's what it looks like all melted and then kinda looks like caramel or applesauce and so this is the first one so I'm adding half the powdered sugar in one whole flavor package and cherry the hard project and now we'll be taking half of the corn syrup packet which we just melted in a single hot water so I don't think I don't know if what it's supposed to look like exactly because the um pamphlet shows a brown blob so my car looks like baking dough which this is what it looks like and I'm pretty sure I don't know this looks like that bubblegum after it loses all of its taste and I are supposed to knead it together like slime on your thing now what I have to do is I have to break it into three balls bring the balls out like this so now I have to cut it after I formed it like the Bubblegum people do on here I tried so now I'll be cutting it I'm gonna do this piece first like this big that's an end piece I cut off this end good nice oh yeah that is some good um oh yeah mm-hmm this won't talk about now I'm gonna be trying the ends to see what they taste like oh my god I love this taste like oh it's so familiar all right so like wedge it's like I was like when y'all like on Halloween when those candies that come in like the wax things either it's like the wax bottles or it's like the wax long things and you bite it and you rip it off sometimes you chew on it it tastes like that both flavor it is a lot like cherry not like wrong cherries but you know like gum we're cherries in it I don't taste like it would probably last for a while so it's like oh yeah because in my mouth but it's kind like falling apart like it's not saying together I think it's really hard like it's not like a good piece of gum but I like it like I don't eat it so it's kind of cool because like I made it and like I've never made gum before so now I'll be showing you to wrap it so what I would do is start over here and start rolling it at the same place and twist the sides and you got your piece of gum okay so this is cherry so I'll be labeling it don't cover up the opening now that'd be bad oh it seems that I have to cover up the opening okay I'll cover them there it is yay okay now we'll be doing the gum container and it seems like you could have all different kinds of version of gum and you're right and you can write your name of your company on there if you want to have one and so mine is gonna be this pink one many two things I'm gonna put a berry here today there's strawberry I mean there's cherries grape there so people know there's grape it's cherry they're grape there yeah we think you might come inside now you can go start a black market at school for your own chewing gum um you could sell it to people on the street you could start like a lemonade stand but instead of a lemonade seeing a gum stand and have your own advertisement or your own billboard so thanks for watching this video I really like taking gum but I don't like the gum as much as I like making it because it does taste like wax at first and it tastes like flavor and then I feel like five minutes it doesn't taste right and so I prefer it away but I really do like the idea that you can have your own gum kit and that it's like available to kids and so that super pup lotta learning stuff in here and experiment that's cool too so see you next time bye [Music]", "6jvI0k1H0OI": "BOY: Look, over there.

kiss but then no you sit up", "KnX7hzwyYkA": "[Music] hi i'm kat and welcome to spaceship since spice I came across this candy kit called bubblegum factory this is a candy kit by scientific Explorer and it says learn the science behind gum and it makes over eight different recipes in the back it says with your bubble gum factory you'll make gobs of gum your own crazy concoctions or other fantastic flavor combinations that is so neat ok let's take a look inside corn syrup gum base citric acid blueberry extreme mint watermelon and the instructions these are the instructions and right away it's a really interesting instruction manual so here's a little bit about the science of bubblegum and the science of chewing also a brief history of gum it's quite interesting actually and here are the recipes I've decided to try to make the junkyard gum it has blueberry watermelon and mint flavor as well as the sugar and the sourness so I think that's going to be really interesting this is the gum base here's the sugar and the watermelon packet this is the watermelon flavor and that's what it looks like and just doing this I can smell the watermelon it smells so good Wow it's a really strong watermelon smell so if you like watermelon you're gonna love this this is the mint one extreme mint it's cause it smells very minty whoa blueberry it doesn't smell as good as the watermelon one this is the citric acid [Music] I'm gonna add the gum base cover it with water now this has to go in the microwave for 15 to 20 seconds so I'll be right back now that the gum base is warmed up I'm gently going to pour the water out and the gum the gum base should be soft enough to start working with there's some corn syrup now it's time to add the flavor I'm making the junkyard gum so it's a little bit of all the flavors combined so here's some watermelon blueberry I also add some powdered sugar I have never had gum with mint and with fruit to combine so this is going to be very interesting try to get all the sugar into the gum all the flavor [Music] this is I'm supposed to do this for a really long time it actually looks a lot more like cookie dough right now then it does look like them well it smells really fruity and minty well it smells really good a lot of meeting will make your gum extra chewy I like bubble gum that's chewy it reminds me a little bit of making bread except for adding flour you have to add sugar I'm gonna get the food coloring out now so I'm going to add some blue [Music] [Music] and I'm gonna add some green and a little bit of red give me figures and then I'm going to turn it into gumballs I'm gonna roll them into little gumballs oops okay so here are my finished creations I'm going to add some citric acid to make them sour I love sour candies I love sour gum so I think these are gonna be really good looks pretty cool and these are the junkyard gumballs that I made I didn't stop there though I also made watermelon gums sour blueberry gum and these ones here are called cool candy kiss it's a mixture between watermelon and MIT actually like these ones the look of these ones the best because of the pink and green twirls I think that's pretty cool and I am going to try the junkyard gum mmm it's really good so there you have it mr. bubble gum factory DIY Kent the cool thing about this is there are so many different flavors and types of gum you can make different shapes you can makes our gums sweet gums mints berry gums it's really cool and it's tons of fun thanks for watching bye guys [Music]", "YEmI9Z-J_t4":

Islam you know strong flavor I probably can you know get the bad breath away no I don't know I can't really say what it tastes like you know a little bit like a blister it tastes strong it's a little harder than you know the other gums made like these all this not like the Trident is kind of harder all right we need this here we got next mmm what's next okay let's do the great taste of chicklets fruit flavor and peppermint gum all right unless you uh want to be a winner tonight I can open you mmm here we go all right this is an easy opening here we go that's white pepper mint mmm Tristan my heart gum I'll have it sugar-free mmm no it's not so if I didn't have done it has sugar in it ingredients right there and it has a strong flavor peppermint and then a sugar-free um to read it I won't know I know like basically chew chew gums like this often just for safety of cavities you know and this one is a sure you also sugar nut sugarless but it has sugar in it so this is a food flavor so let's taste that Oh different colors pretty nice okay mm-hm Sam um hardness in it you know but yeah it's fruity so orange so if free gum I'm only a fan not I'm not not saying that fruity gum I'm not a fan of go back to that we want it and fully gummies are good but when it's not sugarless and not always no and I would go for the most oh um so now Eclipse let's taste this spearmint and this is sugar-free much easier open slides right out I don't it's a hard gun off the bat yeah spearmint yeah Eclipse is good yeah I have a strong taste of spirit mm-hmm all right now something different extra classic bubble and it's long to that lasting flavor I'm excited to see this I don't wanna see what it tastes like - there you go easy opening I like when I don't struggle with opening the candy hey ego I like these made like that reminds me of France most of the gums I made like this and your friends yeah it's a soft gum is sugar-free that's a definite thumbs up yeah yeah my favorite so far we have a winner extra whoo ha happy for that what about this experiment sugar-free as well and these are cubes this is gonna be a another different product that's seen all right mm cubes made in cubes in the Wow look at that made in cubes and it's a gum so I'm gonna taste one yeah mmm cooling there felt like that I really feel like a cooling sensation and it's sugar-free Wow Wow nice refreshing man well it is a long-lasting flavor but it doesn't take over the extra notice a second second one yeah definitely you get the second position let's freshen up some more with cinnamon gum is it sugar-free I'm not sure about that no it is I don't think it is mm yeah it has sugar in it all right so open it and I'm gonna open it and I'll tell you about it yeah so that way you can have a preview and you may want to try these mhm yeah look at them um freshen up oh this is me done like it has that little thing inside oh wow I had a little fruit and in the middle I can't really see it yeah you can if you oh look it's coming out see that and that's really good like the cinnamon cinnamon flavor that's pretty good I have a strong taste of cinnamon mm-hmm alright that as it's not sugarless I'm not really and I can't really put it up over the sugarless gum but it's it's not a bad product you know it definitely better than the Trident mmm definitely better than the trial so what's next on that I didn't should try this yeah ice let's see probably refreshing as well hmm yeah Wow I don't know what flavor is this but who Wow strong sensation uh-huh but it's not everyday thing for me this is not something that you want every day well it's a good product it is sugar-free as well mm-hmm but if you got if you guys like this um you know refreshing sensation that ice and yeah you know if you want to do this for bad breath you can definitely go for this I will change your breath instantly yeah the bad breath so this is a bubblicious strawberry all right let's taste this open it on and give it a try all right packaging is sticky not cool mmm like I said before if you've seen my videos I'm not really a fan of products like this one candy sticks to the paper no mean it's not pretty cool it's not cool at all oh but I give it a try mmm all right I'll taste it half is soft No yeah kind of soft has a flavor strawberry definitely it's five pieces in there lettuce has sugar I use a big huge Bubblegum's yeah so they're different like the French Malabar I don't know if you know of the Malabar that's like a French you know fats chewing gum if you make big bubbles these are the ones well they're not going to take over the extra and ice cubes but not bad for these kind of these products yeah but look the thing is that the paper shouldn't be sticking like this so say there's a cheap made product you know like day that the company is not investing a whole lot in it that's the sad part but I'll definitely want to try our own a huge grape chewing on takes over the whole mouth that they only have room topping mm-hmm I just focus on to Anam and make bubbles haha and I'm gonna ah take it off but whoa huge hahaha I had to show you this and another freshen-up product and we almost there so we have a winner so far which is extra I'm really uh impressed by that because it's like I'm pretty good uh you know gum the gum is perfect actually extra Oh first of all Apple not a spearmint look like Apple I thought it was apple experiment like the same size as that you seen like the same kind of the arm which you've seen before you know you'll have that up see that Wow pretty cool right mmm yo has that Spearman flavor from that liquid inside but it is not sugarless oh no I wouldn't like you know do it to my kids I'll always look I only have one one kid but if you have kids I don't think you you probably yeah yeah you don't want to give them sugar sugar candy or sugar sugar the gum and this one is also that the tropical bubblicious bubblicious is pretty cool oh this one

watching that what else I have I've tasted everything thank you for watching oh this one more actually the sour apple I didn't taste the sour apple is the big bubble gum to bubblicious and it's

you extra is the winner thank you for watching please subscribe have a good day bye", "uKFcwKxwhJk": "oh hi hi welcome to Globex have a seat for me we'll get started yes I see here that each other you worked at a local bank here in towns all right yep uh you know I'm gonna see I mean they drive through I cash your checks first your chewing gum and then you're pulling on it let's just all time be as obnoxious as we can let's see if we can hire it that way so I see you worked at a local bank uh I worked there for about five years um well people came and I would cash their checks count them count the cash the what I couldn't hear you behind all that smacking listen people gum is an unacceptable thing to have during an interview it's very distracting and unprofessional before you go into an interview you need to check yourself and make sure you don't have gum in your mouth spit it out throw it away what did it cost you two cents throw it away thanks for watching and be sure to check out more of our videos at TIE fighter dotnet", "Z_Q_1Zx-__U": "Howdy folks hows it going welcome to my virgin\nkitchen today i'm showing you how to make your very own homemade chewing gum. Pretty cool right although part of me is split\ndown the middle like the devil and the angel thing like the devil is saying Barry why don't\nyou just walk to the shops and buy a packet of chewing gum that's super cheap and the\nangel is like no have a go at making it to show people how to do it because they can\nhave a go for themselves and it did work, so if you want to have a go hit pause on the\nvideo now write all these ingredients down you'll notice there's something on there called\ngum base you can't just walk to your local supermarket and get gum base you have to order\nit online I got a big packet of it so i'm gonna do a bubble gum video too slightly different\ningredients but this is how I made it. First thing we're gonna do is quarter fill\na saucepan with some tap water then place a larger mixing bowl on top then under a low\nflame kind of like a bain marie tip in your gum base balls, I think we can call them gum\nbase balls it's a little bit kinky but you know we'll get away with that. Oh and just to say you can do these steps\nin a microwave if you prefer it's a lot quicker like a 90 second thing something like that\nbut I found with a bain marie you can get a lot more control of the mixture with your\ngum base all broken down add your golden syrup colourings and flavourings over the heat just\nvery briefly mixing it through to incorporate. Onto a chopping board dump down half of your\nicing sugar and then quickly pour down your base mixture now that will be hot but it needs\nto be hot to be manouverable so get your icing sugar all on it and coat it and begin to knead\nit like your making bread you know really get your hands in there like that you know\nmake faces if you want its up to you. You can use a rolling pin if you like to help\nget it nice and smooth, when I first rolled mine out I noticed it was a little pale pink\nwhich would have been perfect if I was making bubblegum flavour chewing gum. But I wanted a stronger kick in there to go\nwith my strawberry flavouring. So when it's gone to cold it's quite hard\nto manouver so either whack it back in your bowl or microwave whatever you're using and\nit'll be like a bit of a putty texture again I slammed mine down on the board gave it some\nextra red food colouring which I got on my hands and rolling pin that was a little gory\nimage right there but it enabled me to roll it out and really work that colour through. Once you are happy with your mixture and you've\ngot as much icing sugar in there as you can grab a sharp knife and cut into any shape\nyou like so you can go for the traditional sort of strip shape I kinda like the cushion\nshape thing so I did that. Then you can start to get crazy with different\nflavourings and colourings this is a lemon chewing gum so yellow food dye and lemon flavouring,\nkeep them wrapped in foil in an airtight container or just chew on them straight away.

years of shredded existence the hold one of a nostalgia trip now first step to the plate though in Portland it's like Bill Murray and Caddyshack Cinderella story you know kind of thing it is impossible as it might seem those two guys in the bullpen were once Portland Mavericks lefty Rob Nelson from Cornell and a real big leaguer Jim Bowden co-creators of big league chew Jim Bowden that an interview once and they said Jim when you open that pouch in the first smelled that what did it smell like and Jim being the businessman who said he said smells like money to you it smell smells like possibility the possibilities were endless in those maths days the independent baseball team chronicled ever so greatly the Netflix documentary the battered bastards of baseball he told me the Portland maverick fraternity in many ways was more exclusive than being in New York Yankee because we were only here for five years so there aren't that many guys maybe 200 of us all told and a lot of them are like me you know three seasons one win but we led the league and fun back to the fun in the pouch the intent to get guys off of shreds of tobacco in the bag they blink you man's eyes watch a great piece and shredded bubblegum stuffed into a giant stay fresh powder for pink or purple shreds of bubblegum it couldn't be happier from a 1977 idea in the pen at old Civic Stadium to the Test Kitchen of the Mavericks batboy in Southeast Portland I made maple flavored and root beer flavored shredded gum from a kit that I bought from a company from Arlington Texas I read about this company in People magazine it's the whole story's preposterous a grand slam idea named art and product league chew sold for production and distribution in 1980 the Wrigley company on a modest three-year deal in the first year they sold eighteen million dollars worth of big league chew to put that in perspective the following year the Wrigley family sold the Chicago Cubs for just under twenty two million dollars lovable losers not out big league chew and absolute hall-of-famer bubblegum nirvana there's a retrospective that's gone opening next month in Cooperstown on Baseball in the 80s and they have an original pouch on open pouch of 1980s big league chew eventually Mars swallowed Wrigley Nelson bought out bouton and shocked his shredded confection in a tiny Ford gum company in Akron New York the fact that it started out small with a little 3-year agreement and here we are more than three decades later with with a brand that's become the Cracker Jacks of bubblegum couldn't be happier this is the feel the texture the smell that's it for a generation of ball playing gum chewing kids big league chew my system is the best bubble blowing gum for your money then and now yeah Rob the father of two twin boys and a teenage daughter who attends Grant High now in fact if you are in his Northeast neighborhood his house is the place to go on Halloween handing out full pouches of the gum all flavors the Hillsborough hops are honoring the past they Portland Mavericks night August 20th about 50 of the old reg tagged crew will fly in from all around the country I'm a hops will wear those glorious red shirt tops as well for the Mavs and fans exodus 18 that night will get free pouches of the gum it's still good big league chew and according to Nelly that wonderful documentary on the

you bought some strong snus yes last time we did a video about a snooze cold bolt yeah and we got a lot of requests our followers who wanted us to test something stronger people wrote Siberia off-road thunder so they just you know yeah let's shoot that out yeah rap tried it here it goes I don't know if these news are available in your country if it is good for you it's not well for reference scale wise on how strong these are yeah Swedish match general has dinner voice yeah regular snows has 0.8 yeah and if it's an extra strong for example this one it's 1.8 okay and then there's the super strong which we tested the vault vault which is 2.6 yeah and that was thrown and then we have these extreme yeah they are in a different category so these are up to 4.5 my almost 5 times stronger than the regular snare yet and I'm already getting sweaty yeah so which one do we try it first I thought we should test the least strongest one yeah so there's a scale so yeah that's this is diggity now I bought I bought a lot of it so I guess I have to snooze this now so this is gonna be my regular snooze for what I don't know months ahead you know like a week a week ahead this is not good no ok so this is the least strong yes so this is called glove explosion white yep it's like a bomb explosion explosion explosion explosion explosion now I said it four times it was like a bone exploding it's a bomb exploding on the on the cover yeah it's almost it smells like whoa gingerbread oh yeah that's not good smell I got this okay so first one yeah 3.5 3.5 okay I'm starting to feel the burn it is strong yeah it is strong yeah it's definitely yeah it's you know my head is gonna warm I think it's pretty good yeah it's not bad snow definitely not about this and this smell I'm China starting to like it what is that yeah I would say it smells like torque and I think it smells like Christmas I guess we have different prisons as you and me tartar bread with our hand okay yeah it's a strong snus kind of kind of good oh it's okay okay next one is actually Siberia the strongest one is four point five and this is four point three is very little difference no that was three point five this is four point three yep it's a bit minty actually yeah yeah I can hear big old strong snooze here we go - eighty degrees Celsius on this one I don't know what that means but yeah I do know Oh because of the minty yep it feels like my upper lip is very cold right now yes the whole body is inside but my upper lip just went to you like Siberia yeah exactly and had a snooze really strong one and then came back in like holy freaking yes this is strong yeah and I got this much of this set up and I at home reference whoo I'm getting I guess this is weird feeling my body's like burning up but this limb smell is in Siberia I'm getting a bit of a hi-yah as focus wise you know it's like I got a think you know okay so now I'm looking there no no I'm looking over there and like aware of it you know I'm only I'm aware of this I'm just real hot cop contingent feeling on my on my upper lip and to refocus they're like dude you're not in focus the hell my eyes know it is wrong do again but I do not like the toothpaste II taste okay my safety because of the solution yeah you look shaky holy [ __ ] you're shaking how much can't even see I can't even look at my own hand yeah yeah strong so okay

Birds nothing else nothing else taste no smell get burned holy crap story I stopped thinking I was like reading and then not reading and then I was like think reading it backwards I was turning it this way I actually feel a bit lightheaded yeah I'm stupid like no I'll do it the other way around I don't really like this one no it's too strong too strong and and I think the pouch is too too flat but if you like strong snus it's it's good sness switch it okay so this is called arctic explorer or Froude X also 4.5 mm it's almost empty yeah this is mint not as much as the Siberia the instant burn this is wrong yes very strong now I understand what you mean that we have to focus some things yeah right no no cause I made this oh I'm holding it now we have to turn it ya have to think what I'm doing yeah exactly you gotta be very experienced to do this apparently we aren't nope but I guess it's good if you don't want to do like herring herring or crow yeah go over this and said it's cheaper and legal yep I'm like dozed off yeah me too I'm feeling hi yeah like after after smoking a blunt yeah I've never done it no of course we haven't but if you man oh yeah seeing people smoking

next video [Music]", "9AysihhjZ4M": "you guys I just filmed this whole video all the way through and the audio wasn't on for making bubblegum today hey what's up you guys my name is Mason Miele and thank you so much for coming back to my channel for another video this is my very first DIY video and I'm super excited I don't know if it's going to work well actually I dunno if it's gonna work but we're gonna pretend like we don't know whether or not this is going to work is it going to be a fail is it going to work stick around to find out oh my gosh alright so today we are making bubblegum you can do this at home with me I got this bubblegum making kit it's called the bubblegum factories at a craft store so I'm sure you can get the ingredients separately or you can get this online I don't know what kind of weird stuff you're into but I'll basically walk you through how to do it and then I'll show you what it looks like at the end and you can try it and yet and all that fun stuff okay so these are the ingredients that it comes with they have gum base which are these little balls of gum which if we're making bubble gum then why does it come with gum already um it also has corn syrup it has flavoring there's blueberry watermelon and mint flavor there's powdered sugar I have a cup of water which obviously didn't come with the package and then food coloring which didn't come with it as well but those are the two things I'm going to add extra so first we're gonna want to do is add about a tablespoon of the gum base to a cup that you can microwave and then also throw away if you need to so I'll just add in like a tablespoon ish yeah it's like little snowman turds and then we're going to do is pour water just like a little bit of water over the gum so that it like kind of like blends in with it and then from there I'm going to go microwave this for 15 to 20 seconds so I'll be right back alright so after you are done microwaving the gum it should look like this you're going to pour the excess water out and it get plastic spoon to stir it with so you just kind of mix it together so that it kind of becomes one big lump like so I'll show you there you go that's what's what's oh look like alright from there I'm going to take it and empty it out on to a cutting board they recommend that you mix it in the cup but I don't really follow direction so we're just gonna do uu-aah it's so sticky well wrapped your finger in there I hope it's hot a bigger finger in a little bit can you guys like be careful at home if you're doing this with me because goal making is very dangerous I'm just saying that right now get it off the spoon come on okay so I'm getting on the cutting board getting it all the way off the spoon from there they have specific measurements of what you need for each recipe or what you need for each flavor but I'm just going to kind of guess and do my own thing so I'm adding about a teaspoon of corn syrup and then I'm going to add watermelon flavoring maybe like a teaspoon of that as well um citric acid is what makes a sour I believe which I didn't know that until today so just pour like a little dash of citric acid make it nice and sour and then from there I'm going to take powdered sugar and just pour it on top of all of it now what you're going to do is mix everything all together and just basically knead it until it becomes a big piece of gum so it's going to be sticky and it's going to be kind of sucky but you just keep going with it probably wash your hands before you do this too just throwing that out there because I don't want you little sickos to get your like poopy hands all over the gum you know so yeah just keep like dabbing it in the powdered sugar wall keep dabbing it down and in the powder to the harder hit the pepper sugar and knead it and fold it over and blend everything together make sure you're like scooping up as much as you can so that any flavoring that you missed out on gets in there so in this base where it's like still sticky but it's getting to be more like a piece of gum that's where I add the food coloring so I'm just going to add one drop of food coloring and I use watermelon flavoring but I just don't even care to match the color to the flavor because who said that watermelon flavor can't be purple you know so you're just going to need the food coloring into it now fold it over and stretch and pull it there you go this isn't a sex tutorial your minds out of the gutter your little stick goes all right another thing that you need to make sure you do is keep adding powdered sugar while you're kneading it and blending it because that helps to keep like the stickiness the tackiness away and then you basically just knead it and pull it and fold it over until everything's all blended together alright guys so I've been needing this for a couple of minutes and it looks pretty good it looks like gum and it feels like gum to it so I'm pretty proud of myself fun life hack you guys if you want to piss off your parents and make them think that you're doing drugs don't clean up your mess because it literally looks like there's cocaine everywhere woo alright so now that you've got it flattened out you can cut it into shapes or pieces where you can roll into little balls but this is basically where you get the individual servings of gum into place before I forget make sure you like and subscribe we're gonna have some problems buddy alright so back to our tutorial what I wanted to do is flatten this out into a line and then I'm just going to take the knife and cut it into little individual like things like pieces of gum I think this looks great so there's your little piece of gum this is what it should look like by the end of at least I think it should look like this I think I did it pretty good let's try it oh my god it worked and it worked you guys this is cool there's different flavors you can do obviously you can add different colors make it more sour less sour but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did be sure to give it a big thumbs up comment below if you decided to make this if you want to make it if you guys like gum I don't know just come below just for the fun of it other than that you guys if you haven't done so yet be sure to hit subscribe right now because I make new videos every week so I'll see you next Thursday okay good bye", "nyYokEN9I18": "today's candy bar having a look at bubble mania bubble crush bubble gum nuggets you just see what I did there I said bubble three times i likely will say it a lot more because in this pack by kids mania you get for scrumptious that's a word we don't use nearly enough today scrumptious right there scrumptious flavors what I'm sorry what did you say what kind of flavors are there while there's green apple has indicated up the top there there is strawberry there is blue raspberry and I guess that is the other flavor up there tutti frutti which apparently did not deserve any sort of mascots you see there is the Apple their strawberry looks a little concerned I don't know why he's concerned perhaps he has a thing against blue raspberry or he's just an idiot and he's like a god working with him again I worked with him on the last job and this guy was a how they keep giving this guy work and he's like oh how are they given this guy work is there anything else that I could be doing but apparently tutti frutti has left eat he's not even rubber he's not even representing if you will he's just left the party but you get as you can see you get small for small little containers each one containing the bubble crush bubblegum nuggets I keep looking at bubble mania and I keep assuming that it's made by Hubble hubba bubba but it is actually not it's made by kids maniac so again for flavors there's the I guess tutti frutti strawberry green apple blue raspberry there's a little bit of rap on there which we will solve immediately by use of red take this wrapper off here put it to the side you don't have to see it for the rest of this review look at these the tiny cans out and I say cans because look look what we got here it's actually like a little tiny can so it's open right there which is how i'm going to open it i'm going to follow the arrow arrow is generally lead us in the right direction sometimes arrows do lead us in the wrong direction and those are evil arrows stay away from those arrows they'll kill you and everybody you ever care about it says open here as well so I guess open us here I might not even need red just peel away peel away at the front and for the next little while oh I say maybe about 15 seconds I'm going to be prepping these and like how you would prep a kitchen maybe if you have a dinner party and you having a bunch of people over you pre prep your food you cut up your vegetables you get the roast already ready to go in the oven perhaps you need to braise it wats bring on some real interesting tidbits of information here I know I know I would love to throw a dinner party I haven't yet but one of these days spots gonna throw a dinner party you guys are all invited fix up you and you let's get these open up and the final prep involved let's get this one opened up oh wait wait a minute algae informations product may contain traces of gluten soy tree nuts and seeds how is that possible how is that possible for gum I don't know alright prepping is completed prepping is finished so first a look at the blue raspberry so I'm going to follow the instructions here open pop that open and inside we get these crater like little pieces of gum you see that on my hand these little tiny pieces of gum right Dyke like so what's nice is you can have a little you can have a lot you can have all of it but then you're gonna be one of those people that are made chewing and spitting on people when you're talking to them and they're not going to want to talk to you for very long so let's give this first one a try I am actually going to give all of these two tries so let's give the first one to try it blue raspberry let's give these a try I don't know perhaps spot needs to have taken the whole container there's really not a lot of flavor I can taste obviously blue raspberry but the gum is just kind of mediocre you would think for all this flair all this business that's going on here it would actually be pretty good but don't be don't let it kid you my friends it's not very good not very good at all at any rate though will run again run the gauntlet here let's try to D fruity notes why didn't do some crafty editing I just took the gun out and pour a little bit more into my hand this is the tutti frutti let's get some of this a try this one's a little crunch here then this one kinda just tastes like regular bubble gum again it's not very good though it's kind of just cheap tasting gum if anybody again was wondering I say again if anybody was wondering where I picked these up I think I picked these up just at a Hasty's market it's a convenience store here in Ontario I don't know maybe you guys don't have these pretty crappy gum though and let's move that aside Jesus can be somewhat of a disappointing review there's that strawberry again oh god is he still here who's employing this guy apparently the strawberry has much smaller pieces let's get these strawberry a try mmm strawberry I think is the worst it's artificially flavored all right flavored with crap not a fan not a fan and finally then do something hopefully the Apple will save this review let's get this Apple opened up spot oh hey look the Apple you get quite a lot larger chunks or you could also pretend it's kryptonite really you could have just remarked this as kryptonite gum I totally would have bought that in a heartbeat kryptonite gum even if it's crap totally what about it and finally let's get the green apple a try here we go no it's not good it's not good at all this gum is really bad for starters the flavor is really artificial is if that's the best word I can use to describe it's very artificial tasting it doesn't last very long I'm the gum just really feels it just tastes cheap and nobody likes cheap cheap gum today's candy spot perhaps something you might want to avoid today career having a look at bubble crush bubble gum nuggets not very good hey thanks for watching see you guys next time you", "M0RLeeDUA-8": "WELCOME WELCOME BACK WELCOME BACK TO WELCOME BACK TO WELCOME WELCOME BACK TO WELCOME\nCHOCOLATE WELCOME BACK TO WELCOME\nCHOCOLATE HAS WELCOME

made of plastics and rubbers they pour the gum base into a mixer then add color and flavor as it begins mixing they pour in glucose syrup a sweetener because it's liquid it helps keep the gum base soft next they add dextrose a powdered sweetener they blend the ingredients for about 20 minutes the stirring action builds up heat which melts everything together the mixtures ready when it reaches the consistency of bread dough they transfer it by cart to a machine called the pre extruder the machine squeezes the mixture through a narrow opening like squeezing toothpaste from the tooth this transforms the big bulky wad into thin manageable strips that can then go through the extruders the extruder squeeze each strip down to the actual width of a piece of bubble gum it comes out as one long continuous stream to be cut into bite-sized pieces later on this extrusion process heats up the gum if they were to cut and wrap it now it would stick to the wrapper so the next stop is a cooling chamber the gum goes in for 15 minutes at temperatures between 37 and 45 degrees Fahrenheit when the Bubblegum comes out it's cooled down enough for what they call the cutting wrap one machine does both jobs in a fraction of a second watch the action in slow motion as the continuous stream of gum enters on one end the machine cuts it into bite-sized pieces pushes each piece into a wax paper wrapper then twists both ends of the wrapper closed", "-CZQa6NMDPI": ">>[music]\n>>NICOLL: Welcome to ProSweets 2012 here in Cologne, Germany. I'm Harold Nicoll and with me is Maureen Akins\nand we're doing our very first installment of a program we call \"Does This Have Gum In\nIt?\" The purpose of this program is to introduce\nand illustrate different types of uses for gums in everyday food items. And since this is the very first installment,\nwe're going to start with the basics, chewing gum. So Maureen, looking at this package of candy\ncoated chewing gum, \"Does this have gum in it?\" >>AKINS: It sure does. So not only is this a great gum center, the\noutside hard candy shell actually contains a hydrocolloid or gum as we refer to them. And the purpose of that gum in this shell\nis to provide strength and it give some flexibility during processing so that as you ship the\nproduct it maintains this nice continuous shell so that your end consumer gets to see\nit in its full form. Historically, shells have been created using\ngum arabic. It's a tree sap. It's thousands and thousands of years old. The purpose is to increase the strength so\nthat when you bite into the piece you get a very nice sensation. A very excellent crunch texture. >>NICOLL: Let's talk a little bit about TicaPAN. I know that we're here in Cologne, Germany,\nat the ProSweets 2012 event and its the first time we've talked about TicaPAN here in Europe. What distinguishes TicaPAN from other traditional\ntypes of gum? >>AKINS: Well, first and foremost, it's actually\na cost savings. Not only can you get all of the same functionality. When we talk about functionality we're referring\nto shell strength, how fast it dries, the smoothness of the appearance. Those are all going to be very similar to\nwhat you would get with gum arabic but we found a way to make it less expensive and\nwe found a way to make your supply much more secure. >>NICOLL: There are two types of TicaPAN that\nI've seen. There's TicaPAN 311 and then there's Quick\nCrunch. What distinguishes one from the other? >>AKINS: Yes. That's an excellent question. TicaPAN 311 was originally formulated to be\nexactly the same as gum arabic. All of the same textural attributes, all of\nthe same functional attributes, with the exception of a whiter shell. TicaPAN Quick Crunch was actually formulated\nto be a product improvement. Something that will give you a much bigger\ncrunch. Something that could potentially give you\nfaster drying times. And then all of the same benefits: whiter\nshell, security of supply that we found with the 311. >>NICOLL: We hope you enjoyed this very first\ninstallment of Does This Have Gum In it? Next month we're going to talk about stabilization\nin salad dressings and find out the roles gums play in those. Meanwhile, enjoy some more scenes of Cologne,\nGermany, and come back next month for \"Does This Have Gum in It?\" >>[music]", "-cZdOGQgXJM": "the light asmr okay so so so so so you so so so so you so

laffy taffy thing and yeah so i have it right here it is i think watermelon flavored see it has watermelons on it and it is really big so that's why i'm doing a review on it because i think it looks pretty cool i got this for halloween i think and i haven't tried it so i'm going to try it boom all right let's open this thing well you can see it's like pinkish there um i can't even get the um unwrapping uh i yeah wrapping wrapping paper i think ah this is hard to get off that's what we've got off so far looks pretty tasty from what i'm seeing it just looks like a normal laughy taffy except it's like pink um i think the most common ones are like i think they're like yellow ones i think they're banana flappy taffys those ones i'm actually a fan of this candy i actually really like lappy taffys guys if you like laffy taffies then make sure to like the video and and comment down below what your favorite laffy taffy flavor is i'd say mine is probably uh i will probably i would probably say banana or something but um after i try this it might be this well it's already unopened so let's just get right into it in three two one oh that's hard that's really hard wow that is hard it tastes really good it does like tastes like a watermelon flavor i really like it it tastes really good like like there's like i don't really know how to explain it there's just like just like a lot of just like flavor added into it that stuck to my teeth but hey that's kind of what laffy taffys do laffy taffies are pretty much um pretty much those like kinds of candies that like kind of just like a stick to the inside of your mouth if you know what i mean it's just like those kind of candies and it's kind of like annoying to get out but i do still really like the taste of it though but dang it is hard it's like hard to like bite off see how hard that is to bite but but this is really good i definitely recommend that you should get one of these if you can because because they're really good but like look how big this thing is it's big it's hard it's sticky and very tasty [Music] see how hard to bite that is see but it does get a little bit softer every time you bite it see how it just gets softer and then you can like bite it more easily but yeah i'm really liking this so far i think this might be like my new favorite flavor i think the only flavors are like this one banana and i think strawberry i think but i think bananas are the most common but i'm not really sure wow it's hard in the first few bites but i do really like it though it's it's it is really good even though it's like hard and it just like sticks to the inside of your mouth i really like it oh that was a big bite oh my gosh it's it's really hard in the in the first few bites like i'm just saying like like

plus stop is the packaging the bubblegum moves onto a scale that automatically weighs out the right amount per tongue the table is sealed with plastic to make it airtight this keeps the bubblegum

You guys can come in and you'll get some free\nbubble gum, you can blow some bubbles,\nand we'll see who blows the biggest one. They'll get a prize. Wait. Who's gonna ? ... How do you judge who's got\nthe biggest bubble?3 I guess we'll end up taking pictures of the\nbubbles. Okay. Then we can compare. Are you going to bring your tape measure out? Sure! I personally can't chew bubble gum,\nbecause as soon as I chew gum in my mouth it pulls the teeth right out of my mouth. Cause you know I got falsies - teeth, that\nis. Do you have any stories about kids falling\nasleep with gum in their mouth and it getting stuck in their hair? Ooohhh... yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That did happen to my daughter when she was\na kid. She was chewing bubble gum.\nand her hair blew in the car and she blew a bubble\nand her hair got stuck in the bubble. How did you get it out? Well, we went home and I\nthink my mom or someone told me to use kerosene. I just cut her hair off and it was way easier\nthan trying to get it out of there cause it wasn't coming out and\nthe kerosene smelled really bad. Yeah, so. Alright, so, here are the bubble gums that\nwe have in stock. This is a Mentos bubble gum\nand it's like in a hard shell and the gum is inside. It smells really good. Trident. We got Trident here. It's in little sticks. Then we have the original Bubble Yum. Classic. Classic, yes. Then we have Hubba Bubba Max. That's strawberry-watermelon flavor. And then we have just another normal Bubbalicious\nbubble gum. And then here, we think this classifies as\nbubble gum. It's Fruit Stripe. You get seven seconds of real flavor and then\nyou spit it out. What's in that stuff? What's it made out of? Sugar? No. I don't know. Uhhh... Wow. All kinds of stuff. Xylitol\nSorbitol Oh god. Glycerin\nAspartame, which is not good for you. We better not read the ingredients. Ok! Are we done here, you guys? Cause it's time for my break. So, I'll see you later! You have a good day, y'all.

taste buds are still working so we're gonna try out these weird flavors we have a wedding cake margarita why would you want your gum to taste like a margarita that's like salty and oh my rainbow iced champagne birthday cake just some fun flavors I got these at world market and I believe they were like a dollar fifty per pack and honestly I don't think I've ever had this brand of gum before I've seen it like at Target and stuff but I've never had it so should we just start off with wedding cake this one actually looks good but I don't know why would you want your gum to taste like that I like a minty gum like stuff that makes your breath smogged not like cake and margaritas well let's see I was a very hard to rip off I don't know why I'm smelling it when I haven't even opened up ER there's maybe about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 pet it says 12 pieces on the front okay so let's try the wedding cake I feel like I'm eating a bean boozled jelly bean I do not want my wedding cake to taste like this this tastes like a bean boozled jelly bean like a gross flavor so I got my trash can because obviously I'm gonna need that either that taste so gross well don't buy this or next let's doing that will be good maybe what about grapefruit melon this shouldn't be that bad it's just like watermelon and stuff so this one isn't really weird but I just grabbed all the ones that they had because I went up I'm throwing this away you know okay wow that is strong this tastes like a bath and Bodyworks smell like a hand sanitizer this is good it's very strong like citrus flavor hmm I like this one YUM and a sugar-free gum Wow I feel like there is not a lot of gum though with the piece like I feel like this is not a lot of gum at all like is it just me or is that like the smallest piece ago next let's try rainbow ice this one yummy the packaging is so cute - with the little snow cone on it snow cones honestly don't really have that much of a flavor because it's just ice less like some syrup in it I mean obviously it's got like a fruity flavor or whatever but for gum I don't know how that's gonna be so let's see no they got the wrong image and title on this package this is not snow cone this is definitely the red white and blue America popsicles I taste red white and blue raspberry blueberry and cherry oh wait is that the flavors it's like cherry blueberry and lemonade that's what I taste it's good actually not bad alright so we had two good ones now let's try should we do margarita I'm scared for this honestly margarita Vita non-alcoholic it alcoholic gun that would be very gross that would be so gross gum that's tastes like alcohol ill just take a shot like it why would you just want to chew on it for a while okay let's take them margherita gum okay wait a second this is actually really good this tastes exactly like a margarita tastes salty and like taste like a lime I know that sounds gross your gum to be salty and tastes like a lime it's actually good I think I'm Ashley enjoying this a lot but like then does your breath smell like a margarita so then if you're driving get pulled over you have this gum in your mouth they're gonna be like oh are you drinking margaritas and you just Punk gum in your mouth to hide the smell it's like no this is my gum look look I have margarita flavored gum not alcohol it okay next we're gonna try a birthday cake which I'm actually not a fan of this flavor in like ice cream and stuff it tastes like frosting and I really don't like frosting that much I mean I'll eat it but like to lick it off a spoon and stuff it's so sweet and I don't know I like thin layers of frosting if it's like a bunch of frosting on top of like a cake slice I'll flip that cake slice to the side and just eat the underneath and leave the frosting I don't like frosting oh how could you like the flavor of cake how do I like the flavor of a margarita yeah I don't know but nasty this tastes like cheap cake with a ton of frosting on it that's been sitting there for a long time bill we need to cleanse out our mouths now with some front-porch lemonade I was like what does that say cuz I can't read I'm awful at reading this is a cute little picture look it's an amazing jar this should be good should be like a lemon drop like lemony okay so I'm tasting the lemonade yes but I'm also tasting these green leaves I don't know if they put them in the lemonade cuz it looks like it in the picture who puts leaves in lemonade leafy lemonade it's alright but like it tastes like leaves oh I think I figured it out are they leaves - the lemon yeah they gotta be okay well you don't put those in the drink what and we're now on our last one in Champagne dreams if you guys want me to do more videos like this because this was a lot of fun I wish I had like 20 more flavors to do like hamburger and french fry mmm should just do a move on then but leave a comment down below if you guys want me to try out certain flavors of like chips or

this video I want to go ahead and talk to you guys about the wristband company that I am partnered with look I and show you guys some of the products that they do have and what their cause is really for so first of all if you guys have never seen a little Chi bracelet here's what they look like each of them are like a rubber silicone texture they do have got some metal ones now as well but each of their wristbands and pretty much anything that they have do you have to like special beads on it ones a white bead ones a black bead and if you guys want to pause the video you guys can read right there or I'll tell you guys so the white beads supposed to stand for staying humble and it has water from Mount Everest the black bead does have sand from the Dead Sea in it and we have actually cut one of these open and it does have both of those in it unfortunately the water does eventually evaporate out of it but the black one will always have that sand in it so also a cool thing about these wristbands is whatever like wristband they do have they find a charity to donate the money to so I don't know if the top my head what's the original one these two marble ones that me and my girlfriend always wear so I've got the black one she's got the white one and this is going to like Mount Everest and like helping with like keeping up with that with the cleanup and stuff like that of it so that's cool we do have got this one on my wrist as well if you guys saw my Instagram post on this that's what I posted this is for like saving sharks in the ocean and stuff like that so it is some cool stuff fun that also they do have got some other stuff right now going on on clearance on their website with a ring so this is a ring that my girlfriend bought for herself and yeah so long story short it's an amazing company they do great things with charities and stuff like that they have got crazy amount of colors or wrist bands on their website you guys can go check it out I will put a link down in the description below and if you guys use code RH game so you guys will get 20% off your order they even have got stuff like sports teams so if you guys are huge sports fans they do have like a game day collection from the NHL MLS NFL MLB any like sport that you can think of they have it in there so go to their website check it out they're an awesome company I've been wearing their wristbands for a long time and I don't see myself ever stopping here in the near future now let's get into the video what is going on guys it is our human games here welcome back to the channel another video hopefully you guys are having an awesome day in today's video we are going to be doing an unboxing and taste test over the brand new GPO flavor bubble-gum now story with this is if you guys did not see the video back in November me and my girlfriend did actually already get to try this flavor due to the fact that I want to give away through J field which was like a tub a shaker Cup and then also a scoop of bubblegum when it was in like the testing phase I don't know if it's been changed since then I've kind of heard both that it has and hasn't so the only way to find out is to try it today but this is like the official bubblegum flavor that you guys can go buy right now so here's a 360 view of the box and the thing that kind of scares me is when I originally tried it is I was not a big fan of it my girlfriend wasn't a big fan of it and I was kind of disappointing but we'll see what its gonna be like today so inside we've got the oh this is a different peak to go scooper so we have a pink to go scooper I wish I had the other one around me to show you guys but this looks like it's a new style of pink so that's another one to add into the collection of them so that's kind of cool new color for that we do got the new bow gum shaker Cup which is right here which I think looks pretty cool the turbine on this side looks like yeah the turbine is like extremely small on this one I don't know how I feel about that but that's here I do like the color scheme of that though from bubblegum I think that's good we do have the tub itself which we'll get in that here in a second we've got the GPL sticker right here for bubblegum I like it it looks good I think it's one of their better stickers in a while oh wow we've got the GPO to go scoop card you guys can take a look at that if you guys want to and then also something new in this collector's box versus the other ones is they have included some GPL tattoos and that's like temporary tattoos that you put on forgotten show you guys those here it looks like that it comes with three of them and this is what they look like so yeah there's three of these in here um rocket I'm looking at the directions on the back of these about like how to apply and it says peel paper away rock it for two to three days anyway so that's cool you get three of them inside the collectors box we're gonna go ahead and put those back I will probably meet my girlfriend we'll both probably put one on just for the fun of it and we'll probably leave one just as a why not just to keep because that's kind of cool that G feels doing that because I've never seen a tattoo of G fuel at a collector's box before and before we get into the tub let me go ahead and clean this up and then we'll get into the tub alrighty guys so here it is the tub of bubblegum check that out I actually do like this tub design for this I like that they like incorporated like the piece of gum with the G filled turbine and yeah so this flavor is gonna have 15 calories 140 milligrams of caffeine which is normal with what G feels been going with lately and yeah here it is in all of its glory everybody's been waiting for this flavor for a long time like G fuel talked about it showed it they've done a lot with this flavor and it's been since like October that we've known that this flavor is coming and we finally get it so that's nice we got to cut it open the seal a little too high on this one and the other thing about this flavor is you guys know that in theory should like it because I typically like the more sweet g feel flavors so we'll see it anyway so let's go ahead and get this open here let's go ahead and peel the top back and the scoopers right towards the top so that's nice go ahead and take that out so the powder is white which I remember it being white and the to go scooper by the way if you guys have not seen that video I'll go ahead and either put a link in the description or put like the video like up in here we do have got the winter white shaker cup here with us today and had ice in it but it's slowly melting but we do have gonna back here with us today telling you to scoop a bubblegum here so the powder is white like how I already said powder smells like nothing I think I said that - last time we smelt this alright so here's a scoop a bubblegum it's gonna get into the shaker cup well go ahead and put the lid back on to the Bubblegum tub go and put that right there we'll put the lid back on - have you winter white and let's go ahead and shake this up all right I would say we're shook it up and good to go here it looks like bubblegum the color the bubblegum 1/2 wow that's guiding you to smell here it definitely smells like bubblegum but it smells like like how we talked about in the original taste test with it and like how everybody else is talking about right now with it it's like bubblegum and something else so this flavor is not straight bubblegum so if you're getting in expecting that like how we did originally don't because it's not just bogum there's something else to it but anyways let's go ahead and try this this is G peels new flavor bubblegum I don't know I think that the I think if I try to remember back to when we first originally tried it I think the gum taste in it is a little bit stronger it still does have that like extra component that we don't know about we think it's kind of like a blow pop flow a blow pop flavor because they did put lollipops on the back of the G filled box which why would they do that if the flavors bubble gum but and if that's the case I think that you do taste that in this a lot of people are saying that it tastes like a lemonade and stuff like that I don't get that too much but you definitely do get a nice bubble gum taste in the front half of it and whatever that like second taste is is what you get in like the back half yeah I mean it does taste like bubblegum though I think that I do like this better than when I first tried it which I thought was gonna happen maybe if I had it twice it would be better I am gonna spend an entire week with this flavor just like how I do the other flavors and a week from when this video goes up you guys can see what I think about it a week later and if you guys should pick it up and stuff like that but as of right now I think that it's actually better than when I first tried it so I think for right now because it's not gonna be in my top 5 or top 10 at the moment we might change the ranking as like I keep drinking it and stuff like that but right now my ranking for it's gonna be like a seven and a half out of ten if you guys know you love bubblegum and stuff like that maybe you should go ahead and pick this up if you guys are a little bit iffy about how the flavor is wait a week and I will have my week later video up to tell you guys if it's worth the thirty six forty dollars if you're buying the collector's box if it's worth it so anyways I'm going to guide your guys thanks for watching hope you guys did enjoy this video if you did smash like button down below remember to subscribe to the channel for more videos and I'll catch you guys in the next one [Music]", "ZsvswBxBexA": "today I'm going to show you how to make a gum wrapper chain and I actually don't have to dumb rappers they just have papers that are cut to the right size to make a chain that back when I was a little girl they used to make gum with pretty wrappers pretty colorful wrappers and we would take the gum wrappers and we cut them in half and we make little chains like this so basically this one is 1 inch by 2.75 inches and I'm just going to fold it in to try to match it up as carefully as you can and once you have it crease in half open it and fold each edge to that center crease and then fold it in half again fold that section in half one more time and then you have the center crease again and pull the ends to the center doing this play so you have a little chain link that looks like this if you look at this edge you can see that there's more edges to be left here and then on this edge there's just four little edges to deal with so what I do when I put my chain together I make sure and take that into consideration as reckoning together so my chain links I want to have my complicated edges on top and slide them into my not as complicated edges and there's like a little swatch where you can fit each of your P ends of your chain link so once you have it fit in you just slide it together and you have one little chain link fit on there now you would continue to add chain links until you had the length of chain that you wanted you have a little bit of trouble sometimes I guess my fingernail or sometimes I use a little tool just get into those spaces but once you get the hang of it it's not too bad and if you use colored papers and it was really pretty and um you can use these for whatever you like some people just like to see how long of a chain they can create and some people like to make bracelets out of them or different stuff I'm basically how it works", "3YGaJb6elTY": "all right so we got southern belle it just came in and we got stator bed up

copyright infringement on it would yes my life has been blocked they said I had a copyrighted print what why now I have them reviewing the video so they can tell me where the hell they hear a copywriter for that and they don't usually block it if there's a copyright in it they don't block what what happens is you don't get paid for it so no it's blocked this says right on it block worldwide that doesn't make any sense so you've gotten somebody's done something to it more than likely yeah so then they'll just give me another super chin of guys she gave me another $4.99 guys she just silver bill you are just whoo Thank You Jimmy Ange guys are the best guys tonight yeah there's a lot of stuff going on on YouTube guys unfortunately hope is photos beautiful eyes take it uh drop down and come back up foam coffee love are you okay oh my goodness no you got to say if your channel is kids I already quit eating Mikey girl I already quit eatin okay so here's here's the thing we're talking about in the wrong moment all I came back to was already quit eat Nike girl okay so we're talking about it says now you have to say if your child your children or your channel is kid where the so my thing is if you want to be citizen so you don't have to put your channel on age restriction all you gotta do is is reciting in it all you do is like a little banner that comes on the top of it and it says to click on it you click on it and you there's like little like the little structures how to do it and you're going to another page and you-tube I know you can just say your your your channel's not for children then kids can't actually click on to your channel my specifically said copyright infringement I mean I've had that too where people have played music up on here and then that that wasn't allowed I'm not allowed to use it because it's got copyright on it but you don't get anything for that it's just you don't get paid for advertisements and stuff can't be seen this has right on it block worldwide I wonder why that is that's the first I've ever heard that I did I got YouTube I'm making their editors go through the video right now you find the copyright in print yeah I would yeah like I said I have never like I said well there's so many people that you know do a lot of things that they shouldn't be doing like them we make complaints and they do this and you know it's crazy g-man says my skin chill is not kid worth due to because you so I am yes I'm going to go to I'm gonna go off this live and I'm gonna come back on on my laptop ok no problem just let me know what no come on back up and eat with us ok ok girl okay alright so just don't go to like if they go set up and they come you know come back at you like I'm the upper girl you know that I'll come back I promise ok awesome there was no music on there I mean I was outside riding down the road my little scooter I don't have a radio on my scooter that's crazy you said phone ringing his headphones right oh they all said my phone ring yeah but still even with that you still don't get you don't get blocked by you guys cuz I've got it in my lives I've had people actually pull it up on their phone and they'll play a song for too long so then that song gets a copyright but it's not a copyright where you get a strike it's a copyright where that music essentially they want to get paid for it so if I want I can't even get any ads or anything on essentially so it's nothing understand why though it is because I've never had that and I'm like I said that's strange I've never heard of that something I didn't have a radio plan I was on my scooter riding down the road there is no radio on my scooter that's weird yeah that's true they will like I said even if you have it on your hair on lots of stuff don't like yes no I can do that girl drop the link for you just give me two seconds here I just gotta get up I can understand it if I had a radio playing but yeah I don't have a radio notice I never have a radio playing in my lives employed but I'm here okay no problem Christie that's no problem I understand I set mine as not friendly for children that's exactly what I said to Nike because their settings in it you can put on it and it says this channel is not made for children because essentially my channel is not okay if kids are scrapping and at the low 18 and below then you know what then you better go ask your parents because there might be a little bit of something that might have happened to my lodge or something there might be some person who might have happened and I don't want to be you know something happened because of that so I just put it all online all my videos so anybody below the age you can't watch them unless you've got the supervision of your parents cursing with weight here correctly no you know what I mean I mean it does we talk about different essentially I gets at it the other day I was gonna set them all for age restriction but if you set it for age restriction then you can't have video or you can't have automatically it says um because when I looked at I'm like oh it says you can't you're not commercials are not wanting to put you know they may not want it because of the content that's in it so I'm like although I'm not so that I wouldn't look at the the banner they gave me and it was read all that stuff on it and that's what I did I followed their instructions and with that is that so instead at least I still have my commercials on my videos mom said she heard music but how can you hear music when there was no radio turn on unpopular I'm getting Texas number is talking okay what do you mean no he didn't come out Nike because I actually I'd like to ask you some questions you got a little more knowledgeable could you just come up so we can we actually maybe we can talk about this because there's a lot of people that were a little confused so come on up when we're talking about like like the kid thing that now that's gone it and how are we supposed to are we supposed to put that down or are you just supposed to go like I did it today and just go and put where it's not kid-friendly to all your channel is Kent friendly yeah so you gotta set that go in your settings yeah I said mine where I'm not kid-friendly I've got mine set for 21 and over if you don't do it in actual in your your your settings you won't YouTube will keep after you and you'll get like I guess sweetie okay well then you're good then and I get that today the morning everybody of any age to get into motorcycles but I'm a grown-ass man I'm gonna say whatever the hell I want to say so I'm gonna set it where it's an adult adult privilege though whatever that way I don't have to hear all the cry it your volumes a little low okay so okay so the question is is that as long as it's stuck for that in in the settings right then you don't like age restriction you will get any extra air any strokes right no yeah because you can't set them for eggs restriction because if you do and you're already monetize and you want to get revenue from your videos maintain height for aids from the view have them review it themselves even a trade restricted mail a dad suit if they don't find anything in it review in mine right now so it'll be a while they got to watch the whole video girl thank you I really appreciate that he dubs you know girl we love you and we love having you in your girl you know that I just you come up Jessica anytime grow you don't hang out with us we're just talking about like I said that new kid thing that everybody and I just said all my for highest property for that age because I'm not having that well any if kids watch mine then that's what the parents rights not mine cuz I never know Susan get a little some just get a little hand on our long I just but you know what we're adults and we realize that you know and then if you said it for kid-friendly and they find something on your video that is not child friendly and I dog goes in there and says her child has watched it they can find you YouTube can find you now for you have a not kid-friendly stuff in your videos and you said it for kid-friendly your best pet is to set everything for not kid-friendly until you get it reviewed Thank You page and then set it back okay but it doesn't matter no even if it isn't like who really like I mean I really essentially I mean as long as the parents give the okay right yeah well the parent goes in there says well my son or my daughter watch this and this this is in there and this is not kid-friendly they can see you Plus YouTube confine you for having that in your video after you are stated that it was a kid-friendly video so you may have to make sure it is completely kid-friendly before you post it as kid-friendly okay so here's the question what if a kiddo watches it and it is marked for adults only then that's their fault that's whoever their parents should be watching them you know and such so that's their fault but if you put it as kid-friendly and they went in there to watch it as a child and their parent is watching it with them and they see something on that video that was not kid-friendly you're in trouble for it because you stated that it was child-friendly okay right also want to make sure because like I said essentially everybody was talking about how you had to put an age restriction on it and I look at that like okay well then you don't get no review if you're already monetized so essentially that's okay if somebody's like below that and doesn't have their hours they don't have that they're not monetized sure you can put an age restriction but it's just easier to put it as once you know essentially unless you really are focusing toward children then just put it as adults well it's still gonna get watch time hours regardless if you have it on child or not you're gonna get your watch time hours because the mostly adults it's watching it anyway thank you okay thank you kitty cat I appreciate that super chat thank you very much these guys are awesome we're just try to get through another question maybe y'all can answer Liam put in there that they heard my phone when it rang my ringtone huh Willa Bob paid for the ringtone isn't it my copyrighted thing yeah it's for you to use only not for you to share my phone ring while I was doing alive uh-huh but that ringtone was for you to use only now that you're broadcasting it on a video you're sharing it I'm holding the phone doing a video well yeah I know that but that's not how they see it that's your fault you should shut your phone off that's yeah kill the ringtone they're gonna consider to be your fault people coming in Richard William came in we got cherry berry they came in and we got Kim a everybody's coming in guys I'm let me show you that we get everybody and Paige says children friendlies don't get Thank You Vicky I don't think so no more in station and you can't use live chats or comments okay yeah well the thing is is that they want it now set either one way or the other and if you don't set it then YouTube I think will probably take it to their own hands and you're gonna end up with a fine I think essentially so I've already done today do that video and if they find any copyrighted stuff you remove it and put the video back up yeah what they'll do is tell you if they do find something you'll have to find out because they won't tell you what they found but they'll tell you around something and you'll have to figure out what it is and take it out yourself and the only thing they asked me if I wanted them to remove it if they find it I told them yeah [ __ ] they've never gave me that okay remember it's okay it's not these are not children okay the difference between me and you Nike is I'm an [ __ ] yeah well they never gave me the option of them taking it out they always just tell me it's and I've had plenty of videos trust me what strikes on them and I had to go and figure out what it was have them review it again and then put it up so Wow yeah so we got drone effects clawed came out how long guys well welcome patch it up and just came in two guys so we got a few is still coming in so I just wanted to but no g-man it did not play the whole song it just played while my phone was ringing yeah it doesn't take much I can't remember how many seconds of a song it is before they can call it a copyright what I don't understand okay so okay so here's an explosion this okay so they call it a copyright and they say you can get strikes for it right well how does that work because I've had it because I've had a couple them in here were people and they'll play it on their cell phone thinking and they don't think up here but then it gets played in here but I have never got a like I've never got the strike well I paid for the damn ringtone if my rate on the play it's not well when you had that actually when they done that to you you were probably not monetized yet now they'll strike you because you're monetizing you're not talk about scrapper when she had it done she wasn't monetized yet so now they will strike you because you're gonna be making money from that video that has that song in it and now they're really gonna they'll start telling you with it now see I can't because that it's not it's not allow it's already got an X on it no no I'm talking about in the future if you do another video and it plays a song in it okay now they're not gonna play with you no more it's gonna be a copyright strike and not a warning okay they didn't warn me they just dropped me and took video down yeah I never had that yeah I've never had that either I've always got the warnings and they'll tell you that there's asteroid or a copyright on it and then you got to go and figure out where the copyrights that and what it is and take it out and then you send it back to them again for them to review it again and then they'll put it up but by this time everybody that's going to look at your videos already seen your video and you already lost all the monetization from it anyway you're not gonna make the money from the video now unless somebody just Scrolls along some day and decides to watch that video again or unless Nike someone plays your playlist because you can still get you went back to rewatch the video and sent me a

how that works like there's a lot of videos it shouldn't be up a lot of hateful videos that are out there they should be taking down you know and they shouldn't be up and there should be a way that

out where they yes for sure we'd like to for sure no I mean sometimes the problem is that some of these youtubers that are big they start things and it just seems to go right down to the small people

policies that go into the youtubes policies it'll tell you right there if you don't believe me I'm not trying to raise my voice with anybody if you don't believe me go read it it'll tell you right

this is my first night on YouTube on the Left who's beside bummer I can't see the plane Vicki yes all right should we hit the no somebody still has a bad brain it's not me I'm on a headset yeah is it guy what I keep you around her YouTube off did you get it that's usually in any way so she's not telling her people we said hi little guys these guys are crazy that 20 moderator stuff got started last night up in Green Bay wacky's okay and somebody said it and it went from there that's how that got started and so they said it's a myth until they know exactly what UT was gonna do on that date you can get your whole channel shut down for using emojis and there's like thousands and thousands of people that already have I myself was using the whole bunch of motor emojis just yesterday or the day before I don't remember when and I haven't got my channel shut down well they said that too in there that some have been ticking down because of it yeah I have anything that's in there it could be a possibility who knows it may be happening because YouTube does glitch you know witches but uh there's nothing in the policy stating that you're not allowed to use so many emojis YouTube is doing is considering them maybe Spain oh I've heard other things too like you're not allowed to use numbers let's say you committing you want to tell like so say you're happy and say let's say you just you just reached your goal and you made it - let's say it was a milestone for somebody that's just brand-new and they started then you know I mean they've only been out for like playing with your phone once and they managed to they're 500 and they came in to tell me and they've got 500 in my you chat hope you didn't say they wanted to get telephone subscribers not getting the look to get there but they've actually got there so is that something that I could get you know in trouble for I don't think so you know I mean these are the things that are going around I've seen it a lot of world channels and a lot of channels I just go back I can Winston does it I'll say hello and then I step back and I just watched his house stuff on rules oh I should already know there's always gonna meet people out there to think they're smarter than anybody else they're gonna spread rumors see how fast they fly it's like the sub and subscribe words and all that stuff when that was going around I still let everybody say it as many times as they wanted to in my channel my channel never got shut down when I was doing my live streams I said sub subscribe you know hit me up all those words everything and I've never had my channel shut down because of those words I even let him type it in my chat never I went straight through Google and ask the question will YouTube screw you if you say the word subscribe and it came back with a list and I know we're in those rules does it say that you're gonna be kicked down because you used that word exactly alright guys well I guess I think use questions I'm having there's so much of this going around and it's everybody's in a panic like it's like you're going to chat it everybody's gonna put everybody in a panic with this stuff going home yeah everybody's so scared and all those channels that are below a thousand they don't have their 4000 that they're all afraid they're gonna the youtubes gonna get rid of them all but you think about if YouTube gets rid of all these small channels what are they gonna do because you think new people are going to stir it up and say okay well I'm gonna start a new channel if you're going to kick me just than boot me to the road before I even get there in a year do you think people are actually gonna do it no they're not going to do it this is how I'd see it at this point would mean yes I'm Malaya I have 250 something if they beat me and take me now I'll just find another platform to go to I don't think they will because if they do that then people are going to their gonna essentially YouTube will get blacklisted no one oh boy no one will use YouTube everybody will just say you know what YouTube's become political and MySpace when Facebook come into play myspace become obsolete jesus said the word one time when they bought me three days oh and it used to do me like that I don't even may not do any room I needed own a ministry basis I don't an ordained minister and therefore when I had it I run a ministry called White House gospel ministries and because I've used words that was in the Bible of all things hail damn things like that broke it down they would lock me down for three days and then it was worthless I don't know everybody's scared about these new rules that are coming in what is it December or January whatever it is they're gonna set these new rules and everybody scare them well how can you hear me well I mean there's a lot of people that have like a lot of different making people a lot of explain before this all kicks in everybody's trying to get to that money you know to get monetized especially oh my god it's like this if they didn't want you to use the emojis the emojis wouldn't be on there yeah that's what you pay for one for two they put right in their policies what words they want you to use in what words they don't want you to use it's just curse word or race word racist words is the ones they don't want you to use yeah anything to do with bullying what I don't understand Oh again okay so here's another here's another problem okay there's bullying going on they get reports of it but they don't do anything about it yeah hey I was one word they took down the channel with the person being bullied instead of the bully I've seen that done I'm actually where the money at it I got a friend of mine that had that happen to him not wear that yesterday this boy in coastal he's a youtuber any things was God did he was daunted everything about him his child was put out there on yes what came into here was written yes but I'm talking to that person that done it but here a week ago they took down a boy that was cussing and saying stuff about you too they took his whole channel hey Liam and we point out the name of the

you guys to listen to me for just a second okay I know it's not in the terms service okay what happened was two people totally Kathy some of you guys might know her I know southern belle knows her you know and Marv Fogelman is which is a big giant channel okay both of these people got demonetized and they didn't know why they contacted YouTube in YouTube told them you have too many moderators you haven't occur what they said was you in the exact words was you have an excessive amount of moderators you need to you need to reduce your number of moderators down to under 20 once they did that they both got romana ties that day okay and that is why I was trying to explain it to you it might not be in the Jewish it's happening okay and totally Kathy is like the nicest most wonderful human being on this planet you know they might change the rules to you know I I don't know I don't know what it is but I just thought I would mention that to you because I know that it's a common practice now for everyone to get a wrench and again this is happen now to two different people in the same week you know it's something that we have to start thinking about we have to we have to watch you know oh that's what happened oh my gosh because he got on monetized sometime this past week and I don't know what both yeah there was zero explanation from YouTube they had to contact YouTube so there's just there's weird things happening right now and I'm not trying to like fear porn or anything like that I just don't want anything to happen to your channel no I understand perfectly you know and I was and I'm sorry but like when I'm goofing around and I'm having a great time I have no problem with getting out the words that I want to say when I'm starting to get anxious or full of anxiety my Asperger's syndrome comes out and I can't get the words together and I was trying to get the words together and I couldn't get them together and I got frustrated and that's why I left it wasn't because of Nike or Vicky or anybody else that's on the piano I just had to walk away for a second so I could get my thoughts together and calm down so that I could come back and talk to you guys about it because I was starting to get flustered I'm gonna help with that real quick because I got three quick point one I'm heartbroken because we didn't get to race away we didn't get the Rachel played oh that Lane wait wait here wait wait I'm gonna do this just from rights gonna help her clear up y'all ready yes it did and I'm not I'm not upset I not mad at anybody I'm not mad at all I just wanted to explain this so that you guys understood where I was coming from I know it's not in the TOS I'd like spent the afternoon trying to find it in the TOS I was trying to find the video where Cathy was talking about it to show it to you guys but if you go back and you watch your livestream from yesterday and today she does talk about it right in the beginning so yes for sure we definitely the color to be Rachel yes they're a pretty pretty pretty blue they match my shirt well I told you they're only blue when I'm in a good mood what was that but yeah this was no shade at Nike so please think you don't don't think I'm mad at you I'm not I'm not mad at you at all I was just like very you don't even understand I mean well the longer you get to know me the more you're gonna realize that when I'm happy go-lucky Rachel no problems but when I start to get upset or I get anxious or I'm trying to say something and if the words aren't coming out right I get very very frustrated you don't even know I can't even handle sound no that happens not you girl says it's okay and we okay so I'm gonna go down so she can come back up so cuz her but one more thing Rachel how you gonna handle meet me you

up well you are you are so sweet you are I I promise you guys like if I'm like angry at a person for something that they did I'm gonna go directly to I have no fear of confrontation I think the only woman ever kind of comes to this panel that I'm scared of it's delayed it was just over strapping shoulder I love that puppy about four hours of Green Bay wacky's panel them talking about everything and last night there was a bunch of them that went in there and they deleted their YouTube accounts they just went in there they saying they're through they give up just deleting it they don't wait to see what YouTube was gonna do and just delete it everything Wow and he says I'm back and ready to roll out to these guys for a while oh my goodness you're four babies okay guys one of them the other ones in the hall right now they're both here they both hang it with me right didn't you excuse us please do I just smash that like guys on a spring thing wacky disk question no he said yes to the boss - this is the every time you - down and then they send out announcements about them I mean everything I'm done and he said yes I don't think so I don't where's your eyes Bubba I think that they only send out changes on things that could be legally pending or legally challenged you know they don't have to send out any everything on every little change that they made but if it's something that could cause them a legal issue they do okay to cover their butts which I agree with I mean which is exactly what they should do but for every little change no I don't think that they do oh there you go there you go was they I think there was some thoughts to that because if they weren't you'd be getting emails every day from YouTube about this change that's very strange right that's what I really think it all depends it the stuff that's in the Terms of Service things that are in the Terms of Service are there to those that's all legal verbage for youtube to cover them you know it's and that's why you have to agree to it in order to be a YouTube person you know but I'll look into it more if I find out in any more information I'll let you know cuz totally Kathy might have the the email from YouTube and if she does I'll get that from her you gotta have a little belt you got to get a little bill miss Canadian scrapper or like a triangle [Music] [Music] [Laughter] there's Krissy everybody

where i got it as i just said this one's 999 for a 6-0 ml bottle comes in all the above mentioned anyway yeah i just figured i would do that i hope you guys missed me because i really enjoy sitting in front of this camera doing these reviews for you guys and i've been absent and it's it felt like a year for me you know what i mean and i explained in the last video what happened it was the most scariest experience in my life being temporarily paralyzed from the waist down for about six hours oh my god i wish i'd never never in my life would ever experience ever ever ever something like that ever in my life ever again i said ever like 26 times anyway this one here sit back and relax tropic bubble gum uh the e-liquid yes all right delicious blend of ripened juicy tropical fruits and a candied effect but as you guys can see here it says it's got bananas oranges lemons kiwis pineapples and a bunch of other junk you guys can see as i said i don't really like their labels it's too cartoony for me all this other mess all right today we're going to go ahead and use my god award dna 250 by jw custom and we'll use the black cheetah version two all right let's go ahead and i'm not gonna say anything more about the the thing here but let's give this [ __ ] a good shake feeling a lot better believe it or not i mean uh like especially going into a hospital where you know covet is rampant and they gave me a test that day when i got rushed to the hospital and thank god thank god all the tests came back negative so i am thrilled about that and i knew i never had it but the media hypes a lot of stuff up not saying i'm not gonna get into a political war here with you guys because i don't judge anybody's political beliefs or religious beliefs or anything on this channel but let's go ahead and give this [ __ ] a good shake here did i open this oh i could smell that pineapple oh that's gonna be a hard one yeah i could smell the pineapple in this one and hopefully it's not that bad i smell that harshness in the pineapple and i could tell let's see we're not getting a visit from the factory americans okay wow that tastes weird i oddly get banana pineapple and kiwi go figure with that one yeah i get banana kiwi and pineapple but not a harsh pineapple anyway you guys already know we're gonna go ahead and saturate them oh wicks and i'll see you [ __ ] in a minute did i forget to mention flavor 15 all day every day and i hope it does help you guys out a little bit because uh you know trying to help you guys out all right so let's go ahead i should adjust my wattage i should really do it this one's at 50 cent 56 i never like to have my dnas go below 50 but uh we'll go ahead and give this one a good shot here i want to try it all right we're at 100 watts even all right so you guys already know i hope everybody is doing well i miss i seriously i've said it like three four times i miss you guys when i sit here and i actually miss you guys you know the comments the love and the support and you know i get occasional trolls that that like to talk [ __ ] about the channel saying that the videos are childlike and childish but you know what i try to make you guys laugh if if you want to you know a cardboard cutout reviewer hey this is this and this is that that's not this channel i just try to make it funny you know i'm not my normal self because for the past i want to say a good month month and a half i've been going through a lot of [ __ ] with this back [ __ ] so yeah this one's definitely smells tropical i definitely get like a kiwi and a pineapple and hopefully it's not that trash pineapple smells nice let's go ahead and see what we do here [ __ ] so this one is candy king tropic bubble gum collection we're sitting at comfortable 100 watts let's give this [ __ ] a horry no harsh pineapple which is good i definitely get like the guava is there guava in here no i get the kiwi um i don't get lemon nor do i get the orange but it's supposed to be a tropical flavor but i am getting a lot of tropical flavors in here but not like as you see on here on the description or or actually on the label but um it's not bad knowing this company does hit and mess with me because their labels suck and 85 or 80 percent of the time their juice is all right but it's really sweet so keep that in mind that's that's bearable it's actually not bad it tastes it tastes very tropical i like i said i hate repeating myself but i get like a tropic like like a pineapple which is good it's a good pineapple not so much banana and like a pineapple and a kiwi it's not bad and to be honest with you it's not overpoweringly sweet it's actually a nice juice so i'll give it to him on this one no throat hit and that's pretty much good that's good to go it's got a nice flavor so it is available you guys already know and i would recommend that it's not bad so i i'm not gonna sit here and batch something that doesn't need to be bashed that's gonna do it for me i'm gonna keep it short and sweet as the first video this week was like 10 to 12 minutes because i like to talk so i like to explain myself and you guys already know number one i'm a virgo i just need

about your brand not a problem I've got pig thing after you eat had some piqu\u00e9 piqu\u00e9 has the clean fresh taste and a freshness burst that refreshes your breath", "HsbXeBC3WQ0": "hello I've just got a quick question what makes chewing gum chewy so do you think chewing gum is made of a type of rubber it turns out the gum world is surprisingly secretive we contacted two of the biggest manufacturers Wrigley's and Cadbury's but neither were very enthusiastic about a visit hi my name is Mira welcome but fortunately Mira said yes to find my way into chewing gum country.you months this company's ingredients are all-natural derived from plants and trees first the intriguing gum base is mixed with all the other raw materials including sweeteners and flavorings once you put all of the ingredients in to the table little bit longer today your have you seen the film I don't this factory can make over 200,000 pieces of chewing gum a day but what gum maker Dan using if it's all natural resource it from the Central American rainfall how'd you know what your clothes so it clays the sample Sapodilla tree this gum has been used for thousands of years the tree is tapped and the gum filtered then cooked it's all about texture really there's not much taste there it tastes like chewing gum when you had it in your mouth you know part for now on and there's no flavor left yet but natural chewing gums constitute only a fraction of the market so what's in the regular gum base and kate's come to Germany run away to the largest this plant owned by bats spans ten square kilometers here they make things like paints pesticides detergent mattress foam and the key ingredient in the gum most of us chew so what part of the chewing gum base do they make okay so most of the chewing gums of the quality chewing gums contain polyisobutylene and if you had a chewing gum without probably yes it would not be so tasty because Polly I see butene is responsible for the for let me say a slow flavor release which means you have a longer joy of your chewing gum and then what keeps you as well and it keeps everything together yes makes it the chew really smoothly and tasty here are some applications of all of our Polly ICT team it's used for sealant for insulating class the attitude to protect the insulating class right everywhere everywhere and also in tires not in each tire but mainly in racing tires to improve the grip especially when it's raining so this is the outside part of the plant and here over the pipe racks are coming the raw materials and everything you need and the raw material is the liquefied gas it's similar to what you have in your fire lighter in your cigarette lighter and it's under pressure and then you put in a catalyst and then the reaction takes place what is your catalyst that is my secret is it can we see what comes out of the other end of that yes of course let's go over there to the filling station sway yep so the gum base actually starts live as a gas which is transformed using a secret ingredient into this could I touch it please do not touch it here but we can take a sample over there and then you can have a you can put it in your hands 150 degrees I'm really sticking oh nothing like your fingers being stuck together by scorching super low isn't it yeah okay we don't want to do that so how hot is this stuff now it's cooling pretty fast so let's oh that is stickier you're like with it it's sticky stuff can i chew this cell you could but within BSF we have a strict rule not to put our products in our mouths here in this stage of production [Music]", "AHPsReBH_zU": "my snack heads would ah so I'm at the airport waiting on a client to come to and why not do a snack review Bubblegum's cherry Slurpee flavored bubble gum

like the that's the go-to slushie when you can't decide cherries always blazing no matter what versus the airhead watermelon flavored bubblegum now we all know airheads for being that a stretchable taffy candy that everybody loves who doesn't no one turns down an ear you know because they have so many flavors in airheads are banging no matter what somebody had to hear him but yo you want this you like yeah they make gum this is crazy man and it says it has micro candies inside like the that bubblegum with the little mint micro crystals inside the crystal flavor gum but yeah it's in this 2017 bubble gum off damn to date a bigot I don't even this type of gum you up it has that little rap that you pull all these pack of gum should have this right here you fold this around you get the first gum out you don't have to rip it and it opens all up and you can just close it just like this loop done if you didn't know that that's how you do this it smells just like a cherry Celebi oh my god that's what I love about the chewy and I like how it makes your mouth red and you look like a vampire that just has some bad blood when you eat like a cherry Slurpee smells so good alright let's open a V airheads gum yeah they also got the little pulling wrap things right here all around BAM it's open and yeah it's just like those stick a bubble gum like the chewing gum is like the little cigarette pack boom but this one opens out usually it flips down this one opens out like BAM yeah they're 14 pieces of like thinner gums and this has 1 2 3 4 5 5 in here smells just like the watermelon area so go to whoo you know I be wanting to take this and stick it in the vent of my car think I'm gonna do that just open a couple stick it in the vent in the car I hope want to get hot I don't melt but so when you turn the AC you just blow to the car and all my customers like it's not so good they're gonna want to licked it the the headrest of my seat and I'm like lady could put your tongue back in your mouth lady put your tongue back in your mouth like to taste it here go wow some sweet orange flavor there heck is this bust it out in the gum that's right here I don't know it was supposed to do that but mmm Wow okay this is crazy sweet now the heck was that go so I got a little flavor crystals in here it feels like little pieces of the airhead taffy candy crazy sweet I do taste the watermelon but I had this like this minty type of flavor that wow the little pieces that's in here it's like it disintegrates on your tongue so I guess that combined together with the sweet gum that's a little bit too much sweet yeah a lot going on right there I don't know there's a lot going on see a gum like that way is too heavily sweet and have other candy in here you'll make a mistake and just swallow the gum pause like you like just a little bit too much going on there being I don't want to feel like I got a swallow of the gum pause all right whoa dump sweet let me get on the water was it like tasting it go I can take Pisco oh yeah right off the RIP its no logo and no it tastes just like like a cherry I think they froze and just basic froze a cheery little piece of the cherry Slurpee and just formed into some gum blaze it tastes just like some cherry Slurpee but if you love the chili Slurpee this is obviously bang yo bubblegum bubblegum yeah to me way better than

you tuned in to our last episode then you know that we are currently looking at some of the nostalgic candies we carry in our store in part one of this series we looked at a few different candies old-fashioned hard candy smarties candy necklaces and rock candy if you haven't seen it go check it out then come right back and watch this episode now let's dive in to part two of the [Music] series the fifth item on our list of nostalgic candies is this gum that i have right here in front of me now i know what you're thinking nicole there are three gums there yeah i know but i'm lumping them all into one category so this gum here we've got blackjack which this was the first chewing gum in america created by thomas adams also the first gum to be made in stick form that's pretty notable we have a lot of gum in stick form now a lot of it is much smaller sticks but this this paved the way for all the other gums the big red the double mint all of that formed just like this in stick form now this has been a favorite amongst black licorice fans since the late 1800s that's a long time i don't like black licorice but if you do check out the blackjack chewing gum the next gum that i have in my hand is beeman's now beeman's was created in the late 1890s by dr edward e beeman it was originally called bemens with an apostrophe s they later dropped the apostrophe and just called it bemens now the funny thing about beamns is this was originally formulated with what is called pepsin or pepsin powder and if you're thinking well that kind of sounds familiar i'm not talking about pepsi okay i'm talking about that pink liquid medicine that you sometimes take when your stomach's just gurgling a little too much maybe because you ate too many nachos the night before or sugar-free gummies or keto candy or anything with mct oil in it you just combined way too many foods that should not have been combined you reach for the pepto-bismol so this gum right here bemens was originally created with pepsin powder and it was used to ease heartburn and aid digestion just like pepto-bismol is and it still has that same kind of minty flavor but it doesn't have pepsin powder in it because fun fact that's really bad for you so instead just choose some demons or take some pepto-bismol the last gum here is clove now clove has a pretty unique flavor that's about all i'm going to say about that flavor it's also been around since prohibition era and it was valued as a breath refresher all those people that uh went out and drank at the bars when you weren't supposed to or they were making moonshine and in all their moonshine when you weren't supposed to they probably chewed clove gum to hide that smell that lingered on their breath so number five nostalgic gums blackjack demons and clove next up on our list number six is what a lot of people just call wax bottles but these wax bottles have a brand name and that brand name is called nickel nip now nickel nip has been around since the early 20th century a long time ago and the name nickel nip it's a combo name nickel nip comes from the combination of a few words nick comes from nickel which was the original cost of a pack of nickel knit bottles nip comes from basically how you're supposed to enjoy these you're supposed to bite the end off and then you take a nip back in prohibition days they had nips basically which were like those tiny little dollar size bottles of liquor that you can get everywhere now a nip you just just a little bit just a little sip so nickel nip you just buy it off and you just drink this so what is this this is a wax bottle and it's filled with fruit flavored liquid that's it if you look you can kind of see the little bubbles yeah there's liquid in there these things can get pretty messy if they get a hole in them that liquid it just drips right out if you bite it off then of course it's going to come out i'm going to demonstrate it for you it's wax so it's intended to be chewed not swallowed you should not just throw this whole thing in your mouth and just chew it all up and be done you bite the top off and then you drink it did a pretty terrible job of biting that be careful when you bite it you don't want to actually close the wax pardon all of my lipstick getting all over this but if you look inside there you can see there is a tiny hole there and you just drank it out what does it taste like believe it or not they do all have different flavors orange yeah it was orange flavored but not just regular orange they have fun little names for all of these too so orange is oh so orange and then the red is chillin cherry because of course it is the yellow is not mellow yellow that name's already taken it's hello yellow and then the green is groovin green and then the internet didn't tell me what the blue one is called the blue is not one of the original four color flavor combos i don't know when the blue came around later but it's probably like blaze and berry or some other catchy thing now does it taste good if i was a kid i'd be like yeah this tastes good because it's kind of reminiscent of like kool-aid or you know those freezer pops that are real popular with kids they come in like the plastic sleeve so if you were to not freeze those and just drink them that's exactly what this tastes like and then once all of that's gone they recommend just chewing this like gum and like gum you're not supposed to swallow it you just chew on it and chew on it and chew on it let's be honest some of you adults out there i know you swallowed this that's nickel nip they've been around for years they're super popular kids of all ages love them and adults when they see them they're like hey do you remember that i kind of lose their appeal which i don't know why they would it's just wax that you get to chew on it's like eating a candle and it's not even scented or flavored", "Ulkcetocz5E": "hey guys welcome back to another video today for 100 subscribers

going to be doing eight Peaks taste it I know there's a lot of different keeps challenges out there but I'm just gonna be doing a peeps taste it so I'm gonna say how I found so didn't pubes so we were on the way home from like a mini-vacation checking out a college because my brother's looking into going to colleges next year and we went to Walmart on the way there and not all the way back and we found a bunch of peeps there and I decided to do a challenge so you've got sour watermelon blue raspberry bubblegum party cake and we've got three mystery boxes so I'm gonna start with not mystery cuz I'm worried for mysteries and any dessert with sour water not just water tower and I am usually a fan of the normal piece oh they have sugar coatings that screen but the insides paint hmm so it's good if you don't like sour it's fine it's not that sour at all it's really like fizzy tasting the surface can I have a paper towel please bad stuff okay back out so now I'm doing to taste which what I think will be my favorite of all the peeps which is blue eye lovely raspberry on the river take them off so it's white on insides of blue crystals so this this really blue raspberry but it is so delicious if you like blue raspberry like me mmm-hmm that is delicious as you really like that so if your love blows raspberry you see blue raspberry peeps I recommend them they're really good now this one is bubblegum flavored which and worried I like bubble bomb but I don't really think so much yes and I was taste his head oh they're picked in the inside pink sugar like the pink pink pink it tastes good but bladder gum bubble gum most it needs to sugar like these so these taste like strawberry sugar to me just think it tastes like strawberry chips too this is our last flavored one that's not a mystery flavor this one I'm I'm more I think the spinner tastes like I like vanilla which is it is birthday cake birthday cake marshmallow so it's a walk like off-white peep blue circles with blue sugar with like sprinkles so now ah was not very good it tastes like really bad vanilla oh I don't like that that's really bad so alright so now we've got um I'm trying one of the mysteries boxes it says some of the flavors you can get a freebie sour zesty so yeah so I cannot tell you at all what flavor I'm tasting smells like marshmallows so it is a white speak with white sugar I can't see without it because it tastes like vanilla it's good but it tastes like vanilla but I'm gonna try another one cuz I'm not sure if they all are different flavors mystery to me so I'm just I won more from this pack I'm Justin I tried another one to loose that box and it really tastes like vanilla - I don't know what's a locking flavour of these very lightly or if they what they did to it so I'm gonna start by trying the next piece box of mystery so I got keeps exploding I'm smelling it okay just by smelling it I can tell this one's going to taste like fruity the free one but this one has a way stronger flavor this one tastes fruit fruit fruit so I'm almost getting teeth when I just Oh almost down that's our that's like fruit with um sour after this I'm gonna try one more like from the box this one tastes the same so I think they might make all the time saver in the box I have one more keeps to drive oh this was like burned it smells like burned stuff I don't know what this is but I

finished off but my favorite one again polar ice this particular gum has little flavor crystal pellet things kind of gummy they've gone and it's called gummy all right I'll go with it as kind of the flavor crystals to give you extra bursts of men the flavor of this gum lasts longer than your desire to chew gum will so you know this is no juicy fruit or big red or double mint or if you know some of those weaker Wrigley gums I like extra ham I've already talked about this in relation to toothpaste in a previous video but things that are minty the minty are the better if you ever find a minty or gum than extra polar ice let me know we've tried other ones some of those five guns and things like that it's not the same you know this gum is the right texture consistency you know it keeps its flavor the longest and it's the mint is so that is my ringing endorsement for extra polar ice you can find it in the checkout line of pretty much any store anywhere any time it's it's pretty common pretty big goodness everybody likes it let me know the comments below what kind of gum do you like and especially if you're aware of a mid tier gum or something that you like more than polar ice let me know and I'll try it out I'll let you know what I think of that one too and don't forget to subscribe to this channel appreciate you tuning in", "O8m61wsakzs": "welcome to this episode of random

gentlemen I've got tropic from candy King's new bubblegum collection let's have a little closer look if you don't mind I'll read off my script to make this a little bit more easier for me tropic is a sweet pink bubblegum loaded with exotic tropical fruit flavors I read that you'll read notes of orange TV mango pineapple and banana infused into a bubble gum and that is quite the amount of flavours if you ask me we'll have to see what will taste once baby it I'm used to seeing candy King selling their bottles in 120 milliliter bottles but this did come in 120 milliliter but not just like you know this this is sixty millimeter epilobium it came in this they call it a twin pack inside here you get two sixty millimeter bottles bringing it up to well 120 milliliter to be more exact it actually came two bottles with the room of sixteen milliliter in total so two bottles with 50 milliliter of juice leaving the little room in each bottles for a Nick shot of 10 milliliter of nicotine I guess and and I've added that inside of one so what will I do with the other bottle that I have right this is my bottle and I've got an extra one in here I promise I may be can't hear it but I promise I got one X right here so why why would I otherwise have this twin packet and this is the one I'm gonna review that's why I have it but yes as you can see in the title when this video is up that that will probably be removed later when it's no giveaway anymore but yes this is a giveaway so since I got 250 milliliter bottles I'm thinking of giving the other one away and to be able to win my second

this virtues that I will be reviewing here very soon but first off I'm just gonna tell you what more candy have in their bubble gum collection well they have melon grape blue rounds and pink lemonade and of course tropic which I will be reviewing today so let's start off by smelling the veggies so as I mentioned at the beginning this way juice has a lot of flavors inside of it but we'll see maybe we won't even notice half of them so let's just start off with a little sniffing sniff sniff smells fruity yeah I mostly smell fruits like a fruit salad you know I don't know what the primary flavor is in here not getting a lot of the bubblegum which should be the main profile with all the fruits hidden inside I guess you know but let's fill it up and I'm doing it off camera here cuz I don't wanna hold it up oh I was going to put on my cap on today vape juice but that doesn't work and in my last video I actually didn't know this until I actually uploaded the video that I forgot to mention what setup I'm vaping on so let's not forget that this time but I usually vape on my health a dead rabbit or da or my so keep that's right you will so keeper I've got about the company name as well so yeah this will be my first puff on the Tropic by Kenny king in their new bubblegum collection first puff well just reading on those flavors earlier I expected it to be like very very fruity but it's actually quite mild you know mixing all the fruits together into one unique flavor and yeah little bit a little bit of pink bubblegum in there well this is definitely a hard use for me to try to pinpoint you know what I'm actually tasting so I'm gonna try to not talk about the vape juice for far too long because I tend to do that sometimes so the videos get you know far too long I'm repeating myself and all that so I'm just gonna try to mention what I'm tasting right now sitting here and what I'm tasting is a tiny bit of the pink bubblegum and actually the banana a banana essence I would guess is quite you know pungent you know it's it's it speaks its little head out a little bit more extra than the other flavor profiles in there yeah bikini uh-huh a tiny hint of banana now and the key is coming morph through more it's definitely sweets like a foodie candy like bubblegum it's it's weird it's it's hard to explain it's not really like a sweet hard candy it really does feel soft like a bubblegum yeah the more I vape it the more the bubblegum actually comes through I'm gonna drip in some more I might sound crazy right now but I'm actually getting different flavors every puff it's it's weird it's very weird now I'm actually getting more of the orange and pineapple earlier I got more of the banana in the TV but the bubblegum is still there it's quite a mind-boggling flavor this now I'm getting the Kiwi again it's it's yeah you'll have to try this yourself to actually know what you're vaping on but it's it's it's quite tropic I would say yeah it's really tropic that's a good name for it Kiwi banana pineapple yeah I'm getting it all and it's very smooth it's a smooth soft flavor it's very kind I don't know what that was it's just it mixes very well all the fruits let's just get over to rating the virtues shall we I would give it a 7 out of 10 it's not like very very good I want this in my mouth all the time but it's it's you know I can appreciate them mixing so many flavors and and actually and actually getting the vapor to taste what they put in there it's it's hard to mix of a cheese I know from experience and I appreciate these lectures I guess you

seems like everybody and their dog is doing construction so there's truck noise I apologize but it's just too beautiful to be inside so what we're gonna do is we're gonna put two Bubblegum's hitch head and see which one's best we're gonna go with hubba bubba which name is synonymous with big bubbles and we're gonna put it against the nostalgic favorite of big league chew and when i was a little girl my older brother who's five years older than me ate this stuff and so of course because he was older I just thought he was the coolest therefore this stuff was the coolest so it gets a half of a mark just for nostalgia but it also has aspartame which I'm no scientist I still don't know if that's okay or not but I'm gonna take away that house nostalgic mark for that so I'm a non-partisan judge now it's all fair Z square Z's so they're going to be marked on the following ha the flavor they're both original flavors so which one is the better original how quickly you can go from putting it in your mouth to being able to blow a bubble and also which one gives you the biggest bubble blowing ability so we're gonna start with hubba bubba i don't eat a lot of bubble gum per se although it's so fun i need a lot of chewing them just for my breath okay I don't have a stopwatch but I have a watch okay 33 and well oh wait so it gets to the half minute mark so it's easy for my brain marks at Oh hey it's been a minute and a half we're gonna give it a whirl not bad two minutes mmm okay so that bubble was at two and a half minute don't look next big leg - I'm gonna try to make it even and only put it about the same amount as one of those pieces of Hubba Bubba although this is the original shredded gum what do you think if I mash that up that looks fair sure it went up I'll hold my jaws I forgot to tie up okay the point per flavor goes to brother Bubba I should have had a point for softness that would have gone to hubba bubba - okay two and a half minutes here we go um and you know what skew format I can tell it was gonna be a long time before I could blow a bubble and it was really syrupy in thin there is actually no contest between the two of them in my mind Hubba Bubba clapping you have by far made a superior gum so this bad boy is gonna be put up against another one next week and we'll see which is the winner from that thanks for watching make sure you subscribe

how to make homemade chewing gum let's go [Music] now what you're going to need is gum mix it look like pellets and there they'll Bend a little bit now you need roughly 57 grams which is two ounces now you might be able to find this in your local supermarket if you can't find this in your local supermarket there is a link in the description bars to where you can buy this online so what you want to do is get a microwave-safe dish this will work anything that you've got that you can put in the microwave and you want to have as I said 57 grams or 2 ounces put it in the microwave on HIGH for 90 seconds and then check it to see if it's quite gooey if you think it's gooey enough to sort of work with then that's fine if it's still a bit hard and hasn't quite good enough try another 30 seconds and on top of that another 30 seconds and keep doing that until you think it's ready to go now while that's melting or heating up in the microwave you want to get some corn syrup can also be called glucose sir if it's derived from corn then that's what you need now what you need for the corn syrup is the same amount 57 grams or 2 ounces put it in something like a mug which then will go in a bowl and you want to put hot or boiling water in there just so the glucose will soften a bit more now this should be really soft so see how I can just squash it like that very simple so that's ready now what you want to do is get that confectionery sugar put about half of it just you know mound on a cutting board on your on your bench wherever is good for you they'll get that gum base that you've melted now get the corn syrup and pour it straight over it have a careful it's going to be a bit hot so just mix it in with something like a I like to use a metal little metal fork now you want to pull this straight over the confectionery sugar mound get that and pour it straight over now don't worry if it's really really sticky it's supposed to be now you can use your hands or get a rolling pin I like to use a bit of both get some of the confectionery sugar and just put it over the rolling pin start rolling it flat just a little bit like that then just get it and mush it all together with your hand now it's going to be very very gooey it's okay it should be now put the remaining sugar over it just cut it into two bits flatten it out just a little bit don't worry what it looks like for now now what you want to do is put in your flavour now you can use anything you can use jell-o gelatin like jelly crystal powder if you want to use kool-aid powder that's fine and just sprinkle it straight over both and then mix it in so just do whatever you want to do need it flatten it squash it roll it this is the fun part now the amount of this flavor that you put in is entirely up to you I usually put in anywhere between two and four teaspoons of it all right step two balls now we just want to flatten them out then what you want to do is just get a knife and cut them up into whatever size pieces you want that's not a knife this is a knife yeah now this is just another batch that I did where I just added a few drops of food coloring so you can see it can make quite a difference to the to the gum just with a few drops so you can see it's yeah nice and gummy oh yeah so yeah so that's what you have to do if you want to add a lot of color to it just put food coloring in three four five six drops whatever you want depending on how dark you want well I hope you like this homemade bubblegum or homemade chewing gum so good straight into it more more I'll see you next time for my next meal [Music]", "M-k7GRxw5zM": "what is going on guys it is our hitman games here welcome back to the channel for another video today we have my girlfriend here with us I still haven't done your

just like a straight mobile go and not like whatever else is in it but this is what we got this is it so if you had to give it a rating right now out of ten what would you give it really great it for

from the guys over at contains gum in the mantle the end of four pieces also gave me a coupon to but i with this gum supposedly it's supposed to be like really really like explosive when you eat it I guess so they gave me four samples they have on a scale from I guess one to ten the weakest one they gave me is a seven that's the blast factor it's called crazy Cola and then there the second one last factor is local women I like lemon so why not and third one is melon berry slam that is the nine on their blast factor and then it also gave me the max okay which is super uber mint I was a free content so let's let's try the seven crazy Cola it's a little smushed but well here we go Wow okay so right away I tasted the cola we're gonna get a really minty explosive flavor and that's just a seven holy crap that's really minty hi oh my geez it's really good though it's really good still got the mint flavor in my mouth I'm guessing that's supposed to be the explosive part but yeah so the second one is they ate the local lemon that's a good lemon flavor - wow there's a blast hmm holy crap it's really good honestly we're really pretty [ __ ] awesome actually Wow that lemon flavor election really strong too like it's still staying still staying with it I'm trying to like to describe it as best as I can but it's it's just really minty I guess that's how they get the explosive part across but it was really good the lemon stayed with it pretty good but here is a the melon berry slam the number-9 nothing a very quick alright melon berry slam there we go whoa open the package

all right the melon berry flavor is still there so good so worth it like once you get past the explosive part which is the flavor is still there so it makes it that much better I guess but really strong really good it's kind of hard to describe it honestly it's just explosive like yeah it's like a grenade that's why I call it grenades go so good Oh shoulder that was seven eight and nine then

like looks like one of the sticks I'm just gonna chew it in like you know how I felt about it I just had my first stick and in my opinion it is really good and it has a lot less sugar if not it's totally sugar-free but there is some sugar content I believe I will definitely recommend this flavor this is a video look at trial and cinnamon if you found this helpful please subscribe comment or thumbs up thanks for watching this one engineer", "8qNjiG6ZoxI": "hello everyone and welcome again to the dollar tree deals i have right here from dollar tree for one dollar is jelly donut double bubble bubble gum let's see if this deal is a must or a bust never really had a lot of money in the bank it's hard to pay the mortgage and fill the gas tank that's why i won't take a little time to thank i thank god for the dollar store i love gum i love bubble gum i love double bubble bubble gum but this is pushing it so basically it's jelly donut gum with a jelly filling grape jelly filling go ahead and open this up now you'll see popping up there on your screen the information on it it has five grams of sugar per gumball and there's about 15 in here should we count and make sure there's 15. you all ready for this smells like it's like great in here so let me bring you down here with me so let's see i'm gonna have one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen just like the package says you ever buy a bag of air with chips in them and you're like man you know how much more they could have fit in here also i do think like with a bag of blaze like it could yeah the quality of the chip it could get squishy it wouldn't have enough room to actually slide around and stay fresh as opposed to being like just crushed in with a bunch of chips all right so here we go i'm going to bite into this and see about the filling because i don't know if i feel like cutting this and it's not it's not squeezing let's do this open it up oh there's there's a jelly filling look at that it's like stringy kind of like i don't know like a paste there you go reminds me of like juicy drop gummies and it has like the stuff you dip it into that's what that reminds me of right there [Music] all right so that took me about a minute worth of chewing to just break through this and get to what i think i know what i'm going to say about this correct me if i'm wrong because maybe you didn't think this i expect you to taste donut i expect it to taste donut mixed with a juicy like raspberry grapey flavoring like like a filled donut jelly filled doughnut what i taste here for one it's very sweet for a small piece of gum that's a lot of sugar and a small piece of gum i taste it tastes just like like a a berry grapey kind of gum is what that tastes like and i don't taste donut whatsoever now do i like it i do like the gum good double bubble gum it reminds me just like double bubble grape gum is what that reminds me of it doesn't have anything special to it so for that purpose and because of the fact it says jelly donut it's brown they're brown balls of gum they don't taste like jelly doughnut double bubble what gives is this a must or a bust still throwing it but it's a bite simply because it's not tasting like it's marketed to taste like it shows the great feeling like it's this amazing thing coming out of this jelly donut flavored gum even on the back side it's not happening for me so therefore if you go to the dollar tree and get these don't expect a whole lot guys thank you for watching this video keep watching because every week i'm going to have some more dollar tree deals and you let me know if you think they are a mustard bust as well may the fourth beauty makes presents before you always put a bow in the show cause that's a wrap the show stops here never quit y'all", "KhTsRdJeLyQ": "[Music] hello hello everyone and welcome back to another video today they're gonna be done either public or a challenge and we have Hydra Bubba Bubba Bubba double bubble bazooka painters alright so when what I taste each one we're gonna be doing I'm gonna be telling you guys how hard it is what it tastes like how much juice contains in it and how big of a bubble you can blob so let's get started first we have stuff hubba bubba this it's not that hard it's not hard it doesn't have any flavor and doesn't have my guys now that's a good sign for the bubble-blowing I'm pretty bad I'm gonna ask you questions because how's the juice how is it juicy why's this okay is it soft enough to blow a bubble I think it's too hard I think it's too hard to blow a bubble true some more than right now I think it's good little bubble so I can even figure out I mean actually to take this number Bubba you cannot blow bubbles with it next kind of scared of and these blue ones are the blue ones are the most sour and I got a blue one I was it with the taste is better or worse than the okay how about blowing a bubble No so honestly I would say that the that was just what time it guys this isn't happening right now what time it took three of these in it and I blew the biggest bubble boy it's sittin between the hub of Allah and the crybabies what is it between people so the hardness is between the hubba bubba and AK right there baby it's like right in the middle there is no absolute no juice because the path how so plain and so dry no flavor but this is called double bubble so I'm guessing that it's going to make a huge okay keep trying we'll speed it up well the one you did just before that what do you think was the best bubble of the three of them that wanna blow big bubble chew it for longer than Nate you'll be getting like that kid wait a minute I have to say something wait I used the bazooka when I was a little kid and it cost a penny each one and there used to be a comic in each one also a little comics let's look at Joe yeah absolutely so let's see now if they still have that magic taste to it this one has the least flavor out of all of them no least flavor it tastes like air like there's a juice better or worse than me if you had to rate it with the hub of a double bubble and cry-baby which one is the best so far with the juice which gives you the most juice bazooka best juice okay that's juice but no flavor huh okay what'd you do for a while it actually comes out with a strawberry flavor okay is it getting soft yet we were looking we found that each one has this inside of it so we figured that me my pop my pop actually had two of them so we found out the more that you chew on it the smaller it gets so I don't recommend you guys with [Music] let's try it's really hard oh oh oh was that an iron inch one of a different flavors I guess okay so it tastes like the color that it's supposed to be black would be lovely this black look like brown brown okay so guys did you see the double bubble over there well my pops about to get it you ready a blue bubble I got to enjoy number two alright alright so now we are gonna be they're gonna be dancing wasn't she category for what the winner from each one is alright so they're the hardest one now we all will see it with the winners are at the for tigress eye I'll be naming each category and you'll be telling which one wins for each one so so for now there's our number one hard I would say it is definitely painters by far paint there's ways for hard the taste that would definitely be the part of a baby's now I had to definitely motion most juiciest woman out taste bazooka and the last one the biggest bubbles double bubble just I don't know what you could win we could win a punch in the face and evolve for these Bubblegum's or five cut cut cut now didn't cut it out of all my five I've will use five bubblegum so I'll say my here is double Oh [Music] so that's hopefully you enjoyed this video please subscribe leave a like and get back to you guys next time [Music]", "MQyhyZ-Ufvw": "there's a brand new bubblegum in town Leymah

Just a little strip of Wonka's magic chewing gum and that is all you will... ...ever need at breakfast, lunch and dinner. This piece of gum happens to be tomato soup, roast beef and blueberry pie.

will be doing different stuff for my channel not just unboxings and reviews and stuff one of things I want to do is geek candy so basically stuff you don't normally see and today we've got chopper chubs cotton Bubblegum's we're going to try this out and see what this is like now I don't actually remember I'll pick this up from just like home bargains or somewhere you know one of those stores which just sells random stuff stuff you don't normally see in normal supermarkets like Tesco etc but first things first it says first is cotton candy and then it's bubble gum so very pink I don't know where this is from it says Holland on the back so let's fly this out smells amazing so it says tutti fruity flavor this drawing is a fancy representation on the product so I'll let you have a close-up of that so let's actually see what this stuff is like it looks like layers of stuff I need something to put down on here okay I've got a special like I pad kind of a chopping board so we'll put it down on here for now so it looks like if you ever seen fiberglass like the kind of stuff you repair cars with it looks a bit like that and it's going everywhere so I'll let you have a close-up of lat if it'll focus so very much like kind of candy floss stuff and it tears apart really easily but it's making a right mess so let's get a pump of this it almost dissolves into nothing but very very sweet let's tear off a big chunk of this he's supposed to fight this I don't really know again must have checked like that and it dissolves to almost nothing you can see the different layers in the back there as well hmm it's almost chewy straight away instantly but within seconds its bubble gum it tastes really really good so there we have it chopper chops cotton bubblegum tutti fruity flavor really really nice see you guys in the next one like I shoulda fold that in half and eat the whole thing in one go that's a bad idea isn't it what do we think I'll do it let's do it it's getting stuck

today we're going to be taking a look at my top five favorite nicotine salt salt nicotine however you want to say it a liquids I know this has been a highly requested video I'm noting going to do some more this is going to be my top five as of now I have tried a bunch of different ones the ones we do carry the ones we don't carry but these are going to be my current top five and we do carry all five of these on Ash Malibu's calm there'll be a link in the description and you can save 25% off with coupon code salt si LT and I'll take 25% off any of these five flavors here so the device I'm going to be using is the aspire breeze I've got four of the breezes lined up and then I have the breeze too I've got them coated here see which flavors in it because I've got two blue and two red breezes so I do have five of the or four of those and then one of them is going to be the breeze to using point six own coils in all five of these devices aspire breeze point six ohms and yep we're gonna start off right away let's go with the V God luscious so it comes in a 30ml bottle v God luscious watermelon flavor comes in 25 and 50 or it comes in 30 and 50 milligrams two options there I'm using a 50 milligram watermelon VG PG on this guy is a 50/50 blend got it in this weather make sure my high-tech little note here on this breeze you got lustrous let's go ahead and have a vape all rights on the V Gadd lucious it's definitely a watermelon with a little bit of candy taste in there not too much candy I get more of the fruity watermelon taste on it they also do have a luscious iced version which is a menthol version of this but it's a really good watermelon I've tried a bunch of watermelons we have the salty Club watermelon as well so I have tried a bunch of watermelons and I really really like this one a lot 30-mil bottle $15.99 and you can get 25% off using that code salt on Aspen Valley babes calm next up we have a classic here mr. salty blue razz lemonade this is one of the first nicotine it might even be the first one actually I tried solid nicotine a liquids I've got it in this red breeze here with my high tech writing on it mr. salty I am using the 45 milligram on this one and the mr. salty is a 60/40 VG PG blend let's have a vape on this blue res lemonade so the flavor on this blue res lemonade is definitely more blue razz that is lemonade it's a sweet candy blue razz with eliminate undertone but it gives it a little bit more of a throw head I feel like I like a lot of lemonade I like some of the other mr. salty bluegrass but lemonade's are definitely one of my favorite flavor profiles out there and this one's a good smooth not too sweet some of the mr. salty flavors are pretty sweet like the cotton candy but this one is really just subtle it's a very very good Etha quit out it is also one of the first nicotine salty liquid sigh did you so I mean that probably does factor into why I like it so much is because it's one of the first ones I use I like it a lot but mr. salty blue razz links will be in the description again next up of course can't do a top-five Nick salt video without one of our own salty Club blueberry we do have three flavors in the salty colorblind blueberry mango and watermelon just simple really good basic flavors not trying to go crazy with the descriptions or anything just want to perfect the good basic flavors out there and yeah it's definitely included in mine I mean I tried hundreds of variation on hundreds of variations probably like 3040 variations of the blueberries and this is the one we did settle on really really do like this blueberry let's go ahead and have forgot to mention here on the salty Club it's a 60/40 VG PG blend 45 milligram is what I'm using right now and it's a very smooth it doesn't have as much of a throw hit as some other 45 milligrams out there it's probably like a seven on the throat hit scale at 45 milligrams while some of the other 45s hit a little bit harder I'd say it's actually on par with mr. saw T's blue whereas lemonade for the for the throat hit effect at 45 milligrams but it's a really good smooth blueberry with a pretty good amount of candy in there it's like a blueberry can be very very good next up we have I love assault strawberry on here 30ml bottle 50/50 blend from the guys over at Mad Hatter very good eliquid spy Mad Hatter I like a lot of their different lines the Aden line I love cookies the I love everything line this is the I love salt line they have five flavors two more actually coming out this week I believe but I've got the pile of salt strawberry candy in here and 50 milligrams I got it in the aspire breeze with a point six own 50/50 blend let's have a vape so on the strawberry candy is a strawberry candy flavor it's not too fruity it's not too sweet which I was surprised by I thought it was gonna be a lot sweeter coming from like their I love candy line and some of those other flavors I really like but this one's more of a mellow strawberry candy flavor it pretty much explains it in the name you definitely get more of a strawberry on the inhale and then on the exhale is more of the candy so it's going to have one more babe on this I love salt strawberry candy yeah it's a very smooth very very good fruit candy bling strawberry candy can't go wrong there and then the last one in here I'm going to include it just because I know a lot of you guys that use the salt nicotine's like tobacco and I so I figured it would be good to include it tobacco flavor and there's two it came down to for me including a tobacco flavor in this it's the VDI Cubano which is a sweet Q and cigar flavor pretty sweet tobacco flavor and then the I love salts tobacco and the I love salt tobacco actually took the cake that is the one out of the two for my personal preference I've got it in the Aspire breeze too here 0.6 own coil 50/50 blend in here this is the 50 milligram on the I love salts sweet tobacco very very smooth good throw hit on the salt on the sweet tobacco by I love salts and it's not overpowering sweet it sort of reminds me of an ry4 blend without that caramel a little extract flavoring that they use in the ry4 it's just tobacco with a little bit of sweet in there it's a very very good taste very good tobacco blend again I don't bake tobacco too much but I've been starting to recently especially with the B got Kevon and like I was saying so I figured I would try the I left salt sweet tobacco and I'm a big fan I do like it more actually than the Cubano so to the I love salts are going to make it in this top five at the king of strawberry candy in the tobacco and then just following up real quick we got mr. salty blue razz lemonade salty Club blueberry and then the final one luscious by viga and salt Nick those are gonna wrap up my top 5 would you carry all these on a smelly babes calm again coupon code salt s alt for 25% off any of these flavors here and we

buy some new for some professional recording equipment such as a better resolution camera a tripod better lighting and all that stuff for this channel to be 100% professional and just be be more out there I guess in terms of professionality so I hope you guys enjoyed that unboxing of the 5 gum brain and but after I actually unboxed it I realized that most of the information is actually on the packaging so that was a bad move on my part I really hate that I opened it I feel like such a  but here we go you guys I'll try to read it off and show you at the same time but first I'll show you the packaging so this is the I've gone packaging umm it's very prestigious and I'm really thinking that's why they're expensive you know it's it's a couple cents more than the than any other gum scene so right here is kind of soft it's got a cool design 3ds and a raindrop right there because it's rain and on the right side it's kind of plasticy same is on the back this sides kind of plasticky and right here is kind of really soft so we opened this and I already ate one to test it out let me try to focus on the camera so you know allergy information contains letch let's hit thin fin let's see if I can see this Fanny like heat or Danica's oh great so this contains the same things are found in nuclear waste hooray you know you got your QR code there just scan it I actually scanned it one time and it was like some crazy video if some dude came up I don't know if they changed it cuz I did this like such a long time ago the skating thing so there is crap it doesn't say how much there is

free gum so if you're trying to lose weight or something get this one because it's sugar-free gum not that there's anything wrong with you I'm pretty sure you're all pretty and you know I love everyone so it's all fine you know you got your bar code there I actually think this bar code was from China but I don't know we'll see and see it's got five calories and you guys that's it so Oh thataway okay so let's bring out the actual piece of gum to do sort of kind of like a review process so this so I chewed it after I opened it and that really cool way with my trusty knife and flavor lasted for 36 minutes you guys that deserves a round of applause 36 minutes this gum lasted I think that's the longest it's lasted for any gum I've actually reviewed so what else do I have to say about it is just that it's a classic actually think this is one of the first five gums or one of the main ones that five actually has it is worth a little couple cents more but I highly recommend it it's really good and the flavor it lasts a long time so you guys I I may just upload a video every Saturday and it might just be on my own because honestly I think I have to just on my own I don't think anyone will help me out so you guys um that's pretty much it so oh wait I do need a rate this gum out of five stars I give it I give it a four and a half out of five because the flavor is it's um it's pretty normal like it's not like the sour patch you know it's not completely different this is just a regular flavor but it's still good and lasts a long time so I give it a four and a half out of five stars whatever thing you guys I'm getting started I'm started or starting to UM actually do a tech channel and you know I actually made it last night and I want some subscribers so the

are we headed to next so we're on our way over to prestige smoke shop it sounds horns and hopefully they let me record inside they have some cool stuff in there so I'd love to bring you guys in with me I just want to say you guys don't try this don't you try a thousand milligrams there's more than enough to just have probably like 100 or something like that damn you guys still fading right now I keep forgetting to talk to the camera [Music] [ __ ] is this guy do we try to kill fated Martin bro I just started my career oh [ __ ] bro we're about to die in the car right now [ __ ] that [ __ ] woke me up oh my god nothing John oh my god you idiot open up his door we almost [ __ ] died he broke you you almost IVA I feel like I almost psycho so [ __ ] high oh the adrenaline rush just kick-started me up again it's crazy alright you guys you guys are gonna hate me but I accidentally stopped the stopcock though I have no idea how long you were stopped work we went to the park and I would say it was probably around 22 minutes when we left are gay so I'm lost with my time right now I just wanna say it's probably at around 25 to 30 minutes to this time because it feels like I've easily it's easily almost been an hour since I've taken the drink right alright you guys so we went to prestige and they ended up being shut down so we're gonna go some but somewhere else maybe another smoke shop and maybe go home because I'm feeling [ __ ] - hi I don't like being out of my house when I'm this I I don't know about you guys but that's just me I'm probably at the our point right now you guys I'm just not feeling good I'm almost really kind of nauseous right now I shouldn't drink that much it was better when I just sipped on it throughout my day definitely do not take all that at one time I would say like what I'm feeling right now you guys is more of a body high more than anything you guys love the most intense crazy body high right now feels like when you're coming up on psychedelics it's just intense I don't know if you guys ever feel like thought on edibles but with me you guys it always hits me in my body super heavy cool wish me luck go happen bro you parked like [ __ ] damn bro how you feeling that for your boba cuz I think I'm good right now on the shopping you ready to go let's go let's go bro I was cold as [ __ ] out there alright let's roll alright job let's do a little drink check got your water I got my water I'll know you guys about this one I'm already kind of over after drinking that full bottle to be honest and I already drank half of the other bottle so I'm ready like 1500 milligrams in this guy right here took you to the real smallest part that's why I spoke with Daniel part it means small part about whatever yeah I'm gonna show you guys I'll take you guys with me all right ciao we are here at the Kenya city of torez park you know we've got getting the whole in town I'm honestly never been to this part though well [ __ ] look look you guys real smallest part I don't know the last time I sat at our Park bench like this I don't get outside too often but I just wanted to update you guys a little bit on like how I'm feeling right now I'm feeling cold I'm feeling tired I wanted to knock out soon that's kind of what edibles do to me I have a hard time staying up on them I'm probably fifteen sixteen hundred milligrams deep first time in my life so forgive me if I don't finish it I might try my best to I just feel like if I finish you right now I'm gonna be knocking out way too early you guys I'm gonna be out out like 3:00 p.m. today but wish me the best almost done with this you ready to leave bro let's get out all right you guys stop watches at 53 minutes and remember how I told you guys that turned off so I said add around 30 minutes so around like an hour and 23 minutes right now and I'm really dreading this challenge I think 1500 1600 milligrams is already way too much you guys I don't know if I should personally take this 400 milligrams I'm way too high I don't remember the last time I've ever felt like this it it feels like drugs I know it's still kind of early I don't know what I'm doing I feel like I just want to go home right now but um yeah I'm tapping with you guys soon I feel like I'm flying right now you guys I'm only going 40 I'm so high so that felt so [ __ ] crazy I feel like I'm gonna die with this guy's driving right now it's not gonna drink the rest of this I hate the surfing bottom as a [ __ ] worst just trying to race right now damn I don't know about you guys the edibles to me feels like absolute [ __ ] tap I don't know why anybody takes them definitely not for fun I mean if I was feeling sick and I couldn't smoke or if I was an edible type of person I probably was just do it in moderation I would never do anything to it what I took today was 44 doses so pretty much one bottle is 22 servings when I ended up taking less 44 servings today you guys and I'm just feeling the effects of the first bottle right now so I feel like the second ball is still gonna hit me and I'm just gonna be floored we're on our way right now back to my pad we're about to run some 2k you know we've gotta go to Chipotle guys I'm hungry as [ __ ] right now when I get high as [ __ ] I need something to bring me back before this like super smacks me down and I knocked the

this one that don't have it so they do use sugar I guess so this is the size of it it's I guess about inch okay so it's just starting to lose its flavor now this taste is very simple actually it's like very simple sugar taste sometimes you get a very strong taste like very light sugar syrup it's nice though so after chewing it a bit the bubbles to become easier to make so I guess you get through it but I do like this better for sure", "o1kNnEe5X6Y": "[Music] number ten one of my favorites the lemon min you're gonna love this super smooth it's got that tart citrusy lemon and that - it man put it in a mix and it just brightens everything what number nine strawberry and I like a strawberry lollipop this is an amazing strawberry very smooth mix this with coconut we call it stroke a nut number eight and with the too far we've got watermelon and watermelon mint watermelons have sweet candied watermelon flavor just like your favorite hard candy I had some mint to this extra smooth and mint eNOS for gonna love it amazing watermelons neither number seven grape meant a lot of the old-school smokers really enjoy this one this is a classic fantastic very traditional flavor got those tart white hanging great I like it to it I'm not even though number six gum with mint it's fantastic it adds that spearmint a little different kick very minty very fresh make sure you smoke this don't chew it number five grapefruit mint they also have regular grapefruit but grapefruit mint made it into the top ten this is the best grapefruit on the market incredible very zesty great citrusy notes got that slight Hardy almost a bitter feeling but really just citrus power that you're gonna love number or each natural taste to it is an authentic piece like you picked it straight off the tree makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside ain't that a peach number three we got our other twofer here blueberry and blueberry with mint you guessed it a very sweet dark blueberry flavor extra two pumps of blue in the snow cone machine these sell just about hand in hand at the same speed you got to have them both in your retail store and your lounge so nice you had them on twice number two double apple need i say more this is the most traditional flavor worldwide but al Fakher on the map you get notes of apple but it's really mix or that a nice licorice flavor it's very traditional very very beautiful just order it the standard classic number one if you haven't seen the trend so far number one overall needs this was the first flavor I ever smoked it got me hooked on who good so great on its own so smooth just a nice cool man not in your face cold mint there is a little cooling to it more of a great soft mint flavor mixes great with everything in your store always have men on hand in

the words of Stuart look what I just thought of that when I said look what I have I do believe in every look what I could that's not gonna make for a good video for me because I'm gonna start laughing anyways and I've come I do believe this they're really not I really thought they were the original but I can tell they're not the recipe has changed the size of the bubble gum has changed in your mouth coffee no I'm drinking coffee with this really puts me back in grammar school we didn't know it at the time back in the 60s in grammar school I had a DD not the hyper it was just a DD and like dyslexia but it wasn't a thing back then I had the hardest time with school when things got really like too hard for me I was such a daydreamer like I had all the ideas about stuff if we'd read a book we're doing a geography or something and I'd see like these different countries or animals my own would just take up off on such a day dream I was really I think the only way I could handle school because it was really difficult daydreaming was fun so it's gonna go I saw have a tendency to do that I've got a handle on my a DD I have all my brain supplements my omega-3 vitamin D honestly I think I could do it now my own wouldn't be to youtube obviously it would be through bio thing but that's not that's hard the problem is what would it be notice my coffee cup my knees it's bringing mom I was couple weeks my niece hasn't I've been playing with my sister's vintage Barbie oh my goodness I wonder if I should do a video with me in my if you're not into bubblegum coffee helps in makeup helps better I'm still not sure I'm happy anyways I love pink pink stuff I totally forgot about the pink and a few weeks back my sister took out all her vintage Barbie she has it all the Barbie my accessories all this stuff and then she has like a Barbie camper a Barbie case she gave it to my niece and of course she gave it to my other sister and she has careful watch over these vintage items but I remember she's telling I was just drooling thinking like what a cool toy a vintage toy now I'm thinking it a step further perhaps she's supposed to be coming over today and that's I got the cups I've got to hide this my pink she won't love that too she sees that oh good one stick on your face that's another place for you bubble on the blower and doozy of steps another plus I analyzed that because when you see me very rarely do I have like makeup on very rarely do I call my hair but perhaps it's the natural skin oil it doesn't let the bubble gum stick but that's it another huge hindrance we're doing a bubble gum video are you kidding me I was good got my pink cups I didn't put my nice and I realized how perfect I can be for my channel can be my signature coffee cup because if you know you follow my channel through a while like my coffee cups would break it was a real Maj for me because remember I had like a huge huge coffee mug it was like white with like a light pink heart it's just something about that cup was cozy and I loved that that broke and it seemed I went I had I had that was my favorite I broke I had a bluish coffee cup I do have one that I love but I just use it for my stupid sandwich videos now is that See's candy mug and so when my last cut broke and was just disappointing I really enjoyed it just cozy and so I said heck with it I whatever coffee cup I'm just gonna use it because if I get too attached it's a loss when it breaks I just have a bad habit breaking I wouldn't you know it I grabbed this ugly red it never breaks I had a black one I loved all that work that one broke there's not a red one that I really don't care for do you think I'm on a break I'm excited now with vintage Barbie in fact we talked about on the phone but she had sent a video of the day my other sister had given it to her as a gift I'll never forget watching the video and realizing I could even tell by looking at the Barbie pieces over the video it was a vintage totally put me back in grammar school when her and I played Barbies I did not know she saved all this I'm looking at it and I'm marching my little niece like tear into everything I'm thinking be careful sister bless your heart she's ticket oh she's a little bit anxious and she said okay one moment you know just like hmm it doesn't stick on anything I'm excited John really appreciate it perhaps", "5i5nJc69sP4": "experience new tic tac gum great taste very refreshing long-lasting flavor it's crunchy and chewy how many you chew is up to you the fresh new gum tic tac gum [Music] new

before on one thing a black background like before so I'm back I know some of you once it gets the stress glands and if you were stressing before when you were younger and you party extracts from the stress glands it will be even more stressed [Applause] this is not disease but yeah just came problems experienced trainers and everything just becomes a bad cycle like if you had eczema before that means you up you're naturally dry and when you are stressed you get my eczema because your body is not outside later that's before Exmouth becomes boys and like everything lots of stress like small things things that didn't bother here so I'm not making your anxiety not important guys but I'm tell you if you're a woman just be happy he appeared with yes if you belong to 40% 40% of us yeah you want you won't recognize myself it's like being another person and I'm usually very positive in everything I know about how to avoid a boy metaphor but laughs and your anxiety with the little boys I will tell you eat lots of fruits veggies lots of fiber drink is the exercise walk out the nature connect with God everyone knows that would help not just me but also longevity that you have a connection spirit that still white string perimenopause it's just that you it's much brighter you know your mind is like you're not down boy down boy when you have perimenopause you know everything why are you shouldn't stress you shouldn't give anxiety but now suddenly it does or that you think you are acting more than usual I'm not saying yippee you should just be happy you know you have your mother Alice lady here in her monstrous I'm just saying never perspective and they don't think of your anxiety as a single thing you know you have to even though it's hard to feel or it's impossible or it's more if to understand how others are going through if you are a woman tried to think how poised it can get so I guess I I'm saying count your blessings it's not medicine it's just hard for me sometimes like yesterday and I will get this migraines guys and it just feels like my head is exploding like I can't thank you I want I'm I'm myself but still not because of the pain tiredness and I'm just wondering because I am something check with your doctor first if it's if you can take it I know I can take it the pain is quite overwhelming I've given birth day so I know what pain is I didn't take a shower I've never had kidney stones i father it it was like giving birth I can - I can take a job that won't give me insurance you know I can't take a job is to be a job so I would get benefits otherwise it's just it's just moving I'm not moving but it's making it harder for me to concentrate everything is I think going slow like I want to walk like three hours but I can only do one or before I will be able to offer seminars or if it after what you would be able to up now like well if I did two worries then that's like an accomplishment that sometimes just one hard because I'm already stressed I don't feel useful next I'm taking I'm just studying for working I'm still have used to being in between and it stresses me and I know it sounds like I am a broth or something I'm not just being like I guess being away from the Philippines it's making it harder to because in the Philippines people oil take things for granted and not think that I will never change of course as you get older your body will change your psyche or change but there's still the same you have you still every soul yes they love your family your friends you know I should like if somebody sing oh I'm sorry I'm sick I would always say yes but Jesus you should still try your best if exercise to do the things your stress sometimes it's just like Charlie always like when I give us driving even though I just become so afraid I push myself too much not expect too much and just you know just it's just some women could have 40% many of them experience the bad symptoms they're all lies I'm very fortunate I have a family who can support me like you know I mean it would be so much more difficult if I had the white because that's what I was doing in dr. zeno I was working for six months in the pavement impalas oh my god I could hardly survive it was six months it was better when I was in the laundering physically because it wasn't so hard compared to the housekeeping but my life miserable housekeeping was good but the perimenopause just made me so slow and tired and also sensitive I had a perimenopause maybe because it just felt like a bad environment for me like I thought about what you live in a while but what a baby but yeah it's so I'm sorry I didn't make a video yesterday guys I don't think I would force myself right to make videos every day I think I just I will just easy

something that I you know I like the white ship curium [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "ItEPM18TO2o": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying to a new seasonal Edition extra gums this is the strawberry swirl and then I also have confetti cake pop and I bought both of these at the Dollar Tree they were a dollar each I think yeah they weren't they were a dollar each you get 15 sticks in each package and I've already I took the cellophane wrapping off because it was it's hard to do in the car and you might wonder how do i review gum I would and the world would you review gun well I don't know how other people do it because I've never seen anyone review go but the way I do it is Kevin and I'm I like to do it when we're going to get out because that way I can put a piece in my mouth and then I go about my day and I can see how good the flavor is how long it lasts and is it worth getting again and I have found some of these seasonal flavors are really good I think I had some pumpkin spice the extra that I liked medical love so much that I would get again the only the only seasonal gum that I've had so far that I would get over and over it's actually Trident lighters that it was the candy cane and Ashley and I get it every year and it's just a good strong candy cane flavor and it lasts a while it's well worth the money so I think first we will try the confetti cake pop and I'm gonna get some peace out and we'll tell you I'll show you how it looks and please together it looks like a piece of birthday cake AHA Mona for you it's kind of hard to open it in the car but this is just how I choose to do it and it's probably hard to see it looks like like it reminds me of the Ben and Jerry's ice cream the birthday cake ice cream we think about the place okay it's kind of hard when you first put in yeah it's hard give it a soft a good fight very vanilla cake yes I'll tell you what though almost like a white chocolate it's not XEL the teeth when you virtually know something it does I agree then this have a good vanilla cake flavor almost the most I'm putting so it's 11:30 now and we're just been in our mouth so we'll let you know how long it was okay so it's been 15 minutes and this gum is pretty much running its course it's still come on still has a little flavor on it but it's certain to get harder to wear it's not enjoyable to chew it anymore so yeah it does hurt you jaws so I'm gonna spit it out that was good I don't know that I would buy another pack of metallic you wouldn't I think I would get very very very tired of that flavor all the time because when I buy a pack of gum I go through the whole pot before I switch to a new pack I don't keep several in my purse so I do think I would get tired of that one so next we're gonna try in the strawberry swirl so let us spit these out and then we'll put the them little openings okay now we are going to try the strawberry swirl and I took pictures there be pictures at the end we gave our mouth a little rest after the cupcake so that flavor spoke German so these are five colors I did not there are five calories each usually there's a less than that one the exercise 5 it smells strong put this paper in my pocket 12:45 it's 12:45 he's in case you couldn't under like the fire that it has a very very strong strawberry smell there's something else though but it's an artificial yeah it's an artificial strawberry I'll keep it on out don't like Kevin I'll keep isn't in his mouth okay so it's 12:45 we'll see how long it lasts okay it is 107 and I'm getting ready to take this gum out Kevin took his out about six seven minutes ago he did not like it from the get-go though you didn't like the flavor at all I'm out of the two they see we're different because out of the - I like the strawberry better because the flavor was so so so strong and when I have gum yeah you admit it we're strong so when I have gum I like something that's gonna be strong you know that usually I'm using it to wet my mouth but also to help with get my breath fresher you know so that strawberry Kevin oh god sorry we're driving okay my hardest ketchup so I like the strawberry better I would not get either one again though because they do this bring and extra and I know I said this on my last review this brand is harder than the Trident layers I don't know what it is but it's just a harder friggin jaws hurt yes it does it makes your jaw hurt to it where the Trident layers you have to chew that for hours before that so they're good Kevin like the cake I like the strawberry but we won't get them again so I hope you enjoyed this on the go gum review so thanks for watching"}
