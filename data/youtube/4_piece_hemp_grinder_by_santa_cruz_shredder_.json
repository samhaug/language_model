{"9GF2fxp355g": "this is episode one of our grinder review series featuring the santa cruz shredder today i'm gonna be talking about this grinder in detail i've actually got two versions in my hand one of them made from aluminium and the other one made from hemp plastic thanks to our sponsor today other side london cannabinoid dispensary based on portobello roads i've got some of their awesome cbd oil here this is their turmeric and cinnamon and they are in the lab working on a brand new flavor now you can use the discount code i smoked for 10 off in store and a special thanks for my santa cruz shredder which i purchased in store a few weeks ago on with a video santa cruz manufactures this in california at two locations and they are the only u.s grinder manufacturer that goes through medical grade cleaning procedures with the end products the santa cruz shredder is by no means the cheapest grinder on the market with the plastic version coming in at between 12 and 25 pounds and the metal version coming in at between 30 and 90 pounds depending on the size shape and number of pieces there are a number of color options available so i opted for the matte raster colored santa cruz shredder medium size which is about 52 millimeters in diameter the small version comes in at 40 millimeters and they've got a large version coming in at 70 millimeters as well this also comes in a whole range of other colors in shiny or in matte they've even got collaborations on the hemp plastic side with cookies so you can get a two piece cookies santa cruz shredder as well a real diverse offering of grinders in the santa cruz range meaning there is something to suit you whatever you're grinding style personally i like a keith catcher so i usually opt for a four piece grinder and i went for the medium four piece santa cruz as you can see here there's a slightly different teeth pattern in the aluminium version versus the hemp plastic version with what looks like a few less teeth in the hemp plastic version but still roughly the same design and talking about the teeth the santa cruz website says that the teeth are radius at the base for strength and able to take extreme use they are twice as strong as the teeth on other grinders and won't dull or release burs or flakes of aluminium the teeth cut multiple ways which helps fluff up the buds i can certainly see this when using the santa cruz shredder the resulting bud is definitely what i'd call fluffy or fluffed up so the next question i want to ask is does the santa cruz shredder mimic anything else on the market now i would say that this is a trend setter rather than a follower and the fact that it has been out since 2011 means that it has some longevity behind the product however the design itself is relatively straightforward we have the four piece grinder design with a magnet you know where they have been innovative is using cad software to design the teeth to ensure the best grind that they can deliver so really not copying other grinders on the market in terms of the teeth style but they haven't moved away from the traditional grinder shape so it does look like a regular grinder but when you hold it in your hand it does have more of a premium feel due to the sort of weights the magnets uh the mat i really like the feel of as well because they are so confident with the teeth in the santa cruz shredder santa cruz shredders offers a lifetime warranty on teeth damage the warranty does not cover scratches or dents or general wear and tear that you could do putting the grinder through its paces over years of use it also features anodized threads to prevent gowling which is where the metal rubs together they even use neodymium diametrically magnetized cylindrical rare earth magnets in the santa cruz shredder that's a pretty cool feature the screen inside that is the keith catching screen is a t304 my chronic precision woven non-fraying stainless steel with a drum skin tight screen capturing technology that means that it is not going to buckle or get loose in the middle of the grinder so that is it for the features of the santa cruz shredder now let's talk about my experience using this device so i really feel like this has been a breath of fresh air it adds pleasure to the joint rolling process to the bone packing process to actually use something so premium feeling and that grinds the bud up so well i'm obviously very familiar with the size and shape of the santa cruz shredder because it's similar to loads of the metal grinders out there that you can get from companies i've had loads of them sent to me in the past but this is just fitting together in a whole different way it's just tight you know it just works it's just it's just snug as a bug in a rug you can pull the magnet off or you can hold it up by the magnet or you can use the sort of looser feeling hemp plastic but even at the plastic level this is a seriously high quality product and you can tell by how well it sort of screws together the threads catch really well there's no messing about with it and that just makes the santa cruz shredder one of my favorite grinders in my collection if you buy the aluminium santa cruz shredder it comes in a box looking like this nice basic packaging but a nice quality and i like the design of the box as well rather than separate flaps they've got a joined flat there which kind of gives it a cool looking design so i've talked about the fluffing up of the bud i'm now going to show you it in action by grinding some marmalade in the santa cruz shredder to show you how it delivers and then i'm going to try out smoking and vaping to see how it delivers for both of those consumption methods because different grinders work differently different consistencies of your herb will suit smoking or vaping better or maybe it will suit both we are about to find out how the santa cruz delivers in this area now it still features the regular threaded design which does mean that it can pick up bits of weed sort of during the grinding process and i would advise you to keep it clean by scratching those little bits off where you can but it doesn't seem to to be jamming up like cheaper grinders even with that being the case i've been using it for quite a while and despite the threads not being completely clean at the moment they're in need of a clean it still has a really smooth open and closed mechanism the grinding of the aluminium one as you can see lovely fluffy weed there it really fluffs it up it fluffs it up and it gives it an epic consistency using the hemp plastic one obviously this is the more budget option so do bear that in mind but it will still deliver a lovely grind as you can see so i would say comparing the two the bud looks relatively fluffed up the same i wouldn't say that the metal grinder has done a better job in grinding up than the hemp plastic santa cruz i think that they've done a very similar job indeed in fact some some ways the hemp plastic one looks even more fluffy uh but really it's we're pulling hairs here because it is very similar in appearance so shreddability rating top marks for both the aluminium and the plastic version of the santa cruz shredder shredding up that butter perfection and making it ready for your favorite smoking equipment speaking of here we go we've got the chong's bung here which of course we're gonna smoke with the santa cruz ground weed let's see how that translates into the smoke join me for this one yeah i've got water in there and i'll see you all on the other side cheers folks [Music] the smooth consistency of the ground up flower delivers a superb bong smoking experience a wowzer core blimey here's an interesting comparison if i just pick it apart with my hands the flower looks like this whereas the santa cruz shredder gives it a much more evenly shredded distribution which makes it more preferable in my opinion than a hand grind i could probably achieve a more uniform grind with a pair of scissors but it would be nowhere near as quickly as just putting it into the santa cruz shredder so again it is better than a scissor grind or a hand grind cheers [Music] so the santa cruz shredder has ground the weed up really nicely for the mighty vaporizer it is giving me a lovely flavor delivery so there's a lot of surface area area there lots of trichomes to vaporize and to melt down into the delicious flavor [Music] so due to the plate size and the size of the holes with which the flower can go through i would say that this is better suited for grinding up herb to smoke with but it still works really well for vaporized herb the santa cruz isn't specializing in that area but the ground up weed is delivering in a vaporizer nicely so let's sum things up appearance top marks i love the look of the santa cruz so we're going to give it a 10 out of 10 in the appearance use and functionality top marks again it is delivering and it is not falling short in any areas 10 out of 10. price point this grinder is more expensive than others on the market and it is probably one of the most expensive ones out there but it is using higher quality materials than other grinders and is medical grade which does give it a nice feature eight out of ten it is still worth it despite the higher price and there are lower price points available if you go for the hemp version shreddability it is a fantastic grinder and it delivers a really nice consistency for the bud when you are smoking it or vaping it the plates are a little bit bigger than some of the other plates out there but the teeth are fantastically designed they don't ever put bits of aluminium into your weed which is a really good thing nine out of ten in terms of the shred ability it doesn't have the vape focused plate as well so overall this this grinder is getting top marks we're talking eight and a half out of ten for the santa cruz shredder i really like this grinder it's getting daily use here in the i smoke hq and it is just an all-round great product it is a little bit more expensive but in my view the amount of times i'm using it makes that price all the more worth it because i really am getting the most out of it that i can so that is my review on the santa cruz shredder what did you think do leave your comments below add any points of your own about this grinder how does it compare to what you're using at the moment i want to know and i'll be back with episode 2 very soon if you enjoy this content hit that thumbs up and

here for this but also this so what are we gonna do today so we're gonna give you a quick rundown of just basic uh the the basics of the santa cruz shredder and then we are going to run it head to head with the raw and some very unscientific tests that are prone to human error i will get out with that in the first place but should give you a better idea of what you're looking at if you are interested in purchasing one of these fine grinders because believe me both of these are just fantastic it's really going to come down to personal preference so what we're looking at first with the santa cruz shredder so obviously legendary the machining on this is just top notch everything is everything is smooth all the edges are chamfered nicely the threads are are great they're not they're not too coarse but they're also not too fine to the problem where you know you'll you'll be misaligning this just by a fraction of an inch that's a big complaint of mine is people just kind of pay lip service to threads i think that they probably put some thought into this to make it as simple as possible there's your basics now we're going to get into more in-depth review of both of these together so the first thing we're going to look at is tooth design so obviously the santa cruz shredder has the the proprietary kind of square tooth design that's supposed to be an air quote and as you can see there's not it's not just the top profile of the teeth it is also further down on the post sorry i've been using this so it's kind of harder to see but you can see where this little uh i'm losing my words again but the the extra machining done on here to create extra surface area more cutting basically so you can jam this thing with bud and just stick it on here give it a couple twists back and forth and it's it's done for the most part i was expecting a whole lot of jamming right here um on the mouth of these teeth but they did a very good job of making these things self-clean you guys know my opinion on the raw life grinder i love this thing i love how it's completely modular couple complaints that i have these fall through holes they're not bad they're a good size and like i said my other video they do pretty good job of you know you don't you can just shake it back and forth and most of your stuff's going to fall through my major complaint about this is that i don't know if you guys can see that very well but this very edge of this hole here um there's not really a whole lot going on to push stuff back into these holes and so you wind up with a lot i guess a lot relatively you wind up with stuff stuck down in this corner here and don't get me wrong you're gonna get that too because of the way that the lid is designed but i feel like there was a little bit more thought put into the lid on the santa cruz because they have this nice bevel right here and i never get i don't say never but very rarely do i get anything jammed into this corner right here that i can't get out with just you know a wood poker whereas this guy likes to trap stuff in the corner here and you've gotta you know drop the bottom out to clean it again both great grinders both great at what they do but i think as far as the actual fall through for your flower after you grind it uh i'm gonna give the win to the santa cruz and the tooth design is all said to the santa cruz sorry um these teeth are you know they're good they're decent but they just don't have the same cutting capability as these square teeth on the santa cruz and all i will show you that in a minute here you can see lots of holes but where the santa cruz really shines is that it's got holes further out towards its edge relative to its size so basically what that's doing for you is there's more to push flower from this edge into this hole or get basically this holes close enough to the edge where most of your stuff's gonna go into this hole before it finds its way into this corner and gets trapped the life grinder is again great but it does get more flowers stuck in here than i would like down in the corner here so the next thing we have is we are going to be looking at basin in the bottom now i actually hand roll my joints and i am a big fan of this nice deep basin you can reach in here grab a good little bit spread it on your paper that and if i am outside i never really worry about this having the wind knock my flower out of it that is a concern with this one people who own this grinder are gonna say oh you could just take the screen part take that out and make a bigger basin the only problem with that is when you screw the top onto here or this other the other section to make a larger and you would then have exposed threads where trichomes and flower itself can get stuck so again getting getting nitpicky here but that's kind of what we do here if you haven't figured it out yet next we are going to compare our diameters which there's an obvious difference i thought when reading the the measurements i guess i made a mistake i thought this was going to be a lot closer in size to life grinder than it is but i will tell you that the size of this thing does not slow it down i am shocked by how much this thing can process all right super scientific forgive my my dirty tools this is a garage it's advertises two and an eighth and it is two in three thirty seconds point of this caliper again not the most scientific thing on the planet it's been beat up but should give you an approximation sorry guys i am not a ve all right and the raw is 2 and 17 30 seconds so obviously a little bit bigger on this end um when you take the screen out the raw life grinder is actually shorter than the santa cruz and again keep in mind this is just the medium they have a large one they believe dwarfs even this and even though i have you know big old monster paws i i thought i'd be more annoyed trying to manipulate this thing i like i like large grinders because i got big old mitts the grip on everything how everything is designed it's it's just so ergonomic and i hate to use that word for some reason but it just really is the moment you've all been waiting for today we have some purple punch and we are going to be grinding equal weights of these now this is half a gram each as measured by my scale which you guys can't read so you're gonna have to take my word for it and so what we're gonna do is we're just going to come over here and we are going to stick some bud in both of these and show you how they work and i just want to show you i am cramming this stuff into the santa cruz and hopefully it doesn't make an idiot out of me uh but i have been amazed at how well this thing can resist uh jamming and gumming up so hopefully i get to show that to you guys and same thing would just mash these guys in here and again both of these very easy to get your flower into lots of space surprising amount of space in between the teeth on the santa cruz for its size it's actually very similar to the life grinder and it works fantastic we have half a gram in each of these lids as you can tell it's a lot different relative to the size of the grinder so first we're going to do the life grinders come up here and so as you can see most of the flowers gone through we still have a little bit that's hanging out up top that should be no nope we're still here okay yeah all right a couple more twists and everything's pretty much falling through then we're gonna move over to the santa cruz here and the santa cruz is like i'm two twists in and look i mean just look at it would you just look at it it just it grinds so smoothly and i was expecting more resistance because it doesn't have you effectively have less of a lever here than you do here so i was expecting more jamming more more jerky operation all that fun stuff but i didn't get it luckily and so as you can see there's there's a little bit of trichomes and some flower in the corner there let's see and as you can see there's so there's a little tiny bit sorry see if we can get that to focus there's a little dusting along the edge and then there's some flowers stuck right here and some trichomes but see what i was talking about with the life grinders see just how much of the trichomes are are stuck in here and again nitpicking but when you get to this level i feel you kind of have to nitpick to really find the differences because both of these are well thought out well manufactured they're just pretty great it's the only way i can describe it so now we have these both ground down here's another big thing i want to show you guys so if you like bigger coarser grinds raw life grinder is going to be for you if you're like me and i'm i'm sorry raw but i i own everything else from you guys i mean how i got a freaking glass rolling trick i don't even know why i really like the consistency it's it's nice for picking up you can grab a good little pinch of it and then just spread it out nice and evenly across your papers before you roll up but some people are into the coarser grind and some folks like the coarser grind this is still very nice and fluffy there's nothing wrong with either one of these so what we are going to do we are going to weigh these again all right so now we are going to weigh the santa cruz we have .3 grams made it through uh from point five being ground initially and some of this is going to be you know trichome sticking to the walls flour sticking inside of here or stuff sticking to the teeth but again for the most part looks pretty damn good and i was expecting a lot more jams with these teeth when i started using them as you can see neither of these grinders are brand new clean because i want to give you guys the real world breakdown of how they work when they're dirty not when they're perfectly out of the box and then we're gonna weigh raw all right and point four made it through on the raw life grinder so again you're not going to notice this completely negligible difference final thoughts on this again both of these fantastic pieces of equipment well thought out well made continue to have iterations going to refine them and another thing that's exciting news for at least me and hopefully they'll just sell the grinder plates but i did see josh castleman the founder of raw making a video where he was talking about they're doing some prototyping with a new tooth design i believe he said something about a square tooth design so i'm going to keep my eyes peeled for that one and i'll let you guys know if i hear anything about it because if there's a square tooth that they're coming up with with maybe maybe a little bit better drop through a little bit at better edge cleaning very excited to see that and i will absolutely be reviewing it for you so that is basically it folks bra in santa cruz prefer for myself i prefer the santa cruz now again sorry bro i'm not getting rid of this this is still a great grinder i still use it every now and then but for for the most part i roll pinners you know one and a quarter pinners and the smaller grind works for me if you are rolling blunts or you you know you got a little bit more space to mess with the raw might be for you and again totally down to personal preference if you guys have any questions please let me know in the comments i got this video idea from somebody who viewed one of my videos and i cannot remember their name right now i'm sorry if you guys have ideas let me know i uh well i was for a load but i'm looking for a job so i got nothing but time and if i can get you guys some info then my day's not totally wasted so all right well thank you for joining me again any questions please drop them down the comments otherwise thanks for stopping by and have a good", "JRZLsMMu80M": "all right guys so i got another review of a grinder the other one i ended up returning because i was not fond of it so i went to a local shop and i held a couple smaller santa cruz ones and i actually like how they felt i went ahead and ordered directly from the website which i'm going to recommend from now on when you order a product directly from the manufacturer the reason being purchases full price just a large grinder and they sent a nice lanyard santa cruz shredder cookies emblem taylor gang emblem pretty cool as a freebie better than nothing i had got that canister grinder off of amazon so i'm not sure if they send anything extra they also sent me this little 3d printed kind of grinder may never used but i thought it was pretty cool no magnet or nothing falls right out false all right but get into the box is the box that came in you know open this guy boom so the packaging is less nice than the canister grinder but this grinder feels amazing it feels just like my older grinder look at those holes nice holes solid here we are the screen on this the mesh let's see see the holes are pretty big so you're gonna i would imagine i'll get some keef out of that and the little pick so i'll take this pick out for now and the main thing that really made me to return the other one one is it was this the magnet see this magnet and the other one i shake it lightly and it would just fall out this magnet is on there just like my other one i love it you can hear hear it that's the magnet pulling it look at that it's not going nowhere i shied away from the santa cruz because of all the branding they have but it's their right to be branded this way if the quality is this good so let's go ahead and just shred up some i like the fact that it's huge this is like two inches here so i can grind up should be able to grind up quite a bit of uh but this is my frosties but right now i don't think you're gonna get a good this is some platinum haze um and i chose this one because this one should definitely leave some uh i don't know should definitely leave some um what do you call it oh keefe all right close this up all right feels good and spin smooth feel smooth a few turns see how it looks still a lot in there still a lot in there that's something that all right taking quite a bit of spins but then again i put a lot in there so all right nice and clean pretty clean it means everything falls through these nice big holes here i'm digging that sunscreen yeah we got a nice amount in there that out all right close it back up it can hold some in there there's no glass you can't see it but [Music] um i can't turn the flash on now but i don't really see much keef in there more than i seen another one some sprinkles the main point though about this grinder i love they sent extras all right that's cool and this look at that i'm shaking this [ __ ] this magnet isn't going anywhere that's what you want you always want that out of a grinder i would i could drop this thing may open may not better chances though anyways there's the review the other one was good can a store is not bad or anything but for my preference this one gets it santa cruz shredder thank you for the extras highly recommend you guys", "hgO-I5lon_g": "all right so first thing we need to do was on my way home from the office you need to go pick up some alcohol so now that we have alcohol I've got two huge bottles for like six dollars and fifty cents super cheap and don't tell me that you guys can't afford to clean your Santa Cruz shredder because it's literally six bucks there are two big-ass bottles that's really the only thing that you need to clean your Santa Cruz shredder so I'm going to catch up with you guys back at the house we're gonna go through a full tutorial of how to clean your Santa Cruz redder so I just wanted to say hello my name is Luke I am one of the product specialists at Santa Cruz shredder I also do the Instagram Facebook I answer any of your guys's questions that you send to us through email so this is the person that's answering your his email you can put a face to the keyboard that's gonna be we're gonna be doing a video today explaining how to clean a Santa Cruz shredder as a proper way now we're gonna start first with the improper way of cleaning your Santa Cruz shredder so don't put it in your dishwasher don't use Windex don't use orange cronic don't use 4/20 solution do not use any of those solutions just because it will affect the finish of your Santa Cruz shredder so if you want to keep your Santa Cruz shredder looking shiny especially a lot of you have these teal ones that we don't produce anymore if people are more interested in the cookies so I have a cookies for peace this is our most popular size most popular style and I would definitely say the four-piece style so here's the four pieces we have a t30 dirty hold that for you guys and the center section which is these two pieces and so I actually have a little bit of pollen collected in there and then if you guys see this my screen is pretty dirty it's gonna look a lot better once we're done with it this first thing you want to do is of course make sure there's no product stuck in the teeth there's no product in your center chamber there's a little bit of mine and then especially you want to take this material out of there you've been working very hard collecting this material so you just don't want to throw it away and you don't want to dissolve it in the alcohol and then the first thing I'm gonna do I'm gonna do a dry scrape with the flat portion this portion of the pic basically what that's gonna be doing is it's gonna be getting all the pollen extra parliament's from my screen and it's gonna be collecting it into the corner here and then I'm just gonna and you want to minimize the tapping and the hitting that you do on your pieces anytime you use them anytime you grind so one benefit of having the bunker piece there's like products sometimes that get stuck and doesn't fall through the windows so you can have the shredder together and then when you hit the two pieces together you can actually see there's some product it actually came out the products gonna fall through and this rubber piece allows you to hit you know the metal on the rubber instead of metal on metal and this will also prolong the life of your shredder you pay good money for it so you gotta take care of it and this is the reason why we're doing a cleaning video to show you guys how to take care of your shredder all right so I went ahead and scraped it all to one side you guys can see that so first you need rag some q-tips and the last thing you need is alcohol some people use alcohol so if they don't have q-tips that you take a surface you can do that ninety one percent is a lot different than regular rubbing alcohol rubbing alcohol has more water content in it so it'll still do the job but it won't do it as fast if you want especially I'm looking for fast solutions fast results I'm going to be using 91% so you can't use rubbing alcohol but it's not what we're gonna be using today so it's gonna be really fast super simple so we have our pieces here so pollen chamber empty collection chamber kind of empty still has a lot of pollen on it that's okay I'm not really concerned and the t-section empty so one thing that a lot of people complain of is hey I don't want to do a full cleaning what can I do to make my grinder spin and start turning again that one thing that you will see is around the edge of this you'll see quite a bit of buildup if you don't want to do a full cleaning you can get yourself some shredder grease by the shredder grease to this edge right here and then you go ahead and start spinning again don't get locked up so mine even though it has some of that material in there it still spins pretty freely not too bad what you can do if you just want to do quick cleaning take a rag now you don't need a moonroof this Delrin ring that can stay in place that's the black ring you can email us if you need a new one we'll send one out to you free of charge but if you guys look at that simply there you know already it looks better just gonna basically reassemble our grinder I'm gonna take the alcohol put too much place my lid on top check it out - it looks like looks like and the teeth we're gonna use the q-tips [Music] and if you look at my q-tip see it's only like green material looking there's no purple itching from the surface all right it's pretty plain fuzz in that take care of that this is a screen that we'll be able to catch more pollen than a screen that is dirty alright so this is what our bottom looks like now inside looks completely brand-new so each piece looks new the only thing you need to do now is let it dry this is what a new one looks like same thing with the three-piece even easier as it is without a screen finish your lid same thing shake alright so update with the 3-piece it's still a little bit dirty we still need to hit the edges so what I'm doing is I'm getting a little bit alcohol q-tip so you ready there you go just let it dry I know so that concludes the video we have our four piece santa cruz shredder and our three piece santa cruz shredder completely clean now they're ready to rock they've been drying for about ten minutes now a few things that I want to leave you guys with to conclude one thing is making sure using the right solutions on your santa cruz shredder you do not want to harm in the finish on them so make sure that you're using alcohol you can also use hot water but those are the only two things don't use 420 solution don't use orange chronic and don't put it in your dishwasher those are all things that i've heard in the past that people have done and it ruins it so don't do it i'm warning you right now don't do it alcohol water alcohol and salt any of those combinations will work so please tell me in the comments below your favorite way to clean your grinder if you have any sort of special techniques any sports special tricks that you use to make sure that you're cleaning it properly please let me know and we'll talk to you guys later thank you so much for watching you", "v_kCvAemXyw": "as good to them in the Jeep in Santa Cruz collaboration grinder until you straight off the bat one of my

James and we're here standing in phoenicians manufacturing facility they're a grinder company located in the States of course right here in Mesa Arizona we've got drew he's the manufacturing manager and he's going to give us a walk-through and show us what it's like to make a phoenician grinder let's check it out hey guys it all starts right here this is all of our raw aluminum it's all 6061 so we process into our grinders from here we move it on to our tables for staging we got these three machines making all three different sized grinders right now from large small to medium each piece of aluminum is cut in a different size for the part that it's going to be completing we have test gauges here to make sure that we don't have any discrepant pieces and the best quality is going to be a pain so from here we load it into these machines and then that part becomes this which then later becomes that which is the finish grinder as far as the machining goes so it starts off as this piece or but starts as this then it gets transformed into this from there this would be the finished raw part so this this surface is underneath so this is the lid here which is part of the cutting mechanism which stacks on top of that and this is the bottom part or if this is the fall through so this is the top side of this say the flip them over to yeah like like those it's two operations okay so this part is half done this part is completed so once it's finished with this then you flip it over and you grind out some anymore yes and there's a called grinding or cutting or this is heading yeah grinding tends to be like on steel this is all aluminum so you run 20 to 26 different tools per grinder on these for the finish 26 different tools what's that mean yeah we can look up at the Carousel here I can show you a couple of different ones what each of those tools is necessary to complete the product that we create here Wow so the machine and this is a CNC machine it starts with one like drill bit and then just kind of rotates to whatever it needs for the next set yeah correct yeah so it's all automatic tool changing all numerically controlled so depending on what needs to be cut this specific part right here will be changed out automatically yes so that tool has a specific tool path in a specific order to create the finish and that this one being a tiny chamfer mill you can see at the end it's got a nice little point on it that's a ninety degree chamfer melt and that finishes out in some of the tighter areas of the grinder so it's pretty straightforward these machines do all of the work when you're making grinders how many grinders can you make in a day in a day it really just depends on the size because they all run different times so this one here runs for 20 minutes so you can do the math there on a eight-hour work shift because the large runs for more 40 minutes and with loading times it's close to 50 so a little bit less on the large a little bit more on the small but we do keep this thing running all day and we make plenty once it's out of that stage then what happens next once we unload that we'll have a finished product and then it comes over here to deburr and everything's hand inspected and handy bird which essentially means that there's not going to be any sharp edges or any the scrapping parts coming through later on in the assembly and processing so this is a part that's fresh out of the machine it's a complete grinder obviously less the screen that goes in there no magnets yet there's no anodization on there so this one hasn't been deep bird yet I can walk you through that real quick you have to do it it starts out on these buffers and then everything gets checked from there [Music] so basically just kind of cleaning them up and polishing them or yeah so you can see the difference here so this edge tends to be really sharp coming out of the machines so running over it with this disk eliminates some of that sharpness so no one's get in their hands cut up and you guys have to do this with every single grinder every single grinder we make goes through this process from there we bring it all up here get staged in these trays and this is their last step before they get anodized and so anodizing is something that you guys do out of house or out of shop yeah yeah we outsource that just due to a couple different reasons cost and the chemicals in the whole process of it it's a pretty big process to deal with but you're still outsourcing to phoenix um yeah it's a local company everything we do is gonna be locally sourced here so keeping the money within all US made all and on all quality controlled by us here out of this facility so why Phoenician grinders and how did they come about so Phoenicians started with the two founders here Colton and Dane and they just wanted a quality product and they had a background in manufacturing so they weren't finding a quality product that was up to their standards you could say and they decided to manufacture it on their own and then it evolved into what you see here today how long has Phoenicians been around Phoenicians been around for six years now how many grinders has Phoenician made now we can go over and look at some of the serial numbers yes you brat yeah so we saw the deeper process and once things come back from anodized they actually shoot over into this room here and this is our laser room so we do all the engraving in house here and we have this setup here this does the tops and bottoms for both the large the medium and the small and from there we kick it over to assembly this is where we'll press in all the magnets and we'll press on all the screens we do a quick cleanup once over of them here and each grinder also includes this Keith pick that we manufacture here in house from the machines yeah this is made on that laser that we just saw so we do the engraving and the outline of it guys cut it from the machines as well yeah it's all cut on that laser oh the laser cuts that yeah the laser cuts everything on here but once it comes back from the anodizing then it comes over to this table and yet and everything gets assembled yeah everything gets assembled into this complete grinder so this one here we're at thirty seven thousand two hundred and ninety and this is a medium four-piece grinder and that's actually only for the medium sizes each size has their own serial number correct yeah all the grinders are gonna have serial numbers on them how big is the staff here at the nation on a daily basis it's usually three or four of us so it's myself Dane Colton and the sales representatives that we have working outside the office so internally it's three of us so we have a large grinder medium grinder small grinder we also manufacture a few different things this is our aura this is a pipe with our X bowl incorporated in it the front carb manufactures all out of aluminum this is this smaller version for your last piece this is an 18 mill X bowl piece also offer that in 14 we have our ash tray deee bowler with removable nail that nail is coated in nickel just to ensure quality and longevity this is our concentrate tray we also have a flower option which will show you up in the office and there's all coating later so this is the gold stuff yeah and this stuff actually belongs to a colleague of ours and it does get used pretty heavy you can see here just how well this finish holds up so this is the same process that a lot of satellite parts go through they get launched up into space so it is designed what do you mean it's the same process so a lot of those satellite parts require a gold or silver coating on them okay just to keep from deterioration so we use that same process here for the gold coating and I know for a fact this grinder has been used heavily and you can see here just how well it maintains its super clean how much does this grinder eco-floor so this is the large four piece paper slot and usually retail on that for a standard and a diced one is 125 and for the gold one the gold one is 1,500 Wow alright guys that's gonna wrap it up today we did a cool walkthrough with drew the manufacturing manager up finishing grinders he's able to show us everything that it's all about and of course if you want one of their grinders you just got to go to Phoenician engineering comm or hit up one of your local smoke shop and if they don't have it you got to tell the owners to get those Phoenician grinders until next time guys give us a thumbs up and smash that like button see you guys later [Music]", "jtV19G_SDbI": "how's it going YouTube I'm always blazing here back with another video and today is gonna be a product review and the product we're gonna be reviewing is the Santa Cruz redder now just a little bit of background info on the Santa Cruz shredder this is a four piece grinder and I believe this is the medium the size medium which is two and one eighth of an inch this grinder comes from the u.s. specifically Santa Cruz that's where they're from Santa Cruz California and yeah so let's get into this review first off off the bat just looking at the grinder it looks very quality quality built just the materials used in the way it like it feels in your hand and it's it's pretty light for a grinder too which is also a plus but yeah so I'm just gonna take the pieces apart together and just tell you a bit about the grinders so this is the first lid that comes off now just to mention the teeth is specially designed they use a computer program I don't know exactly what it's called but the teeth are designed to perfectly grind your bud to a even consistency while also not allowing any chunks big chunks to fall through that's why they have the especially designed holes in the middle there and also they're magnets they're magnets are special earths magnet I believe it says on their website and it's a really good magnet you know it's not gonna I'm shaking this it's not falling off it's a very strong magnet it'll it'll keep your lid closed another thing I really like is this plastic ring I don't know if you could see that if it's gonna focus but there's a little plastic ring right there and it helps actually make your grinding experience very smooth which I really really like it keeps the grinder very nice and clean and makes its operate very smooth every time some people don't like plastic but in my opinion in my opinion sorry it doesn't come in contact with the butter or anything like that so I wouldn't worry about it another great feature about this grinder is it is made out of aluminum but another thing that santa cruz does that i don't know if a lot of other grinder companies do is they anodized their aluminum anodizing their aluminum basically means they they put it through a special process of shooting it with elect electrical waves or something like that which basically makes the surface scratch proof so yes if you scratch this or anything like that it's not gonna leave any fool any metal flakes or anything like that in your in your butter or whatever you're grinding but yeah so this is the chamber at the bottom after you've finished grinding the bud it is pretty big you could fit about I would say two grams to two and a half grams um yeah this is not a brand new grinder just a disclaimer I use this every single day so that's why it's a little dirty but yeah overall I'm not sponsored by Santa Cruz just uh just a little note there because a lot of people think I'm doing this review because maybe I'd be sponsor getting paid by Santa Cruz but I just really like their product and I wanted to show you guys how good it is so this is the kief catch as you could see I've been building up some Keef I don't know the exact micron that this screen is but it is a very heavy-duty screen like it doesn't bend or anything like that it's made out of a good metal and yeah so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna show you how it actually performs and how it actually grinds bud so for today we have some black water that's the strain it is a indica screen actually pretty good bud I'm gonna be doing a review on this sorry I'm just gonna try and get this to focus oh yeah this thing's out very annoying there we go I got it to focus so that is the black water this strain is very frosty it's a nice indica has a very cushy smell to it well yeah I'm gonna be doing a strain review on this later and this is what we're gonna be grinding up in the Santa Cruz so let's see how she does so yeah this grinder is really good because like I said it grinds a very even consistency of your bud it doesn't make it into like a powder but it also doesn't make it too clumpy and too big of pieces where you can't roll a nice joint without it canoeing and another feature which is my favorite is how quiet this grinder is and how smooth it is like I'm literally gonna use three fingers and you could spin it with three fingers only like once you get it started three fingers and you're good it doesn't take too long either you don't have to be here for like ten minutes there's just a little piece left in there just give it a little tap shake it a bit and it's pretty much done so there's the grind very even consistency no big big chunks everything's pretty even uniform very good for rolling joints and if you really want to make it finer you could literally just flip the grinder upside down here's a little tip for all you vapors out there who want your your cush powder II just flip your grinder upside down and keep grinding until you want til you get it to a powder but that's all we have for today this is official review from Omelas blazing for the Santa Cruz shredder and if you ever get a chance to pick this up it's roughly around seventy to a hundred dollars depending on what kind of head shop you buy it at or if you buy it online but this gives thumbs up five stars and if you liked it comment rate subscribe and I'll see you later peace", "AEvkL51vVsQ": "hey guys welcome back it's been a little while since I've done a video but haven't had too much new content to share so but I did pick up a new Santa Cruz shredder for specifically to use with my crafty dosing capsules I found that with my the free grinder that I had it was basically too fine of a grind and I had a lot of particles coming through the the dosing cap lid and onto the the crafty cooling unit here so I ended up looking for coarse grind grinders and I came across the Santa Cruz shredder I like the large size and so I picked one up I was pretty expensive but I think it's well worth the time here for what it's been doing for me as you can see the the holes are significantly larger nice part is this won't grind up actually I haven't found it grind up seeds I've seen a couple fall through and some of the buds I don't know why I'm getting seeds but regardless I'm ending up with a lot of a more coarse grind and with that it's not coming through my dosing capsule kept lids is easy so I've actually went through 8 8 of the caps when I first packed them with this and I had zero dust to use the brush with so I was pretty impressed other nice part was that with a little bit of a coarser grind I ended up with a little bit less bud per capsule so saved me a little bit of blood I didn't really notice any difference in terms of potency things like that I noticed some people did mention that with a coarse grind there they're crafty takes a little longer to heat up I don't have that problem I run mine at 400 with a boost to 410 so by the time it's at 400 I'm vaping pretty well so no problem there the grinder has a fairly coarse screen for pollen so a lot does get through there so maybe that's helping me you know not get some of that dust but still the chunks that I was seeing in the top of this cooling unit or then the screen itself the fine screen we're definitely larger than what comes through into the kief tray so with that being said this has definitely helped keep my cooling unit cleaner in terms of having to not having a brush it is often it may depend on the buds from time to time I suppose some if you have dryer but it'll grind up and you know a little dustier than most but the teeth on here are pretty slick let me see if I can zoom in there I had a little bit of use I've had it for about a week so it's not my first day review this is about a week's worth compared to you know I compared it to what I was using with my previous grinder so what I'll do is I like to just grind up a little bit it's empty right now so another nice part is I guess the threads aren't too long so if you're trying to take this thing apart and want to dump it I found that some grinders have way too much threading so you're sitting there spinning it forever to get it open just drop in a little here and you'll see what the end result is it's not nice open areas for you to put your product in there so you don't have to smash it it's nice and open Center you so you you don't really end up with the bud patty or whatever they call it in the center of the grinder and it's fairly smooth got a nice little gasket there between the third and fourth piece first and second however you count them and so there you have it it's fairly coarse ground I mean it still vapes very very well I don't see any difference between the vape quality or the vapor production or potency between this grinder and my previous grinder if I want to get in and get a you know top off a cap with with any of the pollen or keep putting it down there to do that way and yeah so this has been an awesome grinder so far like I said I've used it a week the paint or anodizing whatever they used is right on par there's no scratching no scuffs yet I'm not seeing any chunks of metal coming off of this thing when I'm grinding up my you know using it I've seen some some people post about some of the Phoenicians ending up with particles of aluminum inside of there they're ground-up buds none of that with this one here so far so one week review I'm very impressed I don't think I'll be picking up any of my old grinders ever again the crafty seems a lot happier in terms of the cleaning unit screen so yeah all-in-all expensive but I think it was worth it thanks guys", "tBOZO8UPEls": "alright guys and girls I just wanted to give a short review on the Santa Cruz grinder I bought this thing for about 60 bucks because it was supposed to be one of the intros to the higher-end grinder one of the big things that drew me to the product is they had a lifetime warranty on the teeth in the grinder a lot of cheaper grinders the sharp stones the $40 the $20 or even the $1 grinders they tend to have a lot of damage that happens to their teeth and being a medical marijuana user I didn't exactly want small shards of plastic in my joint or any anything else that I'm gonna be inhaling especially some of them still had that chemical BPA in it some of the plastic ones say bpa-free but I don't really want to be smoking plastic whether it has BPA or not and some of the cheaper steel ones they're not really gonna combust when you plate them on fire like 1,200 degrees or if you vaporize them at like 300 but it still is something that rather not have in my bud so I was really impressed with this product at the start the grind that was coming out of it was amazing quality but then started to have a few issues with it the more you use it the more bud gets stuck in the teeth of it it's just kind of an inevitable you got to spend at least about a minute or two grinding it back and forth to get all the small pieces out of the teeth and then a couple of weeks after having that it fell from about very high distance or anything with what a miner did in right there you can see it in the threads the problem is with the minor dentin threads the threads don't really want to close the right way so every time you want to take this apart to get to your nicely grinded bud it kind of gives you a pain in the ass every time you put it back the there you ought to be careful to put it together the right way or it's just gonna start cross threading and stripping I figured I can make do with that but um everybody knows you clean grinders with alcohol I used a 99% alcohol some people use isopropyl with rubbing alcohol this is not the limited rated issue the second list thing touched ethyl alcohol it basically strips away the coating should be fine I'd have the new I guess limited edition grades and a cruise grinder but the coating of this still tends to come off sometimes to make it new bad it just isn't something I want in my vaporizer it's not something like my bong is that's what they want my joint so this is gonna be a no-go with this grinder for me I called Santa Cruz right on their website they have a statement about don't call us about scratches some hall breaks thread problems and they were just as useless when they called them they basically said you can use ethyl alcohol to clean it but it shouldn't sit for more than a few seconds basically our product fell apart we're not going to warranty it forget you so I am on the hunt for a new bud Buster now however one thing I can say is the guaranteed the teeth would not ship and would not break and it has held true to that at least", "BwG4jA88hjA": "hey what's up everybody hope you all had a good 4/20 I know it's totally [ __ ] being stuck indoors at this time of year but I hope you all made the best of it so I'm gonna be saying goodbye to my old grinder today this is my head chef Sammy I really like this grinder good finger grips on the side of it great for just crunching through your bud nice and easily the only issue I ever had with this grinder was the crystal catching section on it for the first month I just left it alone and it's like sweet I'm gonna be be collecting like loads of Keef and then at the end of the month I'm gonna open this up but there was not even a dusting on it I've spoken to other people and they said they'd gone okay with it but yeah I've had to cut a couple of holes in it that you can see there and there's a light down a bit yeah there's a couple holes that I've had to cut in it and the effect that those holes give off is this almost like I have collected Keith even though in my brain I know I really haven't guns that I dropped there so I've got my daily driver here this is something that I've been using for a few months now it's just it's a standard piece it doesn't even it doesn't even have a slide bowl on it this is just a tall one-piece downstem single little dance then one hole for diffusion it's got high sand notches on the side of it so it's not a bad piece of tall it's a great entry level little piece I haven't needed anything else a major I did to make a video at Easter I don't think I don't think I actually released that video but I did make a video and I used my old Double Dragon my gold leaf Double Dragon I might actually still have the footage for that so I'm I still still put that video out but anyway so this is my daily driver absolutely love it it's so simple to clean you can see there it's quite clean I use this use this every single day I put a bit goes in there you don't have to put goes in into your bone and it's totally up to use each to their own I don't like to see green floating in my water so yeah that's kind of upsetting when that happens it's a lot of the reason I don't really like to smoke joints that much just because I'm watching that money go out the window is just smoke flying away I'm like I'm paying for that so yeah I like my balls try and save as much as much flour as possible and get all of that goodness up inside of me so race I like a little bit again cuz you getting a bit of flair in the camera lens yeah here we go still a little bit chilly outside this time of year so I thought I'll make the video indoors because had a lot of work to be doing today and when I finished it was a little bit later on than it would have been during these covered for 20 times covered 19 times I should say covered for 20 I much prefer that anyway but I don't want covered right all right ladies gentlemen boys girls habitus let's have a quick bowl of this star dog action wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful right amazing that star dog has such a unique taste to it so oh oh yeah yeah right so saying goodbye to my old grinder hmm head chef Samurai saint-hilaire that's my new grinder I've been testing this one for a couple weeks now I'm gonna put a link in the description so that if you want to get one of these you can also get one of these it's totally up to you I'll tell you what the small issue is though so this is my Santa Cruz shredder I love it I've been wanting a shredder for a long-ass time now normally these four piece ones are 75 quid incredible grinders like they cannot die I cannot recommend them enough six-oh six-one aircraft grade aluminium cnc machined it's neodymium magnets so this is super-strong magnets I will show you the mesh right now there is some ganja here's also some star dog mesh on this is absolutely incredible and that deep dish as well I don't know how well you can see that on the gold probe yeah so this is my new grinder ah I love it I love it just two weeks I've I've actually used like cuz I don't have teeth for so long I ended up digging into this quite a few times already but I've only had the grinder for two weeks so you can you can already see that I mean you can see I've scraped it a few times but yeah that's that's that's incredible compared to my last piece which didn't collect a [ __ ] thing this is just night and day for me it does come with let me have a look here got my chain on it keeps banging on things this is actually from Highland glass and aviemore been racquel so yeah he threw this for me and he gave me this I send this over to me he actually gave me another thing as well I should show you sometime it's my it's a it's a carb cap or what I like to call it's my carb captain cradle but it's a carb cap holder with the carb cap it's so it's so [ __ ] beautiful it's from from Ben Rock Hall again HTH GA Highland glass in having more love that [ __ ] piece so yeah that guy guess that kind of brings me onto this then something I've had made it's got my head happy logo on it for the shop and if you feel the glass where it's all engraved like you can feel every bump on that leaf it's absolutely off so whoo I love it it's 30ml diameter so you're gonna need a bigger than normal carb cap if you've got a bubble cap if you've just got like a flat cap you can use that or whatever you use on the bottom of your shoe or whatever the [ __ ] you use as a carb cap 3 mil thick as well so super super thick there as well this is a lot higher up your intake hole so that kind of stops your oil just leaving the chamber and then this nice wide bottom means that you've got this longer cooling-off period so beautiful absolutely love it let's get a little bit more star dog into this bowl we have a fat rip and then I'm gonna show you right before we have a rip I guess I'm gonna show you a piece if you guys want to see me hitting up this piece and if you want to see the rest of them then let me know and I will show you because I'm more than happy to show you I brought it out I'll put a little bit of water in but I'm not gonna I'm not gonna be hitting it this is the 750 Miller if you've been on this channel in the past and will have seen that I have the bigger brother of this one I actually have the 2000 mother liter and about a year ago now I actually picked up the middle piece if you guys want to see and I've got a mad way of setting up the one after this because of the spiral I got something else that it adds a bit of restriction to the piece but it just finishes the piece off as soon as I seen it I had to have it and then the bowl that I put on it is oh man it just it just finished the whole piece off it's totally impractical like yeah it's just and you cannot use it every single day I mean not the way it is you could potentially if you break it down but even then it's a ridiculous piece so if you want to want to see that let me know that that's something I'll definitely yeah I definitely do man I just love how that grinder works look at that consistency is absolutely awesome and speaking about this actually I had a few of these come in where during packaging during packaging they totally screwed up and they'd scratch the anodizing somehow on a few of the grinders that I got so I managed to care a little discount on that and I'm able to give that out to people at the shop and I just thought well I'll give you guys a shot as well the done for a shop page is still open so I just added added the product so that I'll add a link in the description below so if you do want one of these cheaper and in 100% 99.9% perfect condition the only thing is a tiny scratch the anodizing and mine was on the mines in the crystal caching section so are all the other four pieces there are a couple to Flora there's one to piece left and that one is it's a tiny scratch to just below one of the teeth it has no effect whatsoever on usability but right [ __ ] I love the stranger it smashes through flour I'm gonna fill up my bowl or more time here alright and yeah hope you'll have a good day and hmm you need taste of that startup oh right well he's out he'll be all have a good one she's unit ears habitat you", "Qe-1Z7FW1oM": "the santa cruz shredder was my favorite grinder for so many years and it's still considered the best grinder on the market by so many reviewers in this video i'm going to show you what makes it so different and so amazing [Music] so the santa cruz shredder is probably my most delayed and most procrastinated review ever i've been making videos for like four years now and all my old videos the santa cruz shredder was touted as the number one as my favorite blah blah blah i was always pimping the damn thing i still love it today my name is troy if you're new here i'm from 420bps.com i review cannabis products mostly vapes dab devices and [ __ ] but i'm a stoner i review all things cannabis so edibles machines you know it i'm going to cover it i'm full time at this i quit my job to do it i'm not one of those weed tubers i don't charge a bunch of money santa cruz has never paid me any money i don't do that kind of content i do content that is honest and objective and transparent so i work with stores and things like that as my business rather than taking money from manufacturers because i want to maintain that integrity and that ability to be honest and objective please like and subscribe if you're into that kind of content if you'd like to support me i'm also on patreon or you can just shop through my links that's a big help so let's talk about the santa cruz the santa cruz has several options there's the small the medium the large the jumbo there's three piece there's four piece there's two piece there's even a little hemp grinder like a little disposable grinder that's made out of non-plastic hemp no metal will pass through a metal detector you can use this and throw it away we'll grind some with this and compare it as well there's a lot of color options there's like dozens of colors a bunch of different collaborations as well there's also matte and glossy finish i really really like the glossy finish aka i really dislike the matte finish after my best buddy came down to my house and used my santa cruz shredder he fell in love with it he went home and he bought a santa cruz shredder for himself but he bought a matte finish and it was gross like all the weed just sticks to it uh i don't know what they were thinking but the gloss finish in my opinion is where it's at i've heard people claim that the gloss is sticky for them too but for me it's not and it's never been never the price ranges start from 25 all the way up to about 150 the little disposable ones are like eight dollars the medium four piece which is my favorite the medium four piece is sixty four dollars the medium three piece is fifty two dollars so what makes santa cruz shredder the best a lot of things a lot of things make this thing the best for one it has the best grind consistency out of all of the grinders in my collection even the brilliant cut the brilliant cut is my favorite grinder in the world but the santa cruz shredder still has a better grind like the actual material that comes out of the santa cruz raider is fluffier more consistent better cut less mutilated this has the best grind consistency out of all the grinders on the market it's perfectly fluffy it's perfectly broken up it works perfectly for vapes or for smoking and i've used this grinder with all of my vapes some people say that vape's native super fine or coarse or medium the santa cruz shredder has just worked with everything let's talk about the teeth the teeth remain sharp i've used this grinder for many many years and it's so sharp it's oops that's the wrong end that's what she said the teeth of the santa cruz shredder are different than most cheap grinders uh usually cheap grinders have like diamond shaped teeth you can see here the santa cruz shredder teeth they're a little bit more squared with scallop sides and serrations you can see there's little serrations on the teeth those little serrations make it a lot easier to turn your grinder when you cram it full of weed imagine like scissors like if you had scissors and the blades only went like this like where they were they were the whole length of the blade touches the other blade at the same time it's a lot of a lot of friction a lot of contact so all those different teeth touching all the same time on those diamond grinders it's a lot of effort to do that the teeth of the santa cruz are serrated so they're they're a little more like this so they're they're almost like a cigar cutter where they're they're they're using leverage so there's less contact point there's less there's more cutting and less uh less friction so all those teeth have these little scallops you know there's two scallops on each tooth so when they go by it's a little a little easier to turn and they stay sharper and they make the grind really fluffy the santa cruz is also a high grade aluminum it's not that super soft [ __ ] that a lot of those amazon and dhgate grinders have you know where you where you drop it and it's going to put a big nick in it it's not perfect and it is still aluminum so it will dent or scratch if you if you drop it from a significant distance or hit it with something hard or pointy my gold one has very very very minor scratches and i beat the [ __ ] out of this grinder i've carried it in my backpack and my duffel bag and my luggage it's dropped downstairs it's dropped on pavement and there are still no significant marks there are some little bitty scuffs the gray one on the other hand i dropped it my second day literally my second day from my desk and it landed dropped a drop this far and it landed on a metal bar so when i dropped it it just made this little little umv another thing is the grinder is perfectly precise like every little aspect of it has been refined and designed it's smooth to the touch there's texture on the different pieces that they give it feedback you know it just feels like it's been through a lot of design iterations it's been refined and and perfected the the knurlings i think it's what they're called where it's like little grippies everything feels so good the threads are so smooth so smooth it it turns so nicely it cuts so perfectly these types of things require a lot of machine time so if you look at the inside where everything is is so nicely polished and perfected and and it looks uniform and consistent you don't see that in cheap grinders and when you pick up a cheap grinder you see all the little tool marks and [ __ ] like that the santa cruz has all that stuff buffed out polished out and it's just been worked a lot more that means that this grinder has spent a lot more time inside of a cnc mill than most grinders which is why it's a little more expensive nicer material nicer design more work is put into it therefore it's a more expensive grinder and my favorite thing about the santa cruz shredder and let me let me let me go back and scale out for a second one of the things that i use to judge the quality of a grinder is how frequently i need to clean it if i if i run an eighth through a grinder and it's it's all [ __ ] up and it's jammed that sucks i don't have to be cleaning my grinder every every eighth or every ounce or every three ounces for that matter the santa cruz shredder was my favorite grinder forever because i didn't ever have to clean it i could use it and use it and use it and use it and use it and no matter how dirty this thing got it would still work pretty good it wouldn't be this smooth obviously but it would still work and my favorite thing right here we can get this to get this to focus is like it's like a self-cleaning mode so the lid of the grinder the top cap of the grinder sometimes will develop a little bit of of sticky residue here on the edge this is the grinder hash this is what causes your grinder to not turn so smoothly and here's how the santa cruz uh is self-cleaning this is what i really really love about it when you when you when it builds up these crusties put the top of your of your grinder in at a slight angle and use the lip of the grinder itself to scrape off that that grinder hash and it will fall right into your grinder and then you just vape it with your with your normal weed so you just every every time you see it gunked up like that you can just do a little little self cleaning on a little a little impromptu smooth it out session just nice and gentle don't you don't need to need to be the [ __ ] out of it it's precision it's about the angle and about about how things line up it also works much better when the grinder is actually dirty or if you want if you don't want to do that way you can just wipe off this edge and just maintain this edge pick out anything that gets stuck in there it's a lot less maintenance even if you do want to maintain it than other grinders the keep screen of the santa cruz shredder is also one of the absolute best in the market it doesn't get completely clogged up the way so many other grinders do like if you use it for ounces and ounces and ounces and ounces a lot of times that little key screen will just be completely [ __ ] caked with organic material and keef and it just becomes useless a lot of grinders you got to put a dime in there or scrape the screen or whatever just to to deal with it the santa cruz shredder isn't that way if you ever notice that that it's starting to get clogged just tap it a couple times and usually takes care of it i haven't had any issues my santa cruz shredder used to be so damn full of keef that it was it was like a danger to take it outside the house like i had so much keef collected right now it's all gone because i vaped it uh but but the keith catcher in the santa cruz is is by far my favorite for collecting keith and that's actually one thing that i miss i've since moved on primarily to the brilliant cut grinder but i i pulled the santa cruz four piece back out because i want to have that that keef collection to go to for when i want to top off a bowl santa cruz also has a pretty strong magnet it's not the strongest in the market but it's definitely strong enough to never ever come apart in your pocket unless you're really really doing some crazy [ __ ] in your pocket uh centrifugal force won't make it come off i've never had any issues with with the magnets coming off in a santa cruz it's really really difficult to over tighten a lot of grinders if you when you're grinding you end up over tightening it and then you're like your grinder's stuck the way the threads are designed in this grinder and i don't know i don't know the magic about it i remember i remember he i remember matt from from santa cruz was explaining it to me but basically the way the the threads end it changes the angle so it makes it like difficult there's also some sort of different texture on the thread but no matter how hard you tie try no matter how hard you try to tighten these things it still ends up oh there you go i over tightened it i did over tighten it even when you give it a really good tightening it still breaks loose pretty easy and the threads are so smooth hemp grinder the teeth design are a little bit different on the hemp grinder the hemp grinder is made from all hemp and no plastics no metals the teeth aren't serrated but they still have that boxy shape let's answer a phone call in our live video shall we hello all right let's do a little grind comparison i want to i want to show you the grind of the santa cruz and i want to compare the grind to the hemp grinder so we're going to break out a little nug of z cube or two i'll do two nugs i'll do one nug in each grinder real quick the santa cruz three piece and what i like to do is rather than cramming the nug into the base use the use the lid that way you know that all the weed is gonna be inside of that rim and it's gonna produce less of that grinder hash that i just showed you how to clean up so once it's in there it's a really sharp grinder it's so easy to to grind just a a little bit of muscle strength is all it requires a lot easier than so many other grinders got a little bit of uh weed on top of the magnet whoops that's the problem with doing it the way that i just did it it's a little bit a little bit sloppy so i made a mess of my magnet my fault let's take a look at this grind consistency oh god it smells so [ __ ] dank it's real fluffy real beautiful you can almost see that it flows like liquid like it has it has its own fluid dynamics it's not all broken up like if i if i dump this out it's it's not so mutilated that it's it's powder and keef like it's still little chunks of herb like right right in there you can see that it's it's it's perfectly ground it's very consistent it's just lovely just absolutely lovely i'm gonna do the same thing in this two piece i'm normally not a fan of two piece of grinders because you end up with weed outside like this what i like about three piece and four piece grinders is since i'm a vaporizer user if i grind a whole nug that right there like this weed right here is too much for one for one vaporizer i may load one bowl or two bowls three bowls with that which may be a day's worth if you're a vape user because vaporizing extracts so much more thc than smoking with the vaporizer you end up using a lot less weed so for vaporizer users it's nice to have a little storage compartment as your grinder so your grinder doubles as a storage department you grind some weed you store your ground wheat in there until it's finished and then you grind some more weed with a two-piece grinder you grind your weed you can't leave it in here because you can't retrieve it from here you open the two piece and you got that you can't you can't fill a bowl from that that does look pretty nice though i'm gonna smells nice and and dank so the two piece has some has a little more remnants in the teeth [Music] but decent that actually worked pretty good i'm actually kind of surprised by that it's about the same consistency it looks pretty similar there's a couple big chunks in there with a two-piece grinder the the grind is going to be kind of the result of how many times you do this you know if you keep doing this it'll be a little finer if you only do this a couple times it'll be a little more coarse let's vape a bowl though because this wouldn't be a 420 vape zone video if we didn't vape a bowl i'm gonna pack my vap cap on my brand new rosium 2019 m it's so much easier to load load of vape when it's uh from a grinder compared to a flat surface but whatevs well goodbye so santa cruz shredders they're available all over the place like you see you see santa cruz shredders at head shops and and everywhere but make sure that you're buying a real thing because santa cruz shredder has been around for a long time they're known to be the best grinder on the market so there's knockoffs there's counterfeits out there there there are fake santa cruz shredders on the market make sure you're buying the real thing because the the fake ones they're not as good they're not gonna be as good the real santa cruz shredder is going to have a filled in logo the teeth are going to have that that square shape with the little sides and the serrated teeth santa cruz shredder has never had diamond shaped teeth so if you see something that says santa cruz and it has those typical diamond teeth you know damn well it's a fake to make sure you're getting the real deal i recommend buying from one of the known distributors like planted the vapes or puff it up but because they're popular and because of all the different color options sometimes it's a little difficult to find the size and color option you want for example i've been wanting a jumbo and rasta for years and i've never i've never found one amazon also has a pretty good selection although with amazon again it's possible that somebody could be trying to sell a fake santa cruz because amazon doesn't regulate the counterfeit of of goods and good enough one last thing uh i reviewed the brilliant cut recently and i call the brilliant cut my favorite grinder the brilliant cut is my favorite grinder and i believe it is the nicest most luxurious grinder on the market however the santa cruz like i said has a better grind this grind consistency is slightly better than the brilliant cut and the santa cruz shredder will keep your weed fresher longer in its ground form so if you ground a nug in your brilliant cut and ground nug in your santa cruz i pointed to this one when i said brilliant cut because i'm kind of high the the weed that is ground in your brilliant cut will dry out slightly faster than the weed that's stored in your santa cruz because the threading and the magnet system here creates a tighter air air seal than the dual magnet system of the brilliant cut because the brilliant cut doesn't have any threads so if you don't like threads they're brilliant cut however the brilliant cut is only three piece so there's no keep catcher with the brilliant cut which is why i broke up my santa cruz because i kind of missed that keef you know anyway there's links in the description for the brilliant cut or the santa cruz these are my these two grinders are the cream of the crop the best grinders on the market i've used a whole bunch of other grinders and nothing compares to these two nothing compares nothing compares to you thanks for watching happy grinding", "DVNSSHr--Yc": "[Music] [Music] [Music] what's going on guys my name is Jeff I'll stood on this platform welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new I don't know what you're doing you better subscribe so you can get some more content in your life I've been posting two to three videos a week keeping the streak going hope you guys are enjoying let me know in the comments if there's any videos you want to see I always think you guys suggestions and that's what this video is all about somebody on my snapchat messaged me and asked me if I would break down this little grinder on my YouTube there's a lot more to it than you think I picked this up and I've been showing it off haven't talked too much about it the company's called like cubis or quipus qub us this looks pretty [ __ ] cool they advertise it as like an airtight smell proof [ __ ] alien great quality grinder and I've been really liking it at first I had mixed opinions on it because it is not like your traditional grinder but it has enough unique qualities to it that made me keep coming back to it and it's actually cut my new daily grinder this is my old grinder I loved it it's done a lot of good but recently it has gotten pushed aside the Cubist's or kumis I'm gonna call out the Cubist because it's a cube it's literally the same size as a rubik's cube actually which is partially what caught my attention to it now if your typical four stage grinder what I really liked about this is the compartment that holds your flour that has the screen that goes into your cave catcher can actually be removed from the grinder so that you can have a three piece grinder you'll have a bigger compartment for your flour and then you also don't have to have to keep compartment now don't get me wrong I love Keef actually like a lot of Keef in my day it gives me a [ __ ] but honestly it's not totally worth it to me anymore ever since that came out because keith was like if I'm trying to get like super lit just looks at Keef now it's like I'm trying it super lit I take blob so the point of Keith has kind of been replaced in my eyes but I keep having all these grinders with screens in them and then all of a sudden I just have holy [ __ ] like why didn't I just keep that with all the lead and I could have just enjoyed the weed a little bit more because that Keith does come from somewhere look how much you keep I have in this guy it's literally built to the brim I have this key thing like half built I just started using this grinder like three months ago so the last three months I collected that much Keef that is insane that that much gave it's just been thrown away from my weed so I prefer to have a bigger compartment to hold my weed and then you also have the Keef actually staying inside the flower also today I have a sick woven blunt rolled by my looming toxic iris it was a pre-rolled he made for me it was totally empty and then I just filled it with my own flower and today I'm smoking on some llamosa I'm a big fan of mimosa it's a nice daytime eye and just keeps you going and it's nice like uplifting like conversational high there's some strains that has no clue man I just do not want to talk after I smoke them but mosa is not one of those it definitely keeps the conversation going not a big fan of blunts but I'm making an exception because this one's woven so that's pretty cool has the little checkered pattern on it love these what about tips nothing I'd like to say about this it just looks cool it's one of a novelty thing there's no reason to only smoke one of them once it does the same thing as normal one which is better that better how about great guy I always have them so I got this rounder for free I hit the company up and asked him if I could try it out and show it off and they said yeah but I didn't like this at first because of the two magnets on the top when I was going to grind it it just felt really Jackie because I just kept going over the magnetic connector but then when I realized you needed to do would you flip it around and then once you give it like a 90 degree turn so the magnetic connector isn't touching anymore you have like a full 180 degrees to turn the grinder and actually get a nice sufficient grind out of it even though I am liking the grinder still I do admit it does not grind wheat as fast as the grinder I had in the past I don't know if it's the fact that the holes are a little too small well it's just not enough teeth but it just does not grind it enough just takes an extra 30 seconds to grind up your weed and if that's a deal-breaker for you you're gonna do one you seeing these things retail for like eighty two hundred dollars which is like your typical high quality American grinder price if you're buying a grinder for like $30 it's just not made out of the same grade of quality metals the fact that they say it's smelter if it's nice if you're leading in the car but if it is truly airtight that means it's also watertight so that means that I can submerge the schooling in water and it shouldn't leak through which I'm gonna try out right now first thing you pump the weed out but look how much more weed you can store when you get rid of a little compartment this tiny little thing can hardly hold any weed so sacrificing the key compartment to store more weed is totally worth it in my eyes you can probably fit like five to seven grams in the bottom compartment if you don't have the third stage of the grinder in there all right let me try not [ __ ] this up I try give you guys a little bit angle if I can so we have our water we have our grinder and we are going to fully submerge it then I'm going to smoke this so it doesn't go out see a couple air bubbles that's concerning me salty little ones it's probably not a big deal alright alright rant try this [ __ ] off hill we will decide it is completely dry so water did get into the crevices where the magnets are but these o-rings that connect it are strong enough that it did not leak into the grinder at all so I can confidently say that this is airtight and watertight not gonna lie did not know how I was going to go I'm very excited that it passed the water test and followed the company on Instagram a little bit and the owners just seemed like genuinely cool people which is another reason why I wanted to make this video definitely has a lot of great qualities to it one complaint is doesn't grant me the fastest if there's one thing I could change about it it would have more teeth so everyone grabs me we done faster these things are fully customizable but you can make like the middle black orange you can do like red red white and blue you can do anything you want almost at the end imagine you're like [ __ ] kayaking down a river and you flip your kayak and you're like bag goes underwater and you're like no but we drew it but then you realize you have this grinder and you're like yes no it's fine like I wouldn't even be worried than iconic look alright guys my battery's dying so I guess that's time to wrap the video up I hope you guys enjoyed this video click like if you did make sure you subscribe if you haven't already got a lot more contact

watching my videos you're probably pretty smart please", "pJ5tgyxeaRc": "hey everybody welcome to Lex's world how you guys do and hope you're all well today we're gonna be continuing the four piece grinder review Wars it seems although this is probably the last one of these that were gonna do the last time I did an episode like this which did enormous ly well like a quarter million people watched it I actually reviewed the lift innovations grinder which is kind of a spinning blade one that was ultra luxury and it was a very heavy grinder but they didn't like it all that much and a few different issues came out of that video once I went through the comments number one a lot of you felt that a hundred and fifty dollars was way too much money for a two and a half inch luxury grinder and I kind of agree even without all of the extra accessories at a hundred and twenty dollars it was still an extremely expensive two and a half inch grinder the second problem was that even though I enjoyed the grinder I didn't enjoy it twice as much as my space case which retails for fifty to sixty dollars and I did end up using my space case after that review and I gave away the lift innovations grinder the other problem with the lift innovations grinder was that a lot of you pointed out that hey Phoenicians grinders are actually even better and they're a little bit cheaper so if you're recommending a luxury grinder that should really be the one interesting points worthy of investigation so here's what I did tada I contacted Phoenicians and they were kind enough to send me to grinders the medium sized two and a half inch one that's often sold for around 70 bucks and a super large 3.2 inch one these are often about a hundred and ten dollars and I've spent the last two weeks checking them out using the medium one day today and here's my judgment on them and a look at some of the features so first this medium grinder by itself does have all of the features that a luxury grinder must have number it's Threadless every compartment comes a card with no threading and that's pretty much a must in the luxury ones if you open up the herb chamber you will notice that the herb chamber is very very deep which is what you want to see the screen is removable and it's swappable which is important long-term though I felt that the default screen was too fine it doesn't let enough key fall through and this phoenician didn't come with different screens so I have to assume that it doesn't come with other screens when they retail so you might have to buy your own but otherwise swappable as you go down to the Keith catcher you will notice that it is also super deep and has the rounded edge which is good and looking at the exterior of the grinder it's got these like perforated lobes that make grip really easy but let's say that you're like somebody with arthritis or an older person it even comes with these rubber pieces that you put over the grinder and it can make the grip even easier like ridiculously easy so I thought that was a nice little well-thought-out feature meanwhile as we get into the top compartment it has all the good things that it should have there's no shortage of really sharp teeth and there is an adequate number of holes so that the herb can fall through easily and a magnet that doesn't fail the upside down shake test at all it won't come off and same for that when the magnet doesn't fail the test either I'll show you guys how it grinds here but my main complaint either with the medium Phoenician grinder or with the large Phoenician grinder is that while the overall build quality is very good the material and the weight of it are pretty ordinary with the lift innovations grinder from a couple months ago it was all about super high quality materials and that made it weigh twice as much as the space case here and this weighs about as much as my old space case marginally more but then it's also marginally taller so that makes sense a couple notes though about the big Phoenician grinder as we just wrap up our herb grind here see it makes the herb really fine no problems whatsoever but a couple quick notes about this big Phoenician it is the same on the interior it has all the same features it's Threadless etc etc but it does have a very interesting lid the lid is a triple function it can hold a box of papers just like this you can tuck it in there as long as it's standard size it's got this little ashtray thing and also it is an actual paper holder I'll show you guys what I mean here spread your paper out a little bit tada it holds it so I thought that those were some interesting features actually all you have to do is decide whether a grinder that's over three inches in size and with those extra features is worth a hundred and ten dollars versus the seventy that the medium one costs as for my judgement I'm gonna have to agree with those people that posted about the phoenicians in the last grinders video I loved this grinder it was super comfortable it was convenient it was quiet there were zero issues around herb failing to drop I liked it way more than the lift innovations won so much so that I'm actually going to make this ocean blue on my main new primary grinder I almost feel like I should maybe do something interesting with my old space case maybe I'll clean it up sign it and give it away an Instagram that's one idea but in any case of course a link to the Phoenicians in the video description below but I will also give away this big red one to a lucky winner grinders being technically just a kitchen tool not cannabis paraphernalia so we can give it away on any platform so whichever platform you're seeing this on just leave me a comment under this video between February 16th and February 24th 2019 and you are entered also give the video a share if you got time and the winner will have their comment replied to that's it it's that easy that's it for me everybody we got some grow content lined up the next couple weeks so if you're new here just subscribe to catch that hit that like button if you had a good time and we'll see you next time", "0IeidUT4aNk": "oh you cool cats and kittens it's me your girl celia back at it again with another video all right if you are part of the cannabis community this is for you it is an unboxing of my brand new santa cruz shredder grinder large matte black obsessed with it it cost me about 93 dollars um shipping was free i ordered it on today is friday i ordered it on monday or tuesday i believe it was monday this is pretty fast actually i'm pretty impressed with how fast it got here um so let's do the thing yeah all right here she [ __ ] is let's open her up wow look at the box mechanics on that that's pretty lit i love little weird things like that all right first of all she's [ __ ] huge wow to compare it here's a lighter so it's a pretty big grinder pretty large really beautiful her keith catch is very very nice it's rounded it has a beveled edge to it and uh this is the scraper that it came with so it's black on one side white on the other um listen wait maybe good grinding noise so so this is completely laid out so we have keep catch followed by our screen followed by the top followed by the top top top wow that is magnets like look at how magnetized this is ready like oh we're now in a new ambiance so let's see what this shredder can do skunk ape it's time to go in to the danger zone time for the inaugural shred [Music] to wow she's a hairy [ __ ] all right let's just jump oh [ __ ] [ __ ] ugh i almost forgot something very crucial it's all about the coin right so we're going to remove our lid already there are filaments in this grinder and we're going to take our kefi nickel and we're going to put it in the screen of our keith catch so as we grind the vibration from the keef screen we'll make the coin like on the top of it and that's going to cause more of the keef to fall down into the keef catch all right she's [ __ ] ground and we're now turning very easily let's pop open the top oh it's very magnetized very clean oh we got a little bit of weed stuck on the corner there oh [ __ ] already [ __ ] well it's official she's broken in this is pretty now she you know will never be cleaner than this moment well dirtier i don't know the shred on this is fluffy as [ __ ] look how fluffy tasty look at it alright guys so did the santa cruz shredder live up to its name um it is my first grinding experience i will say it was very easy to grind all of the weed um this is easily this is easily probably uh probably two grams of weed and it ate it no problem so i'm pretty impressed and it's about maybe a third of the way full so um you know there's definitely room to grind to continue grinding um but you know i originally i just wanted this a santa cruz shutter just because i've heard of great things about them um and i mean very impressed i'm very impressed with it oh and by the way uh like comment share all that [ __ ] whatever i'm supposed to say at the end of this thing you guys should know by now whatever a youtuber is supposed to say just throw all that in here all right well i will see you guys in the next video staying home and stay high and if you do have to go out stay safe", "mpZvKQ99t24": "all right so it's big tank daddy in this [ __ ] and today we're going to be reviewing grinders we got kali crushers versus Phoenicians so as you can see I've got quite a few of each and I have quite a lot of experience with grinders started off with one of these puppies disgusting not as bad as a santa cruz shredder so start off with kali crushers so the Cali crusher uses a four-way thread lock so it's got four of these threads going around the middle piece the bottom piece but not the two top pieces so this thread lock is just a quick thread lock there we go so quickly locks it in quickly on logs it's quite convenient they license the idea from or licensed it from Phoenicians who has the rights to it so Phoenicians was the original one and they have a much better thumb lock in my opinion because instead of actual threads where it could thread lock they've got these little bars a lot more effective so both of these are very deep very very deep they both hold a lot of keys so either Phoenicians or Kali is very good for Keefe very good for unlocking and locking you won't get thread lock like a santa cruz shredder in the middle compartment you've got the keep screens I'm not sure what size screens these are but it looks like they use a finer screen on the phoenicians and Kelly crusher on the back you've got just the plain old Kelly crusher the kind of cross just so it's removable they have a screw in the middle so you can remove the kief screen and replace that which is very convenient unlike a santa cruz shredder and on the back of here you've got a Fibonacci sequence or Fibonacci spiral I guess you'd call it which looks very cool and that's also removable with a hex key so upon these shredding parts here the Cali crusher has more of a thick blade shredding so it kind of just chunks up the cash I'd say instead of actually slicing it like the Phoenicians will do the Phoenicians will slice and dice it out because it's actually got blades and they are pretty sharp they're not sharp enough to cut you if you touch them but the very sharp top the Kali is the same thing things note about the Cali crusher is the medium has a very good magnet in it but do not buy the small the small is a terrible magnet on the top and it always falls off so you wouldn't want to get the strong very good just from shaking it small Phoenician is absolutely excellent this is what I personally is I personally use the only one and only waka flocka waka flocka flame so each Venetian on the back has a barcode on it a serial number I won't show you mine but it's got a serial number so it identifies it they come with lifetime warranties something to note about the large Phoenicians is that you can hold rolling papers so you could go ahead and slip slip some rolling papers in there and they just stay out kind of like a tissue box you can peel them out roll up on Phoenicians website they call this an ashtray just kind of disgusting I don't know why you'd want to spend $100 on a grinder and then use it as an ashtray all the grinders here high end grinders and that's why you don't see Santa Cruz shredders anywhere so yeah medium Cali crusher is absolutely beautiful this is my second third grinder ever actually I went I went from the plastic grinder to a regular sharp stone to one of these it is a huge upgrade a few of the money and you want a high-end grinder get a Cali crusher or a phoenician don't get a Santa Cruz show they are garbage so I was actually way too high and forgot to mention it but both of these grinders have a place where you actually put in the marijuana before you grind it up don't be a [ __ ] hero and put it in the top and then try and get the top with the marijuana in it onto the grinder just put it here if any falls through then it's [ __ ] smokeable because it's that small so I don't even know why people put it in the top I see people do that all the time just put it in here remove all the stems and line up the top at the bottom and then you could spin into the direction and away from to look at the the blades have a point on the the end closest to my thumb and kind of a swivel on the back to break it up imagination it's got the the same holes that you can put in too and it just slices right through you don't even really need to line it up with the top the tops kind of got a spiral to it so you could shred with it and against and usually four turns and it's all pretty good so I'd actually say that the I'd actually say that the phoenicians is a much better grinder than the Kelly crusher the the shredding is much better it's much finer maybe I'll do a shred test in the lab and do that sometime so I'm just going to go ahead and wrap this [ __ ] up by saying shadow 2d nail shout out the Phoenician shout out to Cali crusher Phoenicians really got the best best grinder on the market in my opinion out of everything I've seen from mama whatever mama [ __ ] grinder that's like three hundred dollars all the way down to sharp stones Phoenician has absolute best bang for your buck on the market I'd also like to show you the Cali crusher two-piece I forgot about this guy but some people don't want a four-piece grinder so I got the Cali crusher two-piece hearing and gold you can't make any of these two pieces either because of the thread-locking will get in the way so you actually have to go ahead and buy a two-piece if you want one so and there'd also be huge holes on the bottom two two-piece because your two-piece would look like this and there would be a bunch of holes in the bottom so so unless you want it to season some food or some [ __ ] like that you can't you can't grind with that to these so you'd have to go out and get a two-piece grinder you know this is some pretty easy [ __ ] I'm just high as [ __ ] so I'm sure you guys know a 2-piece [ __ ] grinders so while I'm at it I thought I might as well as reviewed the smalls to compare them so they both have huge chief keef captures in the bottom cally crusher still very beautiful drawing you're the only downside to it is the really shitty magnet that they put on it are they thinking but the Phoenicians are absolutely beautiful beautiful look at these magnets let's compare this oh my go landscape look at these magnets look how look at the size difference or are you thinking Kelley what were you thinking when you put that on there anyways the bottom of the Phoenicians absolutely beautiful it's very deep I'll go ahead and stick my thumb in there look at that goes right up to that little little knuckle there almost okay it's about my thumbnail but so deep absolutely just holds a ton of key from there you're not going to get that much Keefe will not you're not going to get as much Keefe as you would with e Kelley crusher because they actually do have different sized grading on the kief screens so this one is a little bit smaller and this one is a little bit larger but just by a fraction probably nothing noticeable again you've got that beautiful block block block on the phoenicians that they licensed up to cow and Callie's got that threadlock kind of a weird design of holes I'd say - I like the the kind of trapezoids that show up on the finishing bar you've also got the Fibonacci of course cross crosshair Callie both these both Rozsival you've got your serial number on the back - Phoenician engineering me in the USA other than say Phoenician engineering no it doesn't and you can get these and a ton of different colors - I've got the Phoenician one here Waka Flocka just chilling purple Cali crusher here black count brusher a couple large Phoenicians back here I will use the large Phoenicians a little too large for me I'd go medium medium only and small I don't know why send medium only it's worth probably cuz I'm high but I'd go being even small only small definitely if anything helps you conserve much smaller much more convenient and I like the feel of a small in my pocket rather than this big kind of chunky medium I've always used mediums before so going to a small was actually a huge difference I loved it and I've never gone back from Waka Flocka here never ever so I'd like to just shout out Phoenician they're doing ops an amazing job with their grinders really really huge innovations like just go ahead and dismiss the fact that santa cruz things at their high-end grinder company and i'd like to give a shout out to Cali crusher - homegrown the mediums are beautiful and the two piece of - two piece as well those are really nice", "gVungILH3Zs": "this is our American made [Music] so what do you see this the use of this other than like whizzes tour bus yeah industrial or if someone is like being tasked with a convention like this where they need to like roll up complimentary joints for everyone so a dispensary might want to have that like that plane at 13 or some [ __ ] right", "0mpJZE-kA-E": "the secret to the grinder is a tooth design [Music] [Music] Green it's in their

something a little different I'm bringing you all how to clean a grind so home for the camera right here according this right here pointing down alright we back over here this angle so you're gonna need do for grant we start there boom I like them we back at it mmm now we got you grinder first thing yeah first things first what you gonna need for me what I use is solved in I don't use alcohol I use acetone cuz I'm gonna [ __ ] alcohol now in the coronavirus [ __ ] I'm using acetone that works as good if not better so you know you got the santa cruz room all dirty like you see this butter burger full of hash or on the side right there the [ __ ] and it's been through quite a lot but it's only been a few months like cuz i got this year on Christmas my girl gave it to me you can see it's pretty dirty we got that coin in there to make that extra Keef pretty dirty the bottom to the burners comes to see if you guys so we have some key right there we're gonna save that yeah we're gonna clean this [ __ ] up funny we think we're gonna save it okay a fire would focus a [ __ ] this wood is cheese something I really got the UM I don't really got this train I haven't done a stirring review on it cuz I don't have a lot of it it's not even that fire like it looks it doesn't even look very good so I'm not gonna do streaming you only do a strain review of the five-yard absolutely that's why I'm taking a little break but yeah let's go alright so what I like to do is I grab this part right here put some salt in it put some salt in the soup I'm gonna go right here on the side so you're gonna fill up this part with salt alright just like that spread it around a little bit so you're gonna get this in your ground then you grab your [ __ ] acid so on the alcohol put it right in there but I don't mess so far right here right it's kind of so W so so now you get this part and you do this put it off and twist it just like you're grinding it just twist just twist I'm gonna do it right here just so angry everything dirty if you just twist you're gonna feel this [ __ ] this getting smoother and smoother twist the twister twister now you open it look you see that part there's almost cleaned out bro so then she's full of nastiness a little bit it's not completely cleaning out but it's way better already so we're gonna do it again you got to go for round two drop some more huh this is how I do it same like I'm sure that there's a lot more ways that you can actually preserve the keys in like the things that are inside the grinder but like me I don't give a [ __ ] about that I just trying to get the [ __ ] clean so this is how I do it do it again just rinse it off [Music] this part was almost clean you gotta give some touch-ups with the [ __ ] what you say with the with a q-tip by like from what it was to what it is now that's just hey this is not even getting out of there now but like this is where it's important it rotating blade this little thing right here if this is [ __ ] is not gonna make the grinder rotate good since that part is cleaned out then we teach how to clean this part there's one of the most harder parts to clean but far as it's easy because all we do is put it right there no zoom that [ __ ] in when we put that there put the salt just like we did salt on there you're gonna do it both ways just like this like both sides just like this the yeah is gonna get a bit dirty belabor it's just salt and alkali you look at my eyes is kind of cleaning your hand yeah it cleans your hands alright so that's part is done now you flip it over and do the same thing on this side mmm more on this side what they [ __ ] over it - they did yeah they did ready so now you see that how it was and how it is now she is perfect perfect yes that's what I wanted it right here because this way gets clogging the stops making Keith that's what we don't want and one just continue that makes up TV now this part I'm not even gonna training I'm just gonna forget but I'm not gonna take out the key from disco it's not even that much Keith you know he cares I know if some other [ __ ] is gonna be like was your ways to keep fighting that she good as [ __ ] I know it's good but like is not that that deep oh it's not that important at least not right now for the video purposes around here is imagine if he got salt if you got salt on your fingers like if you rub it again to this is gonna come out too so he's gonna be good do you just do this one [Music] [Music] film brand new hey guys so I hear did you do it like you can do it again you know you get

Cali crusher grinder I believe this is the 2.5 interior here I gotta say I'm really impressed with this thing it's works really really well top comes off and goes back on nice and easy on the magnets have held in place which is one of the biggest problems that I found with the fake Cali crushers this one it always you know it always stays on and it's pretty easy to take off which is really cool to screw the grooves to let it screw on screw off is are really really nice they fit really well you can tell there's obviously quality in the machining I gotta say I have a couple inexpensive grinders and this thing just surpasses all of them by a longshot I wish I never bought any of those fakes or anything like that the bottom opens you have your Keefe catcher and your spatula as you can see I haven't really used this one too much yet but I'm definitely working on it you can see all the Keefe kind of caked around the edges over here so let's go ahead and grind up some bud thank you guys for watching these videos by the way I really appreciate it this is one of my favorite channels to do videos for for obvious reasons so let's go ahead and grab my wheat germ almost out here but some pretty good stuff take out the small chunk I'm grinding the small chunk I might use the big one in the bomb all right I'm not trying to throw some tunes some reggae over this you guys that way you have something to listen to while you're watching trying to get a close-up show you guys what I'm smoking hearing some good stuff actually from my dispensary so let's just throw a small chunk in there to show you guys how it works so you push it down nice and easy I start twisting it back and forth and you twist it a little bit and actually grinds it up quite quick really see I like getting a fine grind to it so I grind it up a lot Wow you can smell that smells great there we go my little nug nicely ground up perfect for perfect for joints or for anything else if you want you know plug up your bong with a little nug and throw this on top it's perfect I really like using this thing to roll joints it really makes it much easier my other grinders never worked as well or even close to as well so I'm really really happy with the thing there's going to be links in the description below you guys can check it out on Amazon I think it's about 20 bucks but this thing is really big I mean it doesn't even fit in my mason jar yeah this is a pretty big mason jar so please like comment share and subscribe let me know what you guys want to see how semi links to any cool products you guys want me to review I love making these reviews and now go smoke a bowl have a good time you guys thank you you you", "KMDPjT9NN6E": "so I've had this Phoenician grinder for around four years now I'm using it consistently of grinded many nugs throughout the years with this the best thing I have to say about this grinder is the build quality the material that used for this is really nice feels very premium I've dropped it a few times there's no real visible damage that you can see maybe like a little nick here and there but overall the build quality is very nice I was hanging up some photos one time and I didn't have a hammer or anything so I use the bottom of it this is the only damage you got for me banging some picture nails into the wall it's a really well-built product another pro about this is that it immediately catches the eye of people so you're at some session or over a friend's house and you take this out people are usually going to ask you about it this could be because of the very unique look and it could also be because I have like a pretty loud color I got the pink to grab attention and it's worked so far it grinds the same as the first day I got it I press you don't think the grinding ability is enough to justify the price premium but the parts really don't get that dirty I've only cleaned this maybe once or twice so let's get to the cons and it has a pretty big con I have not used any chief and this is how much Keith I have gathered throughout the whole four years of owning this Grande this is it I've changed the screens of this grinder two or three times I put it in a freezer because the internet told me to do that not sure how it works but it didn't work overall the phoenicians grinder it's a it's a very decent premium grinder it will definitely grab people's attention it's built using nice material it's lasted me for years and I think it's gonna last me a lot longer it still grinds the same as the first day I got it and the one big flaw is that doesn't catch Keith at all but if you can afford the premium price if you like the look of this if you want a long-term grinder and you don't care for Keith and this is the grinder for you [Music]", "W5q8SPVmG7I": "so this is the SLX 2.0 and the SCS a large addition here you can see that my SCS has been cleaned recently yet still dirtier than my LX 2.0 that's the ceramic coating kicking in there there you can see the nice key screen here let's see if I can move some butt up away I got two s Alexis I know what I'm doing alright we're gonna look at it by looking through the screen that's something behind it aka the button that grinder you can see you can see quite big that let's look at the SGS screen now a little bit it's not gonna let as much key through so you're gonna it's a little bit finer mesh of a screen that's a little X for sure now they look pretty similar to me actually again one second thought this is my Keith portion here I've never had a lot of key for my SES and I've used it for a long time so putting them back together here's how it is the SCS [Music] [Music] [Music] so I'm not that hard to put that together I can do with one hand although it's probably a lot quicker with two you can see Maya selects and how it's a three to four part Brian there so I'm gonna quickly just put this back together and now you have got both of them here if you look from the top they're about literally the same there's not much difference but you look at it from the side yeah that's where the big difference is and then here's them side-by-side yeah so the SLX is a much more compact grinder even though it's got about the same sir come our diameter is this SCS grinder and this is a large and this is also the large but you can see the large that selects is much smaller overall dimensions yeah and that's about it that's a quick little look at that to both these grinders [Music]", "55t5PXmQvxU": "hey guys in this video I want to talk to you about grinders grinders are a very important part of vaporizing they're a great cannabis gadget in general great for any use but it's super important to have a good grinder with your vaporizer every vaporizer has a different requirement for the grind and many different grinds grinders will give you different results they're not all the same and buying a cheap grinder may not end in a as a good investment in the top left-hand corner here you see the Compton grinder this is my newest grinder I just picked it up a couple of weeks ago and I'm really enjoying it it has a loading zone where you can put your herbs so that you're not crowding the center you're not risking flattening all of the herbs it has user replaceable screen using a special tool that keeps all of the parts out of the center so they don't get gunked-up with pollen and sticky substance and the compton grinders team is working on a lot of accessories for the grinder and a lot of their own products that really turning things out for example they have a great storage vault that screws directly onto your grinder so you can grind for a few different occasions for a few sessions and lock it into your storage vault and we'll show that off a little later in the top right we have the space case grinder this is the medium four-piece the compton grinders was a medium for piece as well space case is one of the oldest names and grinders they have extremely sharp diamond teeth they're thinner than most of the other Diamond teeth grinders which makes them slice really well and a lot of holes in the bottom of the grinding compartment the santa cruz redder in the bottom right hand corner is also a medium for piece but as you can see it's a little different in size from the Space Case in the Compton grinder it has a smaller diameter but it's taller so this is a taller grinder than the space case as you can see here it's got about that much honey overall I can't say a bad thing about the Santa Cruz redder one of my favorite grinders I love the concave rectangular teeth and the whole pattern design it's a it's a very high-quality grinder that lasts and lasts and lasts and has great twisting action great threads I've heard people complaining about some grinders have too many threads some grinders have too few all of these grinders have a different number of threads Santa Cruz shredder finds a happy medium in all the departments and it's a top quality grinder lastly and right next to it is the cosmic case grinder this is the medium for piece as well the cosmic case has lightning bolt shaped teeth which I like I've spent quite a bit of time with my cosmic case grinder and result very happy with it there isn't a reason I would not recommend it and as the prices for these grinders fluctuate during holidays and sale events they all come very close to each other on price let's look at the different Santa Cruz shredders I have three we have the Santa Cruz shredder medium for peace this is the santa cruz shredder jumbo for peace it's taller and significantly wider and the santa cruz shredder jumbo two-piece this is black black and gray or gunmetal the two-piece two-piece I don't like to use very much I what would you do I would have to dump it out onto the table or onto a piece of paper into a tray for my use I like having that third chamber so I will always recommend always recommend getting a four piece grinder or getting a grinder with an herb holding chamber or of course you can get the Compton grinder in the vault all sorts of options you always have options there's so many options with grinder this is the met Tanner the maintainer is a plastic grinder that also has a storage compartment maybe it's a plastic herb storage container that also has a grinder you decide this is the storage container in the maintainer this is the top half of the grinder teeth bottom half your herbs go in here grind grind grind he would then pour them into the container and when they locked and that Tanner is smell proof when I first saw the maintainer it was filled with coffee beans they were smelly coffee beans and when the maintainer was closed I couldn't smell them so it works this is an acrylic grinder acrylic is a type of plastic the specifically this is the volcano herb mill that comes with the volcano or can be purchased from Storz and Bickel you can purchase their crellick grinders from other vendors I don't really like to I've heard a lot of good things about this one and I'm very fond of it I get a cheap plastic smelly grinder and you can get such a fine acrylic rinder for not too expensive it's so difficult to get a grip on the Magic Flight nano grinder it's so when you have something in there and doing this motion this is tough this is not fun with the Magic Flight nano grinder Magic Flight finishing grinder this is more of a greater than a grinder and we will encounter a few of these it grates along the bottom using the ridges in the top fits perfectly onto a Magic Flight Launch Box great for any vaporizer that requires an ultrafine grind this is a grinder card I have a few of these that have come with different vaporizers or as freebies when I purchase the one was a business card I've never used the one I have never really felt the need to they're great for grading you can I really don't see this being a great solution ever and I've been in situations where I've had no brighter and even then I don't see the grinder card being a great solution ever hey guys don't forget to connect with me on Twitter and Instagram at paper review

aluminum herb shredder is the ultimate in new herb shredder technology every element of the shredder has been analysed and improved upon from the revolutionary tooth design and threading pattern to the rare earth magnet used in the lid closure system [Music]", "DNm9cgUiVfE": "hey everybody and welcome to Lexus world and in a bit of a fun-filled episode today we are gonna be showing off some different grinders and I'm gonna compare to you guys the difference between a really simple five to ten dollar grinder like this little plastic two-piece versus a about a 60 or 70 dollar grinder which is this 4 piece space case and we're gonna be showing off this hundred and fifty dollar roughly lift innovations grinder which is a four piece so let's compare and contrast them all and how well they grind and all that kind of thing and we'll start off with this little guy they are between five and ten dollars depending on where you get them and the good ones happen to have a little magnet in the middle and they also have a little hidden storage compartment right here but the problem is is that they rely on these plastic teeth and the plastic teeth are sharp on the onset but they actually wear down and then the grinder doesn't spin as well but you can see if I put some weed in there and turn because it's new it's turning quite well the grind is pretty quick and as you can see if grinded everything up pretty fine so no big complaints with this grinder but the problem is is as I said as it gets old and sticky it becomes a little bit tougher to spin and you need to put some torque behind it and yeah it will sooner or later break it is kind of flimsy so this is not a forever grinder this is a grinder that you can take to a party or camping and feel pretty good about losing or at least if you lose it it doesn't really matter you can always go out spend five bucks in another one the next grinder I'm gonna show you guys is this this is a four piece space case that my regular viewers would have seen and the reason I like the space case grinders because it's got all of the features that a really good grinder should have and it's not a super unreasonable price and what you have in it is a nice and powerful magnet that'll hold down the lid no matter how hard you shake it's got a bunch of sharp teeth it's got plenty of holes in the sifting area so that your material doesn't get stuck in the top compartment if you open it up the threading is nice and thick you're not gonna have any cross threading you have a really nice deep Bowl for the herb area and you also have at the bottom a little Keef collector there you go and as you guys can see everything's super clean because they clean this in the last episode and if you put a little bit of weed into it let's see how it functions I've actually it's been a while since I've had it this clean so this should be cool and this is completely effortless especially when the grinder is this clean but space cases are really good so even once they get old and full of stickiness they turn pretty easily and voila it also has absolutely no difficulty grinding up the herb really fine so let's clean this up voila and now we move on to this lift innovations grinder which I thought was very interesting it is canadian made and with all of the accessories which are quite numerous it actually runs about a hundred and fifty bucks so it actually comes with three different screens that'll determine how much key falls through the grinder as you guys can see I've been testing it out for the last couple of weeks it's got several sifting screens three to be precise and I put in the medium one into the bottom right here because I felt that this one was wouldn't cut up fine enough and this was a little too fine so I quickly switched it out to this and the reason I could switch it out so easily is that comes with the stool and you can actually remove the various rings really easily with this tool and that lets you get at the screens and the sifter is very easily tada super simple I thought that was kind of cool the other cool thing is that even though it comes with a relatively deep Bowl and a relatively deep Keef collector it actually comes with this bonus chamber and you can install at whichever way you want personally I would like to install it like this and get the herb collection area to be twice as deep here's the other feature of this grinder when you open it up you have this kind of blade that spins and it connects into the cover of the grinder up here this is probably the most interesting and unique thing about the design of this one because when you do it this way you create a lot of torque on the cover making it enormous ly easy to spin it even if it starts to get sticky so we'll just put a couple of pieces and again just to show you guys and it spins really really effortlessly tada and here's the one issue I found with this grinder they tried to create this super nice torquey design with a fancy blade but it sometimes means that even as you spin the herb doesn't come all the way down because it can't get caught on the blade so sometimes as a result you end up spinning for longer with this hundred and fifty dollar grinder but in the end as you can see everything works out and you get again very fine weed look at how huge that is with the extra compartment on there it's pretty crazy so overall final thoughts in these three grinders this one I have worked in a head shop and I can tell you that a larger amount of people buy something like this than anything else they just want a really simple grinder that's compact and doesn't cost a lot of money and this works for a bunch of people I have always found these to get a little bit sticky and I found them to not cut as well once they get a little bit used up now this space case I really love I've had it for a long time it's very compact by the way all of these are two and a bit inches so they're the same size you can actually stack them right on top of another and fits perfectly but in any case this grinder is a really good one and it's only 60 bucks and it'll last you a lifetime especially if you clean it out occasionally using the method I showed off in the last episode now this I found that it was very feature heavy and there's a lot that you can do with it as I demonstrated the blade weakness thing as I said is its biggest problem I would buy this grinder if I was a an old lady or somebody with wrist problems or somebody who wanted their grinder to be some kind of big brand statement when they bring it out for myself a grinder just to Grindr and I did not like this twice as much as I like this so for myself I can't justify the price but I can see how some people would want something fancy like this and go for it I will link to all these different grinders in the video description and if you enjoyed this little comparison be sure to subscribe and hit that like button we'll see you next time

started [Music] the number one position is dominated by space case grinder titanium the space case is one of those heavyweight brands in the wheat grinder world a space case grinders will last you for 10 plus years without degrading in performance or any materials or coatings coming off like you get with so many cheaper grinders the build quality of space case grinders is unparalleled performance wise the weight grinder tears through the hardest snugs with minimal effort every time the wood grinder is our topic if you are looking for the easiest and most consistent grind first you do need to be grinding for a long time to get the same grind consistency with all of your harm second it's very easy to get the exact same grind consistently every time you grind it's also unquestionably the best grinder for catching keith the key of build up with this grinder after only 10 to 15 grinds is already so much you'll feel obliged to start using your kif don't you hate it you pull out your grinder see all the resin and dirt between the grinding teeth and quickly realize that you can't grind yet but need to clean first well with space case grinders cleaning isn't needed especially with the titanium space case grinders nothing sticks to this grinder and your horrible slide of the grinding teeth like soft butter slides off a knife although the grind of the space case grinder is finer than that of the santa cruz shredder if you are looking for a really fine grind for conduction vapes mostly you are going to have to go for a proper two-piece grinder for anything else and hundred percent conduction waves this four-pist space case grinder will be perfect and says the main reason why you will get a four-piece grinder is to catch kiev and this space case grinder catches keef like nobody's business it's our topic of all four-piece grinders if you want to know about the latest price of the space case grinder titanium check the description box moving on to the next at number two of santa cruz shredder the santa cruz shredder is also known as the medical grade with grinder and has quite the history and reputation of being one of the highest quality weight grinders you can get this has several reasons it has anodized threaded surface to prevent damage that usually occurs between two sliding metals which means you will always be safe from micro parts of aluminum polluting your harb a very easy grip and rotation doesn't require a strength to grind a street medical grade ultrasonic cleansing procedure straight when it comes out of the manufacturing process to remove any contaminants that get released during the manufacturing process it's extremely reliable durable and scratch resistant all these features make the santa cruz shredder the best pick for anyone that's obsessive about health or safety it's also the only grinder that really shreds your weight instead of grinding it what this means is that your heart will come out fluffy and with a certain amount of volume keeping most trichomes on your heart this fluffy grunt is great for pure convection vapes like the firefly 2 or wave xl cloud evo although a large 4-piece grinder usually means there's a lot of keef build up the santa cruz shredder does fall short in this area when you compare it to the 4-piece space case grinders it gets better its size is big enough to grind any amount of weight of any type with minimal effort i highly recommend santa cruz shredders and they're my favorite grinders because i mostly use convection vaporizers and like fluffy grinds in general if this is your desired product please check the links in the description below the number three position is held by sharpstone 2.0 sharpstone although not known as a top brand in the wood grinder world does produce very high quality wood grinders for a very affordable price but be careful there are a lot of inauthentic sharp stone grinders in circulation plus some sharp stone grinders seem to last longer than others however if you do get the real deal which is also good quality these grinders will last a long time so if you're looking for a very high quality wood grinder to catch a bunch of caves that's cheaper than the santa cruz and space case grinders check out the 4 piece grinders of sharpstone is this video making value to your search if yes please do like share and comment next at number four we have chromium crusher if you are looking for the cheapest four-piece grinder the chromium crusher is the cheapest you should go this grinder is cheap but offer good enough quality for most of you no it won't last 10 plus at five plus years without degrading in performance by two to three years if you treat it well it's made from high quality zinc aluminum alloy and is the heaviest grinders of all the grinders in the list it's incredibly sturdy though and can take a severe beating one thing that could be better with this grinder is the catching of key the key for screen is really fine so you barely will get any also there seem to be scratches and imperfections on the inside which could make you wonder about the safety of this grinder one last annoying thing which just doesn't happen as often as with the higher quality wood grinders as the following hard pieces can get stuck around the edges of the grinding chamber and over time this buildup results in an inconvenient cleaning session the grinder isn't perfect and does have some downsides but for its price you won't find anything better if you've already used any of these products do let us know through a comment it will help others to avoid the buy finally at number 5 of santa cruz shredder 2 or 3 piece medium size you already know why the santa cruz shredders are among our top picks medical grade materials and design extremely reliable and durable will last you 10 plus years without degrading in performance extremely easy to use gives a fluffy grind which is especially good for convection waves and i love it for blunts or joints too but the four piece santa cruz shredders are expensive luckily the three and two piece versions are much more affordable they just don't catch any key now this doesn't necessarily have to be a con for everyone and i don't need a keef catcher and i like two or three piece grinders since you can immediately brush out the key out of two piece grinders also they're just more compact and especially with the small two piece grinders you can get a very fine grind and if you grind upside down the space case two piece grinder does grind finer than the santa cruz shredder however no grinder is better if you're into fluffy grinds keeping a certain amount of volume and most of the trichomes on your arms like you would want with convection vapes i also like a fluffy grind for blunts and joints but the type of grind for blunts and joints is personal if you want a fluffy grinder one the safest grinder but donate to catch key the two or three piece santa cruz shredder is the grinder you should get that's all for today we upload amazon product review videos in every single day so don't forget to subscribe and hit the bell button for the upcoming video notifications",

been doing a review on the brilliant cut grinder I've never done a review on grinders I've only owned three grinders in my own Tsai existence of living my first one was Santa Cruz shredder I had a four-piece I loved that thing then I got me a SL X which I love that thing too specifically for the ceramic coating that kept all of the goodies off of the grinder and kept it from gunking up and now this I don't want my grinder this is the one I love the most why well one of the reason being they come with different grinding plates so you have this one which is the old to grind ultra fine one then you have this one which is the coarse grind as you can see brilliant cut grinder and then this one this is the more you know if you want some bigger chunks a lot of people like to vape bigger chunks because the bigger the chunk the better the taste I'm not saying that if you mince it up with the fine grinder you're not it's not gonna taste good because it will it's just that the bigger the pieces the more terpenes that comes out of that chunk like if you for instance if you put a nice piece of a bud like a point 20.3 you're not gonna get as much vapor out as out of motive apes without the bud being grinded up but you will get some vapor and the taste will be awesome and my the bigger one is in pink as you can see but um nothing no threading that's another thing I love about it super magnetized look at this this thing is a beast I don't know what kind of magnets they might be using neodyne IAM magnets but yes this thing is amazing one thing about this grinder that I love so much is that the ease of just grinding a lot of these grinders you put butter on them and it is so hard to growing like you have to act you have to put so much force with this one you barely need any force like literally need anything look like barely boom look at this literally twisting no problem no problem at all I am using the coarse grind plates as you can see I took out the other plate and put the coarse grind so coarse grind I'm gonna show you exactly how hard it is to do that in other grinders so I could've easily just made this one of those grind there versus grinder videos but I'm not I'm just showing you the ease of use from when I use the brilliant cut to this one the same pieces same type of size putting it in here it's not even twisting people look I am adding so much force and it's still not twisting as you can see him my hands are turning red I'm hiding mad force look still hasn't rounded up what kind of grinder you want that's gonna freakin meat you trying to talk it's just to grind it guys as you can see I'm twisting the top and the bottom and trying to get some type of good force and friction I can still can then it's ridiculous like this is no joke believers and gentlemen as you can see I'm twisting as hard as I can I can't I can't grind it for some reason weirdest aw I cannot grind it but the minute I stick this inside look it was grinding just a little bit well you can see as you can see it is not grinding at all ladies and gentlemen I was adding so much force twisting at and nothing still nothing this is exactly what I'm saying that's why I'm in love with my brilliant cut because I don't have that problem not even not even not even 2% of the time I don't have that problem not at all that's why I don't I don't I really don't know how they did that how they how they got it to where it just no matter how much bud you put in there it's still gonna grind but this on the other hand I don't understand it just doesn't grind I wish I had some type of meter that could test the force of how I was twisting it cuz I'm telling you skin how red my hands got I was twisting this [ __ ] hard a zone but nothing it still wasn't grinding it was just stuck stuck now almost show you exactly how easy it's going to be to do that here obviously you never want to put weed in the middle because it will not close and it will not grind at all then take it back out coarse grind plate but close it up look easy already twisting look with two fingers two fingers I'm twisting it I would break my fingers on the SLX trying to do this they won't even twist look at that two finger twisting I'm not even having a twist the bottom and the top like I was doing there and I still couldn't do this look two fingers no problem no problem I mean as you can see it gets no better than that why bye I loved my SLX I really did at one point and it just it was just too too much work trying to have to twist that damn grinder and and put all his force just to break up bud like you don't know how happy I am with this brilliant cut it wait into you guys have to try this for yourselves in order to realize what I'm talking about of how easy it is to twist that damn grinder no matter how much bud you put in it no matter how sticky the bud is no matter how dense the but is this grill brilliant cut grinder we'll cut the [ __ ] out of whatever you throw out of it I promise a selects I have not even I used to using my SLX every single day every single day the second I got the brilliant cut I promise you I have not used this not all not one bit I can't wait so they come up with a four piece this is my first three piece so obviously I don't have a bank for Keith this has the bank for Keith you know I mean but I love my grinder I'm sure if you guys got this you guys would love it too I know there's a lot of other grinders that everybody says is better you know there's a lot of top brands 60 70 $80 grinders I understand I never tried those but for those of you that love grinders and probably have those crazy ass different grinders I know I can't remember which ones exactly are out but there's a bunch of them out there that a lot of people are swearing by for those of you please get your hands on one of these and then you could tell me exactly what I mean how easy it is to use it's amazing remind you this is isn't the final product I think this gold will be a little bit more gold I'm not too sure you know they're going through different finishes with different companies as you can see this whole diamond thing I mean it's exactly like a diamond but for me I like to call this sacred geometry because that's exactly what it is if you really look at it it's almost like the Lotus I hope everybody had a good day hope everybody enjoyed this review

about the Piranha grinder I have a two and a half inch 4 piece grinder for you here ranges in price from about 35 to $40 she's not too bad for a grinder comes in a couple different colors comes in a black of blue a cyan a green a silver of red and a gray this is the light blue or the cyan color it's pretty lightweight which is nice the top is magnetic which is awesome so it's not going to come apart while it's upside down so if you do travel with it and you do have anything in there even just like some loose pollen at the bottom it's not going to come apart and get all over the place which is nice so I like that I do like full piranha on the front of it he's pretty cute so on the inside here we have a couple different compartments the first one is gonna be your standard grinder compartment it's going to have your teeth on the top and teeth on the bottom they are pretty small those teeth but they are very sharp so that I like it has some notches in here so it gives it a little more of some movement when you're grinding it has two different of hole sizes which I like as far as being able to get it broken up and it having you know good consistency for when you're rolling or if you put it into a vaporizer or you know into a bowl what-have-you so that I like like I said the magnetic is nice just kind of pops right back on there and even you know I have to give it some force to get it off so it's not just gonna come off anyway anywhere so that's good it's gonna have the next layer which is going to be your area for your catching it's gonna follow through these holes here different sizes which is nice like I said it has on the circular and then some of these more and long-dated oval shapes which are nice and it's gonna fall in here this is not very deep but it's nice I mean has enough room has a nice screen here and I'll go down to the bottom compartment which we'll get to in a second so this is nice it does have a lot of turns to get it to close which I'll get to next so on the bottom here this is where it's going to collect your pollen or your Keef this is really nice for those of you like me who like to save a little bit and you can add it to different things like putting in a joint or a bowl putting it in a blunt throughout it of putting it in layers and your vaporizer that's really nice to do so that's cool I like that it's not too deep so I'm going to be more inclined to use more of it quickly that I really like but I don't really like that it's not rounded on the inside here as you can see there is little corners it does come with this handy little tool which is nice you can see that there and it does have little sharp edges so it is gonna get in the corners here but I have a couple concerns about this little tool here my concerns about the tool is that do you leave the tool inside here and then it's going to get Keeffe or pollen all over it and then it's gonna get dirty not only is it gonna get dirty and you're gonna get all over your fingers but now you have it collected on this plastic piece which is going to be even harder to get off so that's a concern my other concern is if I put it somewhere where am I going to put it because I feel like this little piece in the land of stone or abroad is going to get lost those that I do not like it's great that they provide it for you but I feel like rounded edges on the inside would make a better improvement for this grinder as far as the turning aspect which I talked about a second ago that I was going to get back to you can see that there's a large gap here and it's because you have to turn it eight to nine times full turns Annarino turns in order to get it to close so that I feel like is pretty excessive I a couple grinders and I've used a number of grinders that have just a quarter turn and it's nice you want to close it pretty you know tightly to get it to lock but I feel like eight to nine is a lot and it's kind of annoying especially if you're wanting to be more on the go it's kind of tedious to keep opening it like that so that is my good in my bad about this one I think that it's you know tedious as far as the opening I feel like for the teeth they could be a little bit bigger but we should put something in here and see what we get so without further ado let's put some income in and everything obtains that we're going to use in all of my videos is going to be a product that I have obtained through my medical marijuana card I definitely believe in making sure that you are being legal and safe with your medicine so make sure that you are obtaining in a legal way so I'm going to put some in here and I'm gonna close the lid and I'm gonna do some grinding I always have a habit of tapping the top of it for some reason so here it is and it has not fully gone through it seems like something that's going to be an issue is that the center here where these two magnetic pieces stick you're gonna get stuff caught in there so that's going to become an issue after a while I didn't really get much to go through kind of tapping it through here to see you know what actually makes it through those little pieces here is just um stuck on the top I'm gonna put it back on and go for a second and that looks a little better there's still some stuck up in the top here I think you can see it in along the bottom so we're gonna open it up now and see what it caught for us a lot of turns so as you can see here it's nicely browned up it's still pretty fluffy so it didn't break it it's not like your typical using your hands or scissors which is definitely the older methods where it's not going to be as efficient because it's not getting consistently broken up so this does look nice it's not like using acrylic grinders where it just kind of shreds it this definitely makes it you know ground a lot fluffier which is nice and then it's going to collect the pollen here down on the bottom so that I really like as well as far as my personal opinion I think that it has some different sized holes on the bottom here so you can see that it's gonna give you a little bit of a variation which is kind of nice it's nice for when you're packing a bowl but not necessarily nice if you are packing it into a vaporizer or rolling into something you kind of want a little more consistent a little more broken up the other thing that I don't really like about it is that it takes so many turns to get it on and off and you have to feed it just right so you're looking at about eight to nine different tons I guess that's kind of a good thing since it's not really gonna fall apart and fall open like if you're traveling with it taking it somewhere but it's kind of a pain and it's because I feel like it's overkill three to four maybe but eight to nine is a lot it has the same thing on the bottom Fair which again is annoying it's a lot of just turning that's frustrating for 35 to 40 dollars retail this is a good entry-level grinder it's not too heavy I'm not concerned about dropping it and breaking it which is nice you have that issue with wood and acrylic grinders and definitely cheaper metal grinders so I kind of wish that it would have ground a little better just because there's some pieces just kind of hanging out here that should just gone through but overall I feel like it's you know a pretty good entry-level grinder so there you have it", "FrrPfX1Q3LI": "hi i'm rachel from evolution we are an austin-based family-owned company we've been here since 1969 keeping it weird today I'm here to tell you about one of our products this is the diamond grind it's an herb grinder our diamond grinds are made of solid rods of aircraft-grade aluminum the diamond grinds come in three different styles a two piece of four pieces of five piece and seven different sizes with multiple colors the diamond grinds are special to us they they are so special that we have a lifetime guarantee on all of our gone prawns so when you purchase your first one it's the last one you'll ever have to purchase when you open up the two-piece for the first time you'll notice that our diamond grinds have diamond shaped teeth it's where we get the name from they also have magnets on each side the magnets help hold them together and they're very strong so it's not going to fall apart the difference between the two piece and the four piece is the four piece has a screen and the screen is going to help collect your calling so when you open up your four piece and put your urban for the first time you'll want to twist the lid and when you twist the lid all of your herb is going to get ground F and push through these little holes in the top when you open up the second portion of the grinder you'll see that there is a really nice screen there it's going to grab all of your larger pieces of herb and the holes and the very base of the top here now all of the pollen is going to fall through that screen onto a tray that collects it below the tray also comes with a handy spatula to scrape it off as you've used it now the difference between the four piece and the five piece is that the five piece has a course screen the course screens going to give you a little more variation in your pollen and the larger piece is obviously on top and then Paul is gonna fall all the way through it also has a standard screen on it diamond grinds come with a nice handy carrying case that you put your diamond grind in to protect it in between every use diamond grinds when you've used them for a couple of months you'll notice that the screens might get dirty on you and you'll want to clean them so you're gonna take your diamond grinds apart pull your screen out and get some alcohol and q-tips dab the alcohol and q-tips onto the screen itself and if it doesn't get cleaned enough with that cleaning take this whole screen and dip it into alcohol and let it sit for a few minutes use the same q-tip dab it off you're good to go DOM and grinds are made to last that's why we give them the guarantee that we have we hope you'll love them and please come and visit us and subscribe to our Channel visit

don't know if at the date right today is June 2nd hope everybody had a happy Canada today I got a I was gonna do an unboxing but my landlord came and wanted to see it now I was spectin a grinder this big I paid almost $200 for it but it's a real Santa Cruz shredder and it's also not only a santa cruz shredder it's a Taylor Gang or Die Santa Cruz shredder so comparison yes it's smaller I wouldn't trade 50 of these 50 different size grinders 50 different grinders for one Santa Cruz shredder it's a four piece magnet saw is the grinder there's the screen in there and it came with it yeah the Santa Cruz shredder it looks like the tire pick but it's a crystal cleaner so put that back right where it came from so this is going to be a product review so I don't know how long it's going to be of a video we're going to smoke a joint and do a DAB in it but we're going to put some weed in it and just see just see my Terp sauce is gone rest in peace dead soldier this is gone no that's not gone I must have took the other one in that was gone okay other papers in other papers we get a rolling paper thing okay so we're gonna take some of this lovely baba kush and grind it up I'm gonna take some bigger than Uggs am I not going to use those yeah we use those Seabees place them around in there immediately magic going to work now this should all go right to the bottom bow a few spins it's all the bottom boom just like that I'm gonna have to give this a tenth of the tenant it looks perfect it works perfect grinds perfect smooth going back together it's got a magnetic top like this one here it's got a little bit of a magnet top but I'm gonna be retiring this one today to my little bro june/july li told him I would I'm ordering another one of them not right away it was all over to the cookie one in the winter I want to see if I can get a bigger one I'm gonna order the cookies one and see if I can get a bigger one this is above a kiss joint work perfect rolled perfect I got to give the santa cruz shredder by taylor gang shredder by Santa Cruz I'm gonna get that a 10 out of 10 for my product review smoke this joint will do a dad now we all will start doing more product reviews I'm gonna do a big bong versus little bong product review stay tuned for Bubba Coster interview later buddy mine said about what the [ __ ] cannabis he orders from it I said I tried that sign it's no good he's making a $2,000 order anyways all their stuff they sent it to you and it's quick but it's garbage their trips look like they're quads and trips look like double-a so I made it order yesterday to distillate 15 syringes 10 tips and 4 grams I bought four grams weed because she's gonna eventually she's asking now if I can get a deal did same deal I got last time on two pounds and I ordered these because I know I got my other order here so I'm gonna I got my other order here plus I got another order on the way but once this order here is gone I will definitely four of us we all chocking on pounds and we smoke the [ __ ] out of them we sharing with their friends you know what I mean so my next order I'm hoping to get either there's snoop something I don't know if it's Snoop dream or snoop watt but it's an indica dominant hybrid so Snoop something black tuna of course the Bubba cush again I'd buy but black to know there's a few of them God's green cracks and too expensive price range but God's being crack no balk tuna there's another one couple of them that I could get in the price range I want to try out the screen looks relatively big in this right big enough that when it gets full of crystal I'll be able to brush it down through for sure if it doesn't just follow through yeah this bubble Chris joint I'm going down that much of it look at the oil around it hey it's more THC pills I get a hundred milligram pills for two bucks my buddy makes them there's like 550 600 milligrams in the regular rounds if you go with the type of weed that I get it's probably more like 6 per 65 to 7 so say sick one of my ounces say 6500 one of their ounces say 5000 for 500 550 500 so there's an extra 100 milligrams to 200 150 to 200 milligrams in my ounces but still it means to get less capsules still five thousand six hundred and an ounce 100 milligrams so ten hundred milligram pills is that can't be right ten pills to a thousand maybe the like I'd make 50 milligram pills so then I get 20 per thousand so me 20 40 even getting 10 that'd be 50 pills 50 almost 60 pills 60 some pills per ounce I don't believe it's works like that I think my mass off because I'm thinking you should get at least a hundred thousand ounce under the between 75 to 100 milligrams and I believe he gets a thousand out of 100 grams a week I'm gonna make them myself this fall I'm gonna start watching videos around the middle of August have the end August and all September to find a good recipe way to find a good recipes Watts a bunch of different people do it write down how they do it and wait till you find a guy wait till you find a recipe that a few people do at the same because when I was looking up making shadow there's hundreds of videos so just watch them all and if you see right down each one some cool [ __ ] right see how the other people's do it right every person stuff down then when you go to make and to doing it you can say okay seven people did it this way there's work good if people don't make very good product don't use theirs right so making the THC pills it should all be some water method I'm gonna invest in the THC test or two they're quite expensive but it's worth it because you should be able to test concentrates and flour I'm getting begging to make and concentrate first thing I'm buying when I find one is a purge of it I'm not gonna buy 250 on the pots I'm gonna spend double that I got a month to look roughly a little over a month to look I'm gonna cost these hydroponics I'm gonna call the grow up shop I'm gonna say look I don't need nothin fancy something the size of a microwave or something that has like three or four two to four racks I'd like to have had three or four but if it already had three it'd be perfect right once at least have three because starting off I'll probably just doing one and I know how to make wax now I was letting it boil the water rate till there's no alcohol left and scraping it out that's not the way to do what if you got especially if you got a purge thing best way to do it is leave it just enough butane where you can move it all around then you dump it out on your parchment paper and you put that in your [ __ ] purge on them or a purge pot and all that will purge out pus hold for tired purge pot though you usually get a cookie and it's like this I don't want that I want it to be a slab so that's something I'll be for buying in August between all you know you know I'm just so I'll start looking in the next couple weeks because it will be something wrong in the August I'll be blocked or not some ways around the end of August I'll be blind the purge skit the Kurds vacuum Kurds to me it's worth its weight in gold I'm gonna get a couple bigger I got a couple honey a couple uh what's in the columns over there honeybees I'm gonna get two more just like them and then I'm gonna get a couple of the glass ones that are bigger matter of fact I should probably get to more of each and then get a couple bigger ones one that will hold 100 grams one the old a half a pound they're glass they come with plants so I'll be making - chatter I want to make live resin and stuff but that's too far ahead for me it would cost way too much to get all the gear once I get my shed next spring you know I'm gonna have a license to grow so I'm going to end this stone this show until my joints almost done I'm big just [ __ ] God love [ __ ] bow because I'm gonna eventually do some breed I'm thinking about it bubba kush Girl Scout cookies pre nani bubba kush Gorilla Glue no G something like that bah-bah Oh Jean gorilla glue or just gorilla glue no G in bubba kush and girls go and then breed the Bubba cookies in the gorilla og together I have to have my own place to do that and here is a good spot I'm looking to move even if I had to pay Oh within come onto the internet bill and the phone bill [ __ ] even if I had I need a move reason why I haven't set up a studio for you guys this because my apartments right now my friend moved out left all his junk in the bedroom my beds in the living room because I grew my four plan sitting there to put outside well I grew a few and then put them a couple different places but the point is it's just it leaked the other day plus it's just old most of plugins or sunk in the wall I gotta get out of here I've never been happy so I just sit on the couch here all day long I'm gonna go do things that come back sit here so it's not that I don't want to make it cool I'm buying a Wiz Khalifa [ __ ] three by five feet three feet by five feet you know I want to use this I want to use it to make my own little man cave there's a few things gonna be moved around in here I'm taking the couple lights and I got stored in that room out of it I'm gonna end up putting my bed back in that room in one corner and then I'm gonna plastic one corner and use it for a mom and then when I'm done I'm just gonna get a grow tent for that room and grow my foreplay it's legally right but for right now I need the bedroom back for the space out here to live here till I can move I'll be doing that all this week so hopefully in a week or two I'm not gonna happen I was Khalifa like even if I do I probably will hang up but I'm gonna make a corner in there with a little desk stuff like that be Chris you know Krista EV studio I'm gonna make a better woman remove I would just use my half of the bedroom for it we move so what else can I tell you right quick there's lots of sites out there that won't you didn't want their business and all this I went through about 15 sites in the last three months spending a hundred and fifty two hundred dollars per site so I work off and on for cash and when I do if I go work three four hours I make 80 90 hundred bucks for four hours if I work eight hours I make $200 that's why I'm in working cash I helped my friend footfalls in so I wasted a lot of money a lot of it I gave away smoke like a quarter of it give it away like there's even this from my good site they have I got Rockstar honeycomb crystals I don't know if they got it mixed up it looked to me that it would come in little crystal chunks it wasn't it was all like old school honey knows what it tastes like and I gave that right away but I mean it would be so good a few guys would listen to me okay I'm gonna tell you something right now okay smoking weed I know it's expensive as it is okay I paid $35 each so $70 for two grams of diamonds oh gee crusher watermelon skittles okay I got them they didn't look nothing special they didn't and I smoked both of them in six days and I smoke monster by myself okay now just for showing ya now I go out found a new site tried three things liked it bought some more bought some more now I got quite a few things and then I can dab different stuff and it'll ask me like if I like if whatever I spent on this stuff yeah it's quite a bit but in the upside it will ask me probably 3/4 of months like this 7 grams of Terp sauce me basically just smoking that lost at me two and a half weeks two weeks a so 264 two weeks it's 130 a week I didn't smoke no weed no not just that for two weeks I bought this two weeks ago yes I have other stuff but that's the beauty but the point is I had this when I first got this I bought this with a weed order there I bought this and my uncle wanted two grams of live resin and I got this I paid $70 for it so all I had for concentrates to smoke for two for a week was this than a week after like then after the week I got more concentrates to smoke myself but so a week smoking it by itself now I just said I smoked in six days them two grams of diamonds well this gramma bubba kush diamonds i smoked just this for a week and then i've been dabbing on it ever since and i'm going to show you there's probably half a grin there so I smoked about half a gram is 0.5 I smoked about 0.35 in a week with a few joints here and there but usually I smoked with them few joints I smoked a few joints here in there and in six days I killed them two grams of diamonds I had to do big hoots right and the this it's just on you so I paid $70 for this and it's worth it I went and bought another one Wi-Fi ROG I've been taking that one down to my buddies and we've been smoking it and I still got half a gram life had that for about a week and there's nothing like three for smoking it plus if a friend stop seeing they smoke it right so I'm gonna show you I don't normally do this Canha wholesalers c-a-n-n-a wh o l es a l e RS canna wholesalers that's thought when you punch that in it will come up but see there dot C over CA or something well when you type into Google can the wholesalers as you're typing wholesalers it will pop up or even if you per soon as you type canna might pop up can of wholesalers remember ers on the end can the wholesaler is the ers and then should be dossier or CEO or dot IO but it will come up and you can just click on it and the symbol like I said the symbols that the green like that it it it you take ed enter it you know I don't sell but for people who out there who sell it is fair price you'd have to charge $50 a gram for this like the live resonant herb sauce and stuff like that there's another one called bulk we in a box that's a good one for concentrate to do they have diamonds for fifty and stuff I just didn't find them I just didn't try them yet I'm about to so that should be another one bulk wheat in a box but I've never tried it so I can't recommend that I've used it but I'm about to try no just because they good deals on half ounces or stuff if you buy so many you get a better deal la blah blah and that's something them into because me and my uncles like buying half anti founds half ounce half ounce half ounce there's five of us even if we bought six to get a deal I think it's five or six then you get a discount then we can all just share it and then we'll have that for a week we smoke it all medicinally so we smoke a lot of it so point is if you just personally smoke conscience which most people do canta wholesalers man and I'll tell you if you see that girl scope it's called GSC Terp sauce bye I've already bought in at four times what's that tell you right Cookie Monster live resin wicket wedding cake shatter wicket can of wholesales I'm gonna try to get that tell let me be a you to sponsor so piece I'm gonna try to light my concentrate source that it won't take no new patients I'm gonna ask him to as long as anybody says there were Chris tabs there his fans maybe they'll take you she said that there got the new warehouse is just about done they're about to have a lot more products in and I know that would take away from me but even if she took 10 or 15 people from my site because I see a lot of my videos right off the hop get 14 15 views so I'll say take 20 of my people anyone that says when they message yeah Chris staff said to go there because you know what I mean I can't say who's who but all I know is message me and let me know if you're a frequent watcher message me and I'll try to get your name at it how about that so anybody who wants to get a good concentrate site they sell weed to fair prices so if you want that message to me tell me what you think of my channel and I'll see what I can do it will get me and tell me how much you watch it well peace out remember this review is strictly mostly about Santa Cruz shredder I'm not gonna say a lot because you go watch be real TV you go watch anybody all use Santacruz shredders Taylor Gang puts

Coast help again today I am reviewing I'm not even reviewing just bullshitting about some grinders that I've had in my time we got a cosmic one down on the bottom that's a four chamber with the screen big ass chamber was this one this is the chromium crusher and a sharp stone my sharp stone recently broke and I'll show how it's gonna hit let's go in then sorry for the dirty ash catch of water honest thing all night all day actually alright so first let's get this over here why we got the sharp stone first now this is a good grinder it's got the four chamber you know it twists off right here get the kief there's still some in there that I have to salvage and then similar to the cosmic one I have and you twist off here as well you got the screen little chamber and then this little tiny teeth you could tell a few of them snapped off in there on me I think one of the top ones did - no just these two of these one snapped off what broke on this gardener was I was being a dumbass and well they're being a dumbass when this part right here I guess I definitely put way too much weed in this little thing and this thing is supposed to be attached to the back but you could see it just spins so when the blood is in there and they're grinding it's just spinning this might grind in anything so I mean tough cookies on that one the chromium crusher here we have now the screen is right under the grinding part so I mean the teeth are great when I use this thing it really chops up the bud but I wish I got the four chamber because this one the only other chamber here is the Keith catcher and the screen is up there but as you can tell when you look and it's a [ __ ] to screw this [ __ ] thing and like I said before when you look at the teeth like where the teeth are those little holes up here on the outside and inside the teeth are supposed to be where they keep fall through the screen but you could just see it builds up I mean it's a good rind and nonetheless [ __ ] with it this bad boy this thing this thing is ridiculous this is I just bought this thing yeah about the size of a lighter they're about the size of a lighter there and this thing you could probably you could kill somebody with this thing if you whip it the teeth are just strong magnetic strong magnet there the teeth are nasty they're similar to the design of the chromium crusher the holes are bigger too so I mean it's not like your buddy's getting chopped up the chamber now to hold this in is deep deep as a [ __ ] so it's really this is definitely an efficient grinder because I like to grind less smoke more as opposed to and look it already got some Keef going in on there I only grind at once so I mean I'm gonna be in love with his bad-boy I could tell this is gonna be definitely my favorite favorite diner but that's my grind and review there I mean that this is a cosmic the cosmic is my number one pick a number two pick simply just because it has this screen on a separate piece is the sharp stone but if I had a if I had the extra rigged-up chromium crusher I would definitely [ __ ] with that one and I probably wouldn't have gotten the cosmic but only because this one broke I'd like to save my save my pollen so that's why I went with the cosmic okay also I'll be dropping videos of scraping keep out of these and I'll be introducing one of the video with my first shake box I don't know if you guys seen this this is my baby right here it looks like a box fits in a shoebox easy to hide from parents kind of keep the smell in it slides out okay you can see there's little lips they're little magnets on each end just like that symmetrical over here inside is a silkscreen where all your bud I grind up my bud throw the throw it in the silkscreen here put the top on just like this slide it right in my cat's getting up in this so you just put it in slide it on in and then you just shake it it has it scrapes around on the screen you get this mirror which is full pollen once again so I'll be posting videos and me scraping these out I'll be posting videos of me scraping the grinders out so I mean I'll be reviewing some other stuff also I got I got a request to review train wreck in Northern Lights you could find me a dispensary near San Diego that has those I'll definitely be more than glad to pick them up and test them out I mean it's hard to do but it's hard to do strands I mean I really only go through one dispensary I dig their customer support so I really get whatever their menu is looking so I mean it's gonna be hard for me to do strand reviews if you see strands that I have posted pictures of I'm more than likely be happy if you jump on it right away when I still have a little bit of each I'd be happy to sit down and actually do a full review

then sounds terrible but we'll go piece by piece starting from the top so here have the lid or the top grinding piece and the teeth always very here's the middle piece the bottom grinding piece we'll get that to focus a little bit more can we get some focus up in this piece right here all right so then normally it'll come with a piece of mesh right here for the kief and here's the bottom piece or the kief collector almost really it for the 3 case now here is the piece and we'll go through it piece by piece now all grinders are different so mine's not like yours oh well but starting from the top down have the top grinding piece or the lid there's the magnet here's the second piece with the bottom grinding piece here we have the mesh for the kief and then Nicola help the cube go down stuff like that and here we have the bottom piece which you may not be able to tell right now but it's covered in keep all that covered but it's got some Keef on there that's where the Keef goes down to so which one do you prefer go ahead tell me down in the comments tell me ways I could make these videos better but if you like this video hit that like button guess I'm going to say drop it in the comments if you're new I'm going to hit that subscribe button and as always I'll see you guys next time peace", "nskNlWPhuu8": "welcome in this video I decided to look at a few options that we have for grinding our herbs so before you put it in your vaporizer you know you don't want to take just one big giant full nug like this and stick it in your packs too that's not the best way to do it you want to grind it up and there are many different kinds of grinders available and they'll give you many different kinds of grinds the very first one that I started with is the absolute finest grind from any grinder that I have used and it's the Magic Flight Launch Box finishing grinder so this is it's a little grinder and it's more like a grater it's a flat surface with holes in it and you rub the herbs over the holes using the top of the grinder that gave me the absolute finest grind it was like almost like almost powdered when I was done grinding it and when I put it in the PAX 2 I put the little pax sandwich the pack pax pusher on top and vaped it and that gave me immediate clouds immediate vapor even on the first hit I got about two or three great hits out of about half of a pax Bowl maybe a little less than half and I would say out of all four the results were the best from the finest grind but there's a lot of work a lot more work than the next sized grinder which is just it can be any grinder for the most part I have the Jumbo Santa Cruz redder than I used I liked it cuz it's about the size of my fist so I can just stick my hand in there when I'm scooping out my herbs it ground the herbs a lot a lot more coarsely than the Magic Flight finishing grinder but still did a great job when vaping it I did notice when I was done that the colors were not as even as they were when when I was done with the the bowl from the Magic Flight finishing grinder so this did give me a little bit less even of a vape but it was a lot less work and you can grind up a lot more at once and it doesn't require as much maintenance on the side of the grinder so I think that that is completely fine the next thing I did is I grabbed a Pierre pair appear I grabbed a pair of sheers scissors and I just I just scissored him up I just sliced it up with a pair of scissors it wasn't fun and it was a kind of sticky bud so it was all over the scissors I don't want to do that again I don't recommend doing it if you think that that's the easiest solution now you should really try to get a grinder you can you can get some pretty inexpensive ones I don't recommend you know your gas station variety grinder because you get like metal shavings in your herbs and stuff you don't want that but scissors was a big pain in the butt I did not like using the scissors at all and you know I especially didn't want to cut myself while doing this and lastly lastly I use my fingers I just you know clamp clamp clamp with my fingers right on top of these herbs and just pulling them apart and number one my fingers are really sticky afterwards number two my fingers smelled great afterwards number three that's not fun and I don't want to do that and it's you're not really you're all you're doing is you're ripping one big piece into a few other big pieces that are still too big for for these purposes ultimately I found that with the scissors and the fingers the grind was about the same now this is using some real sticky potent bud this isn't using your dry crumbles when you look at it bud that might work great just crumble it up before you vape it but for good sticky big buds use a grinder please do yourself a favor your hands won't smell is great but this was a pain in the butt the vape was much less even there were definitely much darker spots on both of these because you know it kind of squishes one big piece against the side and then there are little air pockets and yeah yeah and then lastly on a whim I took one small nug about half the size of the packs to chamber put it in there and then put the little pusher on top made sure to squish the heck out of that nug and then vape that and the results were not too bad to be honest I think they were even better than using fingers or scissors I couldn't tell you why the results were not too bad maybe it's because I did a great job squishing it down with that pusher maybe that pusher is what really makes the difference I don't recommend doing that even though there was a results weren't bad it's a bad habit to get into other vapes may not treat a whole nug so well and and you won't get all of your you know all of your active ingredients out of it so in short if you want the best possible grind I would start with a large grinder like this not jumbo size but just like our Santa Cruz shredder you can get the medium sized one I don't even recommend the small because it's kind of hard to get a grip on it when you're turning you want to be able to get a nice grip and then after you've ground that then transfer it over into the Magic Flight finishing grinder that way you always have the option of using the finishing grinder but having another grinder around is real helpful because when you're putting a whole buds in here or even stuff you've ripped off by hand this finishing grinder is such a pain in the butt it really is so Santa Cruz shredder or comparable all the way and then if you want that little extra ohm it's definitely worthwhile to invest in one of these scissors fingers whole buds the results weren't terrible but I don't recommend it you know you want to get the best experience so don't don't skimp don't skimp all of this was vaped at the third temperature setting in the packs - I didn't use it through water using my little water pipe adapter here and and the taste on all of them you know it was the same same bud that provided for each one was stupendous I mean the taste on all of them was was good to start then as we got towards the end of the session of course it got a little toasty ER being a convection vaporizer Magic Flight I think just one tiny itty-bitty notch above the rest but it may not be worth the extra hassle thank you guys very much for watching this whole

crews shredded that I got it costs around I was a thirty seven dollars thirty eight dollars I'm like that my local smoke shop it's the it's a two piece obviously the large size it's 100% aluminum its high quality you can feel it in your hand it's it's solid and just overall very well made so yeah I can have the two piece and these things are quite sharp I don't know if you can really see but these little metal pieces here do trim your weed very easily and it is magnetized so knows you can't smell it when it's closed which is the cool thing you really cannot smell what's left in here but yeah I love this thing super high quality very impressed compared to plastic plastic grinders again they those tend to smell very but I've compared to this they're not sealed and this creates such a tight seal that you really cannot smell what you have so if you do want to have a grinder on you that's that's pretty much snow proof and very good quality I would definitely recommend you get one of these

the first step is to grind up your cannabis and fill up the palm box with the ground material after you have filled up the pollen box shake for about 30 to 60 seconds then remove the base and scrape up your Keef you can shake the box again if wanted or at a coin to increase the yield but you will lose some quality and that's what you need to do to meet Keef with the poem box you", "bTr84fW7PVc": "hi this is Bogart and today we're going to be reviewing the Space Case two piece titanium coated space grade aluminum grinder this is the medium size with the 2.5 inch diameter with 1 inch depth the Space Case is very lightweight and the teeth are machined well if there are very sharp teeth and they're very durable teeth so when you're gonna grind up your marijuana just make sure that you've removed any stems or seeds or whatever you have put it in there pretty well put the top on close it down and the teeth being very sharp you are gonna have a smooth operation of being it you don't need to grind it many times before it actually grinds it to a smooth consistency it's easy to empty and it fine grinds all of your buds so our overall review of the Space Case grinder is it is a really great grinder it is actually made in the USA it has a lifetime warranty this is the medium sized grinder and this one was purchased for around $25 they do range in price for the smaller ones on down up to the $80 price range for the larger four-piece grinder now this grinder we've had other people tell us that they were very happy with their space case grinders and we'll continue to get back to you guys as we continue to use the space crease finder and let you know if there's anything that happens too in the future is a up front you know it's really great grinder the first 5-10 times we've used it already we've been grinding it for uses and vaporizers and we've been pretty happy with the way it's ground up to marijuana very well so you guys make sure you click the like button leave us

it's having no trouble so again to open it up all we have to do is line up the edges just like I did there and let's see hey there everyone and welcome to today's episode of Canadian cannabis for today I have a super special episode because I thought it'd be a really cool idea to start reviewing some grinders see exactly what people have to offer if they're doing anything different and to see if these grinders are actually worth your time and money so my great friends that speak easy innovations sent me this awesome little pocket tumbler to check out this beautiful little 2-piece grinder so let's do that right now take her on out here and the first huge difference I see something that I've never seen in any other grinder is gonna be right here you see these two little nubs that line up the reason why you want those two to line up is so you could open your grinder otherwise if the two little nubs don't line up it doesn't open look at that so there's no more need for threads awful threads that don't catch that you have to clean all the time someone knowing having a closed and open your grinder with those dirty threads but that is no longer a problem with this pocket tumbler absolutely awesome I don't even know how annoying that was till I didn't have to have that problem anymore and it is so much nicer to just open and close it like that with no problems just amazing so now that we have it open and you see that there are no threads anywhere let's see the second huge innovation of this two-piece pocket tumbler let's look inside real quick and hopefully you could notice the difference just look at that only half of the grinder actually has little cutting serrated nubs on it as you can see the bottom half here is completely empty well the top here has these super sharp serrated knives absolutely amazing so the reason for that is the bottom half is going to be your crush free loading zone so you could take all of your flour here dump it in the bottom and close the grinder without destroying your cannabis puts it everything in that place and when you're ready you start turning so second innovation is going to be that only half the grinder has these awesome little serrated blades now the third innovation for this grinder amazing they were able to do three things different the the serrated blades are all going to be different heights so these one right here at the middle are gonna be the shortest ones and then you're gonna have a bit taller right here and then right at the end you're gonna have the tallest ones now they all have about the same design super sharp flat serrated edges to cut your cannabis instead of squishing and crushing it absolutely awesome now the same thing on the top you're gonna have the bottom with absolutely nothing then you're gonna have three different heights of blades all of them super sharp super flat ready to cut your cannabis up just amazing so I figure let's stop talking about this beautiful pocket tumbler let's see exactly how it works so all we have to do here is take our cannabis I'm even going to leave the stems in so we can get a real real look at how it works exactly so put our cannabis here in that beautiful beautiful crush free zone now all I'm gonna do is look for the little nub weight there it is line up the nubs put it on down now once I'm down all I have to do is start turning these that's great it feels like there's nothing in there that is super weird I don't know how many times I have to turn to be honest with you so I'm gonna give it a few turns here I know I have to turn it all the way because only half of it actually has serrated blades on it so I'm going to turn it a few times here I think that should be enough again a really not sure but felt like butter the entire time like it's having no trouble so again to open it up all we have to do is line up the edges just like I did there and let's see wow wow that actually worked like butter just amazing I didn't even think it worked it just went so easy was gliding like nothing I really didn't think it would grind I thought I did something wrong but this is absolutely amazing even without a third place a third chamber for all the cannabis to fall down it still didn't over grind this is absolutely perfect and because all the blades are different heights all of this seems to be different sized little nubs now everything's going to be about the size of a grain of rice but then I have some that are half a grain of rice some that are two grains of rice everything perfectly perfectly ground but a nice uneven ground that should make for a beautiful burn so not only does it grind absolutely perfectly but it went so easily absolutely just no no work in that risks whatsoever I mean I don't think I'm not even I don't think I know I know I've never come across a grinder that worked this well I feel like this is the only grinder that actually cuts the cannabis everything else seems to be squishing it and you have to work hard to break the cannabis and rip it apart this one isn't breaking it isn't ripping it isn't tearing the parklet tumbler actually cuts it and cuts it with such ease it is amazing I can't tell you how stoked I am on this not only do I not have threads anymore not only do I have an awesome little crush free zone to put my cannabis in but it actually cuts my cannabis instead of crushing it and ripping it and breaking all those trichome heads this one actually keeps them intact and so easy to grind I have no complaints my only negative is I wish I had this years ago cuz man does it make life easy this was some super sticky fresh cannabis and still ground like butter what else could you ask for super excited that this was my first grinder video because it is absolutely awesome and definitely going to be a hard one to be so huge shoutout to my great friends that speak easy innovations for their beautiful two-piece pocket tumbler I'm definitely definitely gonna start using this one on my daily routine so that's been this week's episode of Canadian cannabis grinder review I hope you enjoyed it hope to see you next week and as always peace and love

lovely pile of just great smoke thanks everybody for watching my videos much love have a great Sunday thank you [Music]", "u0RBC0EDWGM": "hey guys thanks for stopping by in this video i want to show you my honest review and i hope i will be able to highlight all the pros and cons of this product so let's begin that will grind pretty much anything at ease and will cut down on prep time don't let the affordable price fool you this grinder is made of maximum strength aircraft grade aluminum for extra toughness durability and best quality it has powerful neodymium magnets which means you will have an amazing closure freshness and odor control and it also has a thin poly o-ring for smooth grinding and less friction just in case you will need it in the future your package includes spare parts of one o-ring one cotton three wicks three flints and one pollen catcher more wick can be purchased in art and craft shops or online the backup permanent match is easy to use all you have to do is fill the grinder with lighter fluid dip the match inside then scrape it against the ferro magnesium rod to create a flame there is an adjustment period at first strikes so use it more to learn how to create a spark with each strike you can replace the wick by removing the flint striker with pliers fold a new wick on the flint insert don't wait another minute act right now spots are limited and judging by the amount of traffic that we're getting as we speak i think tomorrow you'll see a big sold out message on our page", "Abs6FpzacB4": "good day ladies and germs today I want to show you how to use an herb grinder or spice grinder know you know what type of grinder it is basically it comes in a couple of different sections here comes with the roof take it off and it has a magnet inside see that white piece in the middle that's the magnet now what you want to do is take your just break it up - ever so casually and put it in the top and you'll see these little teeth there these little very sharp teeth are all angled and they're in this middle this golden part here that you see and it's also on the red part the top see these little pieces right there all these little sharp angled edges and they come in this too so when you put this on top as the magnet is as I said now you want to start crushing it and when you do that you also want to turn this red top at the same time it freely move freely moves so you can turn left right both and when I take off the top there shouldn't be hardly any product left and you'll see it has gone from the gold part to the green part and I'll show you now see most of it's gone and where'd it go twist it off ah there's the beauty and there's the herb now comes the good stuff the Keef whereas the Keef come from the black part at the end very black bottom in fact I'm going to pour this out right here just I could show you the screen inside is a screen and underneath there guess what collects the Keef let's take off this green part look at the Keef oh it's nice Gooden to stuff look at that and that's yummy a McGee let's light it up a little bit here can't soot can you see it well no let's get a flashlight how about that yeah that's not gonna flash light but you can see it that's the forget you go on pretty damn good so that's it guys I hope you enjoyed and smoke one for me okay toodaloo hey guys I just wanted one more thing closer look the teeth on the red part and the gold part you could see they're very misshapen those are metal teeth they're very sharp very angled on there to put the urban the gold one put the right on top and start turning you'll see there's magnet in the middle on the red a magnet in the middle on the gold that's gonna connect with each other so make sure there's no herb or spice blocking that area and once you start turning the red top all that will fall through these holes in here there's a bunch of holes in the gold thing and I'll go on to the green part the green part has a green part has a screen on it screen will screen all the extra herb out and then what goes through that it's called the kief the kief will wind up on the black part that's the bottom right there and that stuff will get you pretty high compared to the stuff above it and compared to stuff love that whatever you got the ideas guys so there you go enjoy I have a great night take everybody", "HpZirHZmuHk": "all right everyone how we doing if you're like me you're always buying grinders you know so today we got the on demote her palain king of grinders over here the light wants to work pretty nice color and all I had I had a grinder work that we're trying everything and then one day all of a sudden it just disappeared I left you with this shitty three chamber one you know this one's pretty good for like if you're rollin blunts with these sort of teeth cutting leaves it a little more thick but I needed one of these you know you could really see the very sharp edges on this one I don't like how it has the thick star piece in the middle I often find that bud will always get trapped on that magnet and this magnet and you know in the long term kind of ruin the grinder and the functionality of it but the four chambers yeah I don't like about it is this piece right here you got the top middle pretty a big bowl there and then there's this so at first I was all excited cuz if you could see the depth on this you know it's pretty deep oh it says about an inch and a half but it literally comes out like it doesn't screw in doesn't it falls out not really sure what that's about like I'm not sure if I'm a fan of that because you know if this is loose you know Keef and and stuff will just build up and it will always be shaking around I mean I'm sure it's enough build up this could probably just sit in pretty well but you know it's kind of noticeable if we even when you have the the grinder closed you know you can still hear it but on the bright side you know despite all that what came with this little keep chamber here was actually pretty neat I've never seen one of these before and I don't know if you know that's my fault or not but like obviously we've all seen you know these sorts of keep scrapers you know a little like shovel but I've never seen like a scooped out guitar pick like you could see the the curvature on that like it's pretty cool it's even branded with the on damata name and I mean I never really heard anything about this company I tried looking up reviews on this grinder and before I bought it and I saw nothing but I'm pretty happy with the purchase you know like this this isn't that big of a deal like it's not gonna make or break anything it's just you know like it's not like we're throwing our grinders around the room you know so yeah let's get some button here we round it up got a little bit of gelato today nice nug [Music] I always like to you know break it up a little bit before I put it in so it doesn't give you too much resistance get that stem out of here all right let's see if we can do it all right you got one more easily grind it up still hear that shaking though all right let's see what that did for us Wow it's pretty full like you could see how full that is you know I do like the depth I mean I guess you could just take that out too so that that's actually pretty cool now that I'm thinking about this way because if you ever just want to easily put Keef on top of your bomb pack or bull rip whatever you want to call it it's not a bad idea I actually kind of almost like the removability of it now but see there's always pros and cons to everything you know I would I would definitely suggest this this as a purchase it was I believe $13 so super cheap for a grinder you know usually the super cheap ones they don't really last too long so I mean we'll see what this has in store for us but I mean overall I would say this is a [ __ ] great buy for 13 bucks you really can't beat that hmm as sort of like a 1 by trading one grind everybody knows the rules I'd give it an eighth of functionality because you know discovering the good part about removing this is awesome for when I'm gonna have Keith and I like look how fat that is this thing looks like a [ __ ] cupcake but yeah and all in all that is the on D'Amato grinder review hope you liked it", "qILN_n7C6NM": "all right good morning welcome to uh baby lungs McGee finally the name for the channel so without any further ado we'll get into today's review where you're going to be doing the grab pocket grinder today it's only a three piece dude nothing crazy about it on the outside if anything this looks like one of those now maybe some kind of fancy ear pod holder or something so if you want to throw this in your purse your backpack and go incognita you probably took with this one so things to notice on the inside so all of this and here's machined the rest of the grinder appears to be cast not that that's a bad thing but just keep that in mind there's a little bit more of a porous surface like I was talking about not so much porous as there is just see if you can see that all of this texture and all of this texture is going to hold onto trichomes is basically what you need to be concerned with but I will say overall this is one of my favorite grinders because it's small it's simple whereas I love the raw grinders for the fact that I can you know take everything apart and completely sanitized that I love my graph for the opposite reason and that it's small but it is well-designed so you know - excuse me have some allergies here but what we're going to be looking at is the differences between this and a couple of other I'd say big-name grinders but one of the things I really like about them is that they have this pocket in here are some grinders like the raw have basically a basin and you have to make sure that you don't pack your weed outside of this row of teeth otherwise it'll get smashed and forced up inside here and turn it to grinder - but that's easy you just pack the center this one has three big generous pockets for putting your actual weed in there and not only that but they do have the the circular drop through holes but they are spaced right along the outside right in the path of where this guy's gonna be and so what that does is that combines - when this comes by it actually sweeps stuff off from along the wall and pushes it towards these holes and the other thing that I like is so this does have the full-body anodization like I was talking about on the raw grinder and this is worth noting because it's very small you probably can't see it on the calendar but I'm starting to get where on the edges all these corners of all of these teeth to include several on the lid because I have used this regularly as you can see this one's dirty - but have I noticed any weird metallic taste when I'm smoking now you know you're probably not gonna notice anything but eventually these are going to start turning aluminum color as the anodization wears off and that's like I was talking about I kind of wish that they would find a way to just and eyes the body at the end of the day not a huge deal but something I would like to see is just not eventually winding up with wear marks in here another interesting thing they've done is if you look behind these six exterior teeth here there's not actually the body doesn't ride along the entire inside of the lid there's only six points of contact raised god maybe a half of a millimeter but it's just enough so that it glides on these six contact patches instead of writing on the whole top which is nice because that's going to cut down on Grindr hash that you're gonna make up here you can see at the top of this is pretty damn clean so I like this this finger goes together easily very smooth no problems turning and another thing like this is that whereas the raw has like a decent size this is a deep deep Bowl you could probably grind it's a quarter of an ounce in this thing I think I have the floor I got bored and start regrinding on my wheels I'm pretty sure that this is a able hold probably a quarter before you have to put it somewhere else also big pluses on this one is it is well made so it's got that little bit of surface texture but it is very easy to clean it's well made it's solid it doesn't rattle it's just simple it just works so let's see throw some more forbidden fruit in here so I gotta finish this one first but you know it's always time to prepare for later you know all right so as you can see you like it like I said I don't have to smash this thing here it's pretty nice the top does get a little weeble wobble Union when you first try and put it on especially if you do do it the way that I do which is not smash it directly in and just lift the teeth cut through as you just apply more pressure on the top until it's fully seated like this but I mean I only took a couple of turns for it to loosen up the problem I do have with this grinders if you do put too much in you can see where it does get kind of stuck to the front of these little these little teeth and that happens on both sides so all you have to do is just pop the lid off give it a shake and keep twisting again this can be mitigated by just not putting you a whole bunch in at a time but I want to show you what you do what happens when you kind of overload this thing and it's not the end of the world like look at that repositioned once I guess I drop some but for the most part everything goes down to the bottom because they designed the hole placement really well along with these teeth to actually wipe things toward the center towards the bigger holes so I will give them kudos for that also grab is where at least they're glass pieces are made in America in Austin Texas big fan of their stuff they really care about customer service again they're not sponsoring me obviously this is my second video but um just really high quality stuff I've got a sitter Sherlock and a small wide base bong from them and I'll be reviewing those at some point but very high quality pieces high quality company at least for the glass american-made and running ding if you don't counter a bunch of resistance they have these really nice notches on the side here need a really rip on too and give her what fur and then you know as we come in here see these pieces or you can see up to all the trichomes that came off sorry only move this under the camera but I mean you see everything is is shredded down to a nice size everything's consistent everything's nice and fluffy and yeah the smokes really nicely so if you're looking for a simple grinder for your pocketed backpack for on-the-go or even just at home I highly recommend the grab three piece here again if you have any questions i've been baby boys I guess so yeah if you guys have any questions or comments throw them down in the comments and let me know what I can do for you guys

video was in order for this since it was a rather expensive item i bought one of the most expensive grinders on the market why because i have oh because i have arthritis and i don't like my little grinder i've been using much it works well i've been using a plant cellulose plastic uh santa cruz shredder that i got for like five dollars but uh this thing here is from a company in canada called wacky willies and they were actually out of stock for a good while so and this this is called boomers you know which i'm only 40 so i'm not a boomer even though i've been called that quite a bit lately on the internet this thing let me see if i can this thing is [ __ ] heavy like oh geez oh those are those are razor sharp the machining looks amazing uh this is just exactly what i wanted for a while which is just a really burly stainless two-piece grinder no frills i don't need a keef collector i i like having to keep in my joints in fact i add more keef to a lot of them so we'll just uh we'll give this thing a try and oh yeah oh that is smooth i like it there's no magnet uh it's just gravity that holds the lid on the knurled edge here is what i was really after and the fact that it's a little bit bigger diameter you know but uh this thing's beautiful feels great a 115 dollars that i didn't want to spend but honestly i've bought like 50 60 grinders had a sharp stone that literally just imploded on me i had a let's see if i could find uh i had another grinder oh well i guess it's gone now but uh my chromium crusher the whole insides just uh you know stripped right out on it so i use these things a lot this thing is going to be put through the paces and rather quickly so now this thing feels like it weighs at least a couple of pounds you know two three pounds easily and this is god with a solid grinder so i actually uh let me grab some i'll go ahead and do a grind up i'm not going to roll a hog leg but you know definitely uh some purple wookie minis i didn't do an unboxing on these because i just literally needed to smoke but uh let's try this thing out just put it right into work i really like these kind with the little pyramid shaped spikes inside you know they just seem to cut right through everything oh let's see how this works oh like butter it doesn't even feel like anything's in there oh yeah very nice grind i would say that's definitely on the coarse side but i didn't i didn't spin it much either so um not a lot sticking inside which is you know what you want to see but being that it's stainless this should theoretically this should last me forever i'm 40. i don't know how long it would take me to wear this thing out but looks like a nice grind nice little uniform sized pieces uh twist one up uh they sent me a bag of uh of decals which is always nice so if you want a really high-end grinder and you want one that's not going to wear out and money isn't really a big concern about how much you're going to spend on it definitely check out this boomers grinder um i'll report back after a month you know give my thoughts but uh this thing seems legit this seems like what you're gonna want if you're after a two-piece grinder it doesn't

everything man seriously I picked this one up for $24.99 and with it being an aluminum grinder with a look at those teeth you know they're pretty good as far as like breaking down this is going to give you a slightly finer grind so if you have vaporizers desktop or portable this is definitely gonna be what you're looking for if you can hear that the grooves are very smooth very extremely smooth and that's something that I look forward to whenever I'm looking at grinders and saying which one that I want to pick because that really makes a difference coming in the future years or you know come going forward that's gonna make a difference in the quality of your grinder and if you're happy with it or if you run out there trying to buy another one so this one here is actually really quality so

habit yeah yeah yeah I love you like a bad habit yeah yeah yeah oh but I get right to you you ain't gotta wait definite dinner", "YdvcynVJ-x8": "I'm gonna do something that I've never done before and I'm gonna make this video super short and to the point so let's get started but first let's get high cus you need to do that obviously to clean your Draenor alright so before you clean anything you do need a couple things you do you need your grinder obviously which is the point of watching this video you're going to need rubbing alcohol I use 91% you can also use 70% if you don't have the 91 also we're going to need a bowl of some sort a toothbrush not a new one you can use an old one it's kind of dedicated to cleaning purposes that's what I did also some type of tool to kind of have a little point and I'm going to see that just kind of scrape some things out you can use like a bobby pin even you can use like a little tiny pocketknife I was just a little dab tool you're also going to need some q-tips so after you have all that stuff you can start cleaning the first thing you're going to want to do is stick your grinder in the freezer I stuck it in here for about an hour before I just took it out so it is pretty cold this is just gonna help everything stick together a little bit more and help you collect more Keith so after it's been in the freezer for a while you obviously want to make sure you have no weed in here you can keep the key from the bottom don't worry about that because we're gonna keep everything in there or I do I'm not gonna empty it into a separate container you can do that but that's just something that I just don't really want to do to be honest I think it wastes more so you're gonna take everything apart the first thing that I'm going to do is take a little kind of pointy tool I'm just gonna kind of scrape everything that you can get out there's any big chunks left in here I do have the parchment paper underneath so I can collect anything that I scrape out also what I like to do is go around this kind of inside edge and just scrape all this out cuz this is all just Keith that's just kind of hanging out there tap it out after you got all the stuff that you could out of this you're going to do this with the rest of the pieces especially up here I know I get a lot of chunks stuck up here so basically just go through every little piece in your grinder and scrape everything off manually if you can this is Mike before it says how much Keith we have we're going to see if we can collect anymore I'm not gonna empty this out and clean this bottom part you can if you want to I just want to keep everything in there and make sure I don't lose any to be honest but I do go around this little outer corner part and I just scrape out any stuff that is stuck on the outside and this all is 100% an optional step you don't have to go through and scrape all this out this is strictly just for the point of getting the most Keith out of your grinder as possible so now that we have this nice pile collected I'm just going to go ahead and put this back into my Keith collector this is what I like parchment paper so much because nothing gets stuck to it and it's great take a bowl we're going to fill it with alcohol I just go around this corner apart and the inside just kind of brush everything out make sure you get into little crevices don't even think about it I find it's best to clean your grinder every few weeks depending how much you use it only because the screen gets clogged up and then if you kind of notice after a while that like your Keith collection hasn't been growing that much it's definitely cause your screens clogged so I do recommend cleaning it decently often where at least just kind of brushing out the screen and doing a quick little clean you don't only do this everyday this would be annoying and that's pretty much it just basically keep going around scrubbing all the areas it just helped soaking it this is the screen now it's pretty see-through looks clean nothing too much in that I'm going to go rinse this off with warm water and then we'll put it back together so after you have everything all rinsed out you can tell it is obviously significantly cleaner you can see it through my screen it is still wet so definitely leave this out to dry before you use it so this is how much Keef we ended up with I do think it saved a decent amount this is so satisfying after it's all dried definitely put your grinder back together and feel free to grind up as much weed as you feel need that rhymes but anyway

off with this review is probably not gonna be that good at all since I don't have that much experience with grinders and my knowledge isn't that great but the reason I actually decided to make a review of this winery in the first place is because I couldn't find a review of it anywhere on the internet so this is gonna be the first one that I know so as you can see this is a very small grinder tiny so if you plan on smoking with friends I wouldn't recommend it maybe one friend like two people because when you fill the compartment in the grinder the it felt will probably be enough for two maximum so yeah but if you're gonna smoke all by yourself or if you go out and do I want to take a big reiner with you I would definitely recommend it so the most important question of all how well does it grind well it actually grinds better than I thought it would grind it has very small teeth and they're very sharp I think but because they are so small I fear that they will wear down after a while but maybe I will do a review later or a follow-up review about the grinder so yeah right now it's grinds real well I only grinded like two grams maximum with it and one thing that I very much liked about this grinder is that it has very small holes so the ground of material that you will have will be very fine and will burn very well and just to show you how much Keith you get from 2 grams about 2 grams it's not much it's very little but I don't really know how to keep you usually get from 2 clamps but it's not much but you can't really expect much from it so yeah part to build quality I have mixed feelings about the build quality the build quality is actually great except the middle compartment I can show you it only has one of these rich thingies I don't know if you actually can see them but anyway I don't know why they decided to just have one but on the Keith's compartment there's three why didn't they just make three here it would easily fit easily and since it's only one of these things don't get mad because English is not my mother tongue so I don't know all the words but since it's only one it can be hard to screw on because it can get crooked and if you're not careful enough you might actually destroy the grinder but I hate you but if it actually breaks you can obvious you stir this part and just screw it on and then it will look very very small I know I shouldn't all the time yeah since its Keith but this is how it would look like without the sifter thing so the build quality I would give maybe a seven or six out of ten and writing capability I don't know if I actually said that but it would probably be an eighth time for the moment things and the last part cleaning how hard is it to clean since I haven't used it that much I actually don't know but I have a problem with closing itself ah hate you so as you can see it's crooked you can't close the thing but yeah yeah cleaning I think it's gonna be a little bit harder to clean then a bigger grinder but I haven't had any problems yet within but the number one rule when you have a grinder and don't wait to clean it until it's clogged up clean it regularly and you won't get or you won't get so hard to clean just fill a bag with alcohol like rubbing alcohol shake it up a bit wait until it turns green or any colour half but Green is probably what it's gonna get since you are smoked herb in it and just laid on a plate let it dry and then scrape off all the good stuff and smoke it but anyway that was my review I know it wasn't that good in honesty it may actually have sucked but our review is better than no review good or bad and I'm sorry if I wasted your life with this video but there's many surah mine now and I'm not gonna give them back so stay high", "YhWQ72-iC3w": "[Music]

of the things that I like about the outside is that it has the notches all the way down this is huge because I feel like it gives great grip which is awesome especially since it has quarter turns throughout here and I will get into that in just a second but I like that it just has more of a feel on the outside it's slick but it has these grooves then notches that just kind of give it more of an aggressive feel I feel like I'm really getting you know a finer grind with it just because the outside feeling alone I like that it is made in the USA on the bottom here it shows you that it is made in the USA and then you flip it over and it has information as far as the serial number and the number of the unit and then their website Phoenician grinders comm so really like them I really like their colors they have some nice colors they're all kind of with this nice finish on them and that's really cool to me too they have some special ones going on right now different artist ones there's one with sublime which i think is really nice just kind of different things going on on their website so the inside is really nice has a nice heavy-duty magnet here as you can see I'm putting a little bit effort into here not getting anywhere so that means it's not gonna open up in your bag if you're traveling with it it also means that if it gets knocked off the table by any means which would be the sad but it's not gonna break and it's not gonna bust open and it's not going to release anything that's on the insights you have to give it a little bit of a pull there which is nice because it's going to hold it tightly for you the teeth on the inside like you can see here are a little bit thicker and longer they have kind of a different shape in them I really like that they're super super sharp I'm not going to run my fingers across them because I don't want to cut myself the depth here is really nice you can put a good amount in here and I feel like it's not going to shred it we are going to fluff it which is a nice comparison to you know your standard scissors and or hands because it's actually going to give you an and grind it has different shape here it's not your standard circle or elongated oval so I feel like it's gonna give me a nice variation and it's going to be a nice thing that I can use for rolling a joint of blunt putting into a vaporizer loading it into a bowl it's going to just you know work well so put the magnet to a test goes right back on like you can see when I was flipping it over earlier the lid is on and it is not coming apart so that's nice so quarter turn opens up your grinder which is really nice seals it same thing on the bottom here I like that it's quick and easy it's not difficult to get into it so it has a really nice deep catch here so you can do a good amount at a time which is nice because you're not having to do more than one grind session if you are doing something large to share or if you're wanting to grind a good amount and then store it somewhere which is also really nice for on the go so you're not going to have to reload it multiple times and here you're gonna have your pollen cut your teeth cut your nice little spiral here which is also gonna help as far as the kief moving it around getting it in here my favorite thing about the inside is that has rounded corners so that means it's not gonna get stuck anywhere in the corners here I dug does come with a little guitar pick which does have rounded corners as well so you can get in that you can also use as a scooper this is something that is you know you're here or there to me because I feel like it's great but if you leave it in here then it's gonna get full of pollen if you take it out and set it somewhere and you're like me you might lose it and I feel like that's why it's near here or there because often times I don't even use them because I feel like it kind of gets in the way when I have it on the inside here but I feel like it's cool that they provide that so put it back together it feels really sturdy it's not overly heavy I like that but it doesn't feel super lightweight I'm concerned about it braking which is really nice I'm not concerned about how these teeth are gonna go dull after a because they see an extremely sharp so I'm really excited to try it let's see so the phoenicians grinder is gonna retail this is the medium size it comes in a bunch of different colors they have a larger one which I will be doing a review on see them and I'm really excited about that where it has half of an ashtray on one side and then there is a spot here that it will hold papers which is really nice makes it convenient for being able to sub something out or set it down and then also for holding your papers all-in-one this is like I said is the medium they carry a number different sizes and they range in price of this one retails at about 70 dollars comes in a couple of different colors and I'm really loving what I have here as far as a comparison I have used the Compton and the Cali crushers and I really like both of those they're similar as far as the technology on the inside and the stability and the magnet and the quality overall they range anywhere between the you know 50 60 dollar range all the way up to a hundred dollars but the county crusher being on the higher side of things something I didn't know until I reached out to Phoenicians is that Phoenician actually invented and licenses the design on me on the Cali crusher so it is very similar to what you see with the Cali crusher the thing that I like about it though is that they are just different I don't know I really like that the Cali crusher is small and sleek this one seems like it might even be a little bit taller maybe not I don't have my Cali crusher anymore part of traveling abroad that I was not going to bring any of my stuff with me so I'm having to get all new stuff here which is why every video I do will be of new things so that's exciting so without further ado I'm gonna put some in here and we're gonna test it out so all of the product that I'm putting in all of my videos is all medical marijuana that I have obtained using a medical card I just want to make sure that it's clear that I'm not doing anything illegal and everything is for medical use so I'm excited to try this guy out and I seal there didn't really have to put any effort into pushing it which makes me think that there's enough room in here that you're not squashing and like hurting you know the bud it seems that with other grinders when there's not a lot of room and you go to put it in there it kind of condenses it making it harder for it to grind and that to me would be reasons why I ends up getting stuck in the top here along the sides here because it didn't have an ample room in there when you initially put it in which means that you're having to break it up more before you put it in which is sometimes more difficult because that's kind of a whole point of a grinder is that you're not having to do a lot by hand so that's nice it is an attorney can definitely feel like I need to lock these a little more in place that they'll come off I had a little bit of an issue just now with that but like I said I do like the corner turn so that's definitely just a little bit different anyways knock couple times and here we go so there's a little piece that fell out there so not bad there's only a couple pieces here that were left and let's hop some along here but it looks like it's all pretty well ground it looks like most of it can even go through so we'll give it one little more turn and open it up so here looking really fluffy which is nice I feel like that is a perfect ground I'm really liking that it doesn't look read it up it doesn't look like you couldn't just put it right into a vaporizer right into a full roll right up it's kind of that perfect consistency it's all just gonna kind of group back together and smoke nicely but a nice even grind here that you're going to be able to get the airflow through it nicely and then like I said go for it our turn here and you're going to get the cave collector not a lot of pollen on this one but it'll definitely start to build up after time so that's exciting I'm definitely I'm very excited about this guy so thank you so much for watching the video if you liked what you

all all right just kidding guys and getting a little bit carried away here it is Friday and on Friday I tend to get onto this juice alright so anyways I've had a couple of those already so I'm a little bit Larry as we say in England so this is actually a video about oops let me stabilize that there's actually a video about grinders why am i saying is these fates and why did I start off like that okay so basically these three vapes need three different consistencies to pay perfectly in fact really only two really and there is the Storz and Bickel comes with every one and with every one of these ones with a Croft the other mighty itch you probably all have seen and no and let me tell you for what it is it is brilliant this does it the job but it doesn't it does the job if you've never had one of these before and the reason this one's here is it's basically you know what I have to say this one has actually taught me a lot because it's got its based on feedback and this thing you just turn on and go this thing you just turn on and go this one you need to get into it you need to it gives feedback and you know if you're not if you're not making up with it if you if you're not basically using that feedback and calibrating each time you're not going to get it and that's why a lot of people don't actually get this so what has this taught me this has taught me that the consistency that I've been using to vape this is is just not right the consistency that this thing produces is just not right and the consistency that this thing produces is not right for this and or for that but it is actually for that okay so the truth is all you really need no matter what vaping you're doing is one of these one of these this is these are your four-piece grinders right inside and then there's a chamber in here for the material whoops about that okay we'll clean that up a little bit later so in there and then underneath there's another chamber for your Keef right so let's get rid of these now okay so before I get rid of them I just want to explain again one last time this one it can use pretty much any type of but you stick a full butt in there grind a course or finally and you'll get really nice results I found the tastiest results is when you actually put it in where where it's not cool where it's barely ground just very coarse this one you get the best results with the same cut these two need the same kind of consistency so basically what I found is you think'll you've got two types of vapes you've got the type of vape that requires you know this normal good grinding consistency and then you've got the type of vape that requires this and this little bad boy is what makes everything makes sense and the reason for that is because the way that this works we just clean this up here the way that this works is that this one doesn't grind this one the shears it grates and it turns it into powder and this over here like great and it you get chunks so if you're gonna vape with this or with something like the the epic vape I don't know if you guys are familiar with this vape but this is a rocking rocking desktop that's one in my opinion but then again it's just my opinion there are loads of desktop baits so something like this is gonna be good for this rate regular one but if you want if you want to get the best kind of results using your mighty or your crafty mighty or your craft if you want to get the best results using your mighty oh you're crafty or obviously this you're gonna want to get it down to this insane little consistency that this provides so um you grind it down always with something like this anyone any four-piece you know you get a nice thick sort of ground-up consistency like thick you could do anything with a kit on a doobie with that you could put in this thing you could put that in any desk most desktops that don't need anything course and you get the benefit of the Keith coming through so that's the main reason for using this as well and then you just take from there and put into the move the finishing grinder just to finish it off that's what's called the finishing grinder this needs to act as the intermediary so I'm actually not going to be promoting any specific than grinder because these all pretty much do the same the only one that I will be promoting in this one is this particular one because this does something that no other grinder have ever found is done it brings it down to a consistency which is literally fluffy powder and if you have a vape that requires a lighter consistency like this the Storz and Bickel any Storz and Bickel or the Magic Flight obviously this is made for the Magic Flight but it's not just for the Magic Flight it's for anything that means a very very light consistency so these are the only two grinders you really ever need and only shouldn't ever use is you should always initially break it down in this get the keep going shake it up bring the key through there so that you pick that for later and then take the material that's in here put that in there and just fluff it up and that literally brings it up to a nice fluffy powdery fluffy consistency and that will work like gangbusters in this it's made for that and in the crafty or the mighty or any of those vaporizers that need a really fine fine grind ok so again all you need is any type of a four piece grinder that gives you the grinding and then puts it into the middle for storage while it's in there and you're moving it around it's it's you're getting all this beautiful key I'll show you what we've got here and this is only I've cleaned it out about a week and a half ago two weeks ago and this is the kind of build up you can expect after like two weeks right so there's a lot in there and you it has a lot in there and it's just a waste if you're using the Storz and Bickel it's all just going all in there and getting lost and you'll never end up getting you'll never end up using it so so basically and then the last thing is one last tip is you know there's when you when you get the finishing grinder you know you'll have a massive amount of Keith down there but what I like to do is in between after each grind I like to go like that get the little twigs and the little tiny bits that didn't get grind and pour it into something like this and look how much I've got in here and this is only like this is literally just like a week and a half of two weeks old since I got this one and there's already about the gram in there so these little bits that come out of the grinder they add up and you're gonna have lots of little different bits in there at the end you hit that that's gonna be Rocky all right so guys I'm gonna let that I'm gonna finish up for now I've got to go and listen you know I hope that makes sense you guys got any questions comment below", "lXZEhazu7uc": "I gotta really get ready for this you know I'm saying caught in multimedia yo cannabis lovers welcome back cottonmouth media is forth to mentor its toe how to clean a grinder for dummies hello and welcome to how to clean a grinder I'll be your host today Matt Meredith and welcome to cottonmouth Media yeah today I'm gonna learn how to clean a grinder it's gonna be fun and since this is a two-minute tutorial we're gonna go ahead and throw two minutes on the clock boys thanks fights in order to clean your grinder you're gonna need a handful of things to get the job done nothing gonna need yourself a grinder one that you have used a medley of times as led to something like the scummy you you know residue so you need a scummy grinder an item numero this via need some alcohol any alcohol will really get the job done you want some kind of basic solution in order to really break down a lot of those duct items you know the third item that you're gonna want is definitely gonna be some q-tips and cotton swaps essential absolutely essential when you are getting in between the teeth of the grinder number four you're gonna want something to put the larger pieces of your grinder in so a bowl does a great job of doing that and then I am number five you're gonna want a small brush but if you don't have this um you don't want a toothbrush so some small little brush with hard bristles that's the key with the hard bristles then you're gonna be able to really get into those grooves where that gun piece yeah stuff see those grooves around it goes around the grinder and it's like impossible to get in there with yeah without the brush I won't be using it today but toothpicks are also a magnificent tool and it never hurts to have some water on hand both for you and for the grinder you definitely don't wanna rinse off your grinders once you've you know gotten the alcohol all over it so if that wasn't already obvious to you this last tool you don't have to use this to clean your grinder but it's a great tool if you ever get one of those you know like hygiene kits that has tweezers and little scissors and nail clippers and ear cleaners all kinds of great little tiny tools that can help you get into little small places so if you have one of these laying around do that and delia the alcohol is doing most of the work for us we don't have to do much okay but so now you want to take the q-tip cotton strap we want to put it in between all the teeth and clean the teeth you see this gross stress this in there you definitely want to do your best to not get any of the cotton on the actual grinder you can see some of the stuff but add alcohol really helps loosen up and a great opportunity to just rush out everything that's in those grooves just like you're brushing your teeth you know be like decently aggressive but not too aggressive you want to ruin that enamel you mean as aggressive as you want with this actually unless you don't want to ruin your grinder look it's not looking too bad like this so good Vinton repeat from best resource we're gonna pull out this alcohol we're gonna rinse off the grinders with some a little bit of water and we'll be finished for sure preferably with hot water and you know really cleaned up you dry it off with your paper towels you're ready to start using it again and that my friends is how you clean a grinder I hope this helps some poor lost soul out there looking to clean

button it's like right here somewhere and in today's video we're going to talk about a one hundred and seventy five [ __ ] dollar grinder that I have it's [ __ ] dope but before we do anything a stuff this little raw ninety eight special I've got my amazing taco source lighter he's so beautiful so I think we hit a little slow-mo action in before we start talking about anything Cheers [Music] okay okay that was better than I expected it's a bit so I know everyone's [ __ ] anxious so I'm not gonna [ __ ] delay anything this is the [ __ ] Kubis the Cubist is [ __ ] dope because there's no screws in it so you don't have to screw or anything on or off it's completely held together magnetically it's also waterproof so if this thing falls in water or anything like that your butt is good to go and I have tested it it is [ __ ] waterproof and it's [ __ ] dope it has these [ __ ] gaskets all around everywhere that it opens to keep it nice and waterproof and the reason mine cost so much is because I customized the top with my signature logo just [ __ ] fly and I got a custom inscription on the bottom with my name so no one can [ __ ] steal it but it's also [ __ ] dope couple dope features like I said it's all put together magnetically it has this like magnetic locking system so these are held together by magnets here it also has a really deep chamber so you put a lot of [ __ ] blood in there also since months custom I can pick any colors I want so I got it this gold inside basket and the basket is also removable so if you don't like to catch Keith you can just take that out and just put it all back together like that and now you don't have a Keith catcher I think that's [ __ ] cool I do like Keith so I keep that in there like that and it all fits [ __ ] together something else I like about this is it doesn't actually look like a [ __ ] grinder it's kind of square I'll put a shot up cuz you can like kind of lean it on its side and it's kind of cool so I'll put like a shot up right here of that so it's like you can really put this like on your desk and no one really know what really is I don't think also it's completely smell proof since it's airtight so if you got bud in here and you got this like the office or some [ __ ] you really don't gotta worry because no one's gonna be able to smell nothing because it's completely air [ __ ] proof you can get these honestly I think as low as like a buck ten a hundred ten not like a dollar time but sometimes they go on sale you know for like 90 I got mine on sale for like one sixty four because I got the customer graven on the top is it worth 110 dollars it's worth 110 dollars if you just want to stun on people stun on your friends and [ __ ] and they also have like some really cool like limited edition ones like there's like a Halloween one I'll put that up it's like a pumpkin and [ __ ] it's [ __ ] dope and you can get them with ash trees in the top like if you didn't want to logo here or if you didn't want to leave this blank right here they have like ashtrays you can get it cost a little bit extra money or you can get an ashtray in the top did you want an ashtray also the fact the fact that it's like [ __ ] airtight makes it really good because I don't know about any of you guys but for me cuz I don't want to [ __ ] up like where the keith goes or like how much Keef I have so I never really clean my life my bottom pieces out so what I did since its waterproofing it worked perfectly well I just like took the top half of this off like this and I laid it upside down when I cleaned it for the video and I just poured I just poured [ __ ] a [ __ ] that should be called rubbing alcohol thank you I just like pour rubbing alcohol like right down through these holes until it filled up until I could like see the water coming up through the holes a little bit and I just let it sit there for like a couple hours and then dumped all the water out and like kind of went around it and cleaned it all out and [ __ ] and it worked [ __ ] perfectly which is [ __ ] dope and that is my $175 cuba's grinder they're [ __ ] dope and I think I'm actually gonna do like a more in-depth like detailed review on this once the studio is back up and running because the studio currently still looks like this so that's not [ __ ] good that's never gonna work but so I do want to do like another video of it like when the studio's back put together when the damage is all fixed just because you know it looks nicer down there than it does out here I mean it's nice to do videos outside and once a while but I don't know it's kind of getting old don't forget to do all that [ __ ] normal youtubers tell you to do at the end of their videos like comment share and subscribe they're all really big especially

medicinal benefits I'm also going to be showcasing different alternatives to ingesting medical cannabis specifically I'm going to be exploring vaporization today I have really delicious strain it's called amnesia haze I got from Greentree remedy they are an excellent place to get your medication most strains are lab tested they're very compassionate they just want you to be happy the strain was a sativa it's pretty delicious I usually keep all of my cannabis inside a glass jar this size is perfect for 2/8 maybe a quad yep this strain smells a very nice it has a citrusy lemony twist to it it's very sweet and very earthy I wish I had better nugs but I just couldn't keep my fingers off of the strain really definitely recommend this one gonna load a small nugget when you're breaking this apart you can see all of the trichomes going to proceed to grind my material as well see you have some freshly ground cannabis in my grinder it's one of my favourite grinders of all time it's called as Santa Cruz shredder I especially like the way how the teeth are designed it's kind of different from your normal grinder secondly I like the fact that the teeth are connected to the top part I used to have a sharp stone and this middle part right here would become loose and rotate and you can never use it ever again so this design is far superior had this guy for about three years and still going very strong so definitely recommend getting one of these I'm gonna be using my fave Excel this is a vaporizer device it heats up to the perfect temperature in which THC evaporates so you never reach combustion so you never get all of the negative side effects of smoking like tar and a bunch of carcinogens and carbon monoxide by the way you use a vape XL is you load these cartridges with herb you want to load it about half way you turn it on and after you wait until this red light becomes green now that screen place your cartridge inside you place this water attachment tool on top on the inhale you definitely get the sweet flavor on the exhale you definitely get the citrus and the earthy notes very nice train I remember noting how energetic I am how creative I can be I use a strain specifically for my ADHD and it works great I find strains like this one really helps me with coming up with questions to ask you know during class specifically I find myself asking more questions to myself that makes sense it helps me get more engaged in the lecture so definitely like the strain for that purpose however if the dose is too high I do get confused and I get anxious at the same time so that's something to keep in mind if you enjoyed my little strain review thing please leave a like down below and please subscribe to my channel I'm gonna make more of these videos

there it is [Music] openings as wide as you'd expect them this is their little bit of magic here you don't usually notice it all along is a sort of plastic ring that actually helps you collide here that magnet the fact that that little bit of sound that's that rubber right there you can see the spacing without that it's constant grind you will actually hear the metal rubber gets each other not good feeling very secure very secure very secure a few wrist turns try not losing the sharp stone branded tool I guess that very secure some resistance there yeah a little yeah catcher or what have

you know if i want to be bigger we can do that too but i don't want to do that right now so uh we wanted to be take this moment to be the one where we talk about uh these brilliant cut grinders you know what we have to think of them i want you to know that grinders for life gfl over there that's the company and brilliant cut grinders these things are awesome so you got to make the connection there grinders for life and brilliant cut and before i forget the code troy and jerry will get you 10 off these for the month of february only that's the only month they're gonna do this so oh [ __ ] yeah i forgot about i forgot to tell you that troy no [ __ ] you [ __ ] forgot to tell me that right so 10 percent off month of february code troy and jerry that's the only discount they're we're going to build because they don't discount these at all but yeah they don't discover those at all like yeah for 4 20 and black friday they they'll do like a little little thing but there's those things don't go on sale so that's awesome thank you so much greenwich for life both for the sponsorship and for the the discount for the listeners that's huge man yeah man the only complaint i've ever heard about the grinders for life or the brilliant cut was that it was small for their needs and i'm like okay i could see that if you want if you want to grind up like two nugs at a time yeah like a day's worth or whatever cool you want a bigger grinder i said totally a valid valid need and now they have it the the large i i'm glad they filled the need but what blows my mind even more now is how much easier it is to to turn like a little larger diameter it it's even more buttery it's even more smooth like you can turn these things with with one finger yeah i can do that with a nug in there i can put a nug in there and have enough friction with one finger to grind a nug they're really far ahead of the game when it comes to grinding experience like the the usage experience and i'm i'm really happy to have have the brilliant cut on board as a sponsor me too man all day long i mean they've got you know a lot of spaces for nugs in here and you're right i mean so many times i put one or two nugs and then i put it on and i feel like nothing was there because it just kind of i mean it's gone within a turn or two but they're just i don't understand i i told uh i told them the other day i was talking to him and i said i don't understand how you guys were able to just really fix every problem i could think of about a grinder you know there's no more threadings nothing gets stuck everything falls through it always works it's like butter uh i it's it's ridiculous and then uh the different plates which one you use the most the fine the the coarse or the medium lately i've been i've been on the course but i've been a medium guy for years and i still love the medium and i i use the mediums here but i've been i've been reaching for the course lately and a lot of that has to do with the vapes that i've been preferring like these these heavy header convection vapes all that convection uh performs better with a coarse grind you know more more trichome heads on pieces of leaf matter i don't want that leaf matter and all the cycle mats broken up because the small little bits will actually go into my screen or go through my screen and not not vaporize or not vaporize efficiently and require more maintenance so the the coarse grind equals less maintenance and more flavor you know yeah that's interesting i've uh i've i use the i always use the medium i was using the the fine one the other day because i was trying to um i was playing with tighter packed loads i was trying to i was i was trying to get right right on man i was you know i love to set you up 400 times a show i was i was playing with different grinds and packs and pressures and if you're gonna pack it tightly i'm pretty sure a finer pack is the way to go so anyhow it was nice to have the different plate to [ __ ] around with it and see and i'm still [ __ ] around with it to see but um it's the only grinder i have that has that where i have all those different plates so no these things they really did and the small one here i'm with you uh i didn't i didn't need a bigger one until i got a bigger one and i just like it better it's a better size but like this one here i've had this for like i don't know two years i've cleaned it once and i've been riding it like this hard look at all the grunge in there like that's caked on thick sticky stuff and it doesn't matter it keeps on trucking just like you did with the one finger if you want i mean it's i don't i don't know man i've never had a grinder that could just take the beating that this thing does it's amazing i mean the the santa cruz was my number one grinder and i love that thing because i could use it for so long without ever cleaning it but the the santa cruz is an amazing grinder too and it was always my absolute favorite it was the the one that i always reached for yeah matter what it was like just with a reliable one until the cut came along and was like holy [ __ ] this is such an experience it's like going from driving a honda to driving a bmw the first time you know it's like you feel all these like little luxuries and [ __ ] yeah the experience matters yeah that's funny because i was a santa cruz guy too as well and i still have my santa cruz up there and it's a rasta it's a three color one like these i didn't realize it was i'm into the three color ones i same thing that i migrated from that to this and um i haven't looked back and i'm so stoked to have this big one here man so um yeah dude look we love these doggone things oh yeah i packed a dab to kick off the show you talked so fast through the stash products and the sponsorship stuff that i wasn't able to get my app popped off [Music] troy's fired up i got a load up here troy so hang on that's what she said right two for two right now bro you're not disappointing me at all that was a good dab man right on hmm what was that [Music] you", "KNgtyMsY5Sc": "today i'm going to be doing a review of a grinder that i got off amazon it's called blue bus on amazon it says it's the number one best non-stick ceramic herb grinder so uh it is not bad i'll i will tell you that so this is an honest review i've been using this grinder for maybe two months now and it wasn't bad it was only uh 21. but it's two and a half inches uh in width it's uh pretty good nonstick ceramic grinder so um this what the top looks like why in the world is there a stem in there what was i smoking some mids uh anyways so this is what the inside of it looks like oh man it's kind of hard to there you i had to open it real quick it gets pretty uh kefi in the middle part but the there's a magnet right here and right here so top always kind of attaches easily let me shut it real quick then you got your uh your key from the bottom it gets a good amount but honestly it doesn't get as much keef as like the the sharp stone grinders and some of the other ones i've used but it still gets decent amount i'm going to put it back on real quick like it's a lot of keef just like fell out everywhere oh well um so i'm gonna show you guys how it uh grinds up some weeds real quick i know this review isn't um as you can see it gets the job done it doesn't crush it up into like dust but it still breaks it up pretty good anyways that's pretty much it i just wanted to give you guys a little review of this uh 21 grinder that i got on amazon if you could do me a favor and thumbs up this video and subscribe to my channel that would help me out a lot and yeah that's pretty much it guys thanks for watching my video peace", "f47mq4yo8VU": "[Music] all right welcome back to another episode of people send us free [ __ ] first off eric is holding this 110 dollars it's just before I even start is just such a ridiculous price for a grinder but let's go ahead here so this is the Phoenician grinder here and I guess it's a pretty cool logo off the bat maybe we can ask this question but I really don't know what this part is for am I supposed to put like business cards in there or a joints like a lot of joints like six joints I don't know anyway it has a nice material to it I'm not sure it definitely is some kind of metal maybe it's an aluminum or titanium I don't know man hundred twenty-nine ten dollars maybe maybe it's platinum I don't know but let's open it up so it has a very very strong magnetic function and I mean but awesome doesent okay so yeah it's very strong and I really had to pull pretty hard nothing I'm very strong but I had to pull pretty hard let's start with the good parts you could grind a lot of weed with this I mean quite a bit of weed and it's really heavy-duty it seems like it's gonna last a long time this is for like industrial weed grinding but I have to say that I'm a pretty heavy consumer I like flowers that's primarily what I like to smoke and I don't have a need for something like this i buy grinders all the time in fact I have to replace them fairly often but they're generally like 20 bucks and so I'm buying like a $20 rinder once a year and they work great the difference being here it's a hundred and ten dollars I can't recommend anything to you guys but does virtually the same process as any other grinder and costs one hundred and ten dollars it's honestly laughable if that's our price point so thumbs down on the phoenicians grinder [Music]", "SoE-Lp9MzyA": "I've done a new grinder update

had to have one you can make the most flavorful pesto and guacamole in this not sure why it's so much better other than the way the ingredients are being melded together it's truly a game changer especially with pesto no regrets the product itself is heavy duty and really has some heft to it be sure to season it before you use it i googled how and highly recommend doing it kind of a pain another happy customer said as i just removed from the box i was disappointed that there were no instructions for the seasoning process as well as helpful hints on certain items for first-time users of a pestle also you need instructions on how to open the box on the outside of the box as says to wash in warm soapy water however the information regarding the product on the page where it is listed tells you to not use soap so i will see i have not used it yet it looks nice however the discrepancy of soap no soap is a little unsettling good the next one is [ __ ] ricon vase ceramic grinding

great i really love how deep the inner chamber is it's about the same size as my other one but it seems to hold more and have a deeper lip so it is harder to spill anyway it's cheap and gets the job

shavings smooth movement magnet keeps the top on well small size for a four-piece grind size is suitable and you can get it finer by turning it upside-down cons sometime the materials get stuck where the magnet attaches that you need to knock off to ensure a good connection a tip if you are in search of pollen and such try adding some titanium or stainless steel ball bearings to the second chamber

great colors all the colors are kind of past deal it's kind of like with all the t-shirt like shades in a Lands End catalog that's the kind of grinder color they have the kind of much I don't like grape I'm like a sailboat for a dorm room what I spin is legitimate it's about mitigating", "nCKk9Yu0eoA": "[Music] lots but first we gotta crack out of our club so to do that we need to use this first-of-its-kind and on the grand peep set continuous cracker product smell that's Tyler diesel now we're gonna put some fat lot so we need 200 um so I'm gonna weigh on Stephen hundred grams here you see us but overflowing there we go right it's mixed bucks so the use the grinder to set up the way to flip the switch we just start running in here [Music] and whatnot 200 grams coarsely grinded up smells amazing Sour Diesel alright so now that 200 grams only took a matter of seconds to run and we could have just put in the whole pound and it wouldn't have taken much longer but the beauty here is that it's so simple we can grind what we need now we can keep the rest of the product freshmen later so let's check it out now look at that particulate size in there [Music] now you see the uniform no dust look at that perfect for pre-rolls extractions and edibles but today we're going to use it to roll some fat blunts so this is toke brands and kids at your capital and we're signing out [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "vPYHEmjUcOc": "[Music] so the house of digne steam led me over to probably one of the most novel and unique pieces of equipment I've ever seen in a growing operation and I have Kelsey here can you go over this machine and what it is this is our Franklin Miller taskmaster TM 8500 industrial shredder you know Scott mentioned earlier to me that this isn't the first sweater that you guys have had we've gone through three other wood chippers and shredders before we got this one no kidding okay so those ones just ended up burning out yeah they couldn't handle our waste we're using it every single day and we put about 50 to a hundred pounds of waste through it on an average day why would a facility like yours have something like this so we have to have a 50/50 waste to trash ratio for this so we're gonna do about 50% of leaf and stem and then we'll add something else in there like our rock wall or cardboard just to mix it up so if someone did get into our trash it would be unusable okay so you know this is a very intense kind of piece of machinery I know it says like a big five horsepower motor you guys have a giant kind of lever over there and it turns on it's pretty dramatic well maintenance it about once a week and we'll just you know we'll take this part off and clean the teeth maybe put some oil through it and other than that about once a month we'll fully take it apart and give it a nice good cleaning okay cool well let's get to the fun part and that's grind some stuff awesome [Music] [Applause] you", "9LIyQb8VCUs": "today i'm going to be doing a review on this kozo grinder i got it on amazon for 21.97 which is a pretty good price for the quality that this is i've gotten several grinders off amazon before and this is by far my favorite one that i've gotten so far i'll show you why um the top spins really easily um and these teeth were made for tearing uh bud apart so um it's really easy to grind up um your middle compartment you have to unscrew it quite a few times but at least you know it's not going to open up in your pocket in your backpack or anything but um yeah the middle compartment is pretty deep um the screen as you can see it's kind of wide so the bottom section of this is a keef catcher but it kind of is just catching big pieces of weed but it definitely gets a good amount i've i've been using this uh grinder for about a week maybe a week and a half so it definitely collects a good little bit i'm just going to show you guys how it works real quick wouldn't be a full review without it it's really easy to twist this grinder this is the other grinder that i got off of amazon that i do not like as much as the kozo grinder um they were in the same price range and i will show you why i do not like the blue bus as much as the kozo unfortunately the blue bus grinder it had a little plastic piece that went around the brim right here and it came off and when that came off it really became difficult to turn the top piece of the grinder and it gets jammed also you can see um on the sides of it it's just getting a lot of buildup of like residue from just being crushed into it and around the edges i don't know just seems like to be getting uh jammed up a lot so yeah i don't really recommend the blue bus grinder also whenever you open up the bottom section all your key falls out so yeah i don't recommend this grab the cozo don't forget to slap that like button and subscribe", "G1INmPTWGZg": "how's it going guys just doing a grinder review here of the Phoenician grinders heard a lot about them never use one myself before I just pick this up today just been playing around with it a little bit the quality of this grinder is off the charts it's unbelievable it's full of innovation it's made in USA I think the guys are actually out of Phoenix Arizona just a very cool innovative product I'm just starting with the outside here it's got the there they call it a lobe knob grip and it's on every piece most grinders just have the knurl around the lid which kind of works but this is just a far superior design in my opinion because you get it on each of the sections looking at the bottom here they actually engrave turn the upside right but actually engrave into the aluminum there website made in USA and these guys actually set up their company just like a medical device manufacturer would they've got a real strong stance on delivering products basically of medical grade this even came in a medical grade packaging but every one of them has a part number and an individual serial number and it's pretty cool the guy at the store was telling me you can actually register your serial number online because this grinder believe it or not has a lifetime warranty on all the functionality aspects of it which is basically unheard of in the grinder market so which is awesome because this is a you know buy it once it lasts you forever if it doesn't I hear they got a real good return policy take pictures send it back to them and they send you a new one so pretty cool obviously the most stark thing about the grinder on the outside is the top here I'm assuming this is an ashtray you could probably put your your product in there if you want the coolest thing about this in my opinion is the fact that holds your standard inch and a quarter papers and the a gentleman smoke shop was showing me you can obviously hold them just into the lid like this if it's a new pack or if you want to dispense them out of the top just just rip the back of your rolling papers again these are standard inch and a quarter so they're all going to fit and then you can slide it in and literally dispense these at the top like a tissue box super innovative super cool haven't seen anything like that before pretty awesome design if you ask me now let's really get into this grinder here and open it up this isn't like any grinder I've ever seen before these guys definitely know what they're doing they've completely just changed the game entirely the teeth are very unique the fall through holes are unique even how the teeth engaging cut is unique and where I got this the the owner was telling me that these teeth essentially worked like scissors they shear rather than mashing and tearing the butt apart which is actually far superior if you ask me and the teeth tops also have a blade edge so when you close it you're actually cutting down through the weave and not smashing it like is with every other grinder and they've also removed a lot of the teeth which I've been told helps with reducing friction which we're going to grind up some product here in a few minutes and see how it does the fall through hole pattern is crazy never seen anything like that I definitely consider this a designer high-end grinder to say the least and again just the machining and the quality of this is just absolutely beautiful a lot of grinders I've used they'll just do slots or holes which obviously work but these guys just took it to a whole nother level with making the holes the way they did and looks like it's going to give us a even in thorough consistency since they're all the same size which is definitely important for me it's got a huge neodymium magnet in it the lid holds super good it almost is too strong again good problems to have then we're going to have you're crying or crack open on you so that's the teeth in the fall through and this is really where the grinder takes a turn on really sets itself apart but they've eliminated the threading completely I know every one of you guys or every other grinder out there has their standard thread you know it gets gummed up you know it's cross threaded and it wears out and then you have to end up getting a homing grinder these guys solve the problem entirely it's got this patented locking knotch mechanism that engages with the other side and locks the grinder together so it literally is a snap close snap open it's never going to go past it's never going to mess up and that's one of the features that these guys offer a lifetime warranty with which is pretty which is pretty amazing just a cool shot of the under of the fall through holes again just this is an incredibly well designed and manufactured product again I just don't have enough good things to say about the quality also as you can see there's a little screw in the middle of this which kind of catches people off guard at first as it did myself basically you can take this just this one screw and you can pull these screens in and out so if your screen ever tears you can change it out and these guys are doing just doing the craziest stuff they offer three different mesh size screens a fine standard and of course depending on how much or what your how much Keef you want to generate which is a really great thing because if you're smoking dry weed or or moist weed your Keef is going to be or your keith has a huge variable on how much is going to pass through which is awesome and then just the fact that the screen is replaceable a lot of grinders have fixed screens and if it breaks well you're pretty much Sol and are looking to go buy a new grinder so it's a very innovative thing that they've done here that if it just tucks in a groove holds real tight I believe these are made out of stainless steel these are much thicker than any Rinder screens I've seen and the other grinders I've had and use very thick it's not going to pop or anything like that looks like a real durable screen last section of this obviously our bottom keith catcher let me show you the backside screen to these guys design everything that they do with sacred geometry and essentially what that is or what I've come to understand is it's the natural geometry that occurs in nature whether it's you know the spiral of a pinecone or the number of petals on a sunflower all that is considered sacred geometry and these guys have incorporated it into their grinders in their screen breaks and I believe into their the way their teeth spiral together as well so again just incredibly cool design and looks awesome and sports the screen from other nut underneath the bottom section also has the same locking mechanisms as the second section did and these guys have done it right they've made a very large bottom chamber which obviously can hold Anup Keith you can also store flour product down here and these guys radius the bowl which is awesome and they give you a standard guitar pick which is perfect for reaching into the radius corners and scooping the product out overall this grinder is just it's an awesome product super high quality but let's try it out here and see what the actual results are let's put some put some butter in here this is super moist stuff I just got it's very moist could actually dry a little bit longer but this will be the best test of how this grinder really really grinds up the product so I tend to not fill my grinder to the brim brim we're going to fill this one a little bit more just so we can test it out and see how it really does motion through things some of these have some little stems in there so we'll see how choose those up but let's let's see what we get here so obviously this should be pretty easy to just go on the top which it is that seems very nicely you're not having to smash the lid down like you are other grinders and what's whew this is very this is very easy and again this is moist weed so it is a little sticky but I'm liking what I'm seeing so far the second piece does come undone sometimes I the guy at the store was showing me because these grinders are designed to open easy for patience he said just give it a little snapped and they typically stay closed so let's see if that works out for us and now that I think solved the problem of that coming undone so you end up getting one of these and they're having trouble just give those pieces a little snap and it should be good so let's see what we got here underneath as far as consistency is concerned very good consistency perfect not super fine but not super coarse either you can tell the fall through holes I'll be in the same size are a good thing we don't have any large pieces and small pieces in here everything's pretty well ground up again this is very moist weed but it looks like just about all that went through the lid obviously you guys can see I was only running it for a few seconds there but overall very impressed let's see if we can get the rest of this through here and see what we can make happen oh yeah I think that just about did it so yeah we're more or less all through that actually was very fast most grinders you know you have to really rotate the lid a lot of times to get it all to fall through especially moist moist weed I've never seen a grinder work this easily on on moist bud normally those are some of the hardest to grind up and and this grinder didn't have a problem at all so this is a pretty pretty amazing grinder and I think I'm going to comfortably say this is the best grinder I've ever used and by far is the most innovative innovative grinder on the market as of today for sure and again guys the quality on this is just unbelievable there aren't burrs Nicks anything on these grinders they're delivered flawlessly so very cool product let's see if we get in and keep right now nope going to have to let that dry out a little bit to get some teeth built up but awesome product again this is your Phoenician Phoenician grinders I believe you can get them Phoenician grinders calm what a great product don't have anything but good things to say about it so you guys go out and get yourself a Phoenician and hopefully you have the same opinions I do about it but overall just an incredible product thanks guys", "LE5ltcztGTo": "hi everybody this is my second toy to go ball in my vape this is a base case for peace small grinder right so you open up this baby right here I don't

commitment to domestic manufacturing and operates under the premise that legitimate medicine should be complemented by legitimate medical devices our grinders are specifically engineered for patients by patients this has allowed every aspect of Phoenician grinders design to be engineered from a patient perspective not a product feature approach in a perfect blend of form and function the dramatic lines displayed by the Phoenician grinder immediately set it apart from the other the lid features a built-in paper dispenser and ashtray and the entire exterior has what we call lobe notch grip besides giving a unique aesthetic look the lobe notch design also serves to assist those patients who may have weakened conditions allowing them to operate their Phoenician grinder properly and with minimal effort this grip also allows for the sectional bumper rings to be the most effective the Rings prevent both the noise and damage when tapping the grinder together but diametric teeth were one of the most rigorously tested and engineered aspects of this grinder what our design provides is the ultimate combination of the perfect grind consistency with the least amount of friction the geometry of the teeth placement is spiraled allowing for ground material to sit from the inside out and the outside in a slightly larger trapezoidal shaped fall through holes assist further in the grinding process as it ultimately results in the fewest possible lid rotations to completely grind the medication the quick lock notch design completely replaces standard screw threading that is typically incorporated in all other grinders this innovation completely eliminates the possibility of all cross threading and galling that are inevitable pitfalls of standard grinders this luck knife allowance for a user to open and close the sections quickly and with men we'll effort the screen found in the phoenicians grinder is by far one of the coolest aspects the screen rest naturally in a gorgeous by Bonacci inspired floor support and can be easily replaced by one simple screw the bottom collection chamber of the phoenicians grinder features a full radius around the entire inside diameter creating a bold white shape and allowing the fine pollen to be removed with ease but pieces are interchangeable due to the lack of thread you can turn any four-piece finishing grinder into a 3-piece air if you want something more portable at that time or in the instances you don't want a pollen screen all grinders are individually serialized we offer lifetime warranties on all of our

man so I wanted to share I want to share a really cool product I picked up here this is the Titan crusher it's an herb grinder that is much better than the last one I had I went out shopping and I've came across this one looked like exactly what I was looking for and in fact it is it is built much better very solid the last one I had was kind of like a beer can this one is this is like aircraft aluminum and it's really really cool feels great in your hand and works like a dream so first thing you're gonna notice are all the teeth in here there are 50 of them last one I had like I said not that great of a was a cheaper one and 25 to 30 teeth in it maybe you'll also notice that these are in the shape of a diamond I think you can see that anyway it's a it's a much more of a cutting than it is a grinding like you don't want it grounded into powder man you want it cut into fine little pieces of particulate so and that's what this does exactly I really really like the then the next feature is these the holes in it are much better than the last one last one I had had slots in it you don't want one with slots in it man you want these little holes because that's how you get the really good cut for vaping for smoking for whatever you want to do with it then you've also got this bottom chamber in here collects what comes through this mesh screen so it's like a sieve so you get your Keef your your pollen and your resins all comes into this little this lower layer and layer and you get this scraper too because we all know how sticky sweet that stuff can be it helps you get that all out another super cool feature about this particular grinder is that it's the magnetic top I mean these are some strong magnets there is no way you're gonna accidentally spill anything out of there when you've got some stuff in that top chamber so I highly recommend this one again it's from Titan crusher comes in a real nice little bag that you can keep everything in it's all safe and sound in there when you travel won't get beat up scratched up and there's enough room in there to throw some extra accessories should you want to so check it out - exactly what I was looking for and I thought I'd share it with you today", "x4jIhNG7tGQ": "1975 was the wind improved hunt's reputation and", "cbfuwq_oDoI": "hello again grow gang it's your old pals luna668 chilling here home and uh getting ready to discuss these grinders i've had a variety of grinders over the years this is one of the oldest ones i think this one's probably about 15 years old uh we had this one for a long time supposed to look like a little miniature can of beer if you line the stickers up of course wear and tear they don't line up very good anymore when it's good and tight so it is what it is but it's just a basic grinder you know unscrews it's got a little screen a little area to catch some keef down at the bottom and like i say i've i've used this on camping trips and i've used this all over the place so it's got to still get a little stuff in it so but i've i've had that one for a long time and i use it occasionally still although most of the times i just poke the buds down into the bowl and we're done with it i bought some of these recently to give away i like them they're little plastic green green gobblers here and they work they work pretty good a little plastic ones they're okay this is my mainstay for uh seed extraction no pollen catching or anything like that we just break them up four inch grinder smoosh mush mush and dump it out and pull the seeds out of it that's what i use for seed harvesting so now i have decided to upgrade and buy what is supposed to be the best grinder on the market the raw life grinder this one's in black see what it says wildlife grinder is modularly engineered to last a lifetime i don't know if it actually has a lifetime warranty on it but we're going to unbox it here i just got it in and we're going to take a look at it so let's see we're all life grinders modular last a lifetime every component is easily replaceable even the screen you can add or remove components from your grinder to customize it exactly the way you like personally we remove the screen and use it as a three piece grinding directly into the super large catch basin as with any tool proper lubrication is key applying a few drops of hemp olive or plant based oil around the collar will prevent seizing and ensure your lifetime grinder lives up lives up to its name if your grinder starts to seize or jam lubricate it again we've been selling and grinding smoke herbs and tobacco for over 20 years one of the one of the things we've learned is the best grinders don't just grind they also fluff by fluffing the material it burns much better typical household grinders cause clumps clumps are very bad when it comes to smoke clumps burn unevenly and sometimes fall off the end of your smoke preferably burned which is a terrible partially burned which is a terrible waste any standard aluminum raw life grinder is created using a 6063 aluminum magnesium alloy with a strength of 18 000 psi this diehard shredder is modular and you can shred any way you want so that's that on that because of you the raw foundation has saved tens of thousands of lives learn more at rawfoundation.com for sure this guy does water filtration and stuff for people it's amazing so see oh that comes right out and it's kind of rubberized top that feels real good let's see here's the rest of it nice little foam box that it comes in so we got some cutting pegs they cut in a couple of different directions dude on the same and likewise well machine oh it's a super magnet click that ain't coming off i'm surprised the whole thing didn't just lift right now look at that nice and heavy life grinder oh so smooth a little scraper a little scraper to work with your screen that's in here and then here's your catch basin underneath for all your pollen and whatnot and it completely comes apart apparently you can just push this guy right out is that right how's that come up see is there a that might be a collar here that needs to come undone let's see is there a way to uh yeah this this acts as a wrench for it i remember seeing something about that and then we just unscrew this completely that on there acts like a wrench comes out completely like i said i'm glad i didn't force that there's the screen and a little collar for it easy peasy it's even got a little lip around it where i pushed in the middle it's warped it a little bit probably potato chip action comes completely apart for cleaning i see that's the wrench side this is the other side imagine that fits right over that lip right there yup fits over that lip and can go right back in if you want it yeah but i think i agree with him i don't care about catching kefir i have keith catchers we're good with that already so let's see this goes in here there's your bottom or if my sticker will fit on it nope a little too big the grinder part itself i understand this part comes out as well is that right yeah look at that this also comes out this thing acts like a wrench it's got those little pieces sticking in fits right down in there and acts like a wrench to take this whole thing apart clean it all up you want to make sure it's nice and clean the whole damn thing comes apart it is beautiful beautiful stack it all back together drop it back in drop the pieces back in here well let's see now is it machined in a certain way oh it's got a couple of little lips that it's got to line up with i see got a couple little lips that stick out and once it's in there if it's good and snug and does not move a little spacer i guess and the collar that locks it in place hit it with the little wrench here nice and smooth good and tight nice look at that and now you know it wouldn't be complete without a test let's give it a test let's see this is some dubbing poison let's see i got a big butt of it and i get a little bit of it oh let's do the big bud let's take this big old stem off of here first that's what i've been doing is stripping it down i usually just take the little bugs off it and let's do that and we'll take the little buds off the stick here and poke them in there supposed to shred and fluff this is not what i would call super duper compact bud but it's pretty good little little bitty bits off i like these little popcorn nuggets behind and go into the bin and then discard the stock as i'm sure you've seen a bajillion times before let's see that fluff happen right [ __ ] all that sticks hello let's go ahead and see if we get it closed looks like it's closed good grinding grinding grindy grainy grind and of course it's going to fall through the holes see did it push it all through yet no not yet it sideways here let's see what happens get a little bit that's just not falling through the holes yet and turn it sideways make it go that's close enough let's see how it fluffed up that big old bud a lot of purple flowers looks like it's going to be good for putting right into a raw cone or my favorite bong which is probably more likely for me look at that raw life grinder very nice these are actually kind of hard to find i actually had to hunt one down on ebay yup super nice i'm very happy with that girl gang if you got any questions comments concerns other stuff you'd like to see comments down below thanks so much peace out we'll see you all soon", "Tfi8g3XKdw0": "what's going on your bumbaclot sushi boy captain smoke man and as you can see my grinder has been through some things it actually used to be all black and if you look inside here a lot of gunk and stuff that I'm gonna try to scrape eventually but the main reason why I'm done with this grinder finally I'm a finally retired is because my Keef third chamber at the bottom the screen just doesn't work anymore basically there's an it doesn't collect Keef anymore it's kind of sad so yeah we're going to go ahead and retire this grinder here served us well on the captain of smoke channel here but today we have a new grinder the sharp stone version 2.0 honestly I've kind of been out of touch with the grinder technology so I don't know what this has a lot of hype around it or not but I walked into the smoke shop looking for a new grinder and didn't want to pay a crazy amount of money and you know found a nice three chamber sharp stone and it was actually only $35 so that's what really sold it for me so try to do this with one hand here nice looking teeth on them sharp so this material here the whatever it's coated in the black that it's coating in hopefully it's that like kief resistant stuff so that like what happened with my old grind or everything just gums up and sticks in there does it and then the Chamber's real quick it also comes with a nice little keep scraper inside so you can kind of just you know scrape the screen have the key fall down in there so this is really useful really happy it came with that and then obviously the third chamber down there you know that's for so without any further ado let's get this bad boy all tightened back up and we have some fresh gushers here jungleboy gushers so let's grind something and see alright so here we go nothing too crazy you know couple nugs in here a few nugs in here still a lot of space I didn't want to just over the crowded on the first go-round but I'm let's grind it up in and see what's going on here alright so a few turns let's see what we got here okay alright so there we have it so a nice amount in the second chamber there everything pretty much fell through a little bit left in the teeth which is normal and then you know nothing too serious it doesn't look like it's too gunky if you will like all of that looks like it'll come right on out with a couple you know nice little yeah alright guys so my first initial thoughts of it very smooth good size can hold a bunch so I'm happy so far so the next video I'll be coming back showing you guys how to clean your bong that way we can get a fresh hit you know on a nice clean bone of this jungle boys gushers alright man - ooh boy

"DBzgc6ObNxI": "okay everyone I wanted to do a review to show you how this herb grinder works it's by in a inner planetary development it comes in this bag which I really like that so it's just a cinch bag keeps it handy that you can travel with now I bought this to use for kitchen spices which if that's why you want this I don't think it's going to be the best thing you could use to grind your spices if you're using it for medicinal purposes and you have a medical marijuana card and you were using it for that I could see probably how this would work really great it is plastic inside were you actually grind beyond that the next layer is going to catch whatever you grind and there's a screen there if you can see it okay let a little cardamom as I do okay putting that on back now if anything falls through that screen if you have something fine enough to fall through that screen there's one more layer and that's the bottom layer here and it comes with this little guitar pick I guess to help you if you have really fine powdery substance that falls through that you could use that to gather it up so I used it for three spices and then I gave up so I saw someone's review that they used it for cinnamon and I was that's why I purchased it so I thought that it was actually going to work for that so I have a very small I mean this is a really small cinnamon stick I already snapped it in half they do come larger than this and fatter than this but I snap this in half as you can see if you're using this for kitchen herbs it's just it's not really going to be the most ideal thing to use right now I use um so it's basically impossible so okay we'll try with one in there so it's not going to work it's just it's not working so I've already tried the three herbs I'm just showing you oops ok that one fell out so the other herbs I tried was I tried some coriander the whole seeds and what happened with these is because fresh coriander is really nice to have freshly ground coriander I don't know if I already said it but right now if you don't know what to use for kitchen spices i use an electric coffee grinder so i may be repeating that i'm not sure um and again i'm going to try and show you and you'll see and maybe here then they just fall right through through those holes that are in there so it's not going to be good for coriander so last thing i will show you again if you're not using this for kitchen spices you don't even need to watch the rest of this video this is just the people that that was their intended use for it but again i mean if you're using this for medical marijuana then it seems like it would be pretty perfect for that so this is coriander or I'm sorry karma yeah my car my seat ok you can see the size and I will attempt again this is just going to be a little too many in there ok one fell out so all you have is for cardamom seeds I don't know who only needs four cardamom seeds ground at once but even though it will grind the cardamom but what happens is it's not a very it's not an ideal grind ok so I got it going this time yay all right now I'm going to unscrew it where I can find a car to mom and you can see how it ground it up it's a loop so then you can also see the coriander and there that just simply fell through and was never ground so you're still going to have big pieces of leaf like that so if you actually want it into a powder you're probably better off using a coffee grinder but I would definitely recommend this highly recommend it for anybody that needs it for medical purposes I hope that was helpful to you guys", "PjJ5bQJjAjY": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys welcome to hemp quarters inc it's abel garcia here aka the cowboy today i'm going to be showing you how to roll a cbd joint all right first things first we're going to get into our material so i'm going to be using a santa cruz shredder it's going to provide that perfect fluff you don't want your hemp turning into dust because it's not gonna enhance you're not gonna be able to inhale your flour properly you're gonna get a bunch of scooby snacks and you don't want that next you want to get your papers today we're gonna be using vibes king size until the cowboy rolls all right next you want to get a small rectangular piece of paper for your filter you want a filter to prevent you from inhaling scooby snacks that's why i use a filter then you want to get your flour today we're going to use hemp quarter zinc sour space candy [Music] this is some fire there's some gas right here it's really pungent still has that sour smell to it so it's gonna taste real good when you're inhaling that now we're gonna get into the process all right so first things first you want to get your filter ready what we're going to do is this thing called the w i learned this in one of whis khalifa's videos what you do is you fold the end like three or four times because you want to create a w to prevent [Music] you from inhaling scooby snacks get that nice get that nice w in there [Music] then you want to get your flower ready throw it in your santa cruz shredder or whatever grinder you're using [Music] we need a good amount of flour for this king size rolling up that loud yeah smell it [Music] all right now i'm going to be putting my flower in here spreading it across the paper [Music] and remember the paper has two sides it has a sticky side and the not sticky side so you want to throw your flower on the side that's sticky so whenever you're going to seal up your joint you seal it with the sticky side and now that my flowers evenly spread across the paper i'm going to get both ends and roll back and forth with my with my thumbs my thumbs on my middle finger [Music] roll back and forth index finger [Music] not too tight because you want some good airflow okay now tuck your filter in at the end whichever side [Music] and then you want to roll it back and forth again just a little bit then you get the bottom end of the paper to the end you're going to tuck it underneath the other side the top side of the paper and you're going to roll it over just roll it like that okay when you get to the sticky side we're gonna seal it up seal it right up here we go [Music] let's tuck that filter in [Applause] [Music] sealed up all the way to the top tap it down sometimes you want to add some more flour into the top so we're going to add some more flour [Music] okay put the rest of the flour and just now if you can't tuck it with your pinky it's not fat enough you just tuck it in like that add some more flour tuck it all the way to the top [Music] there you go you can tap it down seal it up [Music] cool there you go king size cbd joint [Music] look at that it's a clobber right there it's like a

"welcome back folks to another episode of the grinder review series here on the ismoke channel this is episode three featuring the canister v2 so i'm going to be taking you through this grinder in as much detail as i can muster right about now grab your bongs and let's get into it [Music] the canister grater v2 is an accessory sold by us smoking company riot spelled ryot a really cool thing about the riot team is that they sponsor a group of pro skaters in the us and canada so they have their own skate team which is just a million miles away from me unless i was playing tony hawk's pro skater 3 on my ps2 the materials used for the canister greater series are a hardened 60 stroke 61 aluminium or aluminum if you're in the us and a stainless steel mesh for the heat screen this is a 60 mesh stainless steel easy change screen which they include as a part of the canister greater v2 range forget two three or four pieces this is seven pieces and i'm gonna take it apart and show you it right now the first part is the puck lid we then have the vape plate this is two different plates and this is the vape plate which stores when not in use we then have a storage pot so you can store additional herbs in the canister grinder on the other side of the storage pot we have the top section of the grinder itself nice sort of texturized uh on the outside for grip as well as rings on the inside which are meant to help with stopping it jamming up we've then got this ring segment which holds the two grinder pieces together followed by the other plate this is the regular flower plate when you contrast it to the vape plate you can see how different they are the vape plate is designed to give a finer grind for using a vaporizer whereas the regular plate is for joints and bongs and underneath that we've got another ring section which has got the mesh keep catcher in and then we have the puck bottom also the keith storage system where the keith gets transferred into and a little pick canister pick for that as well so incredibly modular seven pieces plus the pick plus the screen which comes out so i guess you could be pedantic and say nine pieces to this grinder which is of course a lot more than you normally get with these bits of kit perhaps that is why it is called the world's most advanced grinder by the canister team and then it's magnetized around the actual grinder which is really cool you can get this without the screen attachment a bit of a smaller version in the uk or you could get this version or you could get a mini version and they all have different price points attached this will set you back around 60 pounds in the uk it retails at 90 or 85.90 for one with a clear segment here so you can see what is inside and the mini version of the grinder retails at 30 pounds or 40 45 i believe so it's not a cheap bit of kit in fact this version cost me the same pretty much maybe 10 pound cheaper than my santa cruz shredder in terms of the size this is 2.125 inches diameter and 3.75 inches in height which doesn't mean very much to me to be honest but the smaller version is 1.5 inches in diameter the canister grater v2 grinder features a lifetime warranty and that is a limited lifetime warranty it's against things like broken teeth and things like that so if the teeth chip in this which they don't expect to happen then they will replace it the material used to make the canister series is food grade aluminium it's also given a chemical bath each section is given a chemical bath and inspected to make sure that it is uh reaching you in top quality which i found really cool as well they list the fact that it has a spare plate that you can store and the lid which you can store weed in as a feature on this grinder and i'm inclined to agree i do think having multiple plates is certainly unique to the canister v2 they say that it has anti-residue rings and friction on the outside for easy grinding the anti-residue rings i don't think are the best out there like i do think that i have seen residue buildup and a little bit of sticking on my canister v2 but i do like the texture on the outside meaning it's quite nice to just kind of hold in your hands and even about from hand to hand although i don't recommend this you might end up with weed all over the floor another question i'd like to ask in this grinder review series is just how good is the keith screen so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna show you guys once again what it looks like they they say this is a real selling point they're easy to remove easy to clean although i need to clean mine mesh 60 still i've used this grinder a fair bit and i haven't taken any keyfat at the bottom i've not noticed as much keef buildup as maybe some other grinders actually you know it's not really built up a huge amount of keith using that screen for me so i don't know i mean it looks like a really good quality screen you can visibly see the hulls going through it but i haven't got a tremendous amount of keefe to show for it yet i counted the teeth on this side and there are 28 teeth they are very sharp you don't want to be sticking your fingers in there but there's 28 teeth and then various combinations of grind when you put them into whatever plate you're grinding it into right whilst easy to clean and maintain with a wire brush do get a little bit of weed in there and those trichomes build up so i would advise you keep this clean and don't let it build up for too long otherwise you might notice deterioration in how easy it is to grind and how much weed can it fit in it compared to other grinders i would argue that it can actually fit a fair bit of weed in it you've got several sections for storage the first section is um the actual grind plate itself right like you could just grind it up and underneath that is going to give you a little bit of weed storage there and then the other section that it has hasn't got several it's got two sections that you can store weed in actually is underneath the vape plate which you don't have to keep in so you could take the vape plate out and then you have a little puck for storing your herbs so this can store a fair amount of weed if you really wanted to this is so modular that if you just wanted storage and nothing else and you were leaving the house you can take the top and the bottom off the canister and you can put them together into a storage puck and how easy is it to clean i used a wire brush it looks like this and i simply used it to go like this and clean the plates and and get them shiny clean again so cleaned fairly easily so now to uncover the shreddability rating i'm going to actually use the canister grater we're going to smoke a bowl using ground up weed from this grinder and see how it treats us first i've got to put it all back together so the top goes on to here awesome i've got with me some slurricane some organic no-till chem dank grown slurricane and i'm gonna pop it into the canna store and we're gonna see how it shreds it up here we go so it's really easy once you pop it in there and stick the grinder together this is a super easy thing to do there is less resistance than you get from the majority if not all other grinders it really feels like there's there's nothing inside here as the plates get to work so that is really really cool let's see how it all it all went straight through so that's really cool as well the slurry cane was ground very easily and the weed inside has been shredded really nicely he's got a lovely to be fair he's got a pretty fine grinder anyway using the regular plate and that's really interesting in fact that is food for thought let me just grind up using the vape plate to see the difference it does take a little bit of time to switch over the plates to it's fine if you're just opening it up and using it and grinding with it but when you have to use that modular take apart put back together you do find that you are working out how to use it you know it's quite a technical grinder so i've popped in the the rest of the slurry cane in with the vape plate i'm just going to give it a nice grind just to see again very easy maybe a little bit more resistance with a vape plate it is pushing it through a much smaller area and as you can see most of it's gone through i did notice that if you are going to find a little bit of weed left above the grinder than it is when you use the vape plate you know and it can build up some trichomes in that vape plate because the the holes are so small so just bear that in mind smells fantastic let's see how it compares i mean you could argue that the vape plate has done a finer grind but i would argue that it is not going to make much difference between those two levels of grind so i'd personally just stick to one plate or the other because the normal plate grinds it up really finely anyway let us see how the flavour of the slurry cane comes through with the grind of the canister grater v2 if you're joining me for this one get yourselves ready get your joints rolled your bowls packed your dab rig's heated up those vaporizers switched on and of course hit that pause button if you need to i'm about to smoke some slurry cane using weed ground up in the canister grater v2 grinder join me for this and i'll see you all on the other side cheers folks [Music] i'll tell you what that was really good ground weed really um consistent in its in its uh texture in its density and that meant that it went through the bong really really smoothly i'm actually really impressed with that i've been smoking this weed a lot using a grinder using a different grinder that's my daily driver and that might just be a little bit better i'm going to pop some of the vape plate weed into the bong and we're just going to do a second one just to get an idea of if there's any difference and my bong is how i will know that because i use this thing every day join me for this bong number two of the slurry cane using the canister grater v2 and i'll see you all on the other side [Music] cheers [Music] again giving a really good smoking experience which comes from consistency the weed being good obviously is a priority but the grind being nice and consistent really does help that so yeah versus the hand shred that is gonna win every time so what do i like about it i really like the modular aspect of it it's a really cool look i like how it all fits together i like how technical it can be on one aspect but then that is also a bit of a drawback for the newer consumer i mean you've got to figure out how to slot all these parts together it becomes a little bit like a puzzle especially when you're stoned uh but it's completely doable so what do i like about the canister grater i like that it's textured and i like that it's got modular parts that fit together nicely but then there are some things that leave to be desired such as how technical it is to use for a new user of it you're going to have to familiarize yourself with the pieces and it did get harder to grind after some use requiring a bit of cleaning but let's give it a score as we do in the grinder review series starting with the appearance i'm gonna give this one a nine out of ten i really like the look of it i deliberately got it in rose gold which isn't a color i'd normally pick probably far away from a color i'd normally pick um but i really like the look of the canister grater i like how tall it is i like how it sort of feels in the hand as well and it just looks like a nice bit of kit it's all rounded it's got a nice sort of texture yeah really good marks in terms of the appearance i think it might be a little bit over complicated which has kind of lost it a mark for me with the extra vape plate which was initially i think a perk for me when i then compared the grind and they looked relatively similar i thought i'm not going to really use that very much so i'm going to give it a 7 for you some functionality it is going to get really good marks in terms of shreddability it's going to get a 9 for shred ability because it's really really nice to get that herb clean crisp bong smoking experience um which is kind of the best shredding grinder i think i've got for how how the wheat smokes in a bong which is saying something you know and finally price it is coming in quite expensive at 60 pounds not the most expensive grinder on the market but then again not very cheap so i'm gonna give it another seven in terms of the price so overall the canister grater v2 gets eight out of ten in our grinder review series that puts it up there with the santa cruz shredder i don't know which i prefer out of the two they work better in different areas i love the ease of the santa cruz shredder and it is my daily driver but then again this just performed better with the bong smoking experience which is really important to me so i like that a lot make sure you stay in tune for more episodes of our grinder review series coming very soon what's your favorite grinder please leave your comments below i'm building a list of episodes that i'm going to add to

heritage of cannabis stewardship in Santa Cruz County so we're gonna cover about 50 plus years and about 10 minutes so thank you for joining us so we'll start with my interview with Michael founder of coastal seeds also known as Kaju and this is from his personal testimony so starting in the 1960s so santa cruz as a community back in the 60s was a small sleepy beach town the population about 30,000 people this is right before the university opened and we had a very kind of small community that was really sleepy and focused on on the the beach culture and so Michael moved here in 55 and the history of progressive values in Santa Cruz County seemed to be the perfect fertile breeding ground for for cannabis culture to take root many locals in the 60s were drafted and and served in Vietnam and those Vietnam veterans were exposed to cannabis use amongst other substances but many of those veterans brought those seeds back and that's the beginning the inception of Santa Cruz as a cultural and genetic hotbed of diverse varietals and cultivars from rare places like Vietnam or Thailand at this time in the 60s all the cannabis being consumed especially when the veterans came back from serving was imported cannabis we saw many many varieties from Vietnam it come back with our service members it was extremely underground cannabis culture at this time this was not an open thing that you discussed with your friends you only shared with your most trusted family or friends and the veterans were very keen on taking these seeds that they brought back and starting to experiment but still at this time everything was imported and coming in on barges right outside the Santa Cruz Coast meanwhile the people the youth were participating in the hippy highway and going abroad on on pilgrimages and and adventures and and using the seeds that they found in the flowers while abroad bringing those back smuggling it in so there was an influx of imported cannabis genetics coming to the Santa Cruz Mountains and and this is the very beginning of of domestic collecting of genetics and using it meanwhile in the Central Coast the Cassidy's were a famous family that were someone the first to have these public harvest parties Patrick Cassidy is a local legend and he had the tradition of taking his best mother plant and throwing it on a fire as a sacrifice to give back to the earth and give thanks for for the harvest and the yield and again this was a very underground time so this was a very privileged endeavor to be a part of the Cassidy harvest parties and again these these were very underground guerilla growers most likely growing in trees in redwood trees in different gorilla grows and they would have to carry in all their soil all their compost and all their water in backpacks that they would make and retrofit to to stay away from from the police and law enforcement and also neighbors that might rat you out so the Cassidy's were also the first family to remove the male's from their garden this is a major breakthrough in cannabis cultivation when we remove the male's we create sinsemilla which means seedless cannabis and that was a major development and still to this day having the Cassidy legacy here in Santa Cruz in the Central Coast I mean that changed cannabis cultivation forever and began our process of understanding the differences between the two sexes and how those males produce pollen and you can find specific traits through the art of selection and breed those traits to specific females which led to building the legendary strains that won cups across the decades", "50Bgkz1Tyfw": "hey you do coming back at you from O'Connell Wood Werks grow tent obviously I just wanted to give you guys a quick update showing you that from the last video I was telling you guys that the flowering process has been delayed and after I don't know it did a couple days out I let her hang out outside for a few days with Miss nibbles Hayes who's doing fantastic out there I'm gonna have to do a video of her but um so I had her out there for a few days and then it we had a big thunderstorm so I brought them both in and the timer was still set to 1212 after one night of it being in the tent with the other plant which is outside now she started popping some pistols so I just kept her in here and been running 12 12 cents actually I've been running like 13 hours of darkness in 11 hours of light just because I wanted to ensure that she knew that I wanted her to switch or I just wanted to make sure that it was gonna happen and it seems maybe I think some strains actually require maybe more darkness than others possibly I don't know but that's basically what I had to do to get this one to flip was to around 13 hours of darkness so it is doing quite well now I went a little cut crazy little chomp crazy here some some of these branches will literally just be a top and maybe a couple little sided notes but I went a little crazy I don't know if that was necessary and we'll see what kind of what kind of top that creates by me having done that we'll see I'm not too happy with the fact that I did that to that extent that it is what it is now already did it and there's no adding it back some of these though will be pretty stacked this is one of the like main tops right here and you can see that's already getting and getting pretty big pretty quick and then over here here's the other top and that's about the same story it's got a bunch of shoot shoot offs and looks like it's pretty healthy quite healthy yeah so I just want to give you guys an update tell you what I had to do to get her to flip because I was having some issues she wasn't even showing sex after like I said a few days outside and then in here with that other plant overnight I started seeing pistols so I just kept her in here and she's been entering flower I just changed out her nutrient solution yesterday with the fresh batch with more bloom solution instead of grow I'm only doing half the amount of grow I was doing before and I think I think on the schedule while my voice just did something weird but on the schedule next week I will be just eliminating the grow completely which is the nitrogen and such honestly I've heard people don't even use Poirot when you're using when they use general hydroponics is what I use the nutrient hydroponic solution liquid solution yeah I've heard that people don't even use the grow part the entire process so a lot of people say it's just too much nitrogen but I've been using it and it hasn't hasn't burned the plant and it doesn't seem like it's got any nitrogen nitrogen excess or any of that really so I think I'm just gonna continue with that from now on until I learn otherwise but so it tell me if you think I'm doing a stupid decision here but I think I'm gonna switch from doing DWC to doing cocoa I'm just thinking that it would be easier as far as having to control the temperature because with disks and how thin the plastic walls are these HDPE by the way it is food grade safe but because of how thin these plastic walls are pretty much the water temperature becomes what it is what the air temperature is the ambient air temperature so I mean my wife and I usually like it a little warmer than I know the plant really wants it I know there's a super simple solution or a super simple reason why nutrients are soaked up better with cold water than warm water but I don't have like I I'm not gonna go buy some water cooler machine to cool down I just don't want to run a bunch of machines I like the bubbler that's that's almost too much in itself honestly I want to just grow [Applause] a little simpler and let the cocoa medium be a buffer to my laziness so I mean tell me if I'm being silly next next time I pop some seeds it's going to be some Otto flowers that I got from growers choice so I'll post an affiliate link down below if you want to go grab some seeds and Tom that I sent you they probably won't give me a discount but you can use that affiliate link and you can help out my page so that I can continue showing you guys some content showing you guys what I do and I will actually ask them if they can give me a discount code but I don't know if they do that but so anyway I'm gonna be starting with I got some bubblegum Auto flour I got some gorilla glue Auto flour what was the third one I'll pineapple Express auto flour so I made you all three strains at one time is what I'm thinking I'm gonna do all three strains one two three I'm going to for the first time I'm gonna try I think I'm gonna try low stress training and see how they do in low stress train all right you know what maybe I should try to like the laziest method possible I think well that would be just not touching it I'm not gonna do that because I feel like that's just wasting my time and growing but I want to this is what I want what I really want to do is the plant outside that's my backyard that way my plant outside I want to want to see if I can grow another plant similar to that because the way I did it was top at like the third node and but I left the second and third branches and then I stretched them stretch them that way in that way so I have a cross of branches basically and then off of those that have a bunch of top start to grow up I'll go make a video soon after this but so that's what I really want to try to achieve with my future grows because if I can do that same method and do it good each time and it actually recovers well and gets to some good vegetation vegetative growth I think that is probably the easiest and best way for me to grow anyway for how I like to do it so check out go to my page guys and check out that video I'll post that probably either later today or tomorrow but anyway I'm gonna get out of here and go eat dinner because my wife has been slaving over dinner for the past couple hours and I at least owe to hurry up and go eat but thanks for watching

for future videos I also do some product reviews like vaporizer product reviews and grinders and such I still need to do a grinder review on the the santa cruz shredder that's badass grinder by the way anyway see you guys next time thanks for stopping by subscribe and I'll see you probably next week have a great week guess what", "aa-cGDpOT0g": "hello again grill gang so i'm going to put this all together today the whole point of buying the raw grinder it was to go with the six shooter to make sure i got a good grind make sure this all is working properly we're going to show you how it all works we're going to take some fresh durbin poison and i'm going to pop it into the grinder here definitely i don't you know i'm sure this thing's capable of handling stems and whatnot but i do like to reduce the weed down to just the buds so we're gonna pop these in here and grind up half this half of this bud here maybe most of it let's see if i can get it all in here i don't know if he said anything about overloading it that's not too overloaded i wouldn't think get it down in there get it off the magnet and then slap it all together and grind frying fried the daily grind all right it feels a little fluffy in there it looks like you got most of it down through let's give it a few more twists choppity chop it's pretty darn good down there down there now i'm planning on rolling three j's so i don't know exactly how much herb i'm going to need but these are the king size not the one and a quarter so it's going to be a pretty good amount so we'll go ahead and finish this butt off get this all tucked in here nice and neat now when you get a stock left with all these little flower tips on here i like to just pull those off and we'll throw them back in the bin kind of like that just loosen them take them all right off waste not want that recycle reuse call me cheap call me frugal call me what you will i am saving money for everybody and that is really my whole point save time save money save effort if i can help you out it helps me out if it helps me out i'm sure it'll help you out and that is basically where i'm at so let's get it all inside the container here and keep it off the magnet jam it in there heavy duty [ __ ] grinder abuse it really can't because it's so well machined it just uh it all just goes together and slides so well see yeah cc okay so let's see how much that fluffed up let's go ahead and take a look at that that all got out of there let's see how much we got down here yeah that's a pretty good amount let's go ahead and grind up a little bit little more a little more now that was the some purple bud uh from the durban purple punch and this is regular durban purple and like i say even though it's the same genetic strain there is a tendency of the purple to look and smell and taste differently i also noticed that they were smaller buds on that and this is these are fairly good sized little buds coming off of here so we're only going gonna put three in the first time around but the difference in smell the durbin purple punch is more floral and spicy i think like an anise kind of a smell to it and this greener stuff has more of an og aroma to it i think so we're going to mix this up here make a little toss salad toss it up grind it on down doing a pretty good job there spin it around grind grind grind 180s that's pretty close it's going to throw a little bit more in there one more time i think i'm going to leave the tip of this bud to smoke in a bomb later that sounds good so two more two more big chunks here and away we go i'll start filling up this six shooter now i'm just gonna do three cones and show you the versatile versatility of the uh raw six shooter here really get down in some detail about it okay so that is pretty good i'm really pretty happy with that grind grind grind pop pop pop got a little bit left it's probably getting full down there shake it up a little bit mix it up let's go ahead and take a look and see how much we got in there now should be enough for three j's i would think yeah that's a pretty good amount they got enough room a little bit of room to toss it around in there a little bit of room all right so keep the moisture out so now the six shooter the six shooter it has a little container here i'm sure i could dump that right out into here but i just use that i just never use that so that has its own special use here i'll show you in a minute so i got three cones in here already but not set up for it so i gotta spin this around and line them up make sure that i'm set up for it so you just back that pin out a little bit and this guy in here spins around like an old rotary phone dial so now there's two on this side and one on that side that one's not quite lining up so let me back that one up and move it over one so like i say these are the king sides are fairly long and we line that up lock this down lock this down with a little screw in there that way that doesn't move and they're lined up drop your other cone in the hole take your poker and poke it down into the holes you don't want to go too far because those tips need to be down here so it really keep pays to keep this thing level while you're poking it that way it doesn't go too far so now let's put a little bit in gonna get it from down here so let's go ahead and dump a little bit in now you don't want to do too much at once because the whole point is to get it down to the tip so you're going to put in a little bit and make sure that it goes into the holes and don't let it overflow any one particular spot and then what i do when i'm packing my tip is i just drop it down in here a couple of times make sure that it's down in the tip because that's usually where most people are missing out the other thing that's real nice about this fluffy stuff is it it is really it really is fluffy and it's really nice to to pack so pop pop pop all right and then you can get a little more aggressive with uh how much you're putting in and fill it up in the middle backpack pack backpack pack backpack pack and get some more on that one i know you can't see all this very well so i'm going to move it up here a little bit probably can't see it at all now that it occurs to me you can see it a little bit all right so get this a little closer here so you guys can see so the whole point is that uh you basically get it in there and you shake it down into the holes and you tap it down and then you pack it down with the stick you fill up the holes and you pack it down with the stick and when you're done packing and filling and holding and packing and all that [ __ ] [ __ ] then you take you leave a little bit in there because it's going to fill it up and seal up your grinder put your lid back on and now you tamp it down come back and hit it one more time pack them down in there good and then this base sits here and when you set this on this it pops your joints up for you zap and you have a perfectly filled cone and that is the raw system and if you don't like that you must be a little bit crazy that's all i got to say some people like to twist them up i like to to pinch and fold into the middle makes a joint that looks like that and then you can give it a little squeeze and twist i guess if you want i'm just old school roller so tap tap tap tap tap pack it down a little bit it's already pretty well packed look at that bam three joints just like that quicker than you can quicker than you can say [ __ ] man i need a joint this is uh raw josh i gotta say brother this is a really nice system i i really i'd gotten away from joints for years just because it's you know it's kind of tedious but this is so goddamn simple i really like it really like it so i've taken the smoking some joints now german poison joints bam just like that got a little extra weed left over oh boy into the bin it goes lid back up raw look at that fits right on the top of that i just love it when things fit smoothly you see that look at that it's hardly any motion side to side it fits right on the top of that lid isn't that crazy huh i wonder if they designed it that way look at that makes it of course would make a perfect fit for the bottom of that too nice peace out bro gang hope to see you all soon", "0NJQzCog5WM": "[Music] hey you it's Paul from defining the box where we're defining the box help you think outside of it this week we have the SLX grinder it has its own patented on stick coating three takeaways from this is the coatings actually working pretty awesome I haven't really put it to the test but I love it so far the build quality and Magnon strength is top-notch third it has a removable screen where you can take it out and then dump it into whatever you want which makes it easy to access your teeth catch very unique grinder a new take on it got a three point four to only reason it's a little bit pricier otherwise it's our highest rated grinder thus far who is this floor jarett jarett's willing to pay that higher premium price point for something quality he's down to pay a little bit more Stacey just a lot ever price no Nance I'm really worth it for her the overall score is made up of four ratings grinder got a 4.2 it tears through any product like some butter like butter storage I've got a 3.7 a little bit smaller than some other grinders storage but it makes it really easy to access it it was an amazing key catch longevity I got a 4.0 it's an amazing build quality pretty sure has a lifetime warranty too but they're very particular about who you can buy it from price you got a 2.2 it is more expensive at $60 from authorized resellers you can only buy it in head shops they're just very particular if you want to get your warranty you have to make sure you get it from our authorized reseller I dive into all these ratings later in this video at defining the box the way we get to our overall scores from series of ratings and personal weight if you want to see the most up-to-date ratings and personal weights and how it all works just check the description and I'll give you more details about first rating is grinder grinder got a 4.2 that's the whole process around getting from the unground product to ground product it's mated with three subcategories around capacity prime speed and grind consistency grind capacity you got a 3.5 that's how much product you can fit in the top without affecting its grind ability it's an amazingly smooth grinder but the closer grind teeth doesn't allow for a bunch of storage grind speed I got a 4.4 that's just how fast you can get it from an unground to ground product literally it's just like to twist it's an amazingly smooth grinder the last is grind consistency you got a 4.7 that's how easy it falls through the holes and then just how consistent of a product you have at the end of it as they say it has a feathery consistency the hole size is perfect where it just Falls straight through with no issues the second rating is storage it got a 3.7 that's the process of getting it from your grinder into your consumption device it's made up of four categories storage capacity dispense speed keef catch and portability storage capacity I got a 3.5 that's just how much ground product you can fit in here it's a 2.4 inch grinder and it's a pretty skinny but has a unique storage aspect it actually allows for more product to go through and has a nice smooth out walls that actually protect your product dispense speed it got a 4.0 that's how fast you can get it from your grinder into your consumption device it's really a quick easy threading here it's super easy to get out and then you can just take it out dump it keeps your keep catch unexposed you've cache got a 4.0 that's if there is a key catch and then if it's really good so with this one it's a very unique one that's connected you just can take it out to access it in comes a little guitar pick I don't think that's what's meant for it but as a guitar pick looking thing and then also has a little scoop that's standard with multiple also because you can pour this out when you're getting your product out normally you like dump it but since we're doing this it keeps your Keith and then it allows your Keith cache to work better keeps it nice and crispy and clean crispy clean doughnuts portability got 3.0 that's how easy it is to bring a few and then do it's bringing like another thing to carry it it is a pretty skinny grinder for all of its storage capacity but it still hockey puck grinder and I really wouldn't want to put this thing in my pocket longevity you got a 4.0 that's just how frequent you're gonna be using this thing and how long it will last in your stash collection longevity applies to all products across all categories it's based up of 5 sub categories ease of use cleaning frequency ease of cleaning durability and customer service ease if you've got a 4.0 that's if there's any initial learning curve and then once you make it past the initial learning curve how easy is it on your life this is a standard hockey puck renders so no real learning curve at all but just the amount of and the twist makes it really easy in my wrist it's just a very easy product to use and the whole dispensed aspect it's kind of game-changing it wasn't really I've never thought about using a grinder like that but it definitely has opened my eyes to that ease of use cleaning frequency I got a 4.5 that's how often you have to clean it and can you get away with not cleaning it that's something really strive for is with this nonstick coating you're not to clean it very often there's no power through most things do take into account I'm in Colorado where our product is not as sticky a little bit dryer product up here ease of cleaning it got a 2.8 is once you have to clean it how easy it is to clean give it a more unique coating that benefits a lot it also leaves me questioning how to really clean it there particularly where you can't use like a certain types of toothpicks you'd be very very careful to not dislodge the coating keep that in mind you can't use the standard isopropyl alcohol trick with this one or if you can it's just not very well communicated on really no durability got a 4.8 that's its ability to withstand elements and then something happens what's its warranty pretty sure this thing has a lifetime warranty what's it super articulated on the website the build quality is amazing like the magnet feels like it's well strong and I think I feel like throw this against my wall and have no issues they are very particular about like where you buy it from if you buy it from a non authorized seller they're not gonna foul up the warranty make sure to buy it from their authorized sellers I'll link it all in the description customer-service got a 4.0 is once you run into a problem how easy is it to solve they have pretty awesome customer service but you have to be particular about where you buy it from they don't have any authorized Amazon sellers but if you want to cheap grinder you can go on Amazon get it but if you want to buy the top-notch grinder you have to go through authorized resellers lastly is prices you got a 2.2 that's how it's priced relatively some other products on the market with other grinders on Amazon for like eight ten dollars it is a more of an expensive price point but you're definitely getting a premium product here but for $60 to the authorized resellers it's hard to compete many of these eight to ten dollars renders on Amazon they get the job done but they're probably not gonna last as long as this thing well in summary it's pretty awesome grinder you pay a little bit more to get that quality but the coating is really cool the kief catch is a very unique experience the innovator on small little things but they did a great job innovating on if you want to buy one just click

really hope I'm pronouncing that right but these things are amazing they're made out of recycle their aluminum aircraft aluminum there's a certain grade but this stuff is you can if you can tell it's it's durable but this thing is all about innovation and changing the way grinders are the way the teeth are set here I believe re completely redesigned you can see they're buff up a little bit the way the holes are little ashtray hold a little bit of weed you can see it holds a pack of papers in there but then not only that you know we always get our grinder stuck because all them threads getting hooked up and stuff these things have just like that small little lock on so keep it that's locked all the way and you don't have to sit there and tighten it and it just takes a little bit to untighten it you know what I'm saying it but it's not like it's so much that it's gonna pop open and the magnet on here is like the most intense magnet that I think that you can buy to see I can't get this thing separated without both hands set this down for a second see them with the above there we go so yeah it's not easy to come off and a grinder as you can see here the the screens forget one micron they are but they are interchangeable and you can order them I'm not sure if they you have to send this in I'd have to make sure and check with them but they are interchangeable and I believe they have different sizes and that would be nice to you know collect different sizes if you know what strains you're running through and everything whatnot I have not used it yet because I have not harvested yet and I refuse to run anything that is not good quality through this grinder this is going to be my top shelf grinder pretty much but anyways this is the last piece here the bottom piece and you can see it's rounded edges here let me focus sorry about a dirty everything it looks but then it comes with a like guitar looking pick and it's not as thick as a guitar pick but the one corner fits perfectly in here so it's like you can clean this thing out perfectly with this tooth there uh pick here you know so and I really like the color of it on the green and the green really pops go

much anything at ease and will cut down on prep time don't let the affordable price fool you this grinder is made of maximum strength aircraft grade aluminum for extra toughness durability and best quality it has powerful neodymium magnets which means you will have an amazing closure freshness and odor control and it also has a thin poly o-ring for smooth grinding and less friction just in case you will need it in the future your package includes spare parts of one o-ring one cotton three wicks three flints and one pollen catcher more wick can be purchased in art and craft shops or online the backup permanent match is easy to use all you have to do is fill the grinder with lighter fluid dip the match inside then scrape it against the ferro magnesium rod to create a flame there is an adjustment period at first strikes so use it more to learn how to create a spark with each strike you can replace the wick by removing the flint striker with pliers fold a new wick on the flint insert

break my phone now you can't reply is killing me this time but next time did I must see you [Music]", "i5aEN47uJTI": "hey everyone welcome to weed 101 today we are going to talk about grinders now there are two types of two basic types of grinders you can run into the first it's going to be your more simple to section grinder to piece it's super simple I also have teeth on the inside you put your product in there good a few turns it grinds up on the other side you've got a for sexual grinder you still have the teeth except it's got holes in the bottom of that layer and your product goes through here now that that's yeah three three pieces right there some do stop a bit but a lot of will have what they call a Keith catcher pollen capture chamber all these four pieces now there's not much amiss for a couple reasons one this metal grinder grinds very finely and so I tend to use this mostly just for vaporizers the other thing is that the I use a riot box a Wicca box so it automatically sifts most of my pollen for me so we're no simple here just take your your grinder take a nice piece of weed this is some Chernobyl you don't really have to worry about the same thing stems because if you do this just a couple of gentle turns any seeds these stems that are there you can pick out now why we pick out seeds and stems do you have two seeds yes pick them out stems you don't have to why would you because it's harsh it's it just makes the smoke more harsh so once you've ground up and picked out any seeds and stems that are about that size are bigger now I personally saved those so I can vaporize them later you can save them to make stem tea or if you're gonna make edibles by steeping your weed in some kind of oil or fat you can save those and use those later but in the end what you end up with is product that's round about like that and so that's going to do it for grinding as far as the technical aspect why you can break up using your fingers grinder is gonna give you better consistency it's going to keep your hands clean ER because this is sticky or it should be anyway but yeah it's it's a lot of convenience and it's a lot of just kind of uniform consistency so that comes into play more importantly what we're talking about how things burn whether you want your bowls burn evenly or if you want a decent joint so these are all things we're going to discuss it away at a point after so it's coming up right now that's how you grind weed at this point you can take this you can put it in a bowl you can put in a joint you can do any number of things with it the choice is yours so for weed 101 grinding this is John have a great day", "fTe7qLetdz8": "hey guys Jeremy from East Coast here due to product today for the banana brothers Otto this is a product that we will carry in our stores it is an electric grinder and comb roller so anyone out there who either doesn't know how to roll a cone or prefers not to if you're like me I actually get an allergic reaction like a skin irritation if I touch flour because I have a lot of seasonal allergies I also get you know if I get any of the crystals on my hand it just makes me sneeze I feel kinda gross so this is a great product makes sense to use it again banana brothers Otto we're gonna unbox it right here I'm gonna show you guys how to use this thing so I like that actually comes in a nice box they do did a pretty good job with packaging it pop this thing open here first thing on top is just a card and on the back here you have some very specific in simple visual instructions on how to operate this thing I think it's great that they do this make it super easy put that there for now the top part of the grinder which is actually the thing that grinds the flower is this black piece here pop it open like this massive teeth it's spring-loaded so it's easy to load up I also love that they make it easy these actually come right out so that when you know you got when you use it frequently it gets the flower gets all kicked in there and it's it's easy to clean you pop those out you can rinse them and you can get it nice and clean now bottom part here is a tube this is where you put the code and this grinds everything up puts it right in there everything is magnetized on this which I like so simple you just put it right down it connects super easy now let's pop these out here here it comes with so Kohn's their banana brothers premium cones these are natural and unbleached which I like you can actually use others I prefer the raw ones just my particular taste but these will work right now here down here you got an instruction booklet now we have a little box that has all the accessories aside here all the accessories for the for the piece here so let's pop the soap into it it comes with alright so first thing I'll show you is if you don't want to use it as like an automatic roller you prefer to roll your own this actually has a little cup measures out 1/2 gram full gram gram and a half you can obviously dump it in something else as well if you're just breaking up more you want to use it for grinding up the flour so if we pop that right off we got another attachment here this is actually something that just makes it easy pop the flour and put it right down it doesn't you know helps you not to make a mess so that doesn't shred up all over the place that pre roll to can easily throw a cone in there you don't get it crushed up you carry it with you this here is just a little piece it does go in the bottom of here so that you can use different size cones you don't have to use the standard size that it comes with you can use smaller ones if you prefer to roll some smaller it's it just easy there's charging cord it is micro USB here we got you know a brush you just clean the teeth of the grinder with it and I like to use the end of this to just kind of poke down any flour that you have because it doesn't pack it that's the one complaint that I would have is that it does do a good job of getting all the flour in the cone but you got to pack it down otherwise it's just a little too loose now pop this off here's this is the last thing I'll show you it's a cat goes right on here so you don't spill flour when you store it put it away on the whole love this thing so what I'm gonna actually do is I'm going to show you how easy this thing is to use over here we got some flour good friends over at Boston Empire we get some white whale CVG check them out they always have good quality stuff I love their flour so let's pop a cone in is that they look like decent quality the one thing I will say about the banana brothers cones here is the paper that's down in the filter it it's not it's not the best quality so it kind of gets all crunched up and whatnot that's why I prefer the raccoons but these will you know suffice and comes with the machine so we pop that right in there I'm gonna do so we're going to load some flour in here now if you have a scale you can easily easily measure it out so you know what you're what you're rolling up you know it's you don't want to overload it it can definitely bog this thing down and put a little more stress on the motor than you want you don't want to burn out faster than you you'd like so turn it on you push that down right there you hold it kind of does a little shimmy the teeth move a little bit just to get it going and all you gotta do is push the button that quick after that pop it off because everything's magnetized it just pulls this right up so you can grab the cone but even if not there's some slide things here you can push this back down you can slide it right out so you can grab it and drive it here I said I usually use this brush tool you can use a pen whatever something to just kind of pack everything down there you go easy made pre-rolls doesn't make a mess you'll have to touch anything really love this product definitely check it out we sell this in our store and on our website one of my favorite products that we have that obviously isn't CBD related but I love to use it I love to mix the flowers we live in a legal state here in Massachusetts so you know we go to the dispensary get some flower that's in the range of about 20 to 25 percent THC and then use some of my favorite favorite hemp strains weigh it out do a one to one and then you can get you know really the therapeutic value of both THC and CBD whether you smoke it or you're grinding it up and you're gonna cook with it this is a great product so again guys check us out WWE Scotch herbalist calm and stay tuned we will definitely give more product reviews the links for the product will be down below so check us out thanks guys", "U_FweVNqDyk": "[Music] hey there team and welcome to Canadian cannabis for today we're gonna be checking out another grinder to try and help you guys figure out what grinder is the best for you and if you're a medical marijuana patient or you just want to have the cleanest flower possible you might want to check out this Genesis grinder by the awesome people at MMJ grind so let's do it together right now as we can see we have this beautiful three-inch grinder it's got this nice wooden kind of look to it very very nice look and first thing I noticed that's a little different is going to be this plastic on the outside so let's talk about that first as you can see both sides are going to have these little plastic parts that have these little indents so that's going to make it super easy to not only get grip but it gives you somewhere to put your fingers so that you could turn it super easily this grinder is made so that if you have hand problems wrist problems finger problems anything like that you will still be able to use it because you have great grip on the outside so absolutely love that so we talked about the beautiful nice wooden kind of look to it we talked about this beautiful little grip now let's keep on going as we could see it's going to be a two piece grinder that we have here so let's open this bad boy up and see exactly what the pieces have to offer so just gonna open it up here we got a little click when we open it up so that's cool as you could hear when we open it and close it it's got a nice little click that keeps everything safe so I do love that let's open this bad boy up and there we have our grinder as you could see this guy is going to be made out of aluminum metal but the aluminum is on through a hard anodized process to harden it and make it just as hard as iron steel so you never have to worry about any little particles going into your cannabis absolutely awesome and not only that if you look very closely right here you can see this little black Oh ring this is called the friction reduction ring and it's made out of P om which is a medicinal grade plastic that reduces the friction of the grinder by buffering the two main parts and again because that's medicinal you don't have to worry about it breaking down and getting into your cannabis I absolutely love that idea there's so many grinders out there right now that it's really hard to pick the right one for you so I love that this one uses top-quality ingredients medical quality ingredients so that to make sure you're never gonna be smoking your grinder because why would you want to smoke your grinder that is craziness so we've talked about but look a little bit we've talked about the awesome what it's made out of everything's medicinal now let's talk about these teeth I mean the first thing I see on the teeth you can see it's going to be the nice little S shape that we've definitely seen before but there's something just a little bit different about this grinder if you look on a little angle here you could see that all the teeth are going to be different heights we have smaller medium and tall teeth making it so that you have a gradual grind so that you're not ripping and tearing and destroying your cannabis because you have different heighted teeth they actually will grind at a different rate just awesome so what I'm going to do is right here as you saw and as I just said we have these teeth that are just a little bit lower and the reason for that is that's where you're gonna put your cannabis so you don't just have to squish and dish your cannabis throwing it into your grinder it actually has a place where it fits right there just awesome so as you can see you could fit about half a gram to a gram into this grinder which is just perfect for a personal joint so let's is there anything else that I wanted to mention we talked about this beautiful o ring that's gonna make sure you're not degrading your grinder you're not destroying your grinder and it's gonna keep a nice smooth grind so I mean I'm pretty sure that's it let's bust up some flour and see how this bad boy grinds so I put the gray I put the grinder I put the cannabis in here I'm gonna leave my stem usually I would take the stem out take all that out because no one wants to smoke stem but I want to see how this bad boy grinds so we're gonna keep the stem we're gonna keep everything in here I'm just gonna take the top put it on top till I hear the little click where is my click oh there we are so now I've heard my click and I'm just gonna start turning now usually a lot of people just go full force and start turning but with this one because the teeth are gradually gonna get bigger you just turn a little bit slowly Jesus I really thought there would be more effort than this but there's absolutely no effort as you can see I could just use these two fingers here and still just a beautiful easy slide putting no effort whatsoever I really hope when we open it up this is gonna be ground properly because I mean I'm barely having to work at all to turn this bad boy not only because I have a huge easy place to put my fingers but also because of that little black what did they call it friction reduction ring that's making it so that there's no friction at all you can see just using my fingers here so that should be more than enough we've gone back and forth a few times let's dump our we're out here and see how it ground so just gonna dump it out here as you could see nothing left in the grinder ground perfectly there's no big chunks anywhere and this flower is perfectly ground as you saw before I put the stems in here I put everything in here and I cannot see them in the slightest it completely ground the stem absolutely perfectly but didn't destroy my cannabis my cannabis still has beautiful structure to it it didn't just turn it into a complete powder and there's not tons of cannabis just stuck to my grinder it's actually working I love it and so so smooth to turn I knew it was smooth when I didn't have any flour in it so like that's to be expected but I swear there was almost no difference to when I have no flour to when I actually put flour between the different sized heads that they have that make a gradual kind of grind and between the o-ring that they put making it super smooth to turn the giant grip that they give you it goes so easily all you have to do is quarter turn quarter turn quarter turn and you are pretty much done just a beautiful grinder I absolutely love it and one of my favorite parts about this grinder is they actually have an affordable version because I know there's a lot of beginner smokers out there that just don't want to spend $100 plus on a grinder and with these bad boys you don't have to this guy is going to be just 60 bucks and they even have a cheaper version for just ten dollars now usually I would say stay away from any grinder that cost ten dollars it is definitely gonna fall apart on you but these guys did it properly even the ten dollar grinder is still made with all medic parts so you know you're gonna get a quality cannabis at the end of it I absolutely love it now I'm really hoping they're gonna make a four piece grinder cuz you know I love to collect my Keef but for now this two piece Genesis by the good people at MMJ grind is just awesome beautiful look to it but more importantly it actually works awesome so that's been this week's episode of Canadian cannabis trying to help you guys pick the right grinder for you hope you enjoyed today's episode hope to see you next time and as always peace

we are going to talk about my new favorite weed grinders so just recently i had somebody in my twitch stream asked me what the best weed grinder was shout out to shammy who put me on this journey of finding the best grinder well i found this there's a lot of expensive grinders out there that don't seem special so i went on a little mission looking for a new weed grinder and i wanted to see if i could come up with something better i've used a bunch of grinders over the years and i hadn't really put too much thought in the quality of my grinder but i can honestly say this is the best quality grinder i've ever had so i went on a little journey to find a new weed grinder and i came across a lot of options some of them over a hundred dollars for what didn't even seem like an impressive grinder i was very impressed with this one because it's comparable to a lot of the higher end ones however it's half the cost of a lot of these expensive grinders that i've seen so the slicks grinder like a lot of the other high-end grinders is made out of aerospace aluminum goddamn spaceship metal however what's unique about the slicks grinder is the entire surface of the grinder is coated in a non-stick ceramic which is supposed to help resin build up which is actually really common in a lot of grinders a lot of grinders i've used in the past they get really hard to turn after using them for a few weeks here's my old grinder i've had it for a couple years there's not even any weed in here but it's hard to turn there's a lot of gunk buildup in here to clean this one not too long ago so it's not terrible but i had to get rid of my old gold grinder because it had way too much buildup in it i actually got a purple one and a yellow one and we swapped some of the parts on here so we could have that two-tone action like the [ __ ] lakers we got one for home games and one for away games we should be good if anyone's interested in a slick grinder you can go to cubans.com grinder or i will have a link in the description below these are the larger ones for 60 bucks and they do have a smaller one for 50. and they also sell rolling trays in a couple of sizes i grabbed a smaller one so let's take a closer look at the inside of the grinder the first thing i noticed about this one is the lid on it is heavy and that's actually very crucial to grinding weed if you have a light flimsy lid it's not going to be easy to cut through the bud the weight on this lid is similar to the weight of my entire other ground you can see that it has some resin build up on the top definitely not the non-stick like we've got here but this is a nice heavy lid and that helps with grinding bud we got that unique shape on the teeth there and they're nice and spaced out a lot of grinders i've used before the teeth are too close and they use this shape right here and these actually do a little bit more of making like a powder or making dust out of your weed the other cool thing about the slicks grinder here so you catch your flower in the chamber here and this actually slips right out without any additional untwisting this one just pops right out and then you can see your keyframe there you got a couple of tools in there to play with but let's put some weed in one of these and see how it grinds i got this thing really loaded up we're gonna see if we have an easy time grinding it this might be more than you would typically put in but let's see if it cuts through it and it starts spinning pretty easy actually there's just a lot of herb in there so it's going to have a little bit of time breaking it up or take a little bit of time this ground up consistency nice and fluffy i prefer this for bong pacs and rolling joints it's just perfect it's not too fine and it's nice and fluffy perfect weed fluff let's light this on fire you know what they say kids if you don't tilt your beaker you're probably smoking mids you're cute [Music] if you like the video subscribe to the channel

grinder it's very different from the little tiny one I've got I've got a little pork I suppose so we're gonna take this little red pepper here and we're gonna try not to make it horrible mess as we fold it up and I grew these in my garden a couple years ago and I still have a whole bunch of them left because that was like the most productive thing and then it just kind of get in there pepper I probably shouldn't have put the whole thing in there at once but you get it in there now we got the lid on and you just sort of twist this and you can look through these little windows if I can get the camera to show it maybe not helped if I actually pointed at the camera there we go oh you can see the pepper coming so yeah it's kind of a nice little setup it's got a lot more room in it than the other one which I like because that means you know you can actually store some stuff in there and get some stuff in there it doesn't push everything through some of these bits are just gonna kind of stick up here but they're still ground up pretty good these little diamond D bits rub together and grind it up got this little port here that opens it allows you to easily empty it into like a spice jar and then take this little bottom piece off really quick there's a little mesh thing that you can push it through to get powder wood you can see a little bit of fill through here and then there's a little scrape eating hmmm I just inhaled some pepper so yeah all in all it's a pretty nice little device it's small compact easy to store easy to use it's great for if you're just doing a little bit of grinding for your own personal use I wouldn't recommend it if you're trying to do anything on a larger scale though", "aRFNmNoIoGA": "welcome to a new series here on the ice smoke channel this is

"IvAdwrwlc-k": "[Music] hey how's it going YouTube I'm always blazing here back with another video today is going to be a little bit different as I'm gonna be discussing the necessities that an everyday stoner would need what I basically call it is the stoner starter kit basically I'm just gonna go through a list of items that you know and everyday cannabis user needs and just little things that help them get by and get them through the day so let's jump right into the video what we're gonna start off with is obviously you're gonna need something to keep all your stuff in so this is what I use on a daily basis it's just a beats headphone case now the reason why I use this is it's very convenient you could bring it around in public in plain sight and people are just gonna think like oh look this guy's just carrying his headphones around so no one's gonna think anything of it and the best part about this thing is it's so big on the inside it has like this little inner pouch pocket here as well to fit papers in I'll just fill it up right now just to give you guys kind of an example so you can toss you know your grinders in there your little stash jar as well I can fit a bunch of like just papers and stuff on the inner pockets if you have like any Visine or anything like that as well it literally all fits in here perfectly just to show you guys you just zip this thing up with the zipper and there you go you're pretty much ready to go so that's the first thing you're basically gonna need is some sort of low key but kind of not obvious case for your Cannabis supplies you could also use a pencil case or even like you know one of those move that on kind of like coin pouches like there's many different things you could use it's really personal preference but this is my go-to and favorite thing to use is the beats headphone case works really well and I bring it in public everywhere and no one really has a clue it's not smelly proof but I'll discuss later in the video of why you don't really need a smelly proof so that's the most important thing on the list is having like a little kind of carrying case for your stuff now number two obviously you're gonna want a grinder with you something small enough something durable something that's gonna last you know whatever your preference is if you want to use a plastic grinder if you want to use you know a metal one totally up to you but just make sure it's small enough to fit inside your case so obviously I have the santa cruz shredder here this is my favorite grinder i've been using it for years and years and years and i've had no issues so that's my go-to for that so this brings me to my next thing is you're gonna want a smelly proof type of container to fit your cannabis in something that's small enough that's gonna also fit in your obviously your your little coin pouch thingy or your case so it has to be small enough to fit inside there this is just a small little jar of elevated extracts i got a long time ago and i just save these jars just for everyday use if i have to go out i just put it in here and nothing smells like you can put your nose right to it it doesn't smell like anything so this is essential if you don't have one of these i would recommend getting something like this which is this is actually from a local dispensary here in toronto it's a smelly proof bag and this is actually one of the coolest ones I've seen if you check out the design here the actual zipper gets locked in to this spot right here I'll try and do it so you press this down and then one sec and then you pull the zipper oh and it's perfect because it keeps your stuff smell proof you know you're not gonna have any issues with that and it's just a perfect little pouch to keep your cannabis in so if you can have if you don't have access to any jars any smaller jars like this feel free to pick yourself up like a smelly proof bag obviously it has to fit inside your case which is the most important thing but yeah that's another necessity that you're definitely gonna want to have so I'm gonna put that aside what is next so obviously you're gonna have your grinder you're gonna have your weed on you I mean how are you gonna roll your joints or how are you gonna pack a bowl or stuff well that leads me to my next option you're gonna need a such Pape which is basically any piece of paper printer paper lined paper and just fold it up and just make sure it fits nice into your little pouch here or your little case and what that does is anywhere you go you just open up the piece of paper grind your weed out put it inside and you have like a little rolling tray basically and it's portable and whenever the paper kind of gets too old just throw it out and put a brand new one in there so that's what I've been using for years it works it's portable it's convenient so why not so once you have your Seche Pape obviously you're gonna need stuff to roll with so yeah I just get your favorite papers these are pretty much the ones I have as of right now the elements I have some OC B's some bras as well so yeah what you're gonna want to do is just get your favorite papers put them obviously in your case because you're gonna need to be rolling with them as well also these are included in this pack the filters here at the bottom so if you don't have any filters your desk we're gonna want to you know pre-cut some filter tips and put it in your case as well just so it's a little bit easier for you when you're on the go another thing you're gonna need is some Visine I mean if you're just starting out using cannabis obviously when you smoke your eyes are definitely gonna get red they're definitely gonna get low so if you're out in public and you don't really want people to bother you or know that you're high um I would definitely recommend getting some Visine this is just like the regular original version I mean personally I don't want to condone using Visine I personally don't use it anymore just because I don't know what this does to your eyes long-term I don't know if it's gonna affect you know your body in a negative way I don't know what chemicals you're putting onto your eyes so I mean at the end of the day this option is totally up to you I'm just throwing it in there because it's something that I used in my early years of smoking and it really does help you out so there you go you got the Visine another thing that's really really important that I would say is the next couple of items this one is just one of those little sample colognes that you can just get at you know one of those cologne stores they usually give them as free samples and it has like the little spray nozzle at the top here this is perfect because it's not big it's not bulky you can throw it in your jacket pocket you can throw it in your backpack and you know whenever you're done smoking you can just give yourself a little spray here and it won't totally get rid of the smell I'll be completely honest with you guys some people say oh I don't like using cologne because all it does is just mix with the weed smell I mean sometimes that is true but at the end of the day would you rather just smell like weed or you know have a little bit of Colonus in there so if someone does come by and they smell you you're gonna smell like a little bit of weed a little bit of cologne but if you're in public you know if you're at work or whatever the case may be these are always clutch they always come in handy so I let's say make sure you have one of these I wouldn't suggest putting this with your cannabis stuff just just in case it breaks or just in case it sprays accidents accidentally excuse me you're not gonna want to get cologne all over your grind they're all over you're such paper your papers that'll be kind of gross right so keep this in your jacket pocket or something like that always very handy another thing this leads me to is little breath mints or gum or little candies this is like a little ginger candy I don't have a pack of gum on me to show you guys but that would be the most preferable thing to use when you're done smoking you know just pop of gum in your mouth and it'll kind of get rid of that smokey kind of weedy kind of taste and yeah it'll get rid of that smokey kind of breath that you get right after smoking a joint um like I said if you're out in public and stuff you're obviously not gonna want to be smelling like cannabis I mean everyone's different some people don't really care and some people you know where they live it's illegal so they obviously want to be as low-key as possible so definitely get some breath mints or some gum or some little candies like this as well and just toss it in your little sesh your little such container or your little beats case and this leads me to my next thing which is some hand sanitizer I mean obviously you're not going to want to have this gigantic size get the little portable small ones that you can just fit in your pocket it's perfect for when you're done smoking a joint or hitting a bowl what it does is it just obviously disinfect your hands but it kind of gets rid of that burns kind of like smoky resin II so as I was saying guys you're definitely gonna want some hand sanitizer just to get rid of that resin II burnt smell on your fingers after you're done session always handy to have like I said get the little small portable one that you can fit in your pocket or you know you can hear your pouch here and last but not least which I don't even have on me right now I'm an idiot but you're definitely gonna want a lighter pretty straightforward if you don't have a lighter as a STONER I mean what are you doing that's like the main thing so yeah as I was saying guys I actually had one in my room so what you're gonna want is one of these you know little this is actually I would say even better than a rug Lichter the reason is this is one of those torch lighters I don't know if it'll show up on camera here we'll see there you go see the flame there guys it's very faint I mean but hopefully you guys can see that this is just one of those little torch lighters it refills with butane at the bottom there the torch lighters are perfect because if you're in a windy environment and you're outside the regular lighters you know when you light them up you kind of have to like hold your hand to the joint and like get rid of all the wind because the flame kind kind of dies out with these torch lighters they're very handy because you can be in a windy area and you could just light up a joint no problem so yeah that's basically the last item on the list you're definitely gonna want to have a lighter on you I honestly couldn't think of anything else in my opinion these are these stoner necessities the stoner starter kit that you're gonna need these are everyday items that you'll use and they'll just help you out in the long run I mean if you guys have anything you guys want to add or you guys think I missed something feel free to comment down below and let me know what your stoner starter kit is but yeah that's been the stoner starter kit by I'm always blazing I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did drop a like comment subscribe and we'll see you in the next video peace guys", "v-iq3lqti7E": "[Music] welcome to highly recommended today we are checking out a couple new products to the market by a company called hoy spelled hoj which i've mispronounced on many occasions like a lot of things in my reviews so i made sure that i got it right this time so hoy actually creates two really cool products that are both anodized aluminum and 100 magnetic what i mean by that is let me show you actually this is the coal what the coal is is a magnetic pipe look at that so what this does is it actually allows you to solve the main problem that i personally have with smoking pipes and that is that after your first session the flavor is awful all you can taste is resin and kind of like an old smoky flavor and that really destroys the terpene profile that the cultivators that we've come to love created for us so after i smoke a bowl out of this pipe what i do is i will just open it up reveal the air path and i'll take a paper towel and some rubbing alcohol and just gently wipe it out and once i'm done i put it back together and i have a fresh flavorful smoke session for my second session the other thing that they provide you with is multiple screens so there are a few screens that come with it in the cork magnetic box right here and that allows you to actually swap out the screen when the flavor isn't so good and when the screen actually starts to get dirty and you can just drop that in iso and put in a new fresh screen while you wait for it to clean itself what i like about both of these products is they make the session way easier and what i'm looking for in new technology is ease of use and quality of smoke so the other thing that they create is called the clip the clip is a fully magnetic grinder you're probably like yeah i've used a magnetic grinder before but the clip is different the reason it's different is that everything's magnetic the keef catch the flower chamber and the place where you actually place the flower are all magnetic you don't have that horrible cringe-worthy threaded grinder feeling when you're trying to screw the grinder back on after it's been used a few times and there's some keef and resin build up this thing prevents that all together it's just so nice it's so easy i just really love that i can just it's easy as that just lift it up and it's got really strong magnets so it's not going to fall apart but that's actually not the biggest differentiator with this grinder surprisingly it isn't what really differentiates this grinder is the blade inside there is a fan blade inside in between both the grinder or the grate and where the flower goes so this fan blade actually slices the flour instead of grinding it which gives you a much fluffier consistency and if you're smoking a bowl or even rolling a joint or blunt i personally think a fluffier consistency makes for a much better experience so as you can see when i like rotate this thing you can see this this like fan blade spin on the inside and what actually makes that function is there is a gear right here in the cap when you place it on it actually rotates that fan blade the other really cool thing about this grinder is that it comes with different levels of grading so if you want like a medium fine grind you just stick with what comes in the in your grinder but if you want something that's a little more fine or a little more chunky you just open up the magnetic part of your case that it comes with and then you pop out the both the extra screens which are for the keef and the extra grinding grates which are what i was just talking about so if you want a more fine grind there's something that's a little smaller and if you want a chunkier grind for like rolling blunts for instance they have a wider grate also it comes with different screens so if you want a finer micron of keef that you're getting in your keef section of this grinder you're going to want to use this one if you want something that provides more key faster but it's a little less potent you're gonna want something like this if you have a personal preference of how you want your grinder to act they have a solution for it my favorite part though about this grinder is how easy it is to load into a bowl let me show you this function so it comes with an extra piece and it's specifically for loading into the coal or any other bowl really but it works really well at the coal so you pop off the top section of your grinder and it actually magnetizes to this there's a little cap right here so if you have some extra flour you keep it in there but you just take it off place it in the coal and spin the grinder and it automatically loads the bowl for you so the less that you're touching the weed in my opinion the better because that means there's less fuzzies that can get in your flower i'm super ocd as you know i'm a macro photographer so i see all these little fuzzies and hairs in the flower when i see it on a macro level so it's it's made my ocd worse let's be honest but with something like this it keeps your flower away from any contaminants as much as possible as well as making the session that much easier so now that i've talked about this maybe at nauseam i'm going to show you how it works so first things first let's just grind up a regular traditional four piece grinder kind of bowl and show you the differentiator here with this blade that slices the flower it makes for a very fluffy consistency so today i have some ghost og by claiborne i'm a big fan of this strain it's definitely relaxing so if i start fading on you you know why this grinder has three sections where you can load the flower so we just want to break it up and generally fill each section with you know enough flour but don't pack it too tight i mean just like any grinder really we've got it all loaded and now all we have to do is put our grinder lid on and give it a couple spins until you stop feeling resistance so any resistance that you're feeling at the beginning is just that fan blade slicing the flower and now i'm at a point of no resistance and instead of unscrewing this grinder like i mentioned like every other grinder works you just lift it off and look at that it has a beautiful medium fine fluffy grind this is so much more fluffy than my two-piece grinder i regularly use and it actually makes for a greater rolling experience and when you're done you just put it back on and it's super secure and ready to go so that's just one way this grinder works with one grading method the other way it works is you pop off the top you come over here and you grab the other section that makes it so you can load it directly into the coal it's got a nice flat edge on the lid i'm gonna grab some more ghost og now what we're gonna do is pop off this little cap which is what makes it so it can go into the bowl you place it directly on the coal and you just start rotating and it's loading the bowl for me right now i'm not even looking at my bowl i'm looking at you guys and it is being loaded as we speak so once your bowl is loaded you just replace the cap so that no excess flour falls out and now let's move on to the coal which is the fully magnetic anodized pipe made by hoy so one thing i really like about it versus another bowl is that it doesn't have rounded edges it has concave edges and these concave edges allow you to kind of like scoop your flower directly towards the bowl versus with you know your traditional pipe it'll just kind of like fall off the rounded side so it makes for again another ergonomic experience so once you have all the flour in your bowl you just pack it down another cool thing about this is they thought about ergonomics again it fits perfectly for your pointer and middle finger to wrap around it and your thumb to go like this now let's grab our lighter and i'll show you how this thing rips that's really nice one of the greatest parts about this is that air path it creates this cooling effect that's unlike any other pipe i've used and once you're done smoking it all you gotta do is just like wipe that path out it's pretty flat and it's really easy to kind of wipe the resin out with a little bit of rubbing alcohol and a paper towel it really does make a huge difference with this pipe i'm a big fan i'm a really big fan all right so let's go over the two devices again and what's so impressive about it one they're both magnetic i really love that both are anodized aluminum which is really resistant and sturdy i do really love the ergonomics of this pipe it's very nice and i love the fact that you can easily clean it out so that each session is like the first session it's always a fresh bowl it never tastes like dirty resin [ __ ] that noise i'm just not into it what i like about the clip grinder by hoy i love that everything's magnetic that is a huge deal to me i love that when you're actually trying to get the flower it's as easy as just opening it versus having to like screw all those tiny threads with that cringe-worthy sound i also am incredibly impressed with the fluffiness of the grind what you get from that fan blade on the inside slicing the flower instead of grinding it we should just be referring to this thing as a slicer at this point because that's really what it's doing it's slicing the flower and it just feels nice it's got a great you know weight to it and it also you know none of the magnets are going to like fall apart no matter where you're holding it from they're really strong i think if you're looking for a pipe or grinder or both hoy is doing something really special they're actually innovating in a space that hasn't had a lot of innovation the pipe is really unique it feels great in the hands and the grinder i mean they upgraded the grinder in a positive way a lot of people have tried in the past and they haven't really succeeded hoy has with the clip this thing it's awesome i am a huge fan if it wasn't obvious already i highly recommend it [Music]",

The IQ is a dry herb conduction vaporizer\nmade by the company Davinci. It uses a ceramic zirconia vapor path, features\na full temp spectrum, offers a replaceable battery system and comes with a 10-year warranty. The IQ\u2019s compact size, recessed mouthpiece\nand haptic feedback make it very easy to use while on the go and the pure taste from the\nceramic vapor path make it very enjoyable to use at home as well. The IQ is also currently my highest rated\nconduction vaporizer for overall enjoyment of use, and vapor quality. I use the IQ most for outdoor activities because\nit fits anywhere with its compact size, it\u2019s easy to use in group situations, and it works\nfor short or long trips with replaceable batteries. The Davinci IQ ranks highest in categories\nlike overall portability, vapor quality, and overall control over sessions. At the time of this video the Davinci IQ retails\nfor $275. You can click the links below in the about\nsection or in the top right corner to get the current price directly from Davinci and\na full review on my website. In this Davinci IQ review, I\u2019ll go over\nthe features and how to use the IQ with and without the APP. I\u2019ll go over the battery info, charging\noptions, mouthpieces; Jump into a quick vape demo and finish up with my pros/cons. So let\u2019s jump into my full Davinci IQ review. Ok guys so here is the Davinci IQ vaporizer. It\u2019s very small and compact with a good\nweight to it. It\u2019s easy to pocket, easy to conceal and\nI can pretty much completely palm it for discretion. The buttons feel nice. They are easy to push and very responsive. The LEDS are precise and very bright with\nan option to dim them if needed. The outer shell is a smooth brushed aluminum\nfinish and it\u2019s available in Stealth, which is the color I\u2019m using in this video, Copper,\nGunmetal and Blue. The main components of the IQ are the top\nlid with mouthpiece. Below that is the flavor chamber and battery. The buttons are located along the side, followed\nby the lower lid, the pearl, and the chamber. With the IQ you get two mouthpieces, one recessed\nand one raised that doubles as a 10mm water pipe adapter. You get one 18650 3500mAh battery and a micro\nUSB charging cable. You get one carry can, a keychain tool, some\ncleaning items and lastly, the Davinci smartphone app available for both iOS and Android. Davinci sells quite a few accessories for\nthe IQ and here are the ones that are worth considering. First would be an extra battery. Davinci is currently selling them for $10.95. Next item is the 10-14mm water pipe adapter. This is definitely not needed but works perfect\nif you already have glass at home or planning on picking some up. The glass option I have been using most is\nthe Nectar Collector HoneyBird Combo. Once again this item is not needed but I\u2019m\nvery impressed with the results. This will fit directly over the included 10mm\nmouthpiece and I\u2019ll use both of them in the vape demo towards the end of this video. The last item that comes in handy is the soft\npadded Carrying Case. This case easily fits the IQ with some extra\nbatteries or the Honeybird Combo. The Davinci IQ is 3.54 inches tall, 1.65 inches\nwide and .94 inches deep. It weighs roughly 145 grams which is a little\nheavy for its size but overall it feels good in the hands. By comparison the Pax 3 is 90 grams and the\nCrafty is 135 Grams. Both the Pax 3 and IQ can easily be pocketed\nfor use on the go but the IQ is one of the only vaporizers that I can completely palm\nfor discretion. The Pax 2 and 3 come close but the height\ncauses it to stick out. The Davinci IQ comes with two ceramic zirconia\nmouthpieces. One is a recessed flat mouthpiece that makes\nthe unit easy to palm and conceal. The next is a raised mouthpiece that doubles\nas 10mm water pipe adapter. I personally feel like I get better air flow\nand slightly less draw resistance with the 10mm raised mouthpiece. But you also lose out on the concealment factor. So I tend to use the raised mouthpiece at\nhome and swap to the flat mouthpiece when I head out. The mouthpieces are easy to swap in and out. First, flip up the top lid and pull out the\nsilicone gasket. Remove the mouthpiece from the mold and swap\nin the one that you want. The end of each mouthpiece will have grooves\nthat slide into the silicone gasket. After you lined up the groves, make sure the\nvapor path is lined up and place the mouthpiece into the top lid. The vapor path will line up right over the\nflavor chamber and we\u2019re ready to close the lid. I\u2019ll go ahead and swap back to recessed\nmouthpiece so you can see how to replace it. The IQ comes with a ceramic zirconia chamber\ninsert called the Flavor Chamber. The flavor chamber increases the vapor path\nsurface area helping to cool and smooth the vapor. You can also place dry herbs into the chamber\nand the vapor will condense on the herbs potentially increasing potency for a later session. I have tried throwing some small nugs in the\nflavor chamber and running a few sessions but I didn\u2019t really notice much of an increase\nin potency. It decreased the overall enjoyment of the\nsession because the herbs didn\u2019t taste as good and it added additional draw resistance. You could try something like Mint for some\nadded flavor but overall I prefer to just leave the flavor chamber empty. Now it does stop a lot of the materials that\nwould normally build up in the mouthpiece which cuts down on overall cleaning time. To get to the Flavor Chamber just lift up\non the top lid and if it\u2019s a new unit it should just pop right out. It almost comes out too easy when it\u2019s clean\nand I\u2019ve launched it out on accident so be careful of that. If you\u2019ve been using the unit and it\u2019s\na little dirty like mine, grab the included tool that comes in the top, place it inside\nthe center hole of the flavor chamber cap and lift up with the lip. It should come right out. Now you can also use the same tool to remove\nthe cap. Keep it placed inside the hole, rotate and\npull up. Rotating it helps it come out easier if it\nwants to stick. When you\u2019re done you can just push the lid\nback into place and drop the flavor chamber back into the vapor path. You can also use the unit without the flavor\nchamber but I\u2019ve found that it increases the vapor temperature and harshness while\nmaking cleaning more difficult. So I just prefer to keep it in place. Don\u2019t forget to slide the cleaning tool\nback into place! The Davinci IQ uses a ceramic zirconia chamber\nwhich is the same material as the mouthpieces, flavor chamber and the pearl. The Pearl works by slightly decreasing chamber\nspace and reflecting heat. This will increase vapor production and helps\nwith the overall consistency of the chamber. Technically the pearl is able to twist up\nand down but I strongly recommend just leaving it fully screwed in because it\u2019s very easy\nto lose and you can possibly break the silicone post with over adjusting. I\u2019ve been getting about .3 grams with an\naverage grind and a medium tight pack from my Santa Cruz Shredder and as much as .5 grams\nwith a very fine grind from the MFLB finishing grinder. My personal preference is to use the Santa\nCruz Shredder and grind upside down to get a finer consistency. A medium tight pack will give you the best\nresults and a quick stir with the included tool does help, but is not needed. A finer grind and tight pack will increase\ndraw resistance and overall cleaning but produce bigger clouds. The Davinci IQ uses a replaceable/rechargeable\n3500mAh 18650 sized battery and the IQ charges via a micro USB charging cable. The battery is charged within the device and\nit does NOT come with an external charging dock. At the time of this video, you can pick up\nextra batteries for $10.95/piece. The average battery life is pretty decent\nat about 50-80 minutes per full charge but the IQ battery takes roughly 240 minutes to\nfully charge a dead battery within the unit. You can mitigate this by picking up an external\ncharging dock which will charge two batteries at the same time in about 150 to 180 minutes\ninstead of the 240 minutes that it takes to charge within the unit. I recommend either the EFEST SODA which will\nrun about $10, or the Nitecore I2 which is about $16. I\u2019ll have links to both down below in the\nabout section. The battery is located under the mouthpiece\nand you can get to it by opening the top lid, pulling back on this latch, and it should\npop right out. To get it back in, open up the door, the slightly\nraised end goes in first, push down the lid and over to secure the latch. The IQ offers better battery life than the\nCrafty but not quite as good as the Pax 3. Both the Pax 3 and Crafty will charge faster\nthan the IQ. But only the IQ offers a replaceable battery\nsystem. The Pax 3 averages 100 minutes of use on a\nfull charge and 100 minutes to charge from dead. The Crafty averages 30-45 minutes of use and\ntakes roughly 120 minutes to fully charge a dead battery. To turn on the IQ, press the control button\n5 times. The control button is the single circular\nbutton at the top. The device will show your current battery\nlife and begin heating to your last set precise temp or smart path. From here you can choose between three different\nheating options\u2026 Smart Paths, Precision Mode, and Boost Mode. With Smart Paths, you get four fully customizable\nsession options. Each path can be set with an exact session\nduration, starting temp, middle temp and ending temp. Now you can only customize these smart paths\nwith the Davinci APP so I\u2019ll get more into the app functionality in a minute. The default Smart Paths run from 350 to 430\ndegrees Fahrenheit with the first path starting at 350. From there, the temp will gradually increase\nto 370 at the 5 minute mark and maintain 370 degrees for the remainder of the session. Smart Path 2 runs from 370-390, smart path\n3 is 390-410 and the fourth default smart path runs from 410-430 degrees Fahrenheit. The next heating option is Precision Mode. Precision Mode allows you to select any temp\nbetween 250 and 430 degrees Fahrenheit. In order to get to Precision Mode from Smart\nPath Mode, push the control button one time and quickly select a temp to stay in this\nmode. After selecting a precise temp, the display\nwill show the current temp as the device heats up. Press the up or down arrow to change temps\nand press the control button one time to get back to the Smart Path Mode. The Last option is Boost Mode. Boost Mode is activated by pressing and holding\ndown the control button. Activating boost mode will rapidly increase\noven temperature all the way up to 430 degrees Fahrenheit and maintain that temp until you\nlet off. Letting off the button puts the device into\na rapid cool down mode and places it in standby. Press the control button or the up down arrows\nto return to your previous setting. You can also activate stealth mode which dims\nthe LEDS by pressing the Control button and the down button at the same time. The control button and up arrow will bring\nit back to full brightness. It\u2019s definitely nice to be able to dim the\nLEDS without needing the app. Click all three buttons at once to switch\nbetween Fahrenheit and Celcius and the Up/Down Buttons together will check current battery\nlife. The first thing I\u2019ll go over is how to use\nthe device with the app and walk you through how to set up a custom smart path. When you first open the app, it will show\nyou the current status of the device in the top right corner with the current temp and\nthe target temp towards the bottom. If you just wanted to select a default smart\npath and be done, click the \u201cselect smart paths\u201d option at the very bottom. From here, you can select any default smart\npath, the device will turn on and automatically begin heating. It will also display the path you selected\nin the top right corner and how many times you\u2019ve used this specific smart path. Lastly, the unit will vibrate once the device\nreaches temp. If you just wanted one precise temp, you can\npress the plus or minus button and the heater will automatically begin heating to that temp. You can turn the device off by pressing the\nstandby button below the target temp. Now to edit a Smart Path we\u2019re going to\nclick on the menu option in the top left, select smart paths and then select which path\nwe want to edit. I\u2019m going to pick smart path 4. From here you can pick a name if you want\u2026and\nthen select \u201cedit path\u201d. I\u2019m going to edit this path for the vape\nsession coming up shortly so I\u2019ll be starting higher than I\u2019d normally prefer. I\u2019ll demo the mouthpieces first, then the\nnectar collector combo followed by the WPA and Bubbler combo. My first starting point I\u2019ll set to 380\ndegrees Fahrenheit at one minute for the dry mouthpiece hits. I\u2019ll then quickly climb to 420 degrees over\nthe next minute while I begin to the use water pieces. I\u2019ll set the last point to 430 degrees which\nwill have it gradually climb 10 degrees over the next 8 minutes. You could also set the last point to something\nbelow 10 minutes if you wanted a quicker session. Once you are satisfied with your selections,\npress the save button and from here you can either click done to go back to the smart\npaths dashboard or click start and your session will automatically begin. You can do this for all 4 smart paths and\nonce they are set you can change between them with the up/down buttons. You\u2019ll just have to remember what number\ncorresponds to what path. Some of the other settings within the app\ninclude turning off and on vibration alerts which is something you can\u2019t do without\nthe app. You also have access to device information\nlike total usage time, average session length, average temp and favorite path. You also have access to a complete plant guide,\ntons of walkthroughs, the full user manual in pdf form, a few troubleshooting tips and\nfrequently asked questions. The cleaning and maintenance is pretty easy\nwith the Davinci IQ. All of the components can be easily removed\nand for the most part you just drop them into some ISO. Routine maintenance for me consists of emptying\nthe chamber and brushing out the bowl when I\u2019m finished with a session. The biggest indicator that the IQ is getting\ndirty and needs to be fully cleaned will be the draw resistance. You can also clearly see buildup forming around\nthe holes of the mouthpiece and the flavor chamber. The top mouthpiece will get the dirtiest the\nfastest but it\u2019s also the easiest to remove and clean. So for a full cleaning you\u2019ll remove the\nmouthpiece from the silicone housing. Drop the mouthpiece in some ISO, and you can\nclean the silicone gasket with warm soapy water. Next we\u2019ll remove the flavor chamber from\nthe IQ and remove the gasket from the lid. Drop both glass pieces into some ISO and clean\nthe gasket with some warm soapy water. Next, grab a q-tip and throw a small amount\nof ISO on the end of it. Flip the IQ upside down to make sure that\nwe don\u2019t get any liquids in it and swab out the oven. Like I mentioned above, I don\u2019t remove the\npearl from the chamber so I just wipe it down with an ISO soaked paper towel or q-tip. The easiest spot to overlook is the space\nunderneath the flavor chamber and between the bowl. For this, I\u2019ll use the brush that came with\nthe IQ, flip the IQ upside down and run the brush through the chamber. You\u2019ll want to push it up against the silicone\nstopper at the bottom. This way the brush can get to the materials\nunderneath. Rotate the brush a few times and you\u2019re\ngood to go. Overall the Davinci IQ isn\u2019t too hard to\nclean, but lack of cleaning will cause increased draw resistance. So now that we\u2019ve covered pretty much all\nthe basics of the Davinci IQ, let\u2019s go ahead and jump into the vape session. So for this vape session I will be loading\nabout .3 grams using my santa cruz shredder but grinding upside down so I can get a little\nfiner consistency. Finer grinds will increase draw resistance\nbut produce bigger clouds, whereas an average grind will produce better air flow but the\nvapor will not be as dense. Be sure to load the entire chamber for best\nresults. I\u2019ll select the custom smart path 4 that\nI created earlier. Now I usually start out a typical session\non smart path 1 or 2 and end my session on smart path 3 which is a longer more casual\nsession. So this demo will be a more sped up session\nto show you what kind of vapor density the IQ can produce. I\u2019ll use the recessed mouthpiece first,\nswapping out for the raised mouthpiece, followed by the Honeybird Nectar Collector Combo and\nfinishing up with the 10-14mm Water Pipe Adapter and d020-d bubbler. I would say that I average between 10 to 30\ndraws in a session and sessions will typically last anywhere from 5-15 minutes depending\non your herbs, starting temps, lung capacity, and if you will be using any glass attachments. It\u2019s also important to note that the IQ\nchamber is pretty large. At the time I made this video, the word from\nDavinci is that they are working on a ceramic chamber spacer. But in the mean time I have a quick modification\nfor shrinking the chamber size which you can check out in my full review at vaporizerwizard.com\n. I will also update my article and this video when the spacer is released. The IQ has about average draw resistance for\na conduction vaporizer and I find that I get slightly more air flow with the raised 10mm\nmouthpiece. The IQ also has some good weight to it which\nmakes it easy to grip and pass around. It works great for long slow draws or short\nsips, so I find that the Davinci IQ works very well in group settings. One last thing you can do with water pieces\nis activate the boost mode after you start your draw. So the first pro would have to be the extremely\ncompact size of the IQ. It\u2019s easy to grip, pass around and I can\npocket it easily on the go. The IQ is also the best tasting conduction\nvaporizer that I have tested at this point. I found that the Davinci APP is the most enjoyable\nto use and quite possibly the best app for a portable vaporizer. I also really like the replaceable battery\nsystem. It\u2019s definitely not the fastest at charging\nbatteries but you can pick up some great external charging options for cheap and extra batteries\ncurrently run $10.95 from Davinci. You also get multiple mouthpieces, one of\nwhich doubles as a WPA. The custom smart paths provide all the customization\nthat you could want. You get a full temp spectrum via the precision\nmode Lastly, the Davinci IQ comes with a 10 year\nwarranty. CONS\nThe first con would have to be fact that it takes 240 minutes to fully charge a dead battery\nwithin the unit. It\u2019s easy to pick up an external charger\nbut now you\u2019re spending more money to get the most out of your vaporizer. Next would be the draw resistance and it\u2019s\nnot bad. It\u2019s just not as free flowing as models\nlike the Crafty or Mighty. I also wish that the pre-heat time was in\nthe 20-30 second range instead 40-60. I wish the Davinci spacer was out now\nI wish the vibrate had a low setting (keep either one or both)\nOverall the Davinci IQ will work perfect if you\u2019re looking for a very pocketable unit,\na replaceable battery system, and the purest tasting conduction vaporizer that I have tested\nto date. You also get full control of your sessions\nwithout the need for the Davinci IQ smartphone app. I can safely say that the Davinci IQ is one\nof the most enjoyable session vaporizers that I have used. The replaceable battery system is perfect\nfor both long and short trips, plus it works great at home especially with the Nector Collector\nCombo or the WPA option.

it is very very small it's a really know what to compare to but it's pretty small it is magnetic in the center little nudie Miam magnet in there which is very useful so doesn't fall apart in your pocket or lose it many pieces or if you're storing any herb you're grinding up inside of there in there then it will really stick i've had this for about a year now and i gotta say it's a really nice piece it grinds it up very nicely it's got very sharp blades gotta cut grooves grip it's very reliable but again it's small and you can only really grind up oh you know just one blunt or a joint at a time which isn't really that bad because sometimes it's all you're really doing I got this for about twenty-five dollars I just had money to burn and so I went to local 7-eleven and picked up a vanilla Visa gift card and went on Amazon and purchased this voices corrector and it looks I guess there's a little plastic or rubber o-ring type thing going on there yeah great a better seal it's right there all in all I would say diamond grind make some very good grinders I if I were to do this again I surely wouldn't pay $25 for a little grinder like this but yeah they're pretty expensive but very good quality grinder and if you got some money definitely pick yourself up a diamond grind grinder I would suggest a four piece though with the youth catcher pollen catcher whatever the hell they actually call it all right oh that's it", "H1PJbxR-YkM": "hey everybody welcome back your old man wanted to give you guys a update on everything right now I do have a pepper plant coming up now

that you can smush together making us dizzy at 1080p has a grind as your hands anything hey you know what okay well let's stick it in a blade they definitely smokeable and they don't eat my fingertips on my nails yeah I think the two grinders you know if you're doing that good one it does get to a point where it's like more rolling do you think it's just like the first line of ball even you have to carry on gonna do anything gonna do anything more to it no let's smoke it so write prose or cirrhosis you can put in your wallet you could get it through TSA and I I'd rather take my chances with a head grinder honestly only because of a go see what very good again and then don't do it into your hand perhaps do after the pros do it into a bowl oh good but I would imagine this is a babe own sort of thing this isn't when you need it you need it yeah that's fun right yeah keep it in your cubbyhole keep in your sock drawer keep it in your briefcase back roll dude okay now you see now you committed I dude odd nights ago gee I can't even get there but do you know what that did would it sit on the box it grinded the grinded boss this one could kill a zombie I'm telling you this one is a ninja star you'd never get that internationally what separates like some serious piece of [ __ ] stainless steel it's like I've been there before I've seen them that little heart-shaped one we got in Seattle I think they were giving them away so they are more like cool business cards for stoners than any real practicality because I'm sure there must be other ways I'd rather have a pair of scissors a shot but you're not gonna get that on a fly either turn your backs turned about for one for an original one you can get the knuckles like 50 60 rend summer like cheap Chinese they're all Chinese originals or chop it like that that one Dan Scott is that stainless they're all stainless it all stainless expensive because I think it would be really really late to do - and then we're together we're in the upside-down Tennessee that's the first so I just want to try it out with them not for yourselves as well give it a go before we shoot this thing in the head because maybe we get converted I wish we had more weight do dope you should grind these books we'll talk about that shortly Ike's so opinion so far guys doesn't seem so it seems motivated to talk about the tickets I [ __ ] okay it's gonna be when I'm like in the middle of the desert with no water or anything what do you reckon to this thing would you use it someplace keep it new car yeah we can't get into a gig with scissors you can't get into one of our games then again you sign these that you didn't do it on its own Jerry what you need to do you need these to be a set of two okay so they need to come up Doreen's cross yeah no you can unroll that wanna make it twice as fat I'm surprised you gave it a little okay Jules but not necessarily these ones - yeah these ones the card itself I've seen these things for years I've seen all different shapes and all different types of designs I would have one of these and I'd have a whole yeah what the whole or at least exactly these two can hold it exactly yeah this design with the city leaf in those zombie faces stupid useless you up is vain and useless more about the logo yeah in the function and everything rather make it more functional and have you any work around that than just this because well I think there's a business card we've talked about a business card for quite a long time so I'm gonna give it a lick for just being a talking point because that's what it that only function it's got reviews where do you get that it's got your logo on it yeah you get given one of those as business card fields of green skimming the [ __ ] things across the room at the CDC what you do you make a cold up these [ __ ] herb like that we could do that out truck rolling Taylor then let's do something we could do okay savory what sort of glitter shake it's cool you said you well dude if your age you can use one big one keep one the trays the 120 fairies breading to landfall on the go not dead use Russ Warren says creating operators the future 420 faith amount of Keith you lose gonna lose though mmm that's true but I've been a day it's not really that you don't you think of that situation you're gonna use it for Oh apps better nothing they're not funded services crafty fire it's a powerful branding tool for the most part mm-hmm it really is and as long as you can keep your logo on a little bit that you save your fingers you can do all your creative and make a good quality you use the cheese grater to grind cannabis I remember when we were young we used to put weed to suits yes yes different types of I mean lots of crazy [ __ ] to catch up we'd use the chopping board use one of those those brokers like blades there's knives the age like that and the coffee grinders that's not also wonder if the future of weed is even in its platform because when you buy your cigarette it doesn't come as a big tobacco leaf there so maybe in the long run grinders themselves become irrelevant but that's the Mad Max future no date next tonight so I'm also initially I was like you know it's kind of cut but you guys bring up valid points would I have it rather than nothing I would have it it just makes it I get about this thing in York in your wallet and then one day you'll be like I need a grinder or something you're just me and you remember and you'll be so happy but then you'll forget it somewhere because you'll take it off you're running joined with it and you're [ __ ] leave it like then you leave it and you lose the next time you wanna they're gonna rock up a McDonald's two o'clock in the morning like a Buick just ordered the nice meal it that drive through they're gonna pull up they're gonna stick this post grinder in the [ __ ] machine [Laughter] so it's guys job surprisingly a litter yeah very", "82VWp4VzQmc": "[Music] you", "l8UHyoD00sA": "hey guys it's just hunka hunka burnin reviews and them like i said in the last video i have a bunch of products to do today so get ready for a barrage if you subscribe to us and this is the product for today and it comes in this neat nifty little bag and sisters tiny little brighter basically they have the top that just comes sorry the top that just pops right off me move this down so that more of my hands this pops right off of there and then you put your herbs or whatever it is you're using in here you would close it and turn it turn until there's no real resistance that means everything is broken cut up all that fun stuff when you're done with that you just unscrew this bottom part pull this off of here and be careful when you do that because there might be some up in here and it might fly off to wherever then it has this little portion that pulls out right here and you have the little spring and down to the bottom there is a little poem scraper so that you can get in all the plays on the top I'll show you that in a second but depending on what you're grinding if you are grinding some medical that is sin and it will all fall down into here and then down here you'll have the I'll just say it then you'll have the key key down here if you do the medical you'll have Italy get collected down and it's pretty much like the dust things like that it comes off of what you do so it seems to be pretty nice all the all the blade ends look like they will chop pretty well and like I said this thing you just come in here and you go through and you get anything else that's stuck and it knocks it down and through into the holes and they also included a container not sure where the container is at the moment but it is awesome I freaking love it it is nice and big it also included this little two-headed brush which I'm sure would you the same thing as the other you just go through their clean everything out get it through down to the bottom and then you go from there this seems to be well made it's pretty lights I like the black that's adorable black is my favorite color anyway and um you should be able to break up you said if theoretically you're using this for medical medicine you should be able to break up a good three or four small chunks and like I said then we just put this on here you might not be able to get the lid all the way down you just hold it down and keep turning like I said just keep turning um but yeah I actually really like this I think it's really cool um the only thing I would be a little iffy about is a lot of a lot of grinders are actually five piece if that makes sense where this would actually be its own separate peace and not just you know pulling it out of there you'd have to screw it and then screw it to hear but it's not really that much problem having it this very what I actually do really like it it's pretty cool the lines are cool and there's a lot of black on black on the side which is awesome like I said I love black so I'm gonna leave the link down below you can go and check it out if you want to see the container you'll have to go to our Instagram or the Amazon review that we do for this one of those places will definitely have what you're looking for and if you need a good container that it is a great container it is big but it is a nice container i really like it so yes please go and check out

definitely we think so we hope so that's what we got to offer we hope thank you very much we really appreciate it [Music]", "3rdhSrIc6XQ": "hi I'm here to talk to you about Candis store Kanna store is a kitchen grinder that shreds sips and stores just about anything you might use in a recipe in your kitchen it requires no electricity it's very easy to clean so it's the perfect thing to produce small quantities of shredded spices nuts loose tea that you would normally use a very large grinder for the canvas or grinding system comes in a variety of sizes from one and a half to three inches and you have to pick one based on your kitchen need the one and a half to three inches is a measurement of diameter rather than height so it'll affect how much you can grind at once in the in the grinding compartment and how much of the substance that you're grinding that you actually want to store at that time some of the can source systems have a clear see-through top and some of them have a black brushed aluminum lid so if you feel like you need to see what you're grinding you might want to consider something with a clear top this is one of the larger grinders and I'm going to use that to demonstrate the various parts the core of every canister system is the grinding compartment which is a series of aluminum teeth in the lid and in the base and when you put your ingredients inside and close the lid those teeth rotate past each other as you twist the lid grinding the ingredients to the desired coarseness on the underside of every grinding apartment or a series of drop through holes that allow shredded ingredients to fall through into the storage area now the storage area on different canister models is different the one I'm demonstrating today though has a fine mesh screen at the bottom and this allows you to separate shredded ingredients from the powders that come with those ingredients that may be useful in different recipes the screen can also be used to separate liquid from the materials that you shredded for instance if you're mixing a drink sometimes I make cheery lemonade and I want to keep the pull on the top of the screen the screen itself is easily removable for cleaning you just need a pair of pliers you can see they have a different tip than the pliers typically having the garage and you can see on the ring that holds the screen in there are two holes for those for those pliers to go in and all you have to do is squeeze gently and lift the ring out then you can remove the screen clean it thoroughly when you're ready to put it back in you just put the screen in place you apply pressure to the c-clamp again and pop it back in the last part of the kanaky source system is the base or the bottom the base is removable so that if you want to grind something directly into another container that's not part of a canister system you can you can leave it open but if you want to capture all the powder that comes off when you shred things then you can leave it in place and then that powder will collect in the bottom some of the can of store models have a much larger storage area at the bottom for instance of your brining black pepper and you need to save a lot of it for meals over time then you would use a larger system if you're just grinding enough cinnamon to make apple cider on one evening then then the smaller one will do just fine there are a variety of different mesh screens available for the canister system so it depends on what you're using it for whether you need something that sifts more coarse items or something that's designed to refine the smallest types of powder no matter what kind of screen you have though all you have to do to clean them is remove the c-clamp rinse the screen replace the screen and then replace the sequin", "YOShp3MXM_k": "what's up everybody my name is Ryan I ordered this Compton grinder off of Compton grinders calm I ordered in about three days ago and I just got it in the mail tonight and it came in this cool created little black box which I'm kind of stoked on because it was 40 bucks and that was a little skeptical because they're a new company but this makes me feel better about my purchase when you open it up it's pretty cool the grinders on the inside check it out Compton grinder it's just a two-piece but hey I don't really need a cake Keef catcher so I just bought this one but I'm pretty stoked on it so I'm gonna take it out and show you saying sweet so there it is it's got the cool like ridges like Antley like handles basically like all the way around check it out then on the inside you've got their magnet super-strong all your teeth and that daisy pattern that they talked about online which I'm kind of interested in biggest thing is they're magnets just like super strong that's pretty cool then it's got the poly ring that goes around the outside so you get a smoother cut put it back on it's real smooth alright let's grind up some Nuggets I got some lambsbread from the local clinic no stands in my [ __ ] all right so there it is all inside here's the top it's pretty cool put it on tighten it down super super easy to use it's really smooth all right so that was about ten turns and see where we're at nice all right this thing works great check it out it's got a little bit of weight to it which is nice a lot of the other grinders that I've purchased our little little light so it makes me a little weary of their product but this thing's great let's see you put it back on a couple of super smooth I mean that's just like so easy to use that ring makes it real soft all right yeah this thing's bitchin doesn't really seem to have any like lumps in there it seems like it cuts pretty evenly pretty stoked that nothing seems to be sticking to the outside so that little daisy pattern they talk about seems like it's working yeah not bad I'm pretty stoked a couple more times but there it is Compton grinders happy", "9-sTuokaDA0":

postgraduate this is a group I've actually been using this for a while like I say this is my favorite grinder up head best far and when I say toothless I literally mean toothless but I've already got some pretty ground flour if you guys want to know I'm cheating on to da CP on a nice little deaf boot oh yes I keep my weed in my frickin bed pulled are it's lovely - I'm doing a keepin on some nice death food in here yeah this is like that dumb - just as fast like I've gotten yet but yes nice little death [Music] I've already got some flower creep round it in my mind er [Music] okay believe it or not we're switching a bond today instead of using snoops in the [ __ ] blue Chooch my coochie blue cheese James out bub we're going with the nice plus before peace and you guys know how we start this so let's get ready to go on dementia and [Music] [Music] that Buddha [ __ ] so now when I first got this grinder I was little confused I was like wait they make toothless grinders what but you know what it's actually pretty cool the company who made it is made it this grinder is called the groove as you can tell it has no teeth in it whatsoever but the movement is beautiful now most people when they get a grinder they want something oh I want why use the grinders bro or even better let's go to people I like to break regular clean I mean I mean you you nasty [ __ ] I mean you you nasty [ __ ] that's [ __ ] weird you're losing all the trichomes buddy you're making all the trifling stick to your fingers it's bad dance P and that is actually bad me personally I'd rather use a grinder I like grinders because especially ricardus look like this keep catch or two reckon you can tell I've gotten a lot of use out of this grinder but I could see that screen in there yeah remove this part this is where like a flower falls as you till I got a lot of use out of it but this is where you rent waive all your fire falls and with this little screen you end up collecting something in this bottom piece it's called Keith if you don't know if you do know welcome if you do know we all know we all know how potheads think but if you don't know this is a Keith catcher normally keep this on the bottom just to do what this meant what it says catch the [ __ ] Keith if you don't know that one then I feel [ __ ] sorry but anyways let's move on but yeah me personally I prefer grinders I prefer grinders over breaking up my fears because you just keep all the trichomes right on your bud Oh three hold on guys I'll be right back bye and it's late yeah I'm back guys I'm sorry I had to go take care of something really quick but yeah me personally you gotta have a grinder bro if you don't have a grinder that's just why like people tell me oh oh you're missing the you're missing the feeling for up breaking it up with your picking Oh get in here with that man get the [ __ ] out of here with that if you ain't using a grinder there's definitely something wrong with you oh I'm sorry I thought sorry guys if that was like what thought of buying something but anyways yeah now just so you guys can get an idea I'm gonna take the nug well I got a lot of it I always get baking some [ __ ] fat-ass nut but take a bit of a fat ass nugs they're just juiciest and sticky spunk nokia slugs I've ever gotten be honest you know what's really weird like when you could openly admit that that's the stickiest [ __ ] know you've ever got but yeah here's enough now watch the magic of this grinder press it down like a normal round one two three and all my freakin flowers and write down it up see in there see it is my part already grounds it up like the only thing I don't like believe it or not is the fact that sometimes it does get stuck in little grooves but it comes out believing out it comes out pretty easily with just a little yeah you [ __ ] believe that and I'll be honest I've had like sharp stones I've had a couple who's I've had a many a different grinder but like yo this is a this is a pretty dope better this is a pretty dope runner I will say that and like it gives just like such a nice grind with your [ __ ] Weed Man like if you can't see that I'm sorry like kinda no power but yeah if you kids if like yeah this is why you need to grind it rough cuz do you have grinders with big holes that are that's good for like Jays and blondes like and I don't like some of you weirdo [ __ ] that like like just smoke some kind of like weird-ass [ __ ] blood because I'm one of those realest [ __ ] who can roll a blunt with a [ __ ] the rapper a backward with years but yeah don't don't copy me if if you want if you want to talk when you go for it but that's how we do it but like and that's pretty good for not only lunge and J's but that's also good for bong rips man you could I'm pretty sure like if you wanted to if you somehow knew how to you could like do some kind of crazy [ __ ] out of it man but you know what that's some pretty good [ __ ] we might actually we pack this one speaker which I will be doing a review on this on this piece and I will be posting it so stay tuned for that that is my my hands-down most favorite piece that I've ever gotten is that roar right there [Music] but yeah let's check our list a couple I'm all nice and hurting but yeah guys just nice ain't like this is a beautiful grinder I mean this is a beautiful grinder like you get some pretty and you get some pretty tasty like I've had dry news that for some weird-ass reason like change the flavor just a little bit it doesn't get really good but it seems it's like a really bad motion prepare itself this this actually keeps the true flavor for some reason this actually keeps a really good like the flavor you want from your bud this pizzas bad like and I don't know how either but shut up shut up to you dude I see you doing your thing and before we take our rip let's go on an adventure cheers dad [Music] I love that I suppose in that bathroom once but yeah guys like you definitely need a grinder for your weed you cannot do any you cannot have weed without a grinder that is if you're breaking your weed up your fingers dude and up I'm sorry guys like someone I got someone here and distracting me during the video but you know what it's whatever it's whatever let's get let's get back to the fun here but yeah guys if you're not grinding your weed up like not really grinding your weed up it's like there's something wrong with you cuz you letting all a lot of them trichomes just sit on that nub you're freaking then I even had a friend a weirdo friend - I don't even know what's worked off [ __ ] this person was thinking brah but I've had a weird old [ __ ] friend turnaround tell me that yo it feels so good just like pull it apart bro with your fingers and then just lick your fingers like no no no no no do not do that if were you gonna pack your frickin [ __ ] your hands should be clean I always wash my hands before I pack my balls because my hands I like mine [ __ ] clean and then to add insult to injury never why would you used to get snacks from like actual stoners like my actual stores what if I would break my [ __ ] up with my fingers everybody yo use a grinder get the [ __ ] out of here yeah do you believe that like but this is why you need a grinder both like you keep all the trichomes well you keep most the trichomes on your flour like yeah some fall off but you know what that's why you have a key catcher and keep caches are perfect too because will humble drop that that was bad but heat catchers are good cuz them like when this gets all like full of Keef and [ __ ] dude like you could roll it you could different joint and all and freaking THC oil and just roll you can [ __ ] him [ __ ] wax on that [ __ ] and just roll you can roll it joint straight out of the Keith if you wanted to like the Dennis but yeah I'll take a while to build up all the key but it's the worth bit bro it's the work that it's not even like a one-shot thing just [ __ ] you can even pack a bong with key because I've done it you actually do get pretty hot you don't you do get pretty hot but that's my that's my idea guys like if you don't have a grinder you're missing out on something that's that's what I think though tell me what you think leave a comment or question them in the comment section below I'd love to hear some of the things you guys got and if you don't have anything else this is feel free to leave a like don't forget to subscribe and follow my social media in this link in description below and as you hear as as

cannabis... - As long as it's schedule one.. \n- Part of it is about it being federally schedule one part of it is\nabout the fact that all of the various laws that have been passed in California\nas far as medical cannabis goes were only written specifically for human\npatients and for physicians. - I never even thought of that. - And that's the problem because the legislators didn't either it was not an intentional oversight on\ntheir part. I just don't think anybody really thought about it but because it's\nfederally illegal and because it's not been specifically allowed by the state\nwe're in this very strange... - So the medicinal only applies to humans? - That is correct. - Yet both have endocannabinoid systems..

Yeah so there is a bill right now before the state legislator ab2215 that would help kind of close that gap and allow veterinarians to discuss cannabis with pet owners so we're all\nkind of hoping that that goes forward because that would really pave the way\nnot only for people like me to be able to help people like you but also to\npromote research in the veterinary field. - Wow.\n- ...because clearly you know that is something that we very very much dearly\nmean.. - It would carry over those research findings to the human application.\n- Of course, absolutely it's all very very applicable. \n- Wow. So for animal lovers or just anyone into sustainable living is there a hashtag\nfor that bill or some some place people could go to support that bill? - Right at\nthe top of our web page are two links one of them is for people to sign\nmoveon.org petition and support and one of them is for people to send a letter\nto Assemblyman Ash Kalra who authored ab2215 to let him know that they\nsupport appropriate and proper language for that bill. - Kudos to you. - Thank you.\n- You're brave. - Every veterinarian that I know and I'd speak to a lot of groups of\nveterinarians everyone that I speak to is very interested in the use of medical\ncannabis they very much want this to become a more mainstream thing so I\nthink the second that they have legal cover if you know you're going to see a\nsweeping change in the veterinary field - Wow. That's wonderful!", "Ys_kaY9o8J4": "LM body Lord vapors tail looking at the canister greater vape and solid body grinder these are two separate grinders this is the fake addition here the smaller of the two grinders now right off the bat quality looks great here this one does actually come with a carry bag as well I'll show you the carry bag off the bigger one next there's a blue canister sticker there you got a little booklet about different screens and additions you can guess it's kind of a modular system this and add bits to it there's jars as well where the voice of canvas is doing a lovely job here a really nice piece of kit the aluminium is beautiful as well so this is our first one this is the vape edition as you can see we have a little black lid there goes on top of the first section here and that's also storage so you can store some herb in there then there's our middle section the body there so as you can see they go together like that if you need to put your plate in first so this is the other side is how they meet up magnetic beautiful melody so I'm good to install this now I'm going to install this wrongly on camera here so I've split the footage up somewhere this is not how you don't do this it's very sharp I did cut myself doing this now if I was clever enough to check you would see on the back you have these two lugs use these instead then you won't cut yourself what an idiot I am I thought I'd leave it on to show you how foolish I can be so okay we can see our two sections together and then at the bottom this is the dish that's gonna collect your hair when it's all ground up beautifully made now I haven't reviewed many grinders this does seem to be one of them it's very smooth action on this so there is a smaller one now let's have a look at the bigger one here you can see we've got more sections on this one it has a filter for collecting Keef on it I'll show you what that this one is the solid body again we have our little sticker at the top here and then we would have a little as well we should have a carry bag for this one so both of these models come with a carry bag there's the bag they're quite handy and this pur filter with this one as well very very handy indeed back canister logo on the side of it now these guys I've not really had them before but they are doing a fantastic premium product here so with this one in the lid of this one we could store extra grinders except traveling a little bit later on so there's our lid on the top section here that's the next section underneath and then we need to add our plate you see we get two here one for a standard grind on the right and your vape grind on the left much finer very very good so I'm gonna install this again speed it up see doing it wrong this is where Lord vaporous cuts himself on camera I apologize use the lugs like I'm using on this little filter here so this is the key filter here which will filter any of the dust coming off your head and store it underneath in this little Bowl here at the bottom and then it comes with a spare now there's our full section put together now all I really need to do now is put the lid on and we're ready to go so let's test out the big log shall we so as I said this lid you can store a spare filter in here for your Keefe and you can also store a there's my have in there there's our grind section let's pop it in so this is the lid see if you can stor storage screen and our is aa spare and also a square plate if we wanted to so we could have a thicker grind should we say now let's see how she Motors so I'm gonna put some herb in here again I can store the herb in the top section and store the ground herb in the bottom section very very clever I don't obviously have a separate chamber for the people so let's see how she rolls so there you go that's safely stored in there I'd really like this feature have not seen that on a grinder before and let's give it a go I've sped this up a little bit but as you'll see there's a sterling job trying to get into those last little bits and let's see what she's done the most fine grind I've ever had if you liked this product priest hit the link below let's chat soon thanks for tuning in bye now", "YmOUfGBH4-A": "hi so I'm surrounded by some serious grinders these are very serious they're hermetically sealed I'm gonna crack this one open I really excited these are Venetian grinders let's open it okay they're made in the United States in Phoenix Arizona can finish and grinders by Venetian engineering wow this is cool they don't mess around with their manufacturing and everything is very medical grade medical grade seals here they use that what is it 6061 aerospace aluminum grade aluminum pretty cool and and what's special about these two I haven't even gotten to play with these I'm so excited oh okay they don't even have threads there's not even threads on here whoa that is a strong magnet oh cool so this is a four-piece and you've got these diagonal cut he's at whoa these are sharp but I think this is a patented thing for them these how these are cut the teeth each of these even have a serial number so that you know it's genuine wow this is really cool talk about a nice easy turn then they lock in so the guy is AJ and Jason found these guys at a trade show and I haven't been able to play with them yet okay yeah so cool that's how you put it that's where you cut it this all stays put because of this notch locking system okay so it goes through here this is the four piece that has the pollen catcher okay so here's the screen cool thing about this too is that you can replace the screen super easily we got rebuild kits and there's a fine course and then a standard grade for your screen and that looks easy you just take this little tool here unscrew it put in the new screen okay I see how that's done all right so that locks into place there and then this guy right there we go and then you've got your pollen catcher I look a little guitar pick it's like perfectly in the grooves there to clean that out a smooth area all right I know a lot of times the pond can get stuck in the bottom just these so here's the bottom of that alright oh that's cool oh my heart pick back here it kinds of different sizes and there's also bumpers for it so I haven't even played with the bumpers yeah but this is so if you're tapping out your product it doesn't hurt your table or the furniture and we got different size so this is the small two piece I'm not going to open these but and then the four piece singing an idea of size this is considered the medium or piece and this is the medium two piece in the blue and then we got the silver and this is the large they can kind of see the difference here small medium large simple simple and then the four-piece large yeah very cool very cool you know what I kind of want to check these bumpers and all these are anodized colors yeah these just fit right here on the top and bottom so when you're tapping it out it doesn't like I said hurry okay that's cool that's nice I like that all right awesome Oh awesome I have been playing with these these are really cool brine ders and that's why we got him because we liked them and they work well and it's a quality and company to made in the US you can go online and they've got a whole list of date they describe their process and it's very I mean they're called for nation engineering they're definitely engineers they've got these really strict tolerances for their manufacturing and everything is deferred afterwards so there you'll never find any like flex if anything you know anything flaking off or anything in here so and that's important when you're consuming medicine so check them out online and we're here to answer

dices it sucks my dick it's so [ __ ] awesome it's got 12 compartments 23 settings so many sleeves you'll be looking like a pocket [ __ ] this thing sucks really see that Wow you know grin you cut not grind whoa that's amazing takes me by storm takes me by storm to Kody this [ __ ] is amazing whoa exciting day here everybody because this is it this is the day that we review the lift and ovations grinder probably the most hyped rinder that I've ever come across really one of the most hyped weed products I've ever seen and it came out to some stellar reviews check them out all the products that I've reviewed so far this would have to be the closest thing that I have yet found to a seven to a 7 just seven seven to seven not out of ten nothing nothing even just seven altogether seven I'm very very very very very blown away by this and just thankful that you sent it over my that we barely barely barely barely blown away by this not to be outdone the cooker grinder it took me by storm I couldn't assume it also cooking my store just cuz the level of like holy [ __ ] didn't expect this really like quality ass grinder to be shipped in via this amazing NS bollocks the clipper grinder took me by storm and I know it took you by storm to I couldn't believe that something so nice become in such an awesome ass box how could I ever happen movie on base grinder is binder I love my alliterations that was the most review that you're gonna get out of her but wait there was more I need to start putting like what I wore or something and oh my god can you find her I'm sorry people hate when I do that I feel like the lens is the eye I don't know but um I seriously should start putting like what I wore in this video in my description box is because I honestly [Music] I'm wearing Ommegang Drewry shirt I got it in Cooperstown New York when I got really Schlitz at this burger no wow so with such glowing reviews already it's gonna be very difficult for me to keep my objectivity when looking at this grinder I mean look at our first take yeah yeah welcome back to customs - bock 710 Live we got another legit grinder of you coming to you today the lift innovations grinder it cuts your meat instead of grinding oh i'm overtaken like a storm and i know that you will be - alright so let's do take to this the clipper grinder formerly known as now known as the lift innovations grinder buy lift innovations was developed by a group of very passionate people led by Jesse Maher one of their co-founders and here's actually a video from Jesse describing what the lift innovations grinder does traditional grinders are hard to use hard to clean causing them to seize up and break flipper uses a rotating stainless-steel blade - and a patent-pending wedge design to cut your herb instead of mulching into those tight spaces Wow so you can really hear how passionate he is you can hear it just dripping off of his voice he's very impressive and like he said this grinder rectifies all of the problems that normal grinders have because I guess I guess my grinder never worked before I had one of these so after over selling their credentials and gaining the right influencers I like this it is a dream well they were able to successfully complete an IndieGoGo campaign raising a hundred and fifty four thousand dollars from eighteen hundred and twenty backers of which I was number seven hundred and forty three put my money in in December I believe as of this moment they have not yet completed all IndieGoGo orders and before they haven't even moved on to the pre-orders yet good for that now look I know on previous videos that I've discussed lipped innovations as a company before and I really want to stress that in this review I am separating my opinion of lift innovations as a company versus their product and there's a pretty good reason for that and that's because my opinion of them as a company is that they are 100% amateur hour and the product they made is fantastic but the company itself I don't know how well it's being run and I have a lot of doubts about it and I can tell you why so in the beginning of the IndieGoGo campaign they said that they were experiencing manufacturing that they were experienced in engineering that they had a dynamic business team that was ready to take all challenges and handle this rapid growth that they were overcoming it was very flowery and it sounded like [ __ ] but we all went with it anyway and now you can't find anything about it I wish I could show you but now if you go to the IndieGoGo campaign it's been whitewashed it's just a blank screen but you can find something similar to it on lift innovations on their site currently but now it says stuff like that they build and design electric cars that build snowboards and wind turbines you can see that they really don't have any relatable experience whatsoever but then again we would what I know maybe this thing does morph into an electric car and I just haven't figured out how to do it yet so what happened I think that Jesse figured out how to use CAD he took that CAD idea to a makerspace paid a raw materials fee took that idea turned it into a dream he's using that dream to pay off his mark and a degree by using the hell out of his marketing degree hey it's a great plan but you can tell that these guys don't have any manufacturing experience because a lot of the mistakes that they've made are avoided by people that actually have experience a few examples are when they first started they didn't know they needed three-phase power the next one was the anodizing issue the next after that was using imperfect aluminum they should have known that you can't get away cutting corners like that and stock and inventory control issues just last week they said they have 340 left of these IndieGoGo orders this is like the 13th 14th of January the very next week they said they only shipped out a hundred because they ran out of blades I feel like you could have looked ahead and said damn there's only a hundred blades sitting here how can we ship out 340 something grinders is very amateur hour and their missteps have had some pretty serious repercussions lensing so that's just something I want to be cleared up before we move off into the review head now on to the review if you are joining us for the first time know that I base all my reviews in five categories which are build quality features performance cost and versatility every category is worth 10 points and at the end of it we will tally everything up and give this a proper letter grade it's been touted as revolutionary and an improvement to an almost 200 year old design it cuts it slices it dices it does your taxes and it probably turns into an electric car I haven't figured that part out yet anyway here it is the review of the lift innovations grinder jumping right into it this is made with the same 661 t6 aluminum that you could find in something like the Cali crusher although this one is far more substantial it is a near solid block of aluminum and with just a few holes that are cut out in it it has a quarter turn technology that's also built into it and unlike most quarter turns the tolerances to which this is built which are quite exacting leaves for it to actually lock in place which is something that's quite nice the anodizing job on this is very rugged and it better be considering how much trouble they've had with it it also comes with little leg darts make a guitar pick scraper and an ashtray slash extraction tool really it's a spanner wrench that would double as an ashtray that's about it now this thing has so many features on it you go to the website really go to a website look at the features this has tons to list but there are just far too many to really go over and besides things like wedge design it are too vague and kind of lost some of the things that we didn't really talk about it comes with additional grinding screens in this case the coarse and the fine it comes loaded with a medium sifting disk it also comes with a coarse and a fine screen inside but and this one comes loaded with a medium all of which are sold separately so you get something very pretty with an almost industrial feel to it out of preferred to seat it with the 775 aluminum like the SLX has but it's chunky and slick anodizing make it more durable and resistant to come goals and alcohols therefore making it easier to maintain and build quality I'm giving this a 9 out of 10 however in features it's getting an 8 out of 10 because I would have liked have seen things like this be included with it from the start here it is the performance category the lift innovations Grindr made a lot of promises when it came to performance and chief among them was that it would cut my weed instead of grinding it they explained that that would preserve the trichomes on my bud and better than a traditional grinder would they also explained that because of its design it was ease of operation was vastly improved over traditional grinders and that it also had a variable grind experience per user so those vape would get what they wanted those that combusted would get what they wanted truth of the matter is it is not that revolutionary it's just something that we haven't seen before I mean when's the last time we've seen a blade in a horizontal configuration really all it is is they've moved the traditional vertical teeth design into just a different format that's simply all it is however because of that teeth design it does lead it to its greatest achievement which is the ease of operation so most traditional grinders as you grind it this surface area is in constant contact this is a lot of friction right but what they've done is they've moved all of that cutting force into a single point on the single drivetrain and that is now where all of your cutting force is applied so that is why it's able to power through very dense nugs and very thick buds so far when we take it to parties it powers through even the most PGR heavy nugs and it does it with rabies but with these grinding plates is where lists promises break down the variable grind experience is not as variable as one might think we did a experiment a few episodes back on a live stream where we ran the same weed through each of the screens and what we found was that the medium screen had a negligible difference between the other two and that the biggest difference was here between the fine and the coarse the medium screens on this really aren't that great in general in fact the medium screen that comes with this it collects key fairly quickly but it's very coarse I wouldn't really consider it key it doesn't have that very fine texture that you would be looking for overall this grinder performs on par with similar grinders in this category and it would be something that I would recommend to somebody that uses a desktop of eight unit or they combust I wouldn't recommend it for people that are using like a portable vape unit I'm gonna give this a seven out of ten in performance because Jesse and his team at lyft didn't market this as a grinder that was just going to work they marketed this as a grinder that was actually going to cut my weed and it didn't nope just kidding but this is one of the most unique grinders that I've ever seen in fact one of the most common comments I get when I bring it out places is oh cool but it's also usually followed with then oh man this thing's heavy and that's pretty much how I feel about it it's so cool but oh [ __ ] not only is this thing really heavy but I'm also concerned about losing all of these parts you know at five to ten dollars a piece it may not seem like much to replace one or two here and there but that adds up and it's not ideal as it stands this is a hundred and thirty-one shipped to your door I went back through and tallied up what I had contributed to the IndieGoGo campaign and it came out to eighty seven dollars and I was a little bummed about that because that's not money I would put up again this simply just needs to cost less as you saw earlier it's a shame that lyft is having so many problems bringing their product out because another company has already beat them to it not only have they reverse engineered the design but they brought it to market faster at a cheaper price at $60 it's competitively priced to other things like the SLX it could suck ass absolutely this thing could be the worst grinder that we've ever used but there it is that's the world's most innovative grinder and it's not lips that's sad for cost I'm giving this a seven out of ten and in versatility it's getting a nine out of ten all right so adding it all up it comes to a 40 out of 50 that would be a be well really a be - well look it passes the lift innovations grinder isn't for me and it's not something that I would recommend to anybody on the regular although there are two groups of people who I could see using this and the first of them would be people with mobility issues that don't have problems holding on to something heavy like this and the second being people that are looking for something different but don't mind tossing a Benjamin at it for me it's not my cup of tea I personally wouldn't buy it again but I'm also not unhappy that I have it it's cool really it's just cool enough to keep around really so that's it that's our lift innovations grinder review for you we hope that you enjoyed it if there are any questions that I

weeks on end but this pipe also changed my life that sounds dramatic and it is but honestly i'm a dramatic person so welcome to the busy butt tender my name is shy i occasionally talk about cannabis and cannabis lifestyle so definitely check out this channel if that's what you're interested in but if you're not interested in me and you want to learn more about the pipe i would recommend skipping to this time stamp because i'm going to quickly talk about me because hey that's this is my channel and i can do that so yeah sorry for being away for a little bit i just needed to take a little bit of time for myself a couple of weeks and it was really cool to get emails and dms from people being like hey where are you are you okay i'm okay i just decided to chop off my hair because i got super freaking lazy and i've been honestly just enjoying a little bit of time off and specifically having a little friend with me which that sounded creepy it's not i mean just this pipe and it's not just this pipe this is my new favorite piece and that's huge anyways let me get into firstly my own history of consuming very very very briefly just so we can get some context as to why it's so groundbreaking that i think this pipe is amazing so when i first started smoking weed i originally used pipes so i'll show you my first one this could be a video on its own but this was my very first pipe it looks a little dingy a little bit scraggly she's seen better days but her name used to be dory because i thought that it was like ooh oceany and then she has like these little bubbly type things the glasses turned yellow she is very very dirty and she looks like a pipe that would be used to consume other things which i do not condone on this channel and i would not no don't do that but that's what dory looks like so this is my first little pipe after that i decided okay i'm a pipe person i'll collect pipes now so i ended up upgrading pipes to get this little glass pipe which i named calvin because it looked like a shirt that i owned by calvin klein that i got at winners and it's really really pretty i like that it's white and black and it's a lot bigger than dory but as per usual because it's a glass pipe it got all freaking dirty everywhere and i don't i haven't used these in years and the reason being is because pipes or like glass pipes or just a lot of pipes in general are one of the harshest ways to smoke weed the reason is when you're smoking from a pipe you're lighting your little bowl which is like in this piece you're holding the choke which is this little hole and the smoke just goes straight through into you into your lungs and this passageway no matter how sure this one's probably better than this one because it's a bit thicker and bigger and longer which you always want your things to be thicker bigger and longer but because of that it's actually going to cool it down a little bit the issue is it's not going to really cool it down like that much in comparison to when you're smoking from a water pipe or a bong or a little bubbler you're bringing it through that water so that cools down the smoke these don't cool down [ __ ] they're just going straight to your lungs and it's harsh and you cough and it sucks and that's why i haven't touched them in years and that's also why i thought that pipes were just not my thing anymore i started smoking with bongs and with small bubblers and vaporizing and i was like why in the world would i ever smoke out of a pipe that's just not a fun experience and then a little old man who's not probably very little i don't know how tall he is but a man named simon came into my life and said hey you're the busy bartender do you want to like try out our products and i said sure whatever i get some stuff occasionally why not and he sent me this this is cool cool is my best friend my savior and the most important piece that i've ever had in my collection and that's saying something so let me talk a little bit about cool a little bit about hoi and a little bit about simon so let me backtrack a little bit hoy spelt like this pronounced like hoi it's not hajj it's not i don't know how else i would pronounce it no none of that hoy hoy means hi in danish like the experience that we like to have on this channel occasionally hoy is a uk-based company that is danish designed herb accessories that's what they call it but really let's be honest it's cannabis accessories the cool thing if you're not a design nerd like me is that danish design is probably some of the best design out there they've created amazing lamps and chairs and they've just done such amazing things with the design world out there so it's really really cool to see that type of lens onto a cannabis accessory it's just such an interesting way about looking at it so essentially who is this company simon is their founder and the main guy that i get to speak to who's so lovely so they sent me a grinder which i can make a whole other video about because that's also fantastic and they sent me this so this is cool spelt k-o-l with a fancy looking oh cool is cool it's very very cool and there's so freaking many reasons why the first being so here let's take a little bit of a look at cool it's this beautiful black pipe which is just really angular it's this gorgeous metal pipe made of aluminum a nice flat bowl and then mouthpiece over here now what's very exciting about cool is that you can do that to it so it's essentially two pieces of aluminum that are magnetically attached which is bananas for a multitude of reasons but let me first talk about the main thing that cool is known for and that is cooling down your cannabis smoke essentially how this pipe works for my rudimentary explaining rude rudimentary rudimentally rudimentally i will explain it simply put your herb over here there's a nice metal filter and a flat bowl when you smoke your herb it goes through here into this metal hole and if you can see through the actual shape it goes into this little avocado pit which is essentially like a tiny tiny little dome and then through there it goes through all of these little grooves grooves and little holes how it works is the smoke travels through these holes and grooves and it creates from what simon explained to me tiny little vortexes and it splits and it splits and it splits and it has these little little vortexes that go all the way through until it reaches the end of the mouthpiece and into your lungs all of those tiny little vortexes and splitting up the smoke so many times means that the smoke has more surface area and it's able to cool down very very quickly so that when you're actually inhaling it through the pipe it's infinitely cooler than it would be from a regular pipe and also from a bong or from other different methods of smoking which is so incredible that it's just based on physics that that works i didn't take physics i don't know what that was transitioning to i didn't i was just i'm very upset the fact that i didn't take physics apparently listen i didn't take physics i was more of a bio and chemistry kind of person in high school but if i had taken physics i would probably be just as excited about the fact that physics is what's cooling down my cannabis smoke that's bananas when simon was explaining this to me he noted that the little dimples and grooves were designed based on the mako shark or the macko shark i think it should be pronounced mako it looks like makko to me and the way that it works is by having this design that's similar to the gills and the scales of the macko shark which is the fastest shark in the ocean it creates these little vortexes which are able to split the smoke take out all those impurities and guck earlier on in the pipe and cool it down so that when you're smoking it you're smoking less of that guck that gets trapped up here and you're smoking them smoking you're smoking a much cooler experience your smoking is a much cooler experience there we go so the bowl itself is a flat bowl with these little like waves i guess the waves that lead it to the middle that kind of starts the process of when you're igniting the top it starts like that turning of the smoke to make it not only even across the entire bowl but then brings it into brings it into the pipe and then starts that little vortex thing happening which is just amazing i absolutely love the idea of like nature inspiring design because that's definitely how it should be this is just it's been such a great pipe the fact that it snaps open and closed like this is also groundbreaking if you look at my pipes of yesteryear these do not clean very well you can clean the inside like of the mouthpiece with a q-tip and this with a q-tip and like soak it in alcohol and shake it around for a while but over time there's gonna be some build up especially down here at the bottom of the bowl that's you're you're not gonna get that out and that's just honestly gross and unappealing whereas for this not only can i just soak this entire thing in alcohol but i can give this a deep clean if i really really want to and that is amazing you can't do that for a bong you can't do that for so many different pieces this is so accessible for cleaning and you can always have a nice clean experience and frankly there are too many people smoking out of dirty bongs and dirty pipes so hopefully this can help them with that what i find really remarkable about this pipe that i was a little bit skeptical about when simon was telling me was the fact that it's made of aluminum or aluminium as he said because it's made of aluminum aluminum is great at conducting heat because of that it actually dissipates super duper quickly so as opposed to feeling the impact when i'm actually holding it it goes away like really really quickly so you don't feel the heat when you're holding this which is fantastic as well because that's also a thing with pipes that you might feel like the heat growing in the pipe itself but you don't feel it at all with this also if you notice whenever i'm holding it it has these two beautiful grooves that are really ergonomic and that just feels so nice like it fits in your hand so nicely like just so perfectly i just love the idea that this is cannabis accessories that are actually designed based on user experience that is so so exciting the last thing i would like to talk about which is probably the least exciting for some people but pretty cool for me is the packaging he used this really really cool cork that he sourced himself from portugal and it clasped on like this and the nice thing about this type of packaging is that it's not meant to be thrown out if anything this is like the perfect packaging for traveling if you want to throw it in your backpack it just pops right in there it just pops in there super easily you close it up it's magnetic and that's it it's a perfect carrying case it's not supposed to be thrown out and it's eco-friendly which is beautiful it comes with three different little metal filters which you can clean or at least i have been cleaning them i i like to reduce reuse and recycle guys i'm not a monster and yeah i mean i just really really like this product i will say it does have a price tag obviously all things have price tags we live in a capitalist society but this price tag comes at a hundred dollars i'm pretty sure us but yeah it's a hundred dollars for a pipe which frankly i know it sounds insane because frankly that's a decent amount of money especially for most donors who want to spend all of that on weed but honestly when you're comparing this to a bong which is roughly can be similarly priced and i have been using this more than i've been using my bongs i would say it's a really really good investment i think that this is something that unlike a bong it's not going to shatter on the ground one day and it's handy and it's small and it's really really pretty i keep this on my coffee table i just think it's super cute and what's even better is that if you don't want to buy the cool full size you can always buy the cool mini which actually just came out a couple of months ago it's 80 bucks it's still definitely a steep investment but frankly i do see it as an investment i think that this is if you're into smoking and you don't want to vape you want to invest in a good quality piece i would highly highly recommend this as a piece i think that it's so easy to use it's pretty it works really well and it's what yeah you get it you get the fact that i love this that's all i can really say so yes overall firstly if my hoi team is watching this thank you so much for sending this to me it's changed my smoking experience for the better so thank you so much and if you guys are interested in hoy or the cool or any of the other products i can't link anything in the description because otherwise this video could get taken down which is super duper silly because it's not like i have an affiliate code i'm not trying to sell anything i'm not selling weed i'm just trying to show off a really really cool product that i think is worth it so that's on you youtube change your rules but google them it's spelt like this hoj once again i know that this was a very overwhelmingly positive video which is pretty rare on my channel i did not get paid to say any of this i know that this was sent to me but frankly i get sent other things to that i do not feature on here because i don't want to tell you guys things that i don't use frank like period i use this so speaking of using let's try it out also i've used their grinder let me know down below if you're interested in a video about this because i also want to make that anyways it wouldn't be a busy but tinder video without me actually trying out the product so let's do it and give you a live impression also look how cute this little stash jar is that i got from one of my friends last year for christmas it says cannabis goose and there is a cannabis goose ah and then we got cannabis in it so cute also haven't said anything enough if you don't believe me you should believe her because they're a massive magazine platform and it was voted best pipe 2020 according to herb so if you don't want to take it from me which why are you watching this video if you don't want to take my advice take it from herb's advice this is a great pipe my one caveat that i do have with this product and for me it's not an issue but it might be for other users is that because i mean the bowl is the bowl is pretty sizable it's pretty large and in charge but because the smoke gets pulled through this you're not going to get like a giant you know hit that's going to make you cough and want to die so if that's the way that you smoke maybe this isn't for you but if you don't want that and you want like a nicer more user-friendly experience to me i think this could be a great option so that's just my own personal preference but let me actually show you what it's all [Music] about [Music] but yeah if you can't tell i didn't cough at all i didn't feel any issues in my throat or in my lungs which again for a pipe is incredible honestly even for a bong that's incredible yeah i love it so yeah that's all for me let me know if you guys have the cooled pipe or if you're at all interested in it i would love to know what you guys smoke from and what kind of things are your top most important things to have in a piece as always i'm your busy butt tender my name is shy and i'll see you guys next time also sorry for being gone for so long", "bpjHiz38odw": "what up YouTube what a smooth whoo what to do and how are you hope you guys are having a smooth day powder vibes and today i'm bringing you just a simple review of the phoenicians grinder if you guys haven't heard of it the description will be in the video go subscribe to formation engineering I'll have that description or that link in the description as well and I thank you guys for being here um either here because you support me or you just want to know about the Phoenician engineering grinder either way I'm gonna tell you more about it now I have had it for about a week or so I never like to do anywhere any my reviews I don't like to just take the product straight out of the box and just record the video on speaking points or just from watching you know past YouTube cuz I don't just want to repeat what they say I want to actually indulge use the product experience it and then just speak on that my own personal experiences so as you can tell it's a little bit different have the love knot design which my name--a eliminates any possibility of sticking so first off I mean that's one of my pet peeves one of my downfalls with a lot of grinders is is it just is it sticks it gets stuck you know I just don't like it and as you can see it's a simple twist to unlock and lock it's none of the twisting and untwisting yeah you can see it's very solid you know it doesn't get loose at all so it's pretty firm grip I really love that and they do offer three different sizes the small the medium and the large and what I really like about the large is it's a conversation starter because it has a slot to hold your papers and it also has a built in ashtray on top so that's just really cool and um my personal favorite is the meeting though for as far as you you know function wise I think the medium is just perfect it's great is obviously the best friend I've ever had to date and I think I'll never have to own or buy another grinder and that is just a great feeling to know that you have such you know such a high quality product you know and it did come sterilized as well you know very clean packaging you know because it's medical grade it's not just you know some simple plastic grind it's not just some cheap metal grinder you know it is very high grade and it is a medical and I like I like it for that and as you can see here the teeth system like I said it has a little flower and pollen buildups I have been using it for about a week to really get the you know the fill for but as you can see here you know the teeth share they have a sharing motion a shearing action they kind of acts like um scissors when you're grinding up so it doesn't crush the flower it doesn't beat it up it doesn't pound it you know it's the perfect you know it's perfect just the perfect amount you know doesn't crush it doesn't ruin it nothing so it's perfect I like it and as you can see let me show you again it has the what is that a trapezoid I believe it's the trapezoid shape so it falls through perfect doesn't get stuck you know I believe the original ones were triangles I do believe but now they have you know they have improved the design and it's now trapezoid and I love it the screens also the screens can't be replaced by just a simple screw as you can see just a simple screw right there and then the screen can be replaced as well so I thought that was a good feature as well and let me just show you the little pollen of the kief section it's in the curvature of a bowl so that just makes it way easy you know to collect the pollen of the kief so that is one of my absolute favorite features you know because I have a hard time sometimes really scraping out the key for the pollen and because of just this of the design but I have never seen the curvature the bulb and that in itself is great feature sorry about that guys I'm a little sick so I'll apologize if my voice sounds a little funny alright like that I believe is just allergies and I will say that Phoenicians grinded they are defining and redefining the medical grade for grinders so to me I firmly believe and not only the product but the company and what they trying to achieve and what they have achieved thus far and they just keep you know push themselves do you know even more and to me you know I love to support and back the company like that the product itself was great like you I said you can see some of the the flower and pollen build up here because like I said I've been using it for a week I have no complaints so far it's been great so like I said I'll have the link in the description below and I'll also have a discount code below if you guys interested in getting one of your very own and like I said once you purchase this phoenician engine this Phoenician grinder you will never have to buy another one so as far as that said let me just go and medicate on a little bit of flour that I have grinded up using the Phoenician engineer I appreciate you guys coming here with me today and I hope I've answered any questions if you have any more questions that I didn't answer feel free to message me I will help you out and you know cheers guys until next time stay positive stay smooth and smoking [ __ ] do leave my name matter the Clarisonic doesn't you ever forget it but I hold like a savage", "BenWyHYA_dI": "hello everybody today we're going to do the raffle for the loose ball car and their promotion and as you can see one of us had

[Music]", "9_yLoqwvgNw": "[Music] Chico [Music]", "jDVF8SVtX0A": "you you what's up everybody welcome to investing in cannabis i'm your host Brandon David welcome back to the new year man it's January we are ready to go we are fired up about it you should check us out you should watch all the old episodes investing cannabis TV we're making a big massroots push right now check us out over there instagram at cannabis pod twitter at cannabis pod okay and it plugs so we've talked many many times on this show that there's really two ways to invest right you can touch the plant or you could not touch the plan there's a very clear line in the industry right now who will invest in what and one of the most obvious segments in the non touching the plant is any kind of accessory right so we're talking about any kind of glassware any kind of pipe anything that helps you consume the cannabis right along the same lines are grinders and you might think yourself well yeah I have a grinder like how we're going to make that any better you know i mean it grinds up the weed it collects mikey if it does what i needed to do well you would be very wrong my friend we have a company on the show today called grail grinder my friend josh here with something all right good thank you being on glad to be here so tell us what's grail grinder so the Grail the Grail excuse me it's okay so they get them up the it's like though you so the Grail spelt g ra le I essentially just combined two words grinder and scale to make it as easy as I possibly could people understand when they see it got it so essentially you know I came up with the idea when I was 19 years old smoking a blunt my parents bathroom you know humble beginnings as we all know that at some point I was fascinated great for the steam to turn on exactly the showers at the right temperature the shampoo is placed and prepped and ready the day / coming up anyway so I was always fascinated with how much took me to get high and how much I and how much it cost me to get high so essentially I would start out with my buddies and we'd get the grand bag from our buddy break it all up into a big blunt everyone gets high as [ __ ] great I was really fascinated with how much do you really need to get to that elevated level that were so so desiring so I took that gram bag made it point eight twisted it up ever and it everyone got just as baked made it point six and much to my friends surprise I would ask them how much do you think we just consumed they would say a grand point 91.1 they would not believe me when I said that we had only smoked just over a half grand because everyone was as elevated as we had always designed and always gotten to so that's kind of when the wheels started turning so to speak when you know hey like maybe this is kind of an idea I figured there has to be a grinder scale in the market there's got you this is too simple little things together you gotta grind or somebody else had to have that I had to do it yeah and sure enough after an extensive google search which we know how scientific that is nothing came up so I then talked to a lawyer to see if I could protect this idea in some way and for him to do a legitimate search to see if there's anything out there and there was nothing so we kind of you know when I was 19 we kind of started slowly with the wheels and you know found an engineer and you know six years later we're here now and almost seven years and we've got the Grail you know in the flesh got it so you're smoking a blunt with your friends and you have a STONER idea that's pretty much what we're talking about essentially I've always had this one that like I want my phone to also be a lighter like the stupid I simple what I love about this story is that you went and you did it seven years or not seven years we have here the Grail grinder so let's just like play with other doubt no doubt so essentially it operates like a standard grinder you got your top teeth your bottom teeth what you can do is click the on/off button to illuminate the scale okay so it kind of operates like each of them would individually to start to make it as easy to use as possible you put your m\u00e9tier can you know we gotta you gotta wolseley cannabis here we've got some Dutch treat over here that's true nothing but the finest appreciate a courtesy of investing in cannabis where she goes from let's let's give a shout yeah yeah yeah this is from the Apothecary 'um shout out apothecary I appreciate it guys and that was delivered through on flea because he popped karriem is our customer so hey God much appreciate it on flea and upon the family for a bit of the pin so we've got a beautiful strain of cannabis here you load it as you normally would you just apply the top teeth and what's cool is that it'll bounce once revert back to zero and as i grind i wish we can get a close-up hear it a simultaneously and what's cool is that it literally is a singer single finger action here so you know you're medicating grandmother's and recreational users alike and use it with ease yes so at this point so if you are consuming cannabis to alleviate your arthritis you now lonely no longer have the problem of grinding it out yet not be it no elbow grease involved this is as simple and smooth as a possible grinder could be so like I say frictionless motion you know yeah you give it a standard a couple taps to make sure it's all down so right now we've got you know it says 1.3 so it's beautiful so at this point you have the option to unscrew as you normally would to pinch the material out no or I've added what we call easy roll capability hmm so the side door opens up and you know we'll easy roll capability wrecked okay so we'll keep it clean here yeah you can simply just pour it directly out just like that very nice very nice or of course you could just reach in there you could reach in as well now someone wanted to be even more accurate they could open up the large door right here okay and extract the whole I called the reservoir tray okay so you can take the whole reservoir tray out if you want to pour into a pax vaporizer a water pipe for example yeah simple tap tap motion we've made the spout almost the perfect size for all those applications okay so we try to make it really thought through this I try you know seven years I had to think of everything comment or oh I don't want say everything almost at almost every there's always something to improve upon yeah but essentially I really tried to take the grinder and the scale you know it's two separate processes and just streamline them there's no reason why we can't go without unscrewing pinching losing some on the way not to mention the whole weighing aspect because you know I want to know like I said how much I'm consuming this is a psychoactive substance and I compared it to alcohol in the sense that you know unless I'm having a really bad day and I don't really have days like this ever you know I'm not swinging from the bottle yeah you've got a shot glass a pint glass a glass you know a wine glass to understand how much you're gonna get inebriated yeah I mean it's a fun product but it has serious ramifications right I mean if you truly do consume cannabis for medicinal purposes the dosage that you consume is incredibly important right I think that's the missing link in this whole equation or whole picture that's being painted like there's so much good work being done on the legislative side and on the social side to really make cannabis you know to put it on the forefront as it should be as we're into the election season and just moving forward but I think you know something that the naysayers may say is that this is not a legitimate medicine in that sense now you can get a recommendation not a prescription of recommendation yep and literally have carte blanche at this dispensary to get almost as much as you'd like right you can get a pound two pounds a month depending on where you are yeah and you know as we all know unless you know you're Snoop Dogg hanging with the crew in the studio that's gonna be a lot of cannabis for one individual user yeah you know so you know at this point I hope or the future I see for this product implementation is that let's open up the doors to the responsible medical use not that people aren't using responsibly currently necessarily but let's quantify this data let's let's understand so that we can get the insurance companies involved because one of the reasons they're not currently is that obviously federally there's a lot of reasons why they're not but there's no way they can really make money off it right now because there's no standard application if I've got a sinus infection I go to the doctor I get my 500 milligrams of as a rift assignment excuse me penicillin and I know how much you take how many times to take that and i know that i will feel or my systems will be alleviated as a result of that yeah and if you just anecdotally if you talk to people that have had a negative experience with cannabis it's almost always that they had too much could agree more a hundred percent of the time i talked to people that have limited experience and I say okay well tell me the story you know and they say well I was with my cousin and he rolled a huge blonde and I hit it six times and I thought I was gonna lose my mind I was on a freight train hit him in the face right and all of a sudden hi exactly yeah and good anymore and but it's the same thing right if you are 17 years old and you never drink an alcohol before not that we condone that yeah and I'm done that and you drink a whole fifth of vodka you're not gonna feel too good you're not going to feel very good all right and just as you alluded to the shot glass is that unit of measurement and we need the same here exactly that's what we've created so tell me a little bit about this process so seven years in the make sure after you have that first idea when do you first sort of start to put things in motion so essentially you know like you said you know back in 2009 and it was kind of an interesting you know dance i'll call it to get it to you know a prototyping phase and the patent phase first and foremost you know i was still living in my parents roof at that point you know the cannabis landscape was very different than it is now yeah you know the laws have changed a great deal thankfully the last six seven years yes so when I first kind of was you know had this called a half-baked idea in my bathroom like it was tough to kind of you know pitch my parents on like hey I'm gonna build this cannabis product don't worry about it can be great and did your parents know you were smoking cameras at the time at this point they did they did they did I started becoming you know i'll say habitual user when i was 18 years old yeah um for multitude of reasons obviously but i really just preferred over drinking yeah all my buddies like catch a buzz drinking beer and I on the corner hanging out yeah smoking a blunt you know um but you went to them you pitch this to your parent I did I did a whole powerpoint presentation like I did this [ __ ] as I could you know my dad you know he's been known to consume from time to time whether or not so much yeah okay so you know it was definitely you know and both of them had you know had to kind of take a leap to really understand it though honestly you know my dad smoking corncob pipes and it's not really right it's old-school he does it the way he learned how to do it and like I said my mother was never really into that culture so is an interesting bridge to gap well and someone that buys a grinder to begin with has a certain level of usage share normally and then someone in addition that would want to measure how much they're grinding you've got to be a fairly serious user yeah and i think the word serious is interesting because i think they definitely be a serious user I think serious in terms of the responsibility they take with their consumption not necessarily like serious is in a heavy you know heavy stoner like I think that like he said I think we should all be serious you use in the sense that we should all understand how much we're consuming you know if it's if nothing else monetarily yeah you know I mean definitely monetarily if you're telling me that that blunt that you rolled you know I can save I don't know five or six bucks on that blunt because thank you know how much it is you're showing how much it is like a percent that's real value so like me like I Lee still enjoy Dutch masters that's just my kind of go to smokable of choice and I looking like an East Coaster yeah I try to keep it under the wraps as best I can but you my you know my bias does does come out sometimes um you know I I smoke point 2 i've smoked a quarter gram blunt at night and that that's my depending on the strength you know I've got a good gorilla glue now back at home so it's a little stronger than the sour diesel I had but you know that quarter gram gets me almost exactly to that level of inebriation that I so desire yeah but don't you find that the rap is a little heavy like the I mean you're also smoking tobacco right so I was looking for a Dutch to bring her obviously I wanted to do like a little like little bit for ya every once in a while here um I really I take a normal like big dutch match like the big gar yeah and I cut it in half actually okay two blunts out of the same jar yeah so essentially that the cannabis to paper ratio is motor area more heavily in the cannabis favor but to your point one hundred percent like I'm behind that's my new years revolution will say is trying to wean myself off blunts here yeah you got to give them the vape that you make stuff right yes you have to senior last episode with that oh oh I gotta get on my back sale yeah oh it's incredible it's incredible luxury experience seriously I got something look forward to yeah but if you have a vape XL or you're interested in one you also need the luxury grinder here right i mean there i haven't seen anything quite like it is there another grinder scale in the world so there is not one that's integrated okay when it comes to canvas so there was a curtain patent when we applied for that was for a food processor that actually weighed and then ground the material is so author like coffee for coffee or any kind of you know vegetable material obviously so our kind of whole angle when the patent office came back and said okay now reoch splain wires is different than this patent we said well RR reverses of opposite so we grind it away right so that was kind of our I'm not gonna say loophole but that was our our entry in yeah a little provocation you know interesting I also find that the the more commercial scales that are for food and things they're not granular enough now right so why you can't way point to that basically start to the droughts isn't right yeah yeah sure so I totally great so that's why this age sure that this measures to the hundredth of a gram so it's essentially as accurate is just about any scale you'll buy in any kind of smoker head shop yeah and yeah it's the only one of its kind there's a current grinder scale that's just two separate units that come into a fake soda can okay to make it I guess stealthy right right but they're not really a no it's not integrated at all and that's why that I use mine every single day yeah and you know the first Grail I ever sold was at the Cannabis Cup in Michigan earlier this year or last summer i should say now and i texted the the person who bought it just to check and see how they're doing you know i was obviously anxious as the inventor to see how it was in its application he goes thank you so much I now know that point 35 grams is my perfect dose oh yeah that's a medical marijuana patient got him northern Michigan whoa so not to say that this has changed his life but it's cool it's a tool yeah this is an apparatus they can really better someone's medical application yeah yeah so tell me about the the manufacturing of it I mean hardware is hard right ridiculous tell me why is it so hard I mean this is clearly a new category of ice right sure so I can only speak this is my first kind of foray into the manufacture world so I kind of was learning as I go the the real issues that we faced was really trying to pack so much so much so many of these processes into one unit so it's kind of a tight space in this 2.75 inch diameter visit the scale the two the two pouring chambers the reservoir trade the Keith catcher you know we really did our best to make it as economic as economical as we couldn't that was the biggest issue oh yeah where was the keep catcher so so yeah so you pop open the large door okay to access the reservoir a got it Rosa work and then you notice the line which are grinds up and you can simply unscrew look and what's cool is that if you wanted to replace a screen which is kind of a new fabric grinders you can buy a brand-new one of these right on our website offers right back on top Oh super easy and and is this are these parts were any of them developed or you had to start sort of from scratch none of us are oh yeah these were all kind of One artists okay these are all one off parts that's why it was so important you know I'd say to anyone that's looking to create a product out there yeah find the right engineer and not just the right one it's someone that you need to be able to train what your thoughts too because i don't have an engineering background so it was really tough for me to find not only someone who's ever seen a grinder before that's an engineer but to really convey all this kind of crazy stuff that i wanted to smash into this one product yeah you know he told me my buddy Anthony who's my engineer told me along the way like essentially you're kind of crazy for trying to fit all this stuff into this one unit like it's it's just that the thresholds are very small but thankfully with you know the fortitude between me and him and our perseverance and we were able to get a product to the market that I'm proud of you know it functions exactly the way that it's advertised and I would not put it on the shelves otherwise we stand by our product completely so take me through the economics a little bit what's your cost here and then what do you sell it for so our cost is you know between you know to the low twenty dollar range our wholesale price is right around forty-five to fifty dollars depending on the volume and we found that typically you know these smoke shops head shops dispensaries like to get their Keystone markup meaning you know just twice markup yeah so you know they then flip it around for 90 bucks and we've had no resistance at all I mean essentially you know when people asking my competitors you know I referenced the Santa Cruz shredders the space cases the Compton grinders you know I'm an owner of those products they're all great products I'll be the first to tell you know however for that same price point because all those aforementioned grinders are 85 to a hundred dollars you get what you pay for but essentially for the same price point at a 90 dollar retail price also giving us go you get a scale plus 2 to pour spouts as well right which is something that seems to be the most kind of eye-catching you know people are definitely kind of Wow tour kind of interested or more intrigued with the grinder scale portion but when they see you can pour it just directly out it they just kind of get excited for whatever reason and that's just something that's an additional unique feature that there's been one or two grinders that have kind of showcased that feature but it kind of drifted away as time has gone and so at the wholesale market we're talking about dispensers mainly or hedge so right now being in a non medical marijuana recognized state you know it's interesting when I go in to pitch my product at these smoke shops because I can't reference cannabis I can't reference marijuana or anything of the like you literally get kicked out of the shop for all you people that have been in variance I before yeah it's very strange it's it's strange you say the B word all of a sudden you know you're out it's a water pipe oh man like you know I went to school at Indiana University for my first year and I said bong the firt and they would not like they said 24 hours I had to wait to come back and I'm off a just made that up a that room no idea but I was banned for 20 of the first and only place I've ever been banned thankfully only 24 hours um but yeah it's just really an interesting pitch when I go to these states that just aren't really kind of caught up yeah yeah yeah sure so $45 to the wholesaler what's the breakdown in percentage between you know what you sell direct versus direct to consumer yeah so right now it's about ten percent online sales director consumer about ninety percent in the head shop I'm really trying to flip that now at this point mainly because there is definitely in an educational piece when it comes to the Grail like people aren't going into head shops and asking for the Grail by name not yet right yeah so it's a matter of you know if we can control the content whether it's on our Instagram at the Grail gral E or on our website blunt ventures com you know we we control all of the media that gets out on that and we control all the information about controlling the media sounds not the right where we control the information on to content thank you so we control that content so we can really tailor it and really be the most efficient and effective in the educational pieces when we are you know producing that content ourselves yeah I mean it's a demonstration type product right I mean definitely really don't you know I can't you know I'm very confident my pitch but you know there's only you know it's tough to convey a product when you're not passionate about it it's not your baby in that yearns to you know so it's tough to find people that share that same passion I mean not only does their education piece but the economics are far better if you're selling a direct consumer right definitely so I should I mean I see that as the big growth here right because I think you're going to continue to come up against the big players in the grinder space when you go into head shops and dispensaries wrestle but what's sort of the strategy going forward you know I mean how do you increase that so you know we really gon hard on social media in the last kind of two to three weeks this is we're kind of learning as we go here perfectly frank so our social media instagram has been the most influential i'd say okay in terms of feedback from users and just active user base massroots has been awesome as well and we work very closely with the guise of mass ruler awesome awesome guys I know you guys are going to start working with them as well yeah yeah no we've had a bunch of calls with with massroots Isaac will be on the show before too long whenever scheduling gets done there yeah yeah Graeme great guys and that's another great portal because talk about a target market I mean that says targeted as any market could be like you know everyone's consume cannabis on yet that poor especially for a product like this definitely right this is like for sure yeah very cool man this is uh I love to sear your sort of entrepreneurial spirit here right because you had a vision and your vision is here your vision is here and it does a hundred percent work I don't know that it's for absolutely everyone but I think you've you found a niche here I was really really compelling just back to the growth stuff for a second here like how is it in terms of advertising so a lot of the social networks are very anti cannabis sure right Facebook and Twitter and Google Adwords and said it's very difficult but technically you don't sell a cannabis pro right and that's kind of the beauty of this whole thing here in that sense is that by having utility patent in a sense Uncle Sam best kind of giving me a seal of approval nods at least in my vision in my view of the situation so you do have to be careful though we market it certainly and the fact that I still am in a non-legal state you know is definitely even more reason to kind of tread lightly yeah i'm moving to denver in less than a month actually so all my operations we moved thankfully to a deadly recognized day i'm very excited and why Denver you know Denver having been there four times in the last handful of months for mostly Grail related stuff for trade shows and other friends that are there it seems to kind of be that the epicenter of that really recreational movement obviously there's a heavy medical marijuana movement there but the fact that they were you know them an Washington none of the the Canaries if you will to kind of you know blazed that trail no pun intended you know I'm really kind of proud to be a part of that community honestly being you know they were there first and they're the ones like I say really paving the way and in the fully legal fully recreational market because that's what i see this i see this obviously as a medical avenue for you know the serious medical patients as you mentioned but i see it in even bigger opportunity in the rec side because like you mentioned earlier you know you talk to people who have little experience with cannabis you know a lot of times the people have had negative experience just have too much yeah and they just don't know whether it's an edible or smoke and they don't ever want to try again exactly so we're deterring a future client essentially our future consumer not because it's unsafe or any of the reasons that are some of the politicians want to say they just had too much to start yeah sure like I did the first time I consume alcohol you know I haven't had Jack Daniels since then yeah it still got that weird flavor my mouth how your drink everybody else drink the kid yeah jack is that drinking a lot of people would tequila yes yeah I'd love to kill that's why I'm like so ass-backwards it comes i also have jack those teach there on TV but when it comes to that recreational market it's like I really see this as you know I see that 18 there are 21 and older responsible adult coming to this marketplace obviously in the four states currently plus DC and more to come but I don't want a barrier to entry being them not knowing how much to consume you know I think it's really important that if someone wants to try cannabis as a responsible adult a good for you as you should I think being a plant that's been used for thousands of years now in multiple cultures but now you've got an apparatus to really help you understand and to really give you that that sense of ease that okay you're not going to have too much you're like you're going to start with point zero five grams you're going to wait five minutes and go from there yeah because when you do that you know even if point zero five is a little too much maybe they're a little uneasy they're not going to have that you know that red alert experience that they're never gonna want to try it again at least in my mind you know no I think it's very important I think it's very important hopefully enough people realize that and take the time to dose adequately let's talk about the future for for a minute here you must have plans for what the next the Grail grinder will look like tell us about it a little bit so yeah without giving you too many details we are near a new deal with a manufacturer design and manufacturing format in New York which I'm super excited about these guys are incredible so now linked up with you know this you know expert team of professional designers and professional sourcing and logistics you know that allows me like while I'm very happy with the product we came up with I can kind of give them this product and say okay let's let's make this Lexus and do a Ferrari you know because there's always something to improve you know you know we're going to be upgrading the material you know we're going to be changing the teeth designed slightly because as we you know as we progress in technology as grinders and pipes and vaporizers there are more efficient ways to do it as we go along yeah so we're going to be tweaking as we go to really make this the most efficient grinder on the market I'm not trying to make any bold claims but I know that the team that we put together there's no reason why we can't do that no it's just a matter of us you know doing the proper testing and and what kind of capital do you think it's going to take to to get you there um you know to be honest when it comes to revamping the Grail it's tough to put an exact dollar amount honestly and that's kind of the beauty of these new partners and that's why it's so important to find the right partners to kind of fill your gaps because I'm comfortable selling it I'm comfortable marketing this product I'm not an expert manufacturer so those guys can take this process not only make it a better product but more efficiently produced as well so when you make something more efficiently and you've got pricing power with hundreds of thousands of other products that they already produce all of a sudden my quality goes up on our cost goes down do you have a concept for for how much you could get that cost down yeah I think reasonably we didn't get it down you know up to twenty percent mm-hmm without changing the volume drastically go you know because we're a pretty low volume play right now I'm being you know where this is simply you know I'm not gonna say proving the concept I think we've done a good job of doing that but we're we're in that infant stage of sales right now both you know so we're really looking to find every avenue possible you told me you so like eight hundred or so 800 but only since October yeah I mean we've had an almost your marketing dollars yeah so we are you know other than social media you know there's been you know no magazine ads or no you know other than being a trade shows and we just kind of Hawking people like hey can I introduce you to the grounds the guys like what the hell's a grant writer comes over so awesome I got 30 seconds yeah to give my stick and have you checked out like any Google Adwords or anything like that like you know grinder scale like affecting a lot of traffic or honest that's the avenue we're looking down right now yes I had an old buddy from high school who works in the digital ad world yeah and he is now being technics he's nice enough to help us out do I look into it and to really kind of lay aight cuz like i said you know the whole digital marketing thing like i don't mean to sound like a grandpa but i'm just not that up with it's not you know like i can do the social media but when it comes to add words it really anything beyond that social media platform you know it's it's kind of be on me like I'm literally hey it's a technical skill number it is and that's something that I think it's important to know what you're good at and though you're not yeah so it's not something that anyone can learn that I guess it's just a matter it's deprivation of time yeah well something to certainly consider when you go out raising money is to find an investor that has that expertise right I feel like I'm on shark tank right now but yeah like has that I can wonder if you say I miss one but uh yeah that has that expertise right then it can supply you with someone that maybe have that digital exactly but something you got that friend that's that's good yeah hopefully hopefully that's good stuff so I mean it's the kind of thing we're being so young and in such a new space that we're just trying to leave no stone unturned we're just trying to throw as much to ken at the wall and see what sticks yeah and that's kind of the beauty of this kind of start up phase that were in is that we can see what works and what doesn't yeah and if it doesn't you drop it you go into the next thing just a matter of being kind of athletic in that sense and kind of rolling with the punches you got to fail fast I'm actually what's inevitable yeah you know I always heard people whether it's an athletics your business saying you know until they hit that that kind of pivot point of that failure where they're kind of looking themselves in the mirror and say you know do I still have enough in the tank I mean that's there's truth to that but again like you said it's just a matter of fail quickly yeah how quickly do you get up totally so you're raising money currently or you have enough for four today what's your runway look lush so right now we're looking pretty good thankfully you know our biggest cost right now is made facturing so the fact that we've got these new partners coming in hopefully a lot of that those costs will be mitigated you know by that partnership so won't be a necessarily cash for equity deal be more of a more a barter deal in that sense that they'll be taken care of x y&z well I can really focus on you know a and B you know the marketing and sales yeah so it's not so much of a cash dealer we're looking for its really kind of what kind of value can you provide us and let's find a way to make it work totally yeah good stuff well when you do start raising money please come back and talk to us can't wait we've gotten kind of good how do people do that so yeah so we come to my absolute favorite part of the show okay where we talk about sort of your personal cannabis use we've talked about it a little bit already I know you like blondes you like Dutch masters right you and Jadakiss I think that's it in the world New York you agree yeah so but what kind of strains do you like the indica guys so really you know again not being in a legal state my hands are kind of tied sometimes yeah but in an ideal world I removing a denver-based so in an ideal world of next month in the very not so distant future Sour Diesel my favorites turn okay by far forget the New York aspect that I'm from New York I mean it's something about Ike you can just recognize that funk and it's our diesel and New York strain is lyrics yeah I believe it's got its roots in New York City ibis don't quote me ya know well that'sthat's problem nobody really knows either but yes I mean there's probably 50 thousand different strains of Sour Diesel am exactly right exactly so I i'm pretty sure that the guy who created the screen initially lives in denver now I'm it was from New York you've done your research go what's your favorite it's friend of a friend of a friend you know it's all this mom that you know it's such a small world you let me know if you find out let me know definitely very curious we'll do a follow-up on that got it so sour diesel and blunts pretty exclusively you said it right you're rocking a blah but at a night at night time you smoke a sativa blonde is that so so let me yeah so my favorite stream overall Sour Diesel like I said there's something about that unique flavor and smell they just I just uh just resonates with me when I at night definitely heavy in the calm you know I'll of that pre 98 bubba kush you know heavy CBD that really kind of you know even just a dab of that pre 98 bub i'm not a huge dabber know and i can get my hand concentrate yeah i'm super on the fence about the concentrates right because like i'll just dabbing you're saying yeah in terms of damning like you know i'll smoke a vape pen or something like that you know oil but the actual dab is really intense man it feels like a different substance yes L I get to that point I really don't do it often yeah i really enjoy the act of smoking something yeah but dabbing feels more hardcore um you know when you get the torch out you know many email cuz i don't have an email support i'm not gonna make any direct insinuations but the torch is just not a good look no no no I'm like my dad visited me one time fee a couple months ago and I'm like dad like you try this dab and I brought you guys what the hell are we doing like I kind of agree that like yeah dabbing is cool and there's a time and a place for everything yes sleep but it's not my cup of tea personally sure good stuff man I don't know where else better to leave it there you want to plug some stuff blunt ventures com okay so you can find the Grail at blunt ventures com it's 79 99 plus shipping flat rate ten dollars shipping we ship internationally as well we've got seven colors to choose from we've got the green the gold the black the silver the red the blue we could show something pink as well um you know we're just really excited to be here thank you so much for letting us come on and kind of thanks for coming man great to meet you it was a lot of fun hopefully you had a good time and thank you guys for watching check us out I mean just everywhere content is consumed so invest in cannabis TV that's our website but also Twitter Instagram massroots we're making that big push on massroots Isaac I hope you're watching this right now and I'll see you in a month or so thanks again for watching guys we'll see you next time you", "R6fjdR04GQo": "all righty folks what's gucci i'm back with another tutorial today i'm going to show you guys how to clean your grinder from top to bottom to make it look sparkling and brand new so every two to three months i would say out person especially for a daily smoker like i am and you're grinding up about i want to say two to three grams per day roughly kind of sort of um more like two and a half um at least for me your grind is gonna get caked up with just residue and little bits of weed and keef and all that good stuff that's going to sit in your grinder and eventually not that your grind is going to stop working it's just not going to work as efficiently and as good as it could the way that it would out the box hopefully now that being said a couple things you're going to need obviously not optional it's a grinder one really really really big tip that i would give to any of you guys who are watching this video go and buy a little toothbrush it doesn't have to be any specific one but a toothbrush as well as a tool of some sort in this case this is a phone screen pry tool um i have a whole bunch of these laying around so this really makes good because it's got a little flat uh wedge bit there that you can use to scrape off little bits of whatever and then to poke a little bits of whatever and do your whatever um so these two little guys come and clutch very heavily when you're coming to clean your grinder um also isopropyl alcohol i prefer not getting 70 but in fact in 90 whatever it is 95 but in this case this is what i have and this is what i'm going to use so the only reason i recommend getting the 90 and not 70 is just because it's a lot strong i don't want to see stronger i don't know if stronger is the right word to use but it's it's it's a bit of a better clean if you will so that being said first things first go and take apart your grinder to the best of your abilities the most you can don't break it um and really go with the toothbrush this is where the toothbrush comes in handy and just really scrub and brush if you will the at least the tooth plates of your grinder so that's this piece and this piece so the nice thing about the wildlife grinder v3 at least i know it's probably the same with the other two versions but i don't know for sure so i'm only going off of this one that i have is the ability to take this apart into 12 separate pieces i think that's great very useful when cleaning although realistically how thoroughly you're going to clean this really doesn't matter because in terms of how many how you take it apart and whatever um i personally don't think that it really makes a difference when you take the whole thing apart all 12 pieces versus just cleaning the four main pieces that it uses um so i don't in the review i could not for life me get this piece and this piece separate you guys remember it took like 20 minutes off camera trying to unscrew this and it wouldn't unscrew not sure why but now it unscrews so that's pretty cool now personally speaking i'm not sure what that actual compartment is for i think it's an ash tray if anybody guys in the comments let me know that's what i would assume people would use it for i know there's other grinders out there i'd believe it's the santa cruz shredder it's one of them if not mistaken or one of the grinders out there the bigger ones that has like a little sloth for your one and a quarter papers and then it also has a little kind of bowl for an ash fragrance i really don't know anyways nonetheless what you guys gonna want to do after you've gone ahead and basically took all the loose plant material off of your grinder pieces um keep in mind when it comes to keef i already have a little container i bought like five of these give it a pack of five for like a buck something or two something uh and that's where i keep my keefe that's really cool um just just make sure you you save your plant material if you really care about it if not if you're like some people that don't collect keef separately and you just smoke everything at once that's fine you know disregard the keeping your key now when it comes to actually going and really the cleaning process of your grinder getting a ziplock bag this is a small sandwich bag you don't have to use a large one just make sure it's at least something that's going to seal properly because you're going to be sloshing the isopropyl alcohol around with your grinder pieces in this when it's zipped so if it doesn't seal properly you're going to get ice probably alcohol and weed bits all over you so you may want to wear like an apron or something like that or i don't know you know what i'm saying just take precautions don't wear your best clothes what cleaning your grinder so first things first we're going to drop our grinders pieces in here now one thing that i want to mention i believe i already mentioned i just want to really get it out there any of you guys are interested in buying the raw life grinder v3 i will link it down below in the description one of my biggest gripes has to be that cave gets caked up in like underneath where the screen is because obviously it falls through and that's you know um kind of a pain in the ass because it's something that may not seem like a big deal to most but over time when you've got keith just sitting there and it kind of gets gumped up and whatever i don't know if bacteria could possibly build up as i'm sure it could so anyways as i was saying you want to make sure that your thing really does seal properly now the reason again it's like i mentioned you're gonna be sloshing some isopropyl alcohol around so you don't have to use a whole lot actually i don't even have to unzip the whole thing really so you want to go ahead and open the bottle of ice proper alcohol at this point i only have one shot at doing this because you know i can't i'm not going to go and like grind up like half an ounce of weed just so i can redo this video but you're going to want to put not too much i don't know an exact measurement but not too much so that being said i'm not going to give you like a rough estimate because i am absolutely trash i give estimates on mounts and stuff like this but really make sure that this is thoroughly cleaned so i'm gonna go ahead and put my old um rolling tray on this as this may leak a little bit because it's a cheaper one and you want to really just you want to shake it around do a couple different kind of moves and whatnot and really just let it soak now at this point like i said you want to let it soak um maybe getting a bigger bag would have helped but nonetheless you know you can repeat the process with the same isopropyl alcohol and put it in like a large plastic container you know that would also help but it doesn't have to be um and what you want to do is really just let it sit now the nice thing let's move this out the way is it does not take very long it takes at most i would say maybe a few minutes and if you really really want to do a really nice job at cleaning this and disinfecting it and whatever um oh not like watching this called um alcohol wipes sorry guys blanked out getting alcohol wipes these are the ones that i use these are medical grade i believe hygienic wet wipes these are all called wipes so use that and really wipe it down afterwards and then i'm going to show you guys i'm actually going to have to show you guys rinse it under water thoroughly you don't have to because of rubbing alcohol is going to evaporate but just my sanity i want to rinse it down um and what this alcohol is going to do the rubbing alcohol is going to break down all the plant material that's built on to your grinders pieces um i'm just really you guys can already start to see that it's it's turned green like that almost instantly just turns green slosh it around hold on to the sharper bits because you don't want it to puncture the bag and then you know you spill iceberg alcohol all over your dresser in my case [Music] but like i mentioned it's going to evaporate so i'm going to let it sit for a few minutes and we'll get back to the video all right so literally two minutes later and we are done so at this point actually one thing i did not think about i'm actually gonna grab is some paper towels all right so i've already gone ahead and rinsed off all the pieces of the grinder that i cleaned one little tidbit and this is something it's kind of optional but again in my case there is still a little bit of you know whatever left over on the grinder's teeth so that's the only part of the grinder that really needs to be kind of hit again if you will you know because it's been a bad grind but uh i i see saved this bit of water here to show you guys i don't know some of you guys actually want to see this you find it satisfying so wow there goes my toothbrush almost do not drop your toothbrush so i'll show you guys a little weed particulates in the water that's that that's pretty it's pretty straightforward in terms of the process like i said it's not really difficult so another reason why i kept the water is because i don't want to have to use fresh alcohol just to dip my toothbrush so dip your toothbrush and kind of hit it once again with the toothbrush after just literally soaking it in the um isopropyl alcohol that you already use and to really that's going to give you a bit of more of a thorough cleaning afterward to just really ensure that all the teeth on your grinder are clean and when i'm done doing that i'll get back to you guys so again just to show you guys you guys can see that those three teeth in particular have some gunk stuff you know just left on them now one thing that really really is nice about disaster probably alcohol even though it's only 70 the one thing that it does and the reason why i recommend because it works is because of the fact that what it's doing is breaking down all that stuff that's left over on your grinder and trust me when i tell you guys i'll show you guys the screen in just a second it looks brand spanking new now granted i i can imagine if you were to leave this grinder though i haven't cleaned it at all like no dekey thing or anything for a year i can imagine it would be probably like five times worse than this uh to where i would leave it in the rubbing alcohol for about maybe three minutes four minutes um if you have cheaper grinders that are you know colored or whatever it's not just like bare steel or whatever or aluminum i should say um it's probably not recommended that you leave it in there for long periods of time so maybe leave it for like 30 seconds take it out rinse it wait 30 seconds and then repeat that until you're satisfied with the outcome um and the reason for that again is it's gonna take away the paint the rubbing alcohol unfortunately as you guys know will take away maybe not all of the paint like you know but it would probably more than likely take away at least some of the coloring that's on your grinder and a little other side tip again when you're dipping your toothbrush or whatever kind of brush you're using when you're dipping it don't worry about excess rubbing alcohol dripping um that's why like i said earlier really make sure you do this over a surface you're not worried about getting rubbing hook all on um and just really give it a couple hits even if you don't see anything just so that peace of mind with me knowing that my grinder is going to be clean look at that look at that brand spanking new the teeth are really i think 100 gunk free now which is nice um i guess if you have like an electric toothbrush i'll probably work like 15 times better but that's that um looking again on the bottom set of teeth just kind of you know dip it in this alcohol one more time and that's when it's done now after this obviously you want to rinse this off with water again and you can let it air dry but personally i'm too easy to do that um i'm gonna let it i'm gonna dry it off with a cloth that's pretty much that man and that really makes your grinder look brand new now granted like i said this is not perfect i'm gonna wipe this down with some rubbing alcohol wipes um it just really really works super super well i know this video is a bit lengthy but i mean when you consider that this is probably the best results you can get at least what i'm aware of this is again a worthwhile watch um and i've i'm doing my video because honestly i've seen some people kind of half-ass what they do and just not really they dunk the pieces into the rubbing alcohol instead of letting it sit there and uh it doesn't get you as thorough of a clean i guess it could work if it's a light bit of dirt right it's not really dirt but res uh being left over but and also really make sure that your key screen is dry before you use your grinder if you're gonna use the keep screen um that's also another i guess perk of having this grinder is you can take this keep screen off but that's pretty much that if you guys enjoyed this video in houston you find that this works really well too let me know by hitting that thumbs up button and subscribing until next time smoke on", "VnifrgyNVHg": "[Music] so [Music] what's up guys one hot world we're back at it again [Music] 20 minutes later [Music] let's get it going [Music] oh what's up welcome back to one hi world we got here the finishing grinder and this is a large water it's the largest one there's different ones they have the one that has the um the cut inside of it yeah hold paper but obviously i didn't you can go get this grinder at phoeniciangrinders.com magnets pretty strong you definitely need two hands to open it so i used it for about four days the teeth of the grinder they just be slicing through that butt like nothing so like a blade style teeth they just be chopping and slicing pretty chunky of a bud yeah yes we do use our grinders yes this [ __ ] may be dirty why would we bring you a clean grinder for real if you're a tapper or not but i tap all of my grinders all the time i tapped the [ __ ] out and they hold up paint scuffs sure because you can see i tap the [ __ ] out of it i mean duh the chamber i'm not gonna lie it has i think the capacity to hold about an eighth i think you can grind a whole eighth in there but on its own just dump it all in there you don't think so i think that i think it's how do you get close with it you can do like maybe a gram and a half real life test you got your scale that's three and a half right there it'll do it but it's not going to do it the way it's supposed to do let's keep it real here let's see all at once yep yes oh it just might well damn as long as it's a as long as it's three and a half it don't matter how you break it up in there right that's pretty straight nice see that's why you're not supposed to do it like that you're squishing well you got to get the blades in there now you want some blades to come down smooth so we can actually grind it up the way it's supposed to see you can't even move it right now still did a good job i ain't gonna lie um yeah [Music] could you yes would you should you probably not i say this thing does at least two to two g's it'll fit yeah a whole eighth in there though throw a little bit of nugs grind it up stop throw it a little bit no more nugs grind you can't throw in the whole [ __ ] thing in there it'll it'll they do come serialized with the serial number they do have different various colors this is a four piece grinder also we were looking on our website and i do have a customization kit for the for the keith catcher you can undo that with an allen key [Music] and you can change out the grid the screen this is one thing you light can barely pass through it that's how much i've used this grinder i think this whole screen is completely just clogged so if you're looking for some nice cake patties i don't think you're gonna get that right off the rip the next thing i'm gonna do is get the upgraded screen and come back at you guys and let you guys know on how that ends up going you can watch that on our instagram here when we get an update for you guys the downside to this grinder is it's kind of heavy oh [ __ ] it is see it's not as heavy as it looks don't have a glass table because if you too high and you you do that that that's the table's gone done done so this is over a span of how much time uh that's been some time that's been a good probably six months maybe okay so you cleaned this up before so what do you think i think it's a great i think it's worth it i think it's worth it if you're looking for an at-home grinder that's big as [ __ ] and you can always just have a nice good amount of weed and you want good quality made in the u.s made in the usa um i don't think you can't you can't complain there you go the finishing grinder my crooked finger oh peace and it's like all broken and [ __ ]",

welcome to the ritual channel my name is DOM and today we're are we talking about our favorite grinder on the ritual Channel so this is our favorite grinder it goes by the name of kozo grinders and there's also one called irony I'm not sure if I Rainey's a knockoff or whatever but the Iranian one does not have the label on it on the grinder at least and the kozo one has a grind has a label on the top which is actually very helpful because on this one you can't tell which side is is up or down because there's no labeling on it so maybe you want to put a sticker something like that if you get the IR anyone now I know you might ask why do you have six of the same grinders well that's gonna lead us to our first reason why we like this grinder so much is because it's is a great value and this one costs thirteen dollars this one the cozell one the branded one cost $19 and it's just a great value for $13 you just can't beat it there are places in the United States where you can't buy a pizza for $13 there are places where you can't go see a movie for $13 but for $13 you can get this shipped to your door and it should last you a lifetime because it's such a good value you can purchase multiple grinders and we like multiple grinders because for example if you have a sativa that you're smoking in the morning you want to grind it up and you still have some leftover you can just leave it in here and smoke it in the next morning and then you can have another grinder right here lunchtime weed nighttime weed so that's what we like having multiple grinders and because this kozo grinder is so economical it allows us to have multiple grinders without spending too much money the next reason why we like this renders so much is because it has a removable screen which can make it either a four piece grinder or a three piece grinder and those of you guys that watch the ritual channel know that we love three-piece grinders because honestly you know we just don't like saving the key for later we rather just smoke it right away however if you do like the screen and you like to sift your Keef then you can add the screen in there and now you have a four piece grinder just like that so we love the design for that aspect we also like the nubs although they're not the prettiest things they are very very functional also the grind quality that comes out of this grinder is very very very good it's got a very fluffy you know easy to burn type of quality it doesn't match up the weed or pulverize the weed which we really like so just a very clean and very very good consistent grind quality so pound for pound dollar for dollar this is our favorite grinder on the ritual Channel do you have a favorite binder please let us know down in the comments below we'd love to check it out on the ritual Channel thank you for watching we hope you enjoyed this episode subscribe if you already haven't and have a great day see you in the next one [Music] you [Music]", "iJu2iIZmnCc": "what's up guys it's East Coast Oak just a real quick video let me do a bar it first the user hit me up on my comments on the channel and wanted me to talk about cleaning a grinder now the two key parts of cleaning a grinder especially a for chamber like his was you want to keep the screen and the kief separate away from this whole process if you want to clean your screen you use the makeup brush I have a video of that showing how to do all that look that one up you do not ever want to get to keep wet I see no reason to get the bottom bottom trap wet all that does is collect Keith there's no reason for it to get mega dirty if they got dirty stop [ __ ] around and take your [ __ ] serious all you really need to clean are these two parts you can see the [ __ ] starting to build up on mine but all you really want to do all that black [ __ ] that you see forming up on the sides there that [ __ ] all comes off all you got to do is soak it in is oh that's really it just throw iso bag of iso alcohol and salt let it soak shake it up a little bit pull just these two pieces off just the top two pieces you do not want to soak your screen you do not want to soak your keep trap just these two pieces take a q-tip in between all those teeth and get all the [ __ ] out all the black [ __ ] take a q-tip to it'll come right off when it's soaked for a while and it's soft so sorry I couldn't walk you through it and show you step by step hopefully this video helps you guys out helps anybody out that has this problem that's trying to clean their grinder with a four piece you know the drill guys is East Coast hope subscribe to my channel shout out Humboldt hemp wick stay high work hard smoke harder guys peace and love and a ninja cat look at that nug that got trapped in there yummy yummy yummy this is my savings", "a-yUsYUrISc": "[Music] hey guys so this is the master dam for peace 2.2 inch or grinder so it's made with high quality aluminum and the top is a magnet it works very well and when you get your grinder you'll notice the teeth are very sharp so you can shred and fluff your herb with ease and so your herb will be ground through this section into this compartment that has a mesh screen your herb will collect in this section and through the mesh screen it will collect the pollen on each of these grinders come with a little mini scraper for collecting pollen thanks for watching you can find a variety of grinders and stash shield jars on the Master Dan website or amazon.com [Music]", "Cj87ikVnOCg": "hey you it's Paul from define in the box what we're defining the box to help you think outside of it this week we got the Golden Bell nice cute little Greiner it's the top-selling Grindr on Amazon three takeaways it's so cheap it's hard not to like secondly it has a very fluffy consistency that works for almost any consumption device and three is the kief catch is a pain to open it took me forever and there's a lot a lot of threads here overall score comes at a three point four two coming in a little bit above average the fact that it's cheap helps it a lot who's this for this is for the first time user who's just trying to figure out what a grinder is and get used to it who's it's not for someone trying to grind up a lot and being able to get a grinder that can handle anything that they throw at it we have five main variables to get to our overall score grinder came at a three point one has a very good grind consistency but yet it does not much grind capacity store it's got a two point three threats are pretty hard to open and it actually has a pretty small storage capacity longevity got a three point five with a lifetime warranty had an eight dollar price point it's pretty hard to beat but also the threats make it really hard to use miscellaneous got a three point for Amazon customer service is more than sufficient price got a four point five at an eight Tyler kinder it's really hard to beat I dive into how we got to each of these ratings later in the video [Music] so the overall rating is combined of five different categories they each have their own weight and rating we summarize those together to get an overall rating of three point four two now I'm gonna dive into each rating and how we got to each of those scores for the full weights and the rating and how it works is look in the description will describe it in detail first rating is the grinder rating they've got a three point one and is made of three subcategories grind speed grind consistency in grind capacity grind capacity it got a two point five that's basically how much product you can fit in the grind section a two-inch grinder is pretty standard in the industry but it has a lot of grind teeth on both the top and the bottom making it really hard to stuff a lot of product grinds P you got a two point five that's how fast we can get it from the unground to ground state it performed nearly as well as the pen simple our first review but what it did struggle with is that it would get stuck in these top sections and not actually fall through to the little holes third is grind consistency you got a four point five that's a little variance there is in your ground material it performed even better than the pen simple in the first grinder it and fall through as well but when it does fall through it's a perfect fluffy consistency that works with any consumption device second we have storage storage came out to a 2.3 and is made up of four categories storage capacity dispense speed Keith's catch and portability storage capacity got 2.5 it's basically how much ground material you can fit in the storage area this little grinder can only barely fit one gram with all of it ground up but it's a two inch grinder and it's just a little bit shorter so it makes sense dispense be they got a 2.0 that's how fast you can get it from your grinder into your consumption device the little threads right here are a little hard to open so it makes it hard to get product out keep catch you got a 1.5 and that's how easy and accessible is to get your Keith catch open this one is such a pain in the open that I have to give it a 1.5 and then once it's in here it's really it's really just small not convenient got some in here but it's more of a pain than anything else like just like it gets stuck like that like if you have a hard time like getting it back on the thread be very very precise lastly it's portability with a 3.0 that's how easily you can take your grinder with you wherever you go and if you need to bring another bag with it you'll easily throw this in another bag you can probably put it in your pocket be pretty uncomfortable so it's a pretty average portability size next we have longevity how long is this prod are gonna last you how often are you gonna use it within your stash collection for longevity it came at a 3.5 and is made up of four subcategories durability ease of use ease of cleaning and cleaning frequency durability I got a 4.0 that's just how well it can withstand all the elements there's a little bird on the side of this and it's obviously made in China but it has a lifetime warranty and is ten dollars so still gets pretty awesome rating ease if you still got a 2.5 that's if there's any initial learning curve and once you make it past the initial learning curve does it help a lot so it's a normal standard grinder but the threads make it a little bit harder that's where I definitely see an advantage with the premium grinder averse and not premium grinder cleaning frequency you got a 3.0 that's how often you actually have to clean it you can actually grind through most stems but given how close the teeth are it does take a little upkeep ease of cleaning I got a 4.0 this is once you have to clean it how easy is it it's a super small simple grinder it has a nice nickel coating where you can just and isopropyl alcohol it'll be good to go forth is miscellaneous these are all the other categories I didn't know how to put into the top three miscellaneous came at a three point four and is made up of two categories customer service and novelty customer service got a three point five that's just once you have an issue how easy is it to deal with that's an Amazon product enzyme only actually so there's no like troubleshooting pages or different like support bots but Amazon has pretty awesome customer service so came in at three point five novelty you've got a three point oh that's just how unique it is and you want to share with your friends it's just a standard old hockey puck right there nothing unique about it lastly we have price that's how it's priced relatively to the rest of the grinders on the market got a four point five eight dollar aluminum grinders pretty hard to beat so in conclusion it's so cheap it's hard not to like gives out a great fluffy consistency but you do have to pick it out of the grind teeth

what the [ __ ] is going on straight up i don't know what the [ __ ] is going on roll the footage okay so i was on facebook earlier right and here i was being you know an innocent bystander and i saw this post it talks about how you can clean your grinder um and also make edibles at the same time with your grinder and heavy cream people also use milk and at first i thought it was [ __ ] disgusting in that nobody was doing it but i looked it up and i scrolled more through the facebook and um everyone was doing it and apparently it's a thing and i refuse to believe that i will not i repeat not be drinking um grinder slop but i would love to see if this milk does clean the grinder like i really want to know um they say use heavy cream because it has a higher i guess fat content for the thc to stick to but um [ __ ] that i'm not [ __ ] drinking it that's not sanitary the point is does this work i need to find out and we're going to find out together so if you want to see what the [ __ ] is up keep on watching i genuinely want to know like who came up with this like who was just sitting in was like you know what if i just put the grinder like in the milk i don't really know where this came from and i think that's why i'm just so [ __ ] confused by it let's put it all in and it's supposed to be like completely covered in milk this is so [ __ ] bad i only have one other grinder and um i hope this works and doesn't just [ __ ] up my grinder it's so crazy that it could work though do you know what i'm saying ew i'm gonna cover it and it says to let it simmer for about an hour it's 12 o'clock so i'm going to come back in an hour and see what's up with this okay so it's been about an hour and this is the final result at one point it had this like big film of like dirt and i guess weed and it was like this grayish greenish color i wish i got in the picture but it began boiling and all boiled off so that sucks except not really i was not going to drink this so now that it's been about an hour i'm going to pull it out and see how the grinder looks okay all right wait wait no we know no is it clean no way ew hold up let me get the rest out real quick are you kidding me it works i know i've heard of boiling your grinder but like this works oh my god i can't believe this but like do you see how nasty that is that's why i cannot believe you guys are making this edibles like honestly just take a tolerance break if we're taking our grinder and putting it in like our edibles there needs to be an intervention or something because that's just too [ __ ] much do you guys see this this like weird like milky weedy film so there's this like disgusting like milky film on the grinder that i'm gonna have to wipe off so i'm going to keep cleaning this and just keep it pushing just wanted to show you guys all where i'm at okay plot twist my grinder uh broke about two seconds after i ended that last clip uh maybe i can fix it probably not i'm noticing that the inner ring is bent so i definitely will not be boiling my grinder at all again i knew this might happen oh well i'll try and fix it but if not um i'll just be back with my final thoughts here's the final verdict the grinder is pretty clean this is the uh you know middle part it's kind of shocking the more i thought about it it makes sense because you do like boil your grinder with water um i've never done that i kind of just buy new grinders and uh yeah it definitely cleaned it um i got some milk grime caught on here as we know i got milk grime caught on here i'm sure it could come off but it and then here is the fourth piece oh would you look at that sorry it's some uh i guess wax that's been like at the bottom of my purse which is why i don't know why the [ __ ] you would drink this milk this comes back to that just saying overall i don't know why somebody would do this um i'm glad that i did it um i had fun if you're willing to take the risk and drink the milk honestly it will work and like i know in my mind that it would work and i think that's why i just like unbelievable to me but yeah this was definitely a fun experience um comment down below and tell me if you've ever tried this before because um it seems to be a thing but it doesn't seem to be very like mainstream i hope you enjoyed this video be sure to like comment and subscribe be sure to follow me on instagram at indica wife and yeah i will see you all in the next video bye", "jbXw8njcRlQ": "what up YouTube so this is a quick little video on whenever your grinder gets jammed and you can't twist it and it gets difficult and hard whatever the case may be um when it gets jammed all you will need is a hair type and yeah just kind of twist it up in the grinder teeth take the lid and grind it as if you were opening it and voila that is how you unstick your grinder lid whenever it gets caught from all the debris and whatnot of your cannabis use or other materials that you use so thanks for watching and I hope this can come abuse have a good night", "rCG0rSiCNWU": "would you buy a $2,000 weed grinder Barney's the luxury low-key overpriced department store is launching their own head shop called the high-end they're selling bongs for a thousand bucks and weed grinders for two thousand dollars it's a store within a store kind of like Starbucks is with every Barnes and Noble you ever read a [ __ ] book there'll be a head shop in every Barneys in every legal State and they'll be selling luxury smoke items from companies like to bombas rolling papers pipes by Simon and Salazar and stash boxes by Martina Lee a sterling silver pot grinder cost fifteen hundred of pop pipes cost your average pipe company like a dollar to make a pack of papers cost like a quarter and a stash box if you find a good price may cost a company like two bucks to me and they all do the same thing Scott Campbell celebrity tattoo artist and also a founder of a high-end cannabis line said but I have time to enjoy weed I

__ ] thank you guys for watching I'm Jeremy with Dane City and now is your cannabis news of the day", "gyPtsxzQg3M": "what's up guys it's Kyle here from tubes distribution welcome to episode 14 of a tubes talk I wanted to bring the all-new whacky grinder out for us to try today we've had so many questions from shop owners to dispensary owners on how this product works and we want to show you exactly why it's taken over the grinder market so in stores all across America there's always the same problem with a customer who buys a traditional aluminum grinder now the magnets gonna fall out it's gonna cross thread or the teeth are gonna break off and that's just annoying that's one of the reasons I really like the wacky grinder it's gonna cause less drama for you as a store owner and a customer service side of things whack it does an incredible job making sure they get back to every single person who encounters an issue alright so first off what you're gonna notice here this is the packaging for the wacky grinder they did this Green Goddess on the outside on the top they're gonna have their logo and then on the outside that way your customers can find everything out about the web kit you're gonna have all the emoji cons from Facebook to Instagram snapchat Twitter and YouTube so you can find out all the amazing information on this product but when you pull it off it's kind of like an iPhone box and then you're gonna find the the grinder located on the inside you're also gonna have a grinding plate which also acts as a rolling tray and then in the very bottom once you pull this off is where you're gonna have the charging cord alright so now that the Wacka is out of its actual packaging you're gonna notice right here this is where you're gonna plug in the micro USB cord to charge it once it's charged it'll run for almost 18 hours it's all push-button so all you have to do is push the top to activate the ball and chain on the bottom [Applause] now what's cool about this grinder is this ball and chain acts like a little tornado and as it circles around it'll actually lift the herb off of your rolling tray and they'll start to dice it and cut it while it's doing that will also remove the stems and the seeds and leave them right in the center of your rolling tray all right so now you've seen the Box you've seen the packaging and I've pointed out a few awesome features of the wacky grinder we're gonna put this thing to the test I've got a Canadian lumber rolling trailer right here I've got some locally grown herb and it's time to grind this thing down so now that we have our herb pulled apart she's gonna basically take the whack at grinder super simple you're just going to put it right over the top of your herb now there's three different ways you can use this the first pump which I'm going to show you here that's one push you're gonna pull it off and that's perfect consistency for any of your glass pieces you know personally I prefer the first pump but let's go to the second pump so you're just gonna push it again now this is going to be perfect for any of your papers joints blunts any of your hemp wraps things like that and then on the third push once you do the third pull it off it's gonna be a little finer this is perfect for like your dryer vaporizers or anything else that's electric on the market so now you've seen how the whack grinder works this is an incredible product we do have these on the website they're available individually or in a ten pack for a great price you're definitely gonna want to get these in for your customers to enjoy and the cool part about this is you can whack it anywhere you can whack it in your car you can whack it at work you can whack it anywhere you want so jump on the website pick these up for your shops and if you have any questions feel free to give us a call here at tubes and we'll help you out thanks for tuning in [Music]", "xI7vn2I0A_I": "[Music] mattli stuffs donors like
