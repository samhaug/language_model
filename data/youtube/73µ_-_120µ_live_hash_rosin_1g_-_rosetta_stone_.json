{"o6UrX9n_UWo": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys it's cliff with peer pressure here thanks for tuning in to are solving this review series we've got Roz and Ryan from olio here today we're gonna be checking out his papaya punch number four let's get to it [Music] the papaya punch number four from olio is a cross between purple punch and papaya both heavily indica dominant strains the purple punch was giving me hints of grape candy and a sweet blueberry muffin fresh out of the oven while the papaya was was on the sweet candy side of things papaya candy maybe a little hint of mango in there and it's very surprising that it was an indica dominant strain because most of the effects I was getting were what you would attribute to a sativa dominant strain and I was getting a very energetic productive and uplifting high I tribute this to the high concentration of limonene found in the string and the limonene is really what was giving me that mood elevation in euphoria the second most concentrated terpene present and this strain was Lin Ahlul and I tribute that to the relaxation and stress relief that I was getting from this hey guys it's clip peer-pressure here welcome to the solvent ice review series this is episode number two we've got rosin ryan here with olio and we're gonna be reviewing the papaya punch number four this is our jam product this is been heat cured this is pretty much the most separated of all our consistencies as far as THC a and terpene content within the rosin and we believe it's probably the most shelf-stable even if you don't put it in the fridge or anything like that it keeps flavor for a long time and it's honestly my favorite consistency that I'm smoking right now so you can leave this out and it doesn't it doesn't you know decrease in terpene value it won't dry up which some people do like but this here let me show you here sure so what's this little dab tool here so every gram of ours has kind of comes with a personal dabber it's just a little extra thing we do just select emergency dabber in case of situations for sure very nice nice touch so what can you tell me about the the strain here so this is our papaya punch number four this is we have a few different fee knows we always Fino test a few different seeds that we get it's like the most exotic fruity and most punchy almost phyno it's got an exotic note it's um it's got a little bit of that artificial grape in it from the purple punch it's probably one of my favorite strains at the moment and this is from pony seeds papaya times purple punch very nice yep this is perfect for during the day I'll run some errands after dabbing some of this stuff it's very relaxing but its clear-headed yes it's a hybrid like most things are nowadays and for me personally I know it's different for everybody but I could dab some of this and still get a lot of stuff done during the day I don't feel too body locked or anything like that I still I'm ready to go you know do my stuff for the day so got that clarity stay exactly exactly and it's so flavorful that I almost don't expect to relax feeling I'm expecting some type of anxiety yes achieve a high but it's honestly perfect mellow high for the middle of the day definitely so how do you typically go about finding a good hash string it is many different steps so first of all to grow which ones grow nice we can't get any males obviously we take out the males whatever females are left it really is dependent on how well they grow their yield in the garden then once we wash them it's gonna be based on water hash yields it's gonna be the thing that plays the most role and if we keep it or not if it does yield well a nice hash and it presses well usually we'll keep it it all depends on flavors yields we all come together smoked them we all you know put in our opinions of you know which one do you think is a little bit tastier versus if the yield if it's really worth it sometimes we'll take a tastier one even if it yields a little bit lower just because it's got that little extra that we know people will will enjoy it so for sure so what do you thoughts on fresh frozen verse washing dried and cured flour so you can wash cured I've seen it done stuff 99% of our stuff is fresh frozen almost almost all we have our own in-house garden everything is harvested fresh frozen washed within usually one to two weeks so we try to wash it as quickly as possible really keeps that terpene profile just like it was when you were smelling the plant so when you're going around you got your fingers on the nose I want that to be what the rosin tastes like yeah I went down I really do think fresh frozen you know produces that a little bit better of a quality in the end for sure yeah so yeah you talked about doing BHO extraction in the past and you know when BHO first came out people were always looking for a light golden color but it seems now that things are kind of moving more towards an almost white color and I've even heard of people pulling their plants early to even get that color do you have any comment on like that is a huge trend right now in the in the grow world as people know you can pull your plants a little bit early but you're gonna sacrifice what I believe is a little bit taste and your potency the effects from you pulling early I believe are gonna be felt people really go for that visual yeah so when people see white hash they really they get excited yeah I think people really need to try the hash more side-by-sides sometimes a darker hash will blow the lighter hash out of the water with taste with potency affect how it makes you feel so I really think people should try stuff before you know everybody eats with their eyes so to speak but but uh you really gotta get smoking yeah so what can you tell us about the terpene profiles some of the flavors that you're getting up the papaya punch number four so this number four is probably our most like exotic fruity vino of this papaya punch it's mostly papaya notes it's that exotic fruit in there and it's got a little bit of artificial grape in there from that purple punch that's definitely that's it in there I think it's probably the most well balanced of our papaya punch he knows as far as flavor goes and that consistency is honestly my favorite I like when I see large chunks and they're swimming in Terps so definitely that Jam was just it's something else that is beautiful I seriously could smell it earlier just sitting back here when it was sitting over there so I liked what you did with it for sure well what about terpenes in general their medicinal benefits I mean how do you think that plays a role into the medicinal benefits the high and whether you classify it as an indica sativa I think everybody you know takes terpenes in a little bit differently obviously some of the ones like limonene stuff like that are just known to generally give people a little bit more uplifting effects like that but as far as terpenes go it's really about finding a flavor that you enjoy in an effect that doesn't hinder your day really yeah if you smoked something that you really like but it's giving you anxiety obviously that might not be the strain for you you should find something you know with similar profiles that don't actually have that same terpene you know within the plant so if you like something fruity but you're getting horrible anxiety from lemon let's maybe try like a citrus yeah or another a strawberry banana or something like that where you know hey this tastes really good but it's not gonna cause me to freak out yeah strawberry banana is one of my favorites - it's super relaxing probably the heaviest indica of the fruity stuff that I've tried so I know a lot of people that love it definitely definitely so one thing I love about following you on instagram is that you're just always dropping knowledge helping push the community further for those of you who aren't following him on Instagram he's at a troz and Ryan check him out lots of great content out there so I feel like the first time I ever heard the term rosin jam it was from following you on Instagram can you comment did did you coin that phrase is there anything there it was kind of more of the people speaking we did a little survey and stuff we just wanted a different our selves a little bit um there was a huge craze going on at the time of people putting rosin in jars and this whole new tech that's going on and I really wanted to create a name that people think Jam they think olio but honestly it's kind of taken off we've noticed other people you know using the rosin Jam name and we really don't seem to mind we've had people in Spain posting rosin jam so I think there's a really awesome to see and it's just it's just our version of rosin sauce or you know just a just a new just a new consistency we're just trying to cone so definitely yeah consistency is everything when I'm looking for a product if typically I lean more towards the jams you know if I see something that's a little more buttery that's just not usually my flavor lots of people like the butter does it is all of reference a lot of people love the butter just for ease of dabbing people like to just dig in some people grab it with their hands and just drop a bomb right in there and just its ease of dabbing it's a preference some people don't want the rosin heat it up some people want it straight off the press and put in the fridge so we like to offer a product for everybody yeah if you want your Ross and put in the fridge we have classic coins um if you want butter we have butter if you want your stuff lightly heated we have a batter and if you want a true separation and you want your rasam to look like BHO a live resin consistency and you don't want to leave it in the fridge then the jam is for you no down so I've got a bunch of homies they nerd out on temperatures as far as pressing goes dabbing goes do you have like a perfect temperature range usually fall in when it comes to pressing and dabbing yes I do if you know if something is pretty melty I use usually stick around 180 degrees that's a nice low temp of times and stuff really vary between how much you put in the bag and what you're squishing and all that but I like 180 degrees it just really is like a nice golden you know point for me for sure yeah so what about the your actual rig or the nail have you ever played around with temperatures I have and stuff it's been a while I'm usually just a time kind of guy kind of figure out what my new nail you know Davin is I'll heat it up and kind of do a test or at 45 seconds you know on minute 30 kind of see what my nails I like a low time dab it uh I'm gonna be dabbing I like a little bit extra on the bottom I'll leave a little puddle sometimes I don't mind you're sure we'll be sure to keep it on the blue setting oh yeah yeah so when you typically take a dab how long does it take for you to feel the effects usually I'm and this is just me I usually feel the effects pretty instantly honestly me too I uh I'll take a dab of this stuff and be ready to go yeah you know it's it's pretty instant behind the eyes yeah yep do you get that with other extracts or do you think rosin high gloss hooker I think rosin in general and solvent listen general I feel throughout my body a little bit more I noticed when I dabbed BHO it's it's more of a head high uhm BHO always you know it feels a little more floaty to me uh rosin solvent list is always a little bit more body I feel a little bit more relaxation from it instantly definite so tell me a little bit about the the bubble hash side of things how are you guys washing what's the trick to getting this so it all starts in the grow so most of our stuff is it's very well taken care of throughout all of its life the veg has to be very clean the early flowering stages at the environment is a huge factor so that's all before the wash is really the plant when we take when we're harvesting no no trimmers even touch the nose they're all hold it you know by the stem cut off the nose and take little golf ball sized pieces really trying to not disrupt any trike formation that we've you know work so hard to grow so washing we use our all RO water it's all hand washed pretty much as gentle as you can wash bud they do it multiple times will wash four or five times just to ensure that all the heads are taken off it's done in a cold room it's all ROI sorrow water it's as clean as can be in there so yeah that's how you make clean Rossum's clean hash and a clean girl so you mentioned washing by hand why do you prefer that over say and automate it where I can just hit the button and it's just uh really control over you know your whole process you can stir as gently as you want you can have a machine that stirs pretty gently but just having that control that hand on it and really seeing how much you're taking off each plant and stuff like that it's that extra care that really goes into it that really just makes it that much better for sure well let's let's get to it yes you want to about here guess we'll switch on over to the blue temp there it's the lowest temperature we've got I've got a little new little guide tool too they do come in handy [Music] man that's just what I was looking for you can definitely get that sweep of pile on the front and then on the backend you've got that like earthy grape soda candy like it was it's definitely what I'm looking for I'm glad you enjoyed it man yeah I always um I always enjoy papaya but that uh that little extra little grape really adds something to it it's got like a little almost a spiciness almost to it it's just really good for sure so what are you feeling like effects wise right now what do you think I I love the relaxed feeling I get from this the clear-headedness good vibe to some music right now to there so I just love the effects just great for chilling yeah you know I've got a real calm my body's real relaxed but in my brain I've got that little tingle to it but it's still real clear yep perfect biking it's quick behind the eyes and stuff quick acting I still feel like I could you know get up and go do some stuff right now so it's perfect and it is some strong stuff dum papaya punch generally tests around 80% for us so I mean that's a pretty high THC content so sure yep the rest of it's pretty much chirps we've been getting regularly 20% turps with the jam it's probably a 5 to 8 percent increase over just having it out you know just fresh press so wow it's quite a significant difference yeah so if somebody was looking to get some of this sweet papaya grape soda candy where could they find that so yeah you can find our product pretty much all over Colorado it's in recreational and medical shops dispensaries we have a flagship dispo it's higher grade they offer recreational and medical at two different locations you're probably gonna have our your best bet you know finding some jam there but we also you know post drops all over our Instagram page at dabble leo 7:10 you can give us a follow I also have my personal page at Ross and Ryan so I usually post the flavors as soon as I make them people get a little anxious and always ask me where it's at it's gonna be about a week or two before testing and all the packaging gets ready usually about a week and usually the olio page is where you can find all the information the drops what you know pretty much where everything's going that you're looking for thanks for stopping by man really enjoy the papaya punch number four it's definitely gonna be one of my goat cheese for this summer for anybody out there is not following them on Instagram be sure to check out at Roz and Ryan always dropping knowledge about solving this extraction trying to push the industry forward and dab olio 710 that's where we got the papaya punch number four from highly recommend it I really appreciate you guys having me I always love talking hash and thanks again so much come down so after sitting on the high for a while you know I really found it interesting that I was getting a lot of sativa dominant effects or what you would think would be sativa dominant effects because they're both in economists trains that we're working with here you know we've got the papaya on one side we've got the purple punch on the other like I said both indica dominant so you would expect a sedative effect but what I found was something really uplifting and that's why I think it's the perfect Brosnan for summertime vacation because it was relaxing mentally but still energetic got a little euphoria from that so an all-around great summertime high and perfect for like I said any vacation any trip to the beach or the lake definitely be my go-to and thanks for tuning in guys be sure to like and subscribe below follow us on our IG Facebook at go peer

live rosin on today's episode of solvent les review and I've got Josh the owner of coach masters here to talk all about it and how you can even win your own Awards and what judges look for alright let's check it out today we're really excited to bring you an award-winning live rosin from cush masters in Boulder Colorado this punch-drunk is a nice combination of Bermuda punch and Mac otherwise known as miracle alien cookies - phenomenal strains that they blended together in the lab to make an entirely better creation it took home first place at the Brewster's 7/10 showdown this year and when you open the jar you can immediately tell why it caught the judges attention fruit all kinds of terpenes that are really evocative of a fruit market in South America come at you it's almost hard to tell which ones you're smelling because it's a mixture of pineapple paya maybe even watermelon looking at the consistency it's this gorgeous shiny butter mixed with sugar and you can tell that the terpenes have even started to separate ever so slightly at room temperature this strain isn't the highest in potency testing at around 74 percent THC but that's okay because it more than makes up for it and the smell and the aromas and the flavors that come along with it which we would argue are more important in most cases anyway hey everyone welcome back to solvent let's review this is Eric today we've got a really special episode got Josh from cush masters and some award-winning live rosin just to come first place at the rooster show down in the category so super excited Josh thanks for coming on the show yeah thanks for having me it's a awesome here yeah I tell me a little bit about cush masters so cush masters was a bridge anole founded in 2015 we did contract processing for you know quite a few different people in the industry and all within Colorado and then we expanded our brand outreach around 2017 and you know we're focused on connoisseur extracts and making sure that people are outputting the best quality inputs and outputs for you know come overall concentrates because it's a huge new part of and wave of the industry so we wanted to make sure that people were properly educated as they Deb as they consume as well as make sure it's some good stuff nice so you guys have been at this a little while how long have you guys been making browsing for we've been making rosin since about 2015 yeah so just so everyone knows Josh is also one of the co-owners here at pure pressure and one of the people responsible for really seeing big-time value in solvent lists a long time ago when people were making it with hair straighteners and really josh was the one that came up with the idea of how do I come up with a better press so that I can make this more viable so yeah I mean coach masters was born and you know we found and definitely a necessary need in the market for a high quality you know versatile rosin press you know what we were using just wasn't cutting it and we wanted to make sure that we could put out the best concentrates you know the same way that you know starting material creates quality extracts you know it also comes down to the machinery and the repeatability of that machinery and so you know went out and you know built the press and you know peer pressure is what it is today which is a huge blessing and it's great you know it's amazing to see everybody utilizing that technology and you know it's only getting better yeah so tell everyone a little bit about what goes into making award-winning rosin so the strain we've got today is punch-drunk which is a cross between Mac and Bermuda punch and what is Mac stand for Mac is just a strain that was bred and is it miracle alien cookies is that what we're calling cookies yeah well yeah so tell everyone a little bit more about the strain and kind of what went into this yeah so I mean both strains you know we're grown separately as their own strain and what we ended up doing they each have their own unique profile so you know each their own terpene profile their own you know necessarily bud structure features that type of stuff and trichome head structures which all take into account when you're utilizing and going in for water extraction okay because that was the first process of getting this final product right here mmm that we're about to consume here shortly so that was obviously ice water hash washed pressed when you guys were doing this is this a cross between one strain that's the punch-drunk or is it two strains have been blended together purposefully it was two strains that were blended together you know purposefully okay I'm within the Brent within the lab itself okay so they were grown separately uh-huh and then we decided the two profiles uh would create an amazing you know over what we hoped would be an amazing you know extract you know sometimes they're hit and miss you know sometimes it's harder to sell concentrate when it's a blend like that so you really have to be careful on how you mix these terpene profiles and you know don't make a flavor or something like that that somebody won't enjoy sure okay so there's there's there's some risk involved that's when you're taking a blended we're these strains wash together yes okay so you put it all together washed it and then pressed it because I've definitely heard of some companies and places where they'll wash one or the other and then they'll actually mix the heads after they've been dried but you is there a reason that you prefer that method because it's all you know one cohesive product within the bubble hash itself okay you know when you end up working with bubble hash and depending if you're in a cold room or not you know you end up getting you know those greasy patties bubble hashed a little bit harder to work with so when you have those two flavor profiles within that bud form and it's also where you're gonna have your highest terpene within those genetics itself so you know that's gonna come out in your flavors and stuff you know some are gonna be more dominant than others which is also why you got to be very careful on which ones you mix together got it so for example probably some of the gas your OGS are gonna really overpower certain blends for example exactly okay you know like even on the fruity side as well you know you're gonna end up with certain like tangerines and stuff like that to just overpower everything within extracts so your clementines and your tangerine they're gonna take over that you're making absolutely so another question I know that probably a lot of people watching are really interested in hearing about is when you're picking strains to wash well ones that are really gonna dump and be worth the time and energy to do it can you tell ahead of time like how do you know what's gonna work do you test it like what's your process there yeah I mean that's one of the you know common ash questions I think within the industry and it's you know a very challenging part of deciding on what material to choose from mm-hmm is working with the right growers I'm working with people who are open to feedback and not stuck in their ways I'll start in the garden right yes yeah definitely start in the garden you have to have a good product to work with okay and so really developing those relationships and making sure not only are they handling the products properly while they're growing it so they're not damaging the heads but also well they're packaging it up for delivery to you you know take for an example you know you just cropped all your buds and you're going into freeze them well you have a bunch of bagged stacked on top of each other that aren't necessarily frozen yet so you're gonna wait think about what that's doing to a trichome head you know it's just extremely delicate very delicate right you touch a trichome head usually you know it will explode all right yeah cool so super super interesting stuff when it comes down to actually making something that wins an award like this I mean what goes into that what are the judges looking for and in your experience having entered a couple cups and competitions and having won awards across a couple categories yeah what advice can you give for other people out there who are trying to win their own hardware here yeah I mean I think knowing your competition is really important looking at past competition sure results are also very important looking at those profiles of those strains that have won past Awards within those categories within that award so knowing what the judge is won mm-hmm and you know some competitions allow you to enter more than one per category yeah and so what that allows you to do you know normally if we enter a you know let's just say the 7 10 showdown for example which is the one that we won right here um we were allowed to enter up to 3 into whatever category we wanted we entered one into you know some of the stuff and then we entered 2 into some of the categories as well okay what are some other categories you guys are working with um just tool it around which we took first home first place home as well nice you know we did pens ok those live rosin fans of those live resin pen who live resin panel yeah and then some disposable live resin pens you know just both types of hardware okay and then we also entered wax shatter and crystalline which is diamonds so it sounds like it's probably not a bad idea to enter as many categories as your lab is able to if possible absolutely I mean your material and your products also got to be there um you know you don't want to enter something you don't think you have a valid chance of winning you know because they are very costly as well to you know be entering multiple things into multiple categories which is why we normally stay to one entry but if it's a category that you never know what the judges could be looking for or it's a newer category let's say for example rosin you know you can go with like you know like you're saying earlier the more oh gee you know dominant you know and that judge panel might be you know more of a G type of flavor profiles or the more that fruity type of profile so it gives you kind of wide range to fall within the category of the judges as well gotcha so you guys entered more than one into the Robin category is that we're saying yes we entered two into the rosin category for this strain specifically since this is what we're reviewing today the punch-drunk but if you could guess what why do you think that this one one what about this strain you know before we sample it here in a second like what's special about punch-drunk you know ever since it came out of the machine I mean even all you just knew it it was a beautiful color the clarity the smell in aroma that we are achieving off of that rosin even as its sat in the jars changing consistencies we you know just everybody in the lab kind of gradually went to it it was kind of like a natural thing and like you know we have our solvent list room which is you know separated but you know obviously with high terpenes and rosin extraction and stuff like that you can you know smell them through the doors sometimes yeah and so people are coming in and solving this room the day that we were doing this extraction and you know obviously things like that get picked up by the techniques or the texts that are working that day right when we were talking about entering this competition it was a no-brainer for us this is the one that we thought would do it but we also entered more of an OG dominant profile as well so this one's definitely on the fruitier side yeah given given the name and cross that you're describing together okay cool so let's take a look at this obviously in the video you guys are already gonna check out some sweet macros also really like this package design school got some gold foil on it yeah that's nice thank you can I can tell why people are picking that up on the shelf yeah so here's our little glass jar I'm gonna take a little sniff here so yeah it's really strong yeah like surprisingly strong when you open it I've been to you know labs all over the place done a lot of this and and this one it's just I mean it'll stink up this entire room yeah absolutely no question you're like I'm really trying to dial in it's got you know definitely the tropical fruit I mean some people if I was gonna guess it be some kind of like banana II papaya sort of smell it's hard to nestle made this one so unique you know like knowing kids put their direct finger on it it hits so many different peoples you know wants in a concentrate which was really exciting to see and it was just off to smell alone which can also give you indications yeah of what ward winning concentrates and stuff that you know could be good as other products as well so extremely stable consistency this has been sitting out today for a little while at room temperature most of the time a lot of these strains are gonna be kept in a freezer or fridge during the day and then this however you can just tell that this is really buttery its sugared up just a tiny tiny bit it's almost glistening here in the jar I mean it kind of feels like somebody brought some giant fruit bowl into the room here that we're just smelling on set natural terpenes sweat even at room temperature you know that those terpenes start to rise and separate from the actual rosin itself you know and like I was saying earlier you know the jar itself was you know so potent within the lab that every chunk up the whole place it just stinks up the entire room I mean I can't even imagine we got a graham right here you know we're talking how much were you guys pressing at a time I mean we were pressing around 80 to 120 grams at a time so before we try it because I'm really fixing to I mean I don't know how much longer I can talk about this before we give this a shot but consistency is one of the biggest things when it comes to winning awards is what you've said in the past and what we've heard from some of our other brand allies and some of our other customers can you speak to the consistency aspect especially of rosin specifically and how that matters yeah so consistency in your final product is probably one of the most important things you know especially being a lab or somebody who isn't selling it directly to that customer being on the wholesale side of that equation you know what that does is it allows you to you know no matter who's grabbing that gram within the dispensary um you know it's that gonna end up staying that consistency so making sure that you know you manipulate your material in a way before it hits the shelves so that it stays that consistency whether you're going for shatter or wax or butter or sugar or you know micro diamonds you know some Jam tech like all of those different things and consistencies those are all done within the lab so making sure that as you give it to your packagers that you have a consistent product that you're selling as a consistent product it's nice and stable yeah it's ready to go it's not changing on it so that the judges and someone who is you know buying this off the shelf is you know they're they're getting what they're seeing on the Instagram absolutely you know and that's probably one of the most important things you know for me is being able to provide the industry a consistent product awesome so cush masters is located in Boulder Colorado proud to have them here in the state so we smoke out of a couple different things on one of our previous episodes with Roz and Ryan sometimes we've got a nail we've had episodes where we're putting honey on toast today we've got a puff coke what's setting are we gonna what what do you recommend I call it low for me anything that you're smoking I like to go at a lower temperature so half frozen in general nice low temp always yeah cuz you're gonna be able to get those terpene profiles better and you know if you burn terpenes too and you have too high of a terpene rich product you can actually you know full heart right harsh yeah so you know I really like to enjoy these high quality yeah it's almost like a fine wine right we're not having our dabs medium well today okay we're we're gonna do this proper so all right let's give it a shot you want to load me up absolutely cool [Music] that's strong what are the what are the potency results on this one um so this one we got the box right here so yeah take a peek Matt just like as I'm sitting here it that that fruit that I was smelling in the jar just kind of working its way back might not like toward the back of my tongue you know sometimes certain concentrates they have like a little bit of an after flavor but man with these premium hash robins but I mean super clean and you can tell you know no throat irritation whatsoever there I mean granted I'm not someone who's taken the world's biggest abs but that's one of the biggest things for me is just it's clean I'm not coughing my brains out right now you know I can actually sit here and really let this soak in and I can enjoy it and it's just like I mean that is just really tasty stuff I mean it feels like I'm down in Central America at a fruit stand trying to pick out what pineapple or banana or you know pie I'd like to have and that's the stuff you have to hit and those profiles that you really need to you know what it's like what sounds good to you you know and it's almost like that uh technicians you know responsibilities as materials coming in to identify identify and try and work through those rows in order to achieve those high yields those flavor profile combinations all of those things to create phenomenal concentrates yeah because sometimes you know and why sometimes we do do mixes is because for run size totals for lab optimization you know sometimes you know one girl only grew you know let's say 4,000 grams of this strain and so you know we have a eight thousand twelve thousand gram capacity per run frame we go bring them together if they fit together and they mesh to go there you know why not and you know stay at full optimization yeah so I mean the the sum of parts greater than the individuals here big-time especially for this one good stuff yeah I mean the profile there is just comes together so smooth and so elegantly and like the actual almost like fruit like flavor that it gives it's like you know almost like smoothie yeah so now that we've been sitting here for a minute and I'm starting to like really feel it this is a review after all this one's really nice I'm finding that it's really relaxing it's got a pretty calming quality you know it's gonna be a it's almost like a little bit of a head huh definitely definitely a little behind the eyes in this particular one I don't get that with a lot of strains yeah but it's not overwhelming you know I wear some head high as can be you know and like it's kind of just like step back in the couch you know beat still you know not I'm here I feel lucid exactly but I'm also a lot more relaxed and I was a couple minutes ago and you know that's what we really try and hit within you know concentrates because it is such a representation of the plant and what its capabilities are yeah and you know people out there gonna experience it different ways but I can see why the judges were really pumped up about this one it is it is pretty clear once you get a chance to try it absolutely absolutely you can find us you know pretty much you can go to coach masters calm we have a map on there you know few of our local stores you know throughout the Denver metro area you know pig and whistle Northern Lights you know star bud so check the website the website you know pretty much a good majority of Colorado stores and make sure to follow these guys on Instagram they got great content its cush dot masters is that right yep awesome very final thing for we wrap up our show here for the day the award that you won that was with the rooster right yeah is the rooster they have two competitions that they do for twenty and seven time yep the two kind of holidays of our industry and 710 being oil spelled backwards and 420 I mean who knows the real jet that came up but you know it's it's cool to see them embrace the industry and actually the companies within that industry it's really awesome to be able to do recognized for your hard work I feel like that is just unanimous in other industries that's the land here it brings a lot of legitimacy to the table check out coach masters if you're in Colorado they you can get tickets to the rooster events when they come around so make sure to give them a shout out they're really fun last one we went to a temple nightclub down in Denver we all had a great time so thanks for coming on the show thank you all right thanks for tuning in guys that was some really great product so to get more solvent list reviews make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel right here below check out the rest of the episodes and all of our great solving this videos thanks for tuning in yeah [Music]", "N3vDm9HXWOU": "welcome back to turkey eyes in today's episode we're going to be pressing one ounce of fresh frozen full plan ice water hash we get big yields using the directional flow method as well as show you how I butter the rosin after being pressed [Music] let's go over the items we're going to be using during this week's episode we're going to need parchment paper any brand will do I always go with the unbleached version pressing bags I ordered these online in a custom size to fit my pressing plates perfectly allowing me to maximize the amount that can be pressed at a single time as for micron science I go with the 37 micron because I mainly deal with ice water hash or teeth if you're going to be pressing flour but with ninety micron and I always remember to double bag your product a couple Dobb tools and a set of tweezers lastly obviously the material I'll be pressing you already know from the title we're going to be doing a single press of one ounce the material I'll be pressing is fresh frozen ice water hash this was from one of my previous grows it's a blend of green crack barber bud and Harley Quinn bx4 this is also material that's been freeze-dried I'll be doing a video shortly covering how I made the ice water hash and using my freeze dryer so be sure to hit that subscribe button you can notified when that gets posted as you can see the material is getting pretty sticky once it comes out of the fridge making it very difficult to talk the pressing baked properly [Music] using one of my job tools I packed though ice-water house down into the bag as evenly as possible my hand I give it a good pre-press evening out the material as best as I can at this point the ice water hash has already become warm and it's very sticky not allowing it to be moved around much in the bag [Music] for today's press we're going to be utilizing the directional flow method a benefit of using it is that it allows you to watch the flow during the press you can see the flow from start to finish allowing you to adjust the variables accordingly this becomes very helpful at all stages as you're about to see I forgot to double bag my material which resulted in my bag being unfolded squishing out the ice water hash out the one end this became noticeable immediately allowing me to stop the press right away unfortunately I forgot to record me collecting the material and just putting a second bag over the other [Music] [Music] I stopped the first pressed short not noticing the flow of the rosin still happening [Music] I then folded the pressing bag in half and did a second press giving additional amount of yield [Music] letting the freshly pressed live hash rasa sit for a few minutes allow it to cool carving the rosin eyelet cooler temperature helps with a collection of it using a long-handled dab tool makes the collection of the rosin very easy since the second press was very short I'm going to collect all the rosin together after collecting it all into one patty I like to put it into a glass jar it's process butters the rosin to texture I find more appealing [Music] I simply put the glass shard in between the two plates with the lid tightly screwed on and let it sit for about one hour at 150 degrees Fahrenheit then I open the jar stir the rose and whip it around mix it up place it back in between the plates I had a hundred degrees Fahrenheit for ten hours after the ten hours I collect the rosin out of the jar and place it into a storage container if you enjoyed this video don't forget to hit that like button [Music]", "kfmzOQLahqg": "[Music] and watch it [Music] what's up DD see Scott it real and gum a friend Levi from low temp plates on the line what's up brother man I'm doing good but you know me man first off Levi always supports a DGC was that the 7-10 concentration celebration appreciate your brother yeah absolutely thanks so much for having us out we we really love being there yeah yeah okay so Levi is gonna be my source I've talked it to naazy I've talked to a few people and you're gonna be my source for a freeze dryer or at least you're gonna be my information source right now because I'm a little bit confused what I'm thinking about is I got this greenhouse coming down count aloud 1015 pounds whatever the hell we get from it different strains and I want to make some something good out of them something a little bit better than just shatter I was thinking about the laws man I can't have 15 pounds right but I can take 15 pounds and wash it down to I don't know a few ounces or a half a pound or something like that that would be legally okay no yeah yeah correct yeah I mean as long as you're lifting your your your legal jurisdictions whatever local jurisdictions that you have yeah that can definitely help cut down your total weight now if I'm thinking about it because I am a little bit of a public figure if the cops were watching me and listening to what I said if I was blasting this all with butane is that technically illegal or am I able to do that yeah yeah by far technically illegal yeah okay okay so that's where the rosin press comes in so if I wanted to play by the rules I could press you press this match pressing twelve or fifteen pounds of flour seems a little ridiculous and I'm kind of setting you up for the softball because we don't press flour correct well so you can for a simplicity sake right it's you know for commercial operations is a very easy skewer to throw on on the shelves for home users who just shop at dispensaries it's really nice just because you can go grab some flour I'm from a hair straightener stepping on a hair straightener all the way up mm presses so oh yeah you can but it is quite a bit of work if you're talking 15 pounds or whatever it is then yes yeah yeah you would much prefer pressing the hash equivalent of that it's not alive too big big key to sink your pressing flour you're pressing dried cured flour not like fresh frozen flour so that's what I wanted to get into so the difference remaking shatter and making live or live rosin is that everything has to stay cold right everything has to be frozen so we're gonna harvest it wet we're gonna instantly freeze it and then we're going to wash it in and then once we freeze it we can take our time take out some you know half pound at a time wash it in bubble bags or a bubble machine and that's where I'm a little bit confused so I've got my sifted water hash that comes out of the bubble machine how do I keep that life yeah so the best thing that you can do is as soon as you've washed it is to you've got two options the old-school way would be to freeze it and then microplane it and what you're trying to achieve there is a long-term slow dry so that can range from four to about seven days within a humidity and temperature control room okay so you've got a microplane what you explained micro planning yeah so micro micro planning it would just be freezing the bubble hash that you take out of your bags right and then at when it's frozen you're taking essentially like a grater a sifter and you're sifting it up on to a lot of people use cardboard but what you're doing is that you're trying to break it up into small pieces so it can air dry over a slow period of time on within this time you know you do experience a little bit of oxidization right they start to see things get a little bit darker versus using a free char and that gets me into the second option which would be just slapping it in a freeze dryer and that process pretty much she you pull a deep freeze on the product ranging from you can adjust your times anywhere from about seven to ten hours and that matters seven to ten hours I mean I can't freeze it for a month so you you can't actually freeze it for however long you really wish okay but the the freezer ours they are a little and they're a little bit on the pricier side yeah so it's not something that I would want to run over a long term unless you have to you know so a more conventional freezer would be a little bit more suited if you want to freeze for freeze that hash specifically for you know 24 hours or a week or whatever it is before you can actually do your full freeze drying process all right then yeah that makes sense all right so we got to the where I've got the bubble and I'm putting it in the freeze dryer now so now I just I leave it for what a day a week yeah so you've got essentially two times that on the freeze dryer that are important to you there's there's a free cycle and a dry cycle so the first part of the freeze dryer is to deep freeze the entire product right so seven hours for most product is is plenty depending on what you want to do guy so let's say seven hours there and then there is a dry cycle at the end which there is a vacuum pump and it pulls vacuum on the chamber and then there are trays within the freeze dryer that warm up slightly to allow for the tip furnace for the moisture to evaporate out of the product out of your wet hash and then it pulls a vacuum and it cycles through that so and we're not talking about we're not talking about evaporation here this is sublimation we're going directly from liquid solid to a gas and going away and what evaporation is solid to the liquid gonna do it yes mmm-hmm interesting and it'll take chemistry yeah then so you're just opening up that drain valve and whatever moisture you collected that has been sucked into the they'll just drains out so that is the water from your from your hash all right so then the last step after and how long how long does it take to do that how long do I collect into the drive yeah the dry cycle is usually around 10 to 12 hours okay longer if you've got a large freeze dryer and you're burning it up with a ton of hash if you've got full trains yeah you can easily turn that into 24 hours or so okay okay so then I want to get to the last step because you've given me the whole process I really appreciate you taking the time to do this but the last step is we gotta press it in a rosin press and this is to make you know super high-quality live or awesome am I wrong is that the last step and we just immediately take it out of the freeze dryer and do that or how's that work correct so you know depending on what kind of micron bags you're using ranging from 70 to 90 maybe up to a hundred micron okay first it could actually be full milk so if that's what you prefer you can pull those those microns out for full no and those will typically it's only your first wash that they'll be that they'll be full milk but everything else it can be squished into inter hash frozen just like you mentioned and how many washes do you do out of a bubble teas and bubble bags and the bubble later mmm machine yeah it depends on how much agitation you're getting with with washing machines are getting quite a bit more agitation right 10 or 15 minutes and you can run up to about five washes if you want but at the end at those fourth and fifth maybe even six washes if you're just trying to get everything out they're gonna be the lower quality more contaminated product and you're gonna receive less yield per wash what I'm what type of yield like on a total throughout the six washes you do on like a half pound what type of yields would be looking at so pretty much what most people like to refer to is just to rosin percentage yield so let's say and this is all fresh frozen so good yields would be considered like three to five percent range to rosin off with fresh frozen weight so you just have to run the numbers off that so if it's no 1/2 sorry what was the numbers again just let's do two pounds max is that's 900 grams what can what do we get off that yeah so you do have to remember that's not that's fresh frozen right that's only obvious that's what all the water weight still in the cannabis cheese that's not it dried at all yet so we're gonna have to give all that away and because we'd be correct so yeah if you have two pounds of fresh frozen that would be 900 grams right and let's say you got back a really good yield it's the genetics are good certain really grown you did a good extraction on it let's say to rosin you get three percent yield on that okay so that would be 90 grams yeah it would actually be 27 see why I don't do math with mana right that's why you hold on to the money all right sure all right so 27 grams out of out of okay that's not a 2 pounds of fresh frozen I mean but 2 pounds of fresh frozen Jesus that's gotta be like a half pound to a third of a pound of dried flower yeah yeah approximately they say if I'm not mistaken it's somewhere around you lose about 80% of the weight if I didn't say it I was gonna yes somewhere around eighty percent of the total way around all right all right so I'm thinking this alright so here the reason we were bullshitting is because I'm like alright so if I do this what's my investment you know what's the ROI I just went and bought a gram at the dispensary for $55 for a gram of live resin or like yeah is even live resin not life awesome I do find the rosin have a little bit more flavor I dig them a little bit more I like the consistency too it's easier to dab but um so I'm just thinking if I'm buying $50.00 grams a gram really doesn't last all that long might be cool to have a year's worth of worth of a live rosin hey you got a separate fridge I did some quick math of that 80% water weight chair go away when you dry it right if you if you dried it to that dry weight that's 15 percent of the driveway well which is 15 percent return to live hash rosin that doesn't make sense 15 percent active ingredient on some really Bank bud and and the 85 percent is no material plant material yeah definitely makes sense yeah and I mean you'd be lucky to on a large scale to get that kind of return off of dry pressing flowers and it's not going to be nearly the same quality bubble hash rosin as a rule of thumb is significantly better and quality than flower roses agree with you more Sarah tried both and there's a huge difference yeah yeah exactly all right so come on help me out what's my investment here so I need a freeze dryer first off bubble bags and the bubble later you guys sell them so we actually just started carrying bulk bags okay yeah so we really like those just for the the Frenchy full mil full mesh bags okay I really like those and they've got washing machines as well yeah so what do I got a couple hundred maybe three hundred bucks and a washing machine or some bubble bags yeah yeah you could always depending on the size so you can get down to five gallon right right to about 42 gallon bags [ __ ] as bit larger it's more material so it gets quite a bit more expensive but all in all on bags you don't even need a machine if you don't want to right let me just go with a bucket I with a spoon man my buddy used to make the a locking gank with a wooden spoon brother yeah yeah so you can you can really kick it very primitively and it doesn't take a lot of money to get started it just as you start to scale and trying to do larger and larger amounts to become more efficient that's when it starts costing a little bit extra money sure so we got so we could just end it right there if you want to buy a bubble later bubble machine and some bags or even just some bags and use a five-gallon bucket and some ice you can make really good water hash that way I will tell you the more you beat it the lesser quality is so if you're really gentle with it you can make some dank dabba bull I don't know if it's full milk but it's close whatever is not full melt you can just throw in a hair straightener thrown or press right over you impress that so you could press press that now what if we just want to go there and say hey I'm going to invest a little bit of money for quality and buy a good rosin press help me out I see him for 400 bucks tell me what the difference is between that I don't you see you don't sell no $400 presses do um so so actually how we started our business was that that smaller range I go for three to five hundred dollars just with the cage kids the plate kids at the time everybody was stepping on hair straighteners and everybody was trying to figure out how to scale so they were using the t-shirt presses in there right and then you know just growing up in Kansas and and seeing a lot of these shop presses around I figured why not adapt one of these to a rosin press so that's essentially how we started and the more recently Lucius made the more commercial setups and and higher processing and higher quality systems which are which are the V twos as of currently and so yeah you've got pressure gauges external palms you can operate them through electric means air hand you know they're open source so you choose exactly how you want to apply your force nice yep all right so so if we got a rising press what's it gonna cost us man for a good one yeah for for kind of a beginners home user setup that you wanna you know something that's portable all american-made lifetime warranty I mean the thing is bulletproof it's you know it's gonna last you a lifetime sure how many times is that so up to 20 tons which is 40,000 pounds of force so more force than you ever need but it's nice to have in your back pocket if you ever you know stacking multiple chips and doing a final extraction right what do we press that what's what's the force we press it yeah for the the force for flowers you're looking anywhere from about 1,500 to 2,500 plate and PS I got and platon psi is something that that it takes a small equation to get there but the formulas on our website if you just want to check that out but yeah that's how it breaks down and then for hash awesome you're looking anywhere from 800 to up to 2500 plate psi again got it so it's overkill what you what you're giving them yeah for sure alright and so what's that running come on what's that run my friend prices yeah brother come on DBC price yeah so if you're just if you want to start off with our intro systems those start at 397 that just sticks on any press in your choice this is a really good home user setup but for the more you say press you can go to harbor you're saying like a harbor freight pump or whatever I don't understand what do you mean yes yes that's the actual Harbor Freight brain okay guys so the downside of those is that they're a little bit larger so you may want to set it up and in the garage if you set it up in your living room if you have a girlfriend or wife they're not gonna like it good all right next the exercise bike man you'll be fine I'm sad that's all right so all right so right wow so this is pretty cool so I got a few hundred bucks in the bowl bags for 400 bucks I can get a press so so you telling me a home press yep yep and then if you want to go with something that's a lot more portable you're about ten inches tall you can just throw a bottle jack in those and they're really portable so if you're if you're hopping around from buddies houses to sessions or whatever on it you know you can tote that around with you those start around $1,000 that's shipping and taxes include all right so I'm thinking abut for under a G if I wanted to be a starter for under a G I could start making my own rosin correct yeah yeah you can even make bubble hash rosin for the air thousand bucks yeah and then so here's the big jump man you know me man I always want to go high-end I said I don't always want to go high-end but in my cannabis I do so if I want to go live with then I've got to go with a freeze dryer right mm-hmm yeah yeah so the main advantages of the freeze dryer is to quickly dry your material right so it doesn't leave loose terpenes is that when you lose the terpenes absolutely so if you're just air drying within a room you're also beating the heads up whenever you're doing that aggressive sifting you know that the micro cleaning that I mentioned earlier right so yeah it's a it's just a much better process you're keeping it cold so hence the live rosin aspect your because all you're doing is freezing it and then and then just getting that moisture out pulling a vacuum so while it's cold never really exposed to heat and it's much quicker as well yeah all right but that's a big [ __ ] step up man we're talking another couple grand if I want to get in get into the live business right yeah I'm minimum minimum so the only company that that makes free strives for our industry is gonna be harvest right and they make products ranging from 2,000 up to about 8,000 to like that still is very very very cheap compared to all other freeze drivers on the market because they're like full-on lab great equipment is that what the deal is medical grade stuff it's yeah it's pharmaceutical grade stuffs at it you know most of those machines will start around $30,000 so harvest rights really fulfilled a nice niche in the market for people like us oh very cool very cool although starting a - jeez man damn yeah I get that I get that yeah by the way so what you we were talking about if you don't if you're just drying bubble hash or freeze drying bubble hash guru doesn't let me say drying he gets my own estate but if you just freeze trying to bubble hash you don't need a huge freeze dryer right Yeah right right and so pretty much you've got you've got three different sizes you've got the small the medium and a large been on for most people for most small grows you get away with a smaller a medium I how small is it small so the small is the actual sizes on this guy so it's around a hundred and ten pounds and you can fit approximately two to three wet pounds of bubble hash inside of it no sweat that's a [ __ ] shitload man yeah yeah I mean that dries down to two to a portion of that sure but still yeah I mean that'll fit quite a bit you know that's full trays right yeah you can never make it work all right that soon what seems legit man it seems like okay I'm gonna figure for a solution for a home solution two grand three grants I've got about 3,500 bucks if I want to be in the live business no correct yeah I mean of course you can always hair dry right but yeah you're going to lose the live aspect of the of the rosin but don't make me get my calculator out but if fifty dollars a gram a bit guru could do this one is hit but at fifty dollars a gram how long has it taken it what do you got sixty sixty grams in order to recover that ROI if you're paying fifty dollars a gram at a dispensary you make 60 grams of live live rosin a it's great it be I've got five or six different strains in there and and B I cover my three grant you know I guess a three grand investment you could cover with three grand you don't have to spend in the dispensary anymore what sort of bet you I would spend it you know a couple hundred bucks go to that dispenser every couple weeks man yeah yeah yeah and it makes sense for for home growers for quite a few home growers if you are a heavy smoker or if you're supplying your friends and family that kind of definitely helps yeah definitely if you steal your buddies live rosin and tell them that you'll pay him back yeah yeah I guess still gurus live rosin for the air you know it becomes a prop at that point I love it I love it it cool man all right so I figured some [ __ ] out I appreciate it yeah I just wanted to share with the DG see you and I were texting back and forth yesterday and I was like man let's just do this for the DGC there's some really good information there you pumped it out by the way I really appreciate it Levi right on yeah absolutely and and you know as always we're just trying to put out a lot of information just to help everybody out because I understand it is really overwhelming at first trying to get into solve those expressions so you know we're putting out educational videos on on YouTube and are on our website so you guys are always welcome to try those out they're all free right and your so shout outs oh man where's everybody find it with your YouTube but your website come on yeah so our Instagram is just low temp period plates if you just youtube us it's it's low temp industries or low template so you can find a set either and the websites just low temp - plates com nice nice I appreciate you taking the time brother yeah absolutely thanks so much for having me I really like go chat with you guys all right you're right down in Denver you might see me soon he goes out just lonely at a freeze dryer in the lobby and and you might see me soon brother yeah yeah hope to see you sure well man take it easy brother yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] we're the pill to do [Music] true medicine [Music] Oh he hates the day [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "JEc8S-NYomU": "[Music] all right all right guys we're the first to do this 2 000 milligrams so on the nuxmaster mini there's really the unit was designed to do two different size smashes um it's really designed for travel personal use trade shows um to go and set up heat up quick and uh then extract either a gram nug or three quarters to a gram nug in a piece of parchment paper with no [Music] bag that's one of the presses that it's made to do which we have here in the back some dosey dough and then in the front we have some chronic kush it's also made to do a three and a half gram smash in a three and a half gram bag like this bottle loaded bottle textile um we advocate that extraction method so all of our surface area to pressure calculations on all of our units have been done assuming that you load the bags bottle textile like i said the mini was made for two two different smashes a single nug smash and a piece of parchment with no bag or a three and a half gram bag smash loaded bottle textile now both of these different uh ways of extraction the different weight of extraction are going to require the same pressure because at the end you're going to get the overall same surface area on the extracted material so if you're up to a one gram nug with no bag it's probably gonna be a little bigger so it'll be a little less pressure that you're applying you know um if you go closer towards three quarter of a gram nug with no bag uh it's going to be uh more pressure on that surface area because it's going to be smaller so you'll learn that as you get a unit and you start to extract you'll see the different different results in and out from the different product and whatnot especially if you're on the growing side so we're waiting for this oil to melt over here we thought it'd be a great time to read off some of your youtube comments on the latest videos believe it or not we actually read all of your comments so let's try to keep it positive um latest video was the bubble hash let's see what you guys are saying so connor 4k hey what do you guys do with the already pressed flower as you can see this is exactly what we do we like to make potent thc oil with it and it actually comes out really clean and really high quality don't recommend smoking it i would personally do the oil 10 times out of 10 with the pucks let's see what else we've got here shady 580 cop watch nug smasher is by far the best on the market you'll get your money's worth and then some my small one is paid for itself many times over i really need to get a bigger and bigger one now production is up well shady 580 we got the nug smasher pro ready for you here just give us a call and we'll get this sent over whenever you're ready what else we got better than watching porn nick garden i'd agree with that porn for stoners i dig it complete wash 86 i could see there's a some similarities there so jared stallman how much material did you start with to get that much bubble hash at once was it nugs and trim or just nugs um for that i don't know the exact amount because our friends over at 11 11 cannabis company uh provided us with the bubble hash but it i do know that it was a fresh flower trimmed right off the plant it was still live so if that answers your question let's see what else danny thompson it's like watching da vinci paint i'm seriously considering picking up a nug smasher at harvest time this year i used to be into the whole backyard blasting thing but figure now that i'm growing the garden of my dreams with all my favorite strains why half-ass it when it comes to concentrates that keef was beautiful i'll always have a soft spot for keith full melts i definitely agree with you blasting is cool but rosin is a lot cooler all right i think that's enough for now let me know you guys thought of that we can keep reading them off like i said we read all of your guys's comments so try to keep it positive if you can [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] hey guys make

these parchment pieces brick is presses a brick of hash perfectly take a spoon take our key oh my cause on us so very pretty stuff press it down press it into the corners to the edges gently this is a fluffy Keith takes up a lot more space than it usually does and every strain is different can you grab me a business card kind of just flatten it out on the top roll around the edges this is because you want to be able to tuck your parchment into these edges nice type of cover battle machine in search ii parchment drop the top of the brick very carefully say you know ship the parchment around we lost about a third of a gram right there but such as like things happen give it a good squeeze we're gonna wrap it a couple of sheets of paper towel and we were going through our vise Jimmy because it will not fit into our press unless we clamp it with everybody so I'll be back in just a minute one all right so we're starting with our brick this thick and we are going to squeeze it down until it is about half as thick squeeze it hand tighten the vise at room temp flip it over just so this is even as we can make it and then it's back to the heat press it's now that thick so we have our heat press heated up to 105 degrees ours only presses on the bottom so we have to keep it sealed to get heat to transfer to the top and because it only heats on the bottom we're gonna take the thick chunk of our plate and put that on the bottom that's where most of the heat needs to penetrate this top plate is much thinner and much easier for heat to just pass right through so it'll go on the top side which is warm but doesn't have the doesn't have the extra power that the bottom side has this will lose its heat very quickly we only have it up to 105 degrees because we don't want to squeeze our our hash out through the sides this will want to retain a nice brick form we wanted to only really hash over on the outer layers and have the inside remained remain as a pristine as possible so before I run and I want to show you what it looks like well I guess I can't this papers aren't your type it was very tan yeah it's a very blonde and yellow when we put it in open the press fixing it on the bottom Center it in the press lever shut I always forget yeah to make sure it's nothing it's not squeezing too far give about 15 seconds and then you're gonna pull it out and it should be a darker color with a really nice gummy consistency something kind of like oh I don't know yeah something like that now these little blocks often get stuck if they do you can use where's my little rubber string use one of these little things to get up in there kind of force the park I didn't take a lot did it down to parchment one does two fingers push it down a little bit the other side two fingers in the corner and fold it up okay very clean you get a look closely camera yeah not a lot of residue at all it's good brick has been sufficiently cooked trim up the edges a little should you do that with a knife but don't want to cut your little papers cuz these things take forever to make and there you go oh wow yeah break a hash and a consistency go a little lower with your hands there you go oh yeah what kind of smell would you just go coming off that very high and carry off lean carry a filing tomato tomahto very high in Mersin kinda like cheesy mm-hmm grandma's Bistro mouth mm-hmm yes that's how we make a hash brick awesome and then for chopping so plate clean this is for chopping we just have it Oh first we should weigh it we going wreck it this brick weighs 47 grams pretty much every brick weighs 47 I'm sure those chocolate we I set it long ways yeah something like that tell is epic and then yeah it's chopped but we want to do that here at here as well yeah thanks a lot elbow grease doesn't it oh yeah whole lot of love goes into this product if you are a consumer and we're unaware takes me a whole lot of blood sweat and tears to make your tasty hash there's no real blood here but yeah hopefully no sweat yeah making some nice tootsie rolls huh yeah this stuff stuff is quite gummy it's very easy sometimes it's kind of powdery doesn't want to cut up very easy every stream behaves differently and also ending on how old it is how cold it is ki prefers to be cooled and also just the different temperatures at which you press this break out if you use no heat it will not really form up into this gummy consistency a more powdery want to fall right apart to use too much heat it'll turn black nasty and might squeeze up out the sides of your press all sorts of problems this looks like chocolate doesn't so yeah break me off a piece of that fat hash bar seriously oh yeah a little farther down there yeah beautimous ha and yeah that's how we make it that's how we make it guys and won't you tell the folks who you are I'm Josh I'm the processor here tops off campus for a little while longer this is my keys my process hey guys I'm Mike thanks for watching if you like to see please like share and subscribe we love you Josh", "AORyULfIRe0": "yo yo yo what's good youtube welcome to another live stream i'm going to raise you up just a bit sweet so gopro updated and um my new wi-fi router is in we're showing signal strength here for the stream decent it didn't show that before so now that's pretty good to see anyways let me go ahead and share the link out to instagram and we're going to go ahead and get started uh all right cool well glad we got that up and running let me go ahead and uh get this stream up on my computer oh you're right let's see i'm sure you guys want to see some of this stuff that i have here before we even get started right let me show you what we got going on first of all we weighed everything out earlier we uh pulled it out of the freeze dryer fresh this morning fat fat nineteen point four percent yield killed it one thousand one hundred and thirty grams of nug went in 220 grams of full spectrum hash came out as well as 19 grams of 25 and 160 micron so this is our test press that we use for edibles and then we'll go ahead and press out the rest of these full spectrum pucks i loaded them by hand into the bags and then after putting them in the bags i pressed them down in a rosin evolution pre-press to make sure that they stayed nice and tight and they are evenly distributed went up from uh the small little four ounce jars and uh upgraded to the six ounce jars i got tired of filling those little small ones to the brim and i said it's time to upgrade baby so we got the jar all weighed out we'll be able to weigh this when we're done tonight and see what our final yield was on this run now i'm a big fan of doing my presses a little bit warmer than what most people would i'm using my stool for you guys today so i'm gonna do this but um yeah you guys that watch me often know i will press anywhere from 200 to 225 depending on the cultivar depending on the hash um not all hash comes out the same um for example we talked about trichome density before right we talked about just because it looks like a lot of hash it may not be a lot of hash because um the oil inside may not be full you know what i'm saying the trichome may just be partially full in that case it's fluffy hash where it looks like a lot but it doesn't weigh a lot that's why this 25 micron and this 160 micron it looks like a large puck but it only weighs 19 grams compared to this puck which is smaller in comparison by about a centimeter right and it's not as fat but it weighs more probably about five to six grams more and that's because this is the full spectrum 45 through the 159 which contains higher density trichomes that are full of milk oil compared to the 25 and 160. so just a little throw that in there for you interior genetics what's going on asteroid farms if you guys aren't following asteroid farms on instagram go follow so old homie of mine platinum grove colorado who used to have a really pimp-ass girl room the nasa lab right um one of the inspirations for me initially stepping up my garden well now it's his turn to come back and he just got a brand new house with a nice ass basement and guess what it's time for a brand new build out so we're gonna help each other out take some ideas off of each other and i'm basically gonna have him record the whole thing and um show you guys how he does his build out you know and he'll give you guys pointers along the way and uh you know show you how to build a grow room so by the time you know he's done with that uh build out i'll be done uploading my video on how when i built out my grow room and uh his will be pretty much part two of a series that i'm going to be doing where it's going to be either build-outs brand new or remodels or upgrades and you guys will be able to pay for each episode um individually and absorb all the information that went into that whole build or remodel so it was actually his idea and we're gonna do his build out as episode two so it's gonna be awesome it's gonna have amazing information in there and it's gonna be great for you guys because instead of just seeing my room all the time and you're like oh that's great but not everybody has your room like yours or not everybody has a layout like yours you'll get to see different layouts different places different um climates right you're gonna get to see it all and you're gonna get to see the different thought process that goes into building these so it's gonna be really cool but anyways go check out his instagram because he's already started posting updates on it and it's not often that you get to jump on board and watch it build out brand new from the start most of the time you hop in and it's like uh the person's halfway done they've already done a bunch of [ __ ] you kind of like feel like the new guy you know what i'm saying in a crowd of old guys that been around for a long time now's your chance to get in on the bottom floor be one of those old guys he's been there forever by the time he gets done finishing you could be like i was there when you were still drawing the blueprints yo whippersnapper some of this blue icy and then i'm going to glove up the press is set to 175. we're going to do a low temp press on our test bag it's not going to be a clear indication of how the full spectrum is going to respond but it's going to give me a good enough idea to know whether or not 175 is going to provide the flow i'm looking for or if i'm going to need to go up to my 204 temperature 202 maybe i will put a link up right now i'm not sure that you guys can do it that's what's up jinder mah what's up dude i haven't seen you in forever holy moly so yeah check out asteroid farms what's going on viper what's up slug upstate what's going on we're just giving everybody a minute to trickle on in taking dabs we're enjoying life i haven't even taken a dab with you guys yet have i ah let's take a dab i'm gonna go in on some of this blue icy first oh let's get in there who wants to get in those guts with me we've got 31 left on this battery oh let's get in there the gopro doesn't focus well close up so you guys are gonna take what you get and be happy all right first time catching a live stream viper you caught a very good live stream for your first live stream this whole live stream i've already prepped all my parchment i prepped all my bags normally i'm not this prepped normally i still have full parchment and [ __ ] i wiped down the plates i'm ready to go baby it's waiting on you guys i mean what do you think we're about to press a half pound of hash a half pound cheers at 413 on the email okay ah that blue icy i swear on the exhale it tastes just like a blue icy it is so crazy every time it never fails what's up easy labs green ranger nashville how you doing freshly pressed what's up annie oh gee what's up hidden creek we got the whole [ __ ] family here i think i'm gonna do a live stream prank and start a live stream pressing hash with the hair straightener so we can get a million people asking oh no what happened did the press break fantastic so huh all righty all righty all righty let's swap out the battery you already know we got it we gotta swap out the battery we don't want it to die it'll be another short live stream i had to find it i couldn't forget i couldn't remember where the [ __ ] i put it down now i can't remember which batteries are charged now let's see lucky number nothing they'd be lying sometimes you got to pull them out and pop them back in they're not lying tonight [ __ ] [ __ ] well one of you's got to be higher than 25 [ __ ] percent let's find out i i don't feel comfortable knowing i've got 25 percent left on the battery i just took a fat ass dab and i'm about to start pressing i'm gonna get excited forget and this is gonna die by the way if the stream does go down unexpectedly please stay tuned because i will bring it right back up this is a non-stop party tonight that battery was at 100 you [ __ ] lying ass charger all right all right so for those of you that are new here i do a [ __ ] ton in a very small space so this is where i'm going to be collecting at when i'm all done here okay we're gonna move some [ __ ] out of the way shout out to roz and inc i want you guys to look at something real close here custom product for who that is who has bags like that who has bags like that do you want to know why he carries these two and a half by four and a half bags hey cuz of me baby who wants some bags i know some of you press and some of you need some bags all right anyways we've got parchment laid out we've got our bags ready to go okay and here you guys are going to go you're going to go right here look at that just for you how's that view yeah you could just chill set you down now is a good time if you got to use the restroom you got to go grab a drink you know what i'm saying whatever you got to do go handle that let me figure out this lighting i don't want it to be too bright for you guys oh [ __ ] that's too bright all right i feel good about this you guys are ordering from rosin inc make sure you guys use my coupon codes they're on my site solventlessbnb.com let's get ready get up there get up there just a little love from my homie right there you know all right remember you guys we're gonna be doing the 160 micron and the 25 micron mixed together as a test press before we move on to the full spectrum presses here we have the uh [ __ ] puck come on turn on screen doesn't recognize my gloves oh well anyways i hope that you guys were able to see that now this uh this is just some uh edibles mix of some uh the last strain that i pressed out which is the grape cosby little dark but it is [ __ ] chirpy and delicious and it will do amazing for edibles because the flavor that it will add is not too over the top but it's definitely like you notice it notice it so we're going to drip this into that edibles jar this is probably not going to flow crazy this is a test press a low temp test press at 175 all right i honestly feel like i should go up a little so so so so oh that looks like it's gonna be good well i think i found the temperature i'm gonna try for the first full spectrum maybe it'll flow a little bit more i'll take it for edibles siezer um don't worry that was just a plate on top of the press jumping around my cold plate up there good extraction well the flow was okay wasn't quite what i want it's kind of a weird flow so all right well not quite what i'm looking for believe it or not 185 that's gonna give me that awkward drip i'm gonna hold pull my audience to see what you guys think the temperature is that i'm gonna go with i already know what i'm going with i'm gonna go with uh my usual all right well we're gonna go ahead and do the first full uh spec press now all the same size that one was at 175. small bag we'll do this one first oh jesus 224 no too high 202 202 202 that's that's where i'm feeling 202 today i can feel it in my huevos rancheros pressing some cool spectrum once cash baby all right the room temperature is 74 degrees i do not believe in running a cold room during the pressing stage now bear with me you guys this is going to be a tad bit awkward as i have to deal with not only the um press this new jar which is larger and doesn't sit on the edge so i have to hold it like this in fact i don't even know what your viewpoint is now does that make sense right there where it's at for you guys i mean all right here we go we're at 191.1 191.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 six that's how slow my press heats up i love it i don't care what anybody says it doesn't overshoot temperatures during pressing because it sleeps it heats up slowly it doesn't like jump up all crazy because it has some overpowered 150 to 200 watt heaters it just has two 100 watt heaters nicely spaced out let's take a dab again next time tomorrow it sounds delicious this [ __ ] is like caramel taffy uh oh uh oh ah excuse me i felt like my nose was gonna run all over camera i didn't want that oh yeah what's up mommy my [ __ ] that'll do good that'll do oh that gets the job done i'll tell you what how you guys feeling about this prize we're at 199.7 199.7.8.9 200. 201 i'm not there and dad just [ __ ] knock me on my ass about let's get ready to remove look at that still plenty of paper towel left to clean bangers with throw that away save that puffing my man it's a good night when my boy puffin comes to visit you're pressing yourself right now huh hell yeah get it dog we are warmed up to 202 degrees let's go this is gonna be a second test press slightly lower than my normal but for some reason i'm feeling this temperature why i saw gonza say 204 and i'm like yeah yeah that's my normal i feel it but then all of a sudden my balls rumbled and spoke to me from deep within and they said no 202 now they're all right [ __ ] it the balls haven't lied yet oh what would you look at that there already me gusta come here come to daddy a little [ __ ] go what i say i knew it i felt it i felt it in my huevos rancheros oh yeah let's get messy somebody's got to make a meme out of the next big bag that squirts all over this jar so i'm feeling good about that that's a fish grab that and we're gonna move this over here i'll turn you right now 202 my [ __ ] i want to know did i get it all did i oh man that was a beautiful extraction 202 good job balls sometimes it's in your brains sometimes it's in your balls tonight it was in my balls oh check your insta i just saw you let me see let's let's see what am i checking your story i don't know maybe i jumped in at the wrong part of that conversation oh elevated uh nah there wasn't a lot on the parchment there was barely anything in here really maybe like two to three grams that was a small piece of uh that was small and that was 19 grams in there and uh [ __ ] dude not a lot left in there it's all over the [ __ ] sides of this jar is where it's at you guys want to see a big squirt huh all right let's get it gotta get off this cyber dream stuff though um all right let's get it big old fatty this one feels like a 27-30-ish somewhere in there all right let's go i don't want to listen to trap sorry i gotta get i gotta get the right music on first this is bothering me put on some good old tj hotto all right let's go i'm gonna fold this one down the center i just pinch it crease it down the center diagonal the other diagonals and that gives you kind of like a good flow right there already and then you just pinch the sides together and it's like let me check my battery here 85 percent go dude i'm all smoking one squeeze okay shout out to my man mysticalgo my official artist on sbnb records back down oh yep bomb extraction on that one let's go cross mountain ranges split cells of tomorrow it flowed so well there's like not even that much on the paper let us go yes uh let's keep this party [ __ ] going good over here peace i think i put some information in the description maybe i didn't add that i guess but 25 micron double bag from rosin inc for the uh for the bags my bad y'all i tried to put some information in there and i left out that one yo if you guys can't catch the live streams sign up for my patreon i upload them there so come to daddy um is i'm the master of my own fate i determine my own yield i grew the flowers this is the source of the single i am my own god excuse you uh is that's why i keep the ends of these parchment pieces wrap them over the parchment paper i wish i could slow this down listen listen did you [ __ ] catch it though my man [ __ ] threw it in putting him on game yo understand he let y'all know i'm putting y'all on game for free i'm gonna i'm gonna take it back one time is it too loud uh um let's go ladies and gentlemen it's time to flow i'm gonna bring you guys back some i feel like i'm not bad hold on you guys don't really need that flashlight i don't think anyways let me take it off and passed wrench squad hold it down here's a pro tip on really fat pucks make sure you leave a little extra space behind the puck so that you don't get a blowout but i can mute it that's fine didn't need that light but i'm not liking how that's lining up on the [ __ ] plates i'm gonna move it over just a tad real quick like uh is i go go go go go real big extraction what is it [ __ ] this one's really done i'm calling it now it's gonna be a dumper is nobody [ __ ] with you you know what as a kid i actually did like origami and [ __ ] you know what was better than origami paper [ __ ] planes god damn it paper planes with a [ __ ] i could fold all types of paper planes you guys when i was a kid not now you know why i can't do it now because i lost the book i didn't look that [ __ ] up read that [ __ ] in the book you know what i mean books are cool as [ __ ] you can learn how to make paper airplanes and [ __ ] who would have thought mm-hmm starting to get good at this [ __ ] so um okay well brown is foreign i until you quit this next one's gonna squirt like a [ __ ] so um okay i have that camera ready i'm gonna record this one on my phone i'm not sure how i'ma do it watch me money money all the time hey money please no worries it's only 200 degrees touch it with your [ __ ] hands that sense sorry i'm trying to align this a little bit differently here safety reasons there it is my press has a ram that can adjust positions so um it's a little bit different than most the ram isn't stationary which means that it can come out of alignment sometimes if i move it or whatever but it's all we're helping to make good taking care of your summer projects is a breeze bam summer savings on all your favorite brands make things even easier so freshen up the deck and fire up the grill summer's here and it's as close as your home yard get more done let's get it i've used this prosper [ __ ] ever you're biking like five years now i just let go of the [ __ ] bar my bad you guys the camera is on a very unsteady amount kinda i don't have the tripod leg spread out very well all right is to the place whoa the puck slit in the plates when i was adjusting it apparently almost popped out of the front no blow out though but i gotta pull it out real quick and readjust it i'm so glad that didn't blow out but somehow that slipped out that's a trip i'm so happy that i didn't blow out that's crazy what the [ __ ] i've never had that happened that's a trip that's a trip son experience saved for real he wouldn't would he he [ __ ] would let's go back on the plates you go you son of a [ __ ] that was a trippy trip trippy trip trip this thing is about i was like why is it not going like it should be leaking way more and then all of a sudden the handle slipped and i was like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] what happened put that back on the plate for a second up a let that so hmm who's your daddy who's your daddy what a safe uh is before oh yeah good extraction i'll take it oh yeah let's power through it two more to go parchment gets added to the jar everything i want everything together mixed together equal even steven the stuff that sticks to the parchment might be different terpenes might be different different [ __ ] you know you don't want to leave it out shop from the comfort of your home at sprint.com that's not a lot of work bro i know i'm saying it's already time to upgrade the jar again i just got this damn jar i'm upset it's not fun i thought for sure it was going to be good enough we knew get a bigger drawer uh bertha it's time to go squirtle what the [ __ ] it did it again something's going on here is it sliding something's happening here there's no blowout but it's sliding off pressure's not being applied evenly to the plates somehow or they're too tight or i pre-packed them at an angle never had this happen okay i know what i'm about to do fix this i'm going to have to increase the pressure even slower every problem there is a solution hmm leaned on him to apply pressure for the pre-press by doing it evenly i had to have been time to upgrade and put my bigger plates on i guess for these bigger presses right inside there i hope you guys are watching this if you guys aren't [ __ ] paying attention i don't know what you're doing right now when i mess up that's when you guys need to pay attention because i don't mess up very often not to sound cocky whatsoever but i don't so if i make a mistake that's resulting in some type of mess up it would benefit everybody around me to pay attention and realize what i'm doing wrong so i got my light that's fine before i make sure i got the jar underneath there i didn't think it was going to squirt like that still this parchment is heavy from the [ __ ] first part of the press but it's still flowing good that's all that matters and no blowout fan dumb strong on the top setting don't you get a damn hum my curl is my rocker maybe i choose you and i don't even have i don't even have um i have a couple theories for what it is lots of adjusts right now it's increasing pressure too fast and also i have the press at a a pretty good angle right now leaning towards the front and i think that the hash is melting and making the puck inside uneven and then it blows out the front like that so i think i'm just going to go ahead oops just hit the table i'm going to go ahead and flatten out the press a little bit more risky with this puck anymore how would i do on the save [ __ ] crazy giving her incredible so okay my battery at 34 okay um check the alignment of the plates one more me come on gloves don't stupid i know it's not that cold in here but then mm-hmm little 74 degrees in here oh missiles contemplating life changes foreign foreign let me grab some parchment hold on i got an idea not so much as an idea that i just want to do something for this press just insurance actually all okay searching for savings on descriptions is so complex it's like getting a documentary unfortunately you just savings period not all patients eligible savings so um me yes i haven't even hit one ton of pressure you guys think i'm kidding look so just hit two and a half oh figured it out right pressure was increasing too fast and the angle probably didn't know so so well aren't you guys glad i got the internet connections really good attraction well wow please so um batteries are charged let's get a battery swap in before we do anything else we'll go from there sound good oh think so okay all right so good job bertha good job baby we're gonna take a dab and then after this dab i'm going to um go ahead and collect what's on the parchment and get it added to the jar while it's still warm man that's heavy that's heavy i mean yield wise i'm thinking it's got to be it's got to be upwards of 80 it has to be you know there's it is no [ __ ] way it's not it's a little harsh didn't it that's okay i'll turn it down i knew there was a little [ __ ] nap thingy in here a little [ __ ] flew right on me else we know there's never a good time to run out of fresh luckily our delivery and free pickup excuse me so whether it's a few extra guns from the back all right i mean you can't help it i got lights on in here when i come in through the garage little [ __ ] just came in with me i guess oh boy oh what are we taking a dab off i mean this is the 160 and 25. this [ __ ] is looking better than some people's like 90s come on man this is my throwaway edibles what's your calling air force reserve af reserve dot com all righty i got the drugs already got a little bit of runs on here i'm gonna grab some more though on the outside of one of these parchments but i smeared i know there's like a bunch on the outside i could take so i don't have to dip into the jar or anything i'm i'm weird right now you're like call that fresh press man i wish i'll give you a melt so like wood that's runs wow wow that flavor is intense now that i haven't dabbed it in a while in a while holy [ __ ] it is intense um hitter hitter hitter hitter hitter goodness q-tip foreign all right fire all right here we go

the speed nicely the press is still have enough in the speed of the plate clothing there we go this is dupe I'm just gonna blow out if I'm not careful he's gonna put on a wrap and a small small amount when you get in there and see this [Music] back it off a little bit there's friends gonna blow very clear [Music] oh wow yes I see I haven't went over 20 because say good job so the guys that resin ran holy God looks like water [Music] look like the light is colored like some added some lemon [Music] [Music] Wow it's done here alright gotta pull it to dance while going up so much slower right now [Music] literally smells like our friend Dimitri wait oh yeah oh whoa that's a crazy thing to transform the center that's it oh it's some lamb lamb wiggity wow you guys really you can't really even see it on the paper there are spots in the tape help me see the light are you falling on Tosh late look go eliminate some time for Hannah oh well yeah yeah totally now you can see those little squares here I figured it was worth its buy the expensive what can i yeah bamm-bamm spaghetti land no it's all right cooled off a bit now collect it up no but you just do right off the bat just take that one gram you're talking about mm-hmm put it right over yeah off these rips that's a purest of the pure 100 scale you do what I say I have to do a second pressing not focusing on very well it tried to focus on it for a second yeah it goes in and out I got to figure out what it's focused thing is the giving it doesn't have it one that you can choose but I found it and that's perfect well it's so good that you're and yeah it's just serious oh yeah that's a good view of it you sure you just saying have smellivision order oh man oh wow the odor of this Rand Paul mouth dude whoo oh no oh my baby sure of it just like that that stage Nicholas pull that off a bit a little bit simply a 50% yield I'm sorry to say oh oh there's still more yeah boom there you go that's like a dream well I'm curious because if but like it should be one third of the ratio just cuz this is gonna end up being like super small amount of diamonds who want to get a fatty amount or like an even ratio or some Island right now what bank with some some good amount so it's like a pretty deep sea some diamonds and then like even it might be less than I have a grandma last time today know why empresa nice oh there you go oh well then gold out then some ranch farmers and definitely farming that resident whether that's fire two grams that's pretty good there was what was it on the way through 70 yeah that's two point seven half that's like stir-crazy out Jesus 77% whopping their services in Wildman oh so yeah I don't know what the ratio I guess would be one still do this one again of a higher temp oh yeah turn it up right now yeah so yeah we got Graham to make the goods out of those may not be the better yet okay yeah guys so you're getting exactly you know one young put these into this much it's really easy Matt yeah it'll be all right calculated okay so I'm really anxious to fight at this stuff yeah [Music] oh gosh here's a little trick associated to one if you lock your fingers you just take the glove off your finger [Music] yeah pretty honking way back [Music] hit honestly though we don't look that much better than his hash I mean I said there's more definition Oh Barry speaking yeah now watch week watching the watch walking with the [ __ ] oh okay there was very much done with him really [ __ ] activated now the bird about ten minutes oh really right there I thought yeah yeah that's literally the most gorgeous [ __ ] time the second squish real quick here 180 degrees now Wolverton 160 oh nice all that in just one blow real oh I figured this would have to go hi yeah but maybe we should have no such is who fear why rural Oh so he said why do you whip it for consistency people are commenting hell yeah well size micron byesies I believe we're using 25 right well I'm not sure what size micron bags of the hash to use there but 25 microns 92 149 there you go I know that and then yeah my silkscreen here's 25 micron which is a little lower than you really need to go for doing hash rosin 37 is my usual but this stuff is really I just makes it really clean and then it's also double usable uh EE used as the thing that we wrap the rosin back into to make the HCA extract out of it the [ __ ] daddy so thanks and then yeah Emily and a weapon it does it just kind of kicks in the nucleation process which helps to cause it to butter or change consistencies which you need it to be in that kind of tacky ER consistency or less less messy before you can actually make it into the THC a effectively otherwise most of it was booze out of the bag this one was on with right this is what the first grand that we didn't live yet this is the second ground that you whipped on camera and writing it so you can see the difference between the two clearly this one was just whipped for it you know a little while that one it was not whipped at all looks beautiful says hell yeah focus three people in the house now yeah those look [ __ ] beautiful thank you sir sup neighbors so these guys following Instagram resin ranch extraction yeah they know what they're doing yeah this is hella dense split in the house starting yeah gotta know they're easier than love well my limiting factors are out of my hands you know if people are knowing the product and they're isolating it clean methods then most pretty much just skate by on this end serious you know thank you John 4411 thank you very much this is donated lemon start out Thank You Man that's [ __ ] awesome when life gives you lemons you squish them muhfuckas into some dank but yet so one form this is kind of a nice little squarish shape book yeah and get it butter in the form that we want to wrap it in the final bag well that's the wait until the father to do that but you can get that shape oh dude Thank You lab max flashier than that [ __ ] yeah bro just enabling this little infants of it yeah well we gonna have some lemonade oh that is that fresh hmm gonna get myself a second time remember it's still beautiful color oh wow yeah it's still clear yeah how are you playing oh my god yeah I get the time yeah yeah whoo garlic comes out in 2021 I guess forget that so what'd you guys think can unicorn swim - or just fly the thoughts was a rosin master as the rosin teenage ones are the thoughts that keep you up at night yeah I mean obviously they can breathe in outer space but so that yeah of course they can swim in cool BAM there's the second press meat usually makes it a darker color but it's still yeah it's totally fun that's the same way oh my god we ready to go try to have with that yeah as I was thinking yeah [ __ ] yeah I know if we can just shut this down now it's like make that into some tea later or something no she should be there awesome dude yo thank you a third squish light but I mean that's fearful if you want to or anything but yo thank you for this [ __ ] thing we'll do whatever so parts you come on soon cool fine y'all have a good night bhai de Cerio thank you guys for tuning it well yeah [Music]", "icuI3WpxQxk": "hi I'm Cass and this is honey and we're here with Matt Natalie and beautiful green sea to retreat into phyno and we are about to do the coolest thing we are making on our gummies so not Natalie they're the experts and they are going to show us so what's step one oh well first of all you want to get yourself some cannabis so this is purple blue so have a look at that and maybe you can pick a decent size and I'll go to that that we can chip apart a little bit maybe they're all done man that number to which you could have a look at a little darker so you both can go ahead and pick some cannabis out of that bag just how much can we pick maybe something close to 2 3 grams whatever feels right you can either choose a big mug or even just a few small notes we're gonna switch this down I'm not to a compressed pop okay so that's gonna be one of the first steps once we've picked out the cannabis so we are making these gummies from rosin so it's a solvent list product so it's a great canvas extract you don't need to use like any weird chemicals or solvents or anything like that so it's a super exciting way to D carb and income means a hundred percent it sounds like yeah pretty much all using is sweet and a bit of pressure to squeeze out the trichomes off of those buds so we're gonna have an extraction process to remove what we want off of the buds and you can play around with the different heats and pressures so the idea is to maybe find the ultimate way to get a great yield of different strains might be different pressures different temperatures so there's a bit of a science to it and a bit of a logging process to see if you can dial this in and get as much out of it as possible what are you doing here so we are going to pre press the flower so basically you're gonna weigh out how much cannabis you're using and we are friends at rose and unity have created this amazing database program it's online so you go to rosin unity our OS I am you and I - I gotta come and you can love all your information so you're going to want to weigh your flour and then you can track it so there's gonna be a little spa there it says how much weight and I'm gonna say 2.5 grams of cannabis and now we're going to put it into this crazy little 3d printer puck press that resin you'll be babe that's good and you're just gonna press it that's the muscle in this room right now I'm gonna let him and we status it is there a way that you could do this that you couldn't press it that hard is there like a machine that you could buy that we're doing are well in some in some presses you put them in a little baggy a little screen it'll lose through but in this case it's just parchment paper so you do need the puck in a sense to make this approach go down mm-hmm so there's a company called Kanna clamp and that's who we're gonna press our Roselyn today which reminds me we should fire them up yeah and they the Kanna clamps come with a little press a little box press so it's like that but instead of a circular puck it is a rectangle and so if you buy a set it kind of clips you will get one of those presses with it right in a sense but the kind of line look at that no there we are we've got ourselves a bit fragile actually you're a nice step president as impressed as possible so now we're gonna weigh that puck again just to double-check so at 2.3 to you or a 2.5 we're also gonna wear our parchment paper before we get anywhere further with this process so on the data base it's going to say paperweight in so this is just your paper parchment paper as it is culinary parchment from paper chef is the best rosin parchment paper to use paper chef's you should probably just make Brussels paper we're gonna basically fold it twice and make a little pocket this is mechanically they're made in the States so it's basically a hair straightener on steroids yeah amazing it's really easy to use one button to turn it on side button turns it up so you can try two different temperatures again you get to log them on your AWS and unity to see what temperature you squish that and see what your yield is like the one thing about the can of clamps it's important is first of all they get hot so do send them down on a silicon mat to protect your comb and the second thing is that you want to make sure you line up your bud in the middle of the clamp so you want to make sure that you're squishing the whole bud and the whole pot in otherwise you'll miss some of the squish so preferably the puck is centered so none of it is gonna okay those guys venture sure cos okay now I don't have much pressure on this yet but we're gonna want to start a timer as soon as I do apply some heavy pressure and from there we'll just see what happens all right I'm not quite there yet once I'm feeling I would say there's some pressure there now and you're at 225 so there we go let's do this so I'm gonna clamp this in as aggressively as I can't we're gonna get this nice and tight the handle is plastic so I'm not gonna go crazy and we're just gonna wait this is pretty accessible though like this isn't totally large of an appliance to have yeah and as the heat compresses this puck I'm able to actually squish down even further so over the minute now we're just over a minute I've actually squeezed it in even further what is the last thing we let it go to two minutes all of this information so the big thing is people are excited about what they've switched with turning this unit you're done is the main safety feature because these are hot so that is the one disclaimer to be careful is turning this off between squishes okay so this is your rosin here it is all this liquid here so you always get like a little clam better pop and don't throw these away because these are still good you can like melt these in with butter you make popcorn topping so they can't recycle then tomorrow can you maybe tilt that towards the camera so they can see what we got out of that now how its strong would you say that is well we'll find out we're gonna win see actually what kind of return on the switch we got we'll see exactly how much we have here and from there we can get a better idea how much rosin we have all right so everybody can huddle in and have a close look at this because any basic dab tool we'll just go ahead and clean all this stuff it'll all stick together so once you've got a clump going you can just literally almost like vacuuming the parchment it all just comes together and actually that may be why you're right it's really yeah it really is this was actually a nice consistency array of squish and just like that we've squished that bud and we've collected all the rosin so that was a an extraction just like that Wow yes it really is and this will be what we D carb activate and use for our edibles so we're gonna take the rose and look at addy carbon in the oven at 275 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes so we have preheated the oven to 275 and you're just gonna put it in a mason jar and cause a lid on it that's going to be carbon because Robin you don't get enough heat from squishing it to be carpet so you're just gonna get a little bit more for your cannabis if you and your awesome if you put it in the oven first so what does D carbon mean then her so deep carbonate is basically activating the cannabis so that once you put it into an ethylene it and your stomach acids will break it down so if you didn't decarbonise aim effect at all that's right yeah okay there we go two minutes all right blue represent movies well the stuff comes the long way to get old lady should now remaking rosin as well and rosin you know what your yield is so on that purple blue we've got a 13 percent yield no not bad 20 percent yield is like pretty fantastic they're not all beggars look at that yeah cool so that will make the bulk of our edibles all right from 30 minutes 30 minutes start your timer so you know so you want to use a quarter cup of water with your bus with yellow whatever flavor you desire no super classy weird jello gummies Angelica mystic so we only had a third cup measuring so you want to stir it yeah red her Brides putting a half gram of rosin if we had a larger ER with more rosin it would swirl more efficiently no we're scraping there yeah we got it nice a second in goes the jelly into the bowl to later go into the molds all right everyone get to see ours Easter Island bolt can't fire grotto like that show to the campfire Stern had to give him something and probably see him on the weekend at the event let me get out of your way Oh gonna put him in that fridge Emily and this guy says the fridge for 20 minutes so look at them how long were these in the fridge for these goes-- were like 22 minutes in the fridge we're just testing out this ice cube tray and it's silicone we did line it with an oil I would recommend using like a coconut oil we use pen a lot well because that's when we had access to it just helps it slide out [Applause] yeah Roz I love these I caught these perfect they make these in like 40 minutes a lot like mr. Z Z is making a cheesecake and so we use half gram of rosin so it's 250 milligrams and we broke it up over 500 their food was I don't know 15 milligrams per piece 40 so I would like start slow you know well it depends where you'll feel like this day don't give that to your grandma you taught us that such a clear easy awesome way and now I have these delicious affordable when I make gifts thank you thank you and huge other two rows in unity for hooking us up they showed us Ryan at rosa unity you go follow them at Rose music on Instagram they're killing it they go to super cool Rosen database and he showed us how to make these two days ago and now we're spreading the love and you guys I see it and we have been looking for and specific resin edibles and now we can make them thank you so much Matt and Ali and you have an amazing story and you're gonna hear about it on our show regular Canadians enjoying weed so with Cass and honey now check them out this time thanks green sea to retreat for having us here gasps gunfire we're hooking up today yeah it's been a [ __ ] wicked day all your eggs edibles this day has been absolutely perfect and kind of interesting so this is just gel our Joan something that kids know how to make thank you", "BZudsMyM23Y": "[Music] recently we purchased this adapt dress it's a 10 ton rosin press the company is actually that press there they're actually they could do it yourself Razi manufacturer but I've bought their full-on kit hydraulic pump the hand pump resection and you see right here with the gauge it comes with everything you need the full built out press portion with the three by five plates included the 10-ton jack right here it has this really cool feature called drip tech or the hole press flips forward like this and it rosin can just drip out onto a piece of parchment down it just makes collection a lot easier it's really just a pain to scrape the parchment when you have a lot so if it drips and pools into one spot it's really convenient so it's a pretty sweet little feature now honestly this is pretty much the same thing as the what what time presses that everyone's using nowadays it looks the same and it seems to be performing the same so I thought I put it to work here with some old outdoor bubble hash just uh yeah like five grams total I'm gonna toss in a thirty seven micron press book bag to be my first time using their bags it's kind of a review for both the damn press and the press quote bags today I'm gonna be pressing that 175 and I think that's about it dive into it [Applause] [Music] okay but then we had a power outage I was a little bit whack but everything came back on so let's get back to it [Music] almost bump together this is pretty old hash I'm just playing around with the press right now not really trying to make any pretty product this sauce is probably gonna be like a really dark brown or like nasty looking rosin but just getting an idea for how it works for when I'm running some product from the fall harvest [Music] all right so we don't have enough to fill the bag obviously so we're gonna try to press it this she's going to give us the least amount of surface area on the bag which would therefore lead to a higher yield cuz it would mean less hash getting stuck inside of the bag or the filter material so all you do is you tuck these corners under and I'm obviously gonna cut the bag I'm just gonna kind of shape in the hash right now just picking up I'm gonna cut it just a little bit higher to be conservative this fear pretty ugly cook all the talks like this so I got like a little little package you throw it in the truss here just to get a free press on it gonna make it easier to work with the press [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] now we're gonna throw this little package here on the placement parchment you can tell them a total newb this is my first time using this bag baby close the trust [Laughter] interesting - in there before I actually apply pressure [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] kind of like few seconds Neil about 30 seconds to a minute you can see we're starting to get a little bit of rosin starting the bead right there on the bag with this letting it heat up so prevent a blowout on the bag you just want to take it gentle and not apply too much pressure at once [Music] push it in there a little start applying actual pressure and drip it down all right starting to see some those would be who did this give it a little bit more efficient peejoe I'm gonna flip it down [Applause] just make sure we're all aligned here and I will start really applying pressure we still haven't actually applied any psi whatsoever the gauge is still at nothing [Music] [Music] really dark that's just because when I made the bubble hash it was from product that was really it was outdoor but let's sit for three months before I actually made the hash the track of themselves are already really oxidized not exactly enticing but I guess is more of a test in so I can just really get a feel for these products before I actually start pressing my own really high-quality stuff from my own garden now I apologize for all the noise we got the nursery full up and running so we got exhaust fans going behind me and like a little clone station so it's all making quite a bit of noise it looks like it's starting to slow down so we're gonna apply a little bit more pressure here we can squeeze a little bit more out of it where we are pressure was really not that much we're gonna keep slowly applying pressure until we don't get any more drippings or any more rods and beating so honestly they're impressed with both the bags the best club working really nice this 37 micron is giving me a pretty darn good yield for that low quality bubble hash and the rosin press here my dad press is making and just extremely easy to do everything you know how to really low cost this whole setup here was under $600 so that just gives you guys an idea a low town press alone is like 900 so this is awesome that's all I gotta say those are my worried so far I'm just gonna apply just a little bit more pressure here give it the final push and then we're gonna pull it off I'd say this press is about done we're getting in close to about three minutes just kidding it's probably a lot more than that we should have probably only been gone for three minutes but again I'm just playing around so yeah I'm definitely pleased with both product so leave links to that in the description of both the dad for us and the of the bags that I used in this video all around seemingly great products [Music] as of right now I highly recommend everything that I'm running wait for this last little bit you're a bother yes press [Music] that's hitted bag performed pretty well barely even sticky a little bit around the edges but little blob right there how much is getting stuck in them and no blowouts [Music] oh yeah looking good whoa [Music] pretty [Music] please [Music] I'm not gonna waste your time and scrape all this up [Music] the idea that's basically again tutorial and quest bubble hash it's a review on the gap press tent tongue trip tech rosin press and a review also on these Press Club bags right here they say they're organic and biodegradable that's pretty cool zero flow flow out guarantee they don't know how true either of those things are but true today [Music] oh yeah they work nice please overall [Music] links are gonna be in the description about these products I'm not getting paid by either these companies just want to rep the stuff that I'm using because I feel like if it works other people should know about it so I hope you guys enjoyed this video goodnight [Music]", "DwfFsR_AE8s": "[Music] okay so today is tremors bonus day I'm going to be taking a bunch of trim and lar from a recent harvest and I'm going to be showing you how I go about making some simple safe solving this crisis if hash [Music] there's many different ways that go about taking care of your trim in life and this is simply just one of them and by no means of mine expert I'm just going to show you what I do in terms of sifting my trim and life to further extract the cannabinoids just to get as much as I can out of the plant with that being said I'm going to leave a link down below to a video with bubbleman and D for 20k going over the dry sipping process and in that one particular video they really do go over a lot of key points so I do recommend watching that video as well after you watch this video of course guys come on now when it comes to dry sipping trim lar for actual flowers dries in the name so make sure the material you're using is dry enough otherwise the trichomes they won't fall off the plant matter as easily now I'm using trim and lar from a recent harvest and after hang-drying the flowers for 10 old days I trimmed the flowers up and place them into jars for curing and I left all the trim and larf from the harvest on these screens to further dry I had it on the screens for over a week before placing into a freezer bag and storing the trim in the freezer for future use now on top of making sure the material is dry enough to dry sift also ensure your material is as cold as you can get it during the process of sifting the cold temperatures causes the trichomes to become brittle and more liable to break off the plant so it's best to store your material in the freezer right before getting ready to sift it try to set up your work area for sifting in a cold environment I'm using my basement and I live in Canada where it's currently minus 12 outside and my basement is sitting around twelve degrees Celsius or about 55 Fahrenheit if you happen to have a garage or perhaps a spot outside that is blocked off from the wind you may want to put on a jacket and take your sift area outside this way you can achieve the best yields from your trim [Music] now let's talk zip screens so each zip screen has a different mesh count which allows different size materials to pass through your top screens are classified as you're working screens and the top screen I'm using is the ninety lines per inch this is the main screen you're gonna be working all the material over it the trichomes will be breaking off and falling through to the next screen which is the hundred and ten lines per inch this screen is an important one because it's going to continue to allow the trichome heads to pass through while catching most contaminants which are going to be your decapitated stocks and pistol hairs the trichomes will fall on the screen or roll around until dropping through the screen while the contaminants toxin hairs land flat and gets stuck on top of the screen now this leaves us with the very bottom screen which is the 200 lines per inch this screen catches all of your trichomes it has a few purposes from being the final catch system of your trichome heads but is also used as a cleaning tool to further clean and purify your drive shaft heads of contaminants this is where you can take some farmers grade hash or Keith and further clean it down into pure heads there's multiple techniques to go about cleaning your dry state further from the carding technique to static dry sifting I'm gonna leave a link down below to a couple detailed videos on how to further clean your farmers great hasher Keith [Music] so the way I sent my tram in large is I like to do it in three separate runs the main difference between each run is going to be the time and the amount of agitation the material goes through the first run is going to be quick and it's going to produce the cleanest heads while the second and third runs are going to produce the most amount of heads but they will be dirtier and not as pure the first run through the screens very quick the material is simply being dropped onto the working screens and then picked back up off the screen and set aside for run to the main point of the first run is to collect the nicest and cleanest heads the longer the material is worked over the screens the more containers will fall through into your pile of clean ash so for the first run it's important to be quick and diligent and avoid being too rough and leaving the materials on the screen for too long [Music] now as I drop the material on the top screen the trichomes are going to be falling off and passing through and hitting the second screen and then rolling around until the finds will hold a pass through to the bottom screen so what I like to do is collect what's on the bottom screen already because it will be the cleanest pile of hash with minimum contaminants I will set this aside on a parchment and then bring back the second screen and I will just give the top of the screen a flick to cause the material to bounce this allows majority of there are many trichome heads to roll down to the bottom screen these are still very clean heads but because I'm flicking the screen more contaminants are gonna pass through which is why I like to collect them in separate piles keep in mind this is just what I do you very well could flick the second screen right away and just collect it all out ones and label all of that your first one the reason why I do with this waste because that first collection with the least amount of agitation is always going to be the most meltia sand cleanest heads that you can do and in the quickest form [Music] to prepare for the second run I just make sure the screens are clean because any condemned is left on those screens will block the trichomes from rolling down through the screens to the bottom so after every single run I will brush the screens down I also like to put the material back into the freezer too brittle up the trichomes usually a wait about a half-hour before starting the second run [Music] the second run is where I start to get rougher with the material on the working screens I will start to move around the material with my hands for about 10 to 15 seconds and typically for speed I move the material to the side of the screen and then grab another handful and drop it on the screen to repeat after a couple handfuls I will remove the material and place it into a bin for its third run and then continue on until the rest is finished [Music] now there's plenty of ways to go about dry sifting your material and you don't need to do a first second and third run personally I don't like to clean the hash so by doing a quick first in second run it allows me to collect a lot of trichome heads that require less cleaning the third run is where I spend the most time working the material and will end up with more farmer's grade hash that requires to be cleaned to further purify it from contaminants that's where the carding technique and things like static dry sifting come in handy they help further clean dirty hash from removing pistols and decapitated stocks [Music] oh that's good piping hot though last night I only ended up doing two runs just ran out of time it's gonna take way too long to do the third run and it was getting pretty damn late I am gonna do a third run probably like next week sometime I placed all the trim enlarged back into the freezer what we ended up with is like three point four grams of second run sift on the first run the quick run we ended up getting like the Eagles a gram so what I'm gonna do now is actually I want to press some of this the second run hash out into some rosin this is gonna be maybe my third time overall ever pressing hash out into some rosin I'm gonna do all of this wish me luck this is the very very first run and then this is also from the first run but that's after I added the screen a bit so probably a little bit more dirty than this stuff so we're gonna go ahead and take a dab of this and will it melt it probably will I mean I've good suspicion it will never timer Londa we're at a minute at a minute so this right here is a point four and probably gonna end up doing all of it let's go oh yeah she bubbled oh yeah that was super low ten in WoW is that tasty oh yeah you can see it evens these little dirty in there whoo that was nice okay guys well let's get set up the press some hash [Music] [Music] okay so first up we got a bag the hash now I've seen on Pedro's grow room he double bags his hash frozen I've seen him use a few variations I've seen him use 237 micron bags and I've seen him use a 25 micron bag with a 160 micron bag so no reason why I'm gonna go with this variation of double bagging so well let's get this stuff so I put the three point four grams of sift the second run sift into the 25 micron bag you know what I'm gonna do I think I'm gonna just pack this down a bit with my body weight and then so the 160 micron bag I don't know if I should have packed that down before or after look at that so there we go we got 3.4 grams of dry sift inside a 25 micron bag which is also double bagged inside a 160 micron bag these are from rosin evolution and I do have a coupon code down below along with a coupon code for the low temperature and press what you're about to see in two seconds so I think I need a pair of scissors just to trim this up and the way we go give me a second so that way we could just fold it a bit and get ready to press cool so the way I'm going to be pressing out this sift is using a directional flow method now it's very simple and what it just does is it presses all of the rosin of the front and it keeps it from going out the sides of that so you're going to basically cut this parchment to the correct size and there's a simple s just like that and then you fold in each side this is the way I do it very simple takes no time to set up and then you're good to go yeah because I'm pressing out some dry sift I turned down the low temp press down to 71 degree Celsius which I believe is about 160 degrees Fahrenheit and yeah anyways she's ready to go so let's press some rosin [Music] I'm at one minute right now [Music] I really don't know how much pressure to add I don't want to blow anything l things just gonna wait two minutes it's about now and I think we're good oh wow this looks four-way go and suck your blood that alone so that alone is 1.75 grams 1.77 grams and still got all this stuff on it and this looks definitely worthy of press pressing twice so okay guys that's this week's video I really hope you enjoyed it don't forget I'm not an expert when it comes to dry sifting you can actually grab farmer's hash and clean it down and there's multiple ways to do that so a few videos on that will be down below I'm also gonna link Pedro's grow rooms Instagram profile and YouTube channel down below as well as he presses a lot of hash rasen so if you guys are interested in learning more about that that's where I learned this double bag technique my phone just made a noise guys I'm not gonna redo it we're keeping it also don't forget that links to everything you see in this video there down below included the coupon code so if you're intrigued by anything check those out you want to help me out please

"ezRzBxPQpbI": "when you know that this is $75 and you're getting a big scoop of it I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there [ __ ] it this video is for mature audience if you're not a mature audience this video is not for you what's up everybody Cubans here and today we are going to get into some rather expensive concentrates I picked up a gram of some hash rosin today that was priced at $75 and it is one of the most expensive grams of concentrate I have ever purchased so let's take a close look at what we got I've had a gram of Summit connoisseurs genetic and concentrates Tiger's milk and this stuff looks like a nice little slab of peanut butter I'm pretty excited pretty excited abot both so you can get a look at the packaging here this is that Tiger's milk and it's testing at about seventy nine percent THC and then it does have a little bit of CBD a in there but you know what I am so excited for this let's just take it down where are my clothes at let's get a nice nice little scoop here out of the email all fresh and clean and I'm gonna see how it does does [Music] um yeah that was really good I'm gonna actually throw that on a courts now I'm gonna throw that around on a few nails and see if we like it but just to compare I picked up some cheap dabs this cost 75 a gram for some hash rasen 75 bucks for this it's pretty expensive most most of my concentrates I usually find deals and get a lot of good looking stuff like this this is some live batter I got for about 15 bucks a gram one-fifth of the price now sometimes I find live sugars live diamonds of batters around that 15 to 20 dollar price if I'm getting it on a deal it's not the everyday price so begin the deal you can get this stuff cheap so it's really interesting to pay five times as much for a single gram of concentrate I can't I can't believe I did it it's still interesting to me that this costs five times as much as this other gram of some delicious looking stuff but some hash rods and it's hard to come by especially here in Colorado Springs it's not super common to find rosin hash rosin so I guess you got to pay that top dollar because it's so rare but let's get some more dabs of this cone I'm not done with this yet let's see what I'm gonna do some cold starts when you know that this is $75 and you get in a big school but I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there okay [Music] it's throwing out a couple bucks in that [ __ ] it [ __ ] it and get a little bit more I need about three-fitty oh we got it okay okay just pricey tab right here damn it all right let's get a nice cold start here and see if it's super delicious on the court oh damn well damn okay okay that's good stuff so I just stabbed it a couple of times here and it's pretty good stuff but is it is it worth it is it worth paying five times as much as I do for some good live banner is it worth is it worth paying five times as much to get some solvent once that's basically the major difference is the fact that it's solvent list most concentrates are made with a solvent it's the easier method it's the most common method but with rosin they use heat and pressure to make it so they just basically squish the THC or they squish the extract out of the nugs or out of hash most of the time they'll make a hash and then they'll press the hash and that's what this is this is a this is hash rosin so it's a little bit more expensive and my understanding is the yield is a little bit lower it's it's a process to make the hash and then when you press the hash you wouldn't get the same type of yield as if you were doing like a butane or propane extraction so I think part of the process is it's a little bit harder to get high-quality product and you're typically going to get less with whatever amount of plant material you go into the process with so I think that affects the price it is pretty rare out here in Colorado Springs not a lot of people are pressing - I can find it in a few places some places have rosin and half chosen but it's not as common as BHO and pho and there's so many dispensaries that grow their own bud and they do their own in-house extractions so something like this I can I can pretty much get really cheap any day of the week if I'm looking around so for me to pay five times as much for this it's a little little far-fetched I honestly I'd rather have five grams of this and haven't done but yet and it's just I like volume I like to do a lot of dub so I'm gonna go back and forth on these we're gonna compare I just want to shave this I got this the same day I kick it costs literally one-fifth the price I'm just gonna see if it's if it's it if it's 20% it's good like it doesn't make oh god I just paid so much money but anyway anyway anyway yeah that's that's solid for the price that's sell it for $15 grand look um I I think it's good I think that that the rosin is good I'm gonna dab the rod let me have a bucket that was that was the I don't even know of the other strain is [Music] [Music] I mean it's definitely better [Music] the Robins better smoother and tastes a little better you can't really compare the highs because I'm better than both back for it but it's all about the taste for me and it is smoother is it pay five times the price smoother [Music] I don't think so because it's not it's not five times as good yeah I don't even know how you would get five times as give it something like this this isn't the best this isn't the best cheap batter that I've got but for something to be five times as good as this would be pretty impressive so this is not five times as good probably not worth five times the price if I see it on deals I may get it but I don't think it's worth anything that's worth three times the price two times the price even thirty forty five bucks I get why it costs so much it's a it's a little bit less common not as many people are making it and you get lower yields with it I get why it it costs more but it's not currently it's not at the price point where it's super worth it for me to only buy rosin maybe if I had a press and I could get amazing yields myself but I don't grow and I don't have any interest in growing so it's like I don't have to buy all my nugs anyway to smash it so kind of interesting I like finding deals so maybe I'll get excited about finding a deal in the future but yeah this isn't actually the most expensive gram of concentrate I've ever purchased a few years ago I remember purchasing a I purchased several grams actually a full melt bubble hash that I got remember the dispensary but I got some full melt bubble I think it was about eighty eight bucks a gram I think I remember paying just under ninety a gram it was really really good stuff it was like some of the craziest stuff I ever spent I I gotta go back and look for some pictures of it cuz it was a few years ago those full mount bubble hash grams I got were like pretty good but after I got a mouse this isn't worth eighty eight bucks a gram what the [ __ ] did I just do so I kind of feel that way here what the [ __ ] that I just do but we made a video that's what the [ __ ] we just did so let's do a few more dabs of this [ __ ] might as well I've only taken out several dollars off of it I don't see if we can take several more I'm interested in the cold start here so let's do that [Music] here's a few dollars [Music] yeah this is good stuff still I wish I could afford you dabs well this was actually pretty fun and I'm pretty blessed after all those naps and I'm glad I finally got to try this rosin up and see it in a bunch of dispensaries even if I did pay money for it but if you liked this video be sure to subscribe for more content in the future and check out my other social media I'll have links in the description below and for my live streams tune in to twitch at twitch.tv slash Cubans if you tune in at night I'm probably live right now getting high dabbing some much cheaper than than $75 a gram rosin unless you tuned in very shortly after this is made that I might have some of this left but uh come hang out and we'll see you next time [Music] I would say perfect balance but I'm going [Music] [Music] [Music]", "xU1y9mX6jio": "here we go what's good YouTube welcome to another live stream can already take a few dabs and hang out it's just got done prepping for another hash wash damn it getting cold in here too because of that I might have to go grab my jacket but um yeah got the AC cranked to 62 degrees that the ice-cold water in the reservoir I've got a bag of ice for the washer and I've got six more bags ice out in the freezer I need to get a bigger freezer and all the materials well so later tonight after I get the kids down spend some time with the wife I'm gonna come back out here and knock out that bubble hash run uninterrupted probably gonna do somewhere between six to eight runs on it depending on how it looks and how everything is coming out [Music] anyways let's go ahead and get a - go in here I hope you guys are having a good day [Music] that was not clickbait by the way for those of you this joint this is a 104 grant or 100 Ford's a hundred grams now mixed strain hash frothing some cookies some sweet cream some zukie and what else sweet cream cookie sweet cream zoo keys and orange cookies that's what it is [Music] sorry I had someone from work pop-up I don't look out real quick [Music] all right cool [Music] anyways let's go ahead oh it's so good yeah I need to go ahead and fill up a little bit char with that [Music] this was some 60 micron parabola for edibles [Music] this one still has a cush cake in it and this one has on a fish cake so those that's my head - cooks cake in a jar [Music] earth is [ __ ] cold and her alright so I would like you yet in my day did you imagine dabbing that whole thing just like here we feel [ __ ] half the Banger ease and the easily I wouldn't even try it it'd be a waste and a half that's good enough for me enjoy that for the week [Music] the 160 press was man very little in there so that's what that looks like when I end up putting it in the jar and then a lot of people would ask me how did you get that [ __ ] rossington to stick to the bottom of the jar look so neat [Music] here's I take the glove and you're just going to push it down around the edges towards the center you're doing a cold room that's good rosin a clean glove and just like that now it looks like that [Music] with that's hard to see but yeah that's how that comes out when you end up doing that push it down it comes out real nice and clean looking perfect for grams or so it's upload a bird [Music] all right so I gotta move my dad station over now I'm not pressing it back over here well I like it Kiyo is : grab yeah you can do with parchment - I have a little bit more control with the glove I feel like and it rarely gets sticky but parchment works to a more sticky stuff I will use parchment I'm gonna go grab a hoodie real quick [Music] [Music] whoa [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] whoo my tears my eyes [Music] Oh [Music] oh man the big dads always get my nose my eyes [Music] Oh [Music] about three days away from the harvest yeah we're on day 54 honestly I think I could pull them down tomorrow or the next day I want it probably gonna go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] today's Thursday tomorrow's Friday yep I'm go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] five six out of the gate 58 [Music] [Music] I got some pictures of the plants I haven't even posted to Instagram yet pausing to share them with you guys real quick [Music] [Music] turn down the lights already this whole side is just [ __ ] Mileena should be up here these ones dried back a little bit too much almost too much but not too two months still prosti of [ __ ] 12 cars black out there my Spade going over there [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's the current status in the Guardian you know just like oh my flesh for usually you're about seven days it's that but you know [Music] I had issues this run just like Ross Leafs his issues because he's in cocoa they're harder to detect early and so he faced the consequences of the buffering that cal-mag provides in coma cocoa I wasn't in at nursery iam so I was able to turn my issues around a little bit faster but you know basically what I'm saying is you know I had issues this run and the crop is still coming out pretty good so next run you know those issues will be corrected I'll make a video covering the issues that I ran into this grow and how I plan to correct them and I'll throw it up on the patreon hopefully you guys can learn from some of my mistakes you know I talked about on the show doing your own research and shape one of the things I researched if I should have used top-down broward rivers and when I talked to mango tech Abadi he told me to use two gallons per hours to avoid clog and that's what each use is but then I ended up getting water channeling that is too fast on the float and I cost a lot of issues I never really fed high enough of an ECE to have the easy build up nor did I ever push the plants that hard to cause them to have any lockouts it was all because my irrigation was wrong from the get-go with the water swim [Music] are you taking off right now that's one of the changes I'm implementing is not only am I going to get rid of the 2 gallon per hour but I'm going to go all the way down to like a point 3 gallon per hour dripper that could eat drawstring and stuff up here so yeah that'll fix a lot of issues right off to that that I believe uh Charles and pastor [Music] that Daffy got me hired balls rolling in on me now [Music] oh my bad I look here looking up and showers my phone [Music] there's no broad my issues going on in here all it is is either a they were different cuts or they were microclimates right he talked about the water channeling so you know phosphorus deficiency can learn to purpling stems and the plants that express themselves differently also has purple stems where I was the ones that didn't have the red bugs didn't have purple stems so I think it was more of a microclimate issue water channeling issue causing different uptake different nutrients and it just got exacerbated due to the lockout because of the water channeling so next one I'm doing is with wedding cake and I should be getting those clones in about two weeks so I have about two weeks to prep get the plants chopped harvested and everything I'll flip them right in the room that they're in right now I'm basically going to push the tables to one side of the room and then I'll go in and use a light rail for this up against the wall and I'll cut down on the one plant out of time and hang it on a trellis hanging from the ceiling and then I'll just hang all the plants from one light all right [Music] when my moustache hairs on the know it wouldn't happen I got trim my mustache geez so yeah basically just go one light at a time right down hole lights worth of plants hang them go to the next one cut those down hang out on a different trailer that's there the next one so I'll have three trellis nets hanging on the side of the room I'll have to retry this netting on that side of the room so after I cut down the whole left side of the room and those plants are hanging up there on that left side I'm going to disassemble the tables and walk them out of the room and then I can push that whole other table completely over to the middle of the room hang up all those buttons on the back side of the room or wherever in the room right and then basically I'll be good to go I'll get everything hung I'll turn off the shaker fan I'll just keep one of them on probably maybe turn it down to low or something and I'll just have to DEET you and AC going in there I'll be able to scrub down the you the four by twelve that's in there now scrub it down and get it reset and start making my adjustments to the room while I wait on my new 4 by 12 American Girl products they're probably they told me it was going to be issued early June like June 8th or 6 but they might be able to get it in sooner so I mean worst case scenario the room will be down for about three weeks while I wait on the new table but I'll just match all the plants on one table while I'm doing that perfect and then when I get my new table in I'll be able to go ahead and transition the plants over throw up my trellis mats and pretty much switch so you know that's the plan and like I said I'll document all the changes to the room it said of everything that I'd be like want to document the changes and yeah my keeper fee no cuts from honest genetics should be here in the next two to three weeks and solved a whole room full of wedding cake in there veg and flour that while I have a child my keeper he knows from our genetics and my new keeper you know caked up cherries wedding cake crossed with cherry something f3 I'm going to do the three-tiered setup but I'm waiting on him to send me the updated invoice for the new poles and as soon as I get those I'll be able to set it up and I'll have pretty much what I was thinking of doing them what happened to rekey poofy nose and I could basically put all of them on their own tier if I wanted and then have clones next to it or I could just put all the moms on one and then since I'm doing two tables at a time I'll just pick you know I'll have two tiers for clothes you know cherry cookies have three thank you thank you thank you I never remember like my keeper he knows from honest I don't remember what I was are either blue hurricane 27 crossed with white sunrise for the blue lion keeper and then scarlet sure is chocolate frosting crossed with something I think [Music] I trust my man on his genetics he tells me yo this is a [ __ ] you should run for a hash let's fire fire fire legs all right now you got it [Music] like I remembered it enough to purchase it and you know that's all that matters now that's all that matters now I need to show up in the garden [Music] so stoked I have I'll have the blue Hawaiian which is gonna have exotic super crazy unique blue Terps it's gonna be highly sativa dominant as far as the high goes and then the truck not the truck cherry but the cakes of cherries that's gonna be my cherry Fino right there so I'll have a blue of a cherry and then I have the gassy out of scarlet shirt so it's gonna be dope [Music] this is real the kind of light that I use for clowns are right behind either the raging raging kales and I actually got sponsored by science LED yeah so I will be getting now raging candle LEDs probably twice a year during two biggest ways that I do and it couldn't be [ __ ] dope it can really know and then every other month or so I'll be giving away a bunch of science LED swag hats ashtrays shirts things like that all be put on there grower spotlight on their homepage pretty shortly here I have some pictures that I have to take for them and type up some some information and what else asked me to leave to help them do research spectrum tuning and hash production so I'll be doing that so and then also the big thing I'll be an authorized reseller for their lights on my webpage as soon as it's up in a few days so as soon as the page is up I'm going to try and get them on there and I'll be able to resell a life through my page so that way you know they don't do they don't do coupon codes like people in the industry you got to use to coupon codes because of for flex and all that but what that does is it makes it so that you can't sell that product in brick-and-mortar stores anymore and in the hydro industry almost need brick-and-mortar stores still surprisingly to you know expand and survive because still a big commercial facilities go through these hydro stores and you know direct to these manufacturers a lot so they don't do coupon codes they're like let's say they offer a 10% discount code here in California right and somebody purchases a light from you know from me and using my promo code but they're in Oregon or something and or somewhere else where they maybe don't charge sales tax and now not only are they getting the 10% off but they're also getting like seven or eight maybe taking even up to 10% off of that because of no sales tax right whereas if they were to purchase it in the store you know the store would be able to make a profit but in order to compete with that price that they would get you know from using the coupon code the brick-and-mortar store would basically have to not turn a profit so it doesn't work out for them to be able to give people who coupon codes stacked as representatives of the brand so instead I'll be able to be a reseller and then just a very very small portion of the profit that they would make from that light will go towards me instead so I'll be an authorized reseller and then basically helping do research and you know passing that information you guys like I have been this whole time so anyways this is what we're working with they bought this is delicious delicious it's called cookie dough and it's amazing [Music] I don't suspect this is gonna last long you won't need a code to let them know who sent you because you're gonna go through my website to purchase they're working on other programs like referral codes and things like that but [Music] yeah I guess I should keep this on camera so people don't think that I'm like lying and I say I got a grandfather drive here we did well today it's real I wouldn't had a couple more but honestly you guys want to get jars of the grape Cosby and literally all I have left of this [Music] that's it but in this drawer it's maybe maybe seven grams six seven grams of the grape Cosby I think the other jars been scraped empty already yeah scraped empty great cause be gone on that one and then the hell a Koosh cake [Music] there's like maybe two to three grams to scrape out of here [Music] and this one I think is scraped completely empty yeah there's maybe like point two in here it's empty so there was 70 72 grams of the La Push cake and 60 grams of the Cosby [Music] but every time you come in here you [ __ ] promotin be real oh no no no who was it last time it wasn't beaver oh it was your boy the other one that's not good Bernhard that's who it was last time [Music] about your ass sorry yo for real alright here's the funny story that's how you guys are quick so the reason this one got called rape Cosby because [Music] my wife and I dabbed it and she got so [ __ ] high off of it it was like she got roofied like straight roofie I could have done anything I wanted to so I was like mother kali shake great cosby it tastes like grapes and knocks you the [ __ ] out like you did this it was between grape Cosby and roofie colada you know think of work 12 but you guys got to make sure you do it right [Music] it's great cause be like that lowercase G Capital are [Music] all right let's get [Music] a little credit given to me I need a label hood [Music] it's not for grams but whatever [Music] you know [Music] so we're gonna get some cookie dough on there a menace [Music] they push tape on there [Music] [Music] [Music] me up a man popular science [Music] my episode 5 right there alone [Music] [Music] there was a five [Music] [ __ ] bones knock out maybe this is episode [Music] all right hold on okay [Music] but right now it is [Music] but few days that idiot that ain't the one all right well [ __ ] it I'll get it uploaded I was trying to do it right now but I'm having a little bit of a hard time finding a you write for [Music] oh

okay yeah here it is and as this little my everybody [Music] alright I'll go ahead and get this uploaded to YouTube right you know [Music] I'm kind of done editing these I'm just gonna start uploading the RAW files and if people don't like it they can kiss my ass I don't have time to edit them together anymore that's why I put the PowerPoint how I did you know if I do the PowerPoint I don't have to worry about putting an intro and all that into the video it's just boom okay boss [Music] alright crap dude my science for plant nutrition are a cool description I'll edit that later now don't care playlist crafted science done no it's not made for kids don't have to restrict [Music] monetization please do [Music] public [Music] boom what is instant premiere oh [ __ ] we could watch it together at the same [ __ ] time let's [ __ ] do that right now I did not know we could do that that is really cool we can watch the video together yeah three minutes five all right it's 321 I'm gonna go in at

really curious to see what this does though man that was such a good [ __ ] good [ __ ] episode and then episode 5 I'm glad we took a break because we were really [ __ ] burned out both of us and we needed a skip a week we came back and we didn't even have a PowerPoint or anything but it was still an amazing discussion Garrett jumped online from science at levy and he just [ __ ] to talk about what we wanted to talk about which was great just you know [Music] we just talked about troubleshooting it was [ __ ] awesome you know he get his perspective on things like walking into like a huge commercial facility and how you would troubleshoot their [ __ ] to figure out what's going on why certain part of the crop might not be doing its good versus another part things like that so it was really cool to get his perspective because you know as far as lost leaf goes he's a commercial facility but he's a one-man army and it's a small commercial facility it's the size of a house basically a one-story house and so and that's that's no diss whatsoever [ __ ] it's amazing what he's doing I wish I could be at his level but in the realm of commercial grows it's relatively small so you know his perspective is one and then Maya the home grower is another and then Gary brings a whole different perspective being that he's kind of more on the large large scale commercial and so it was really cool you know and go with it so unfortunately during this whole Cove 8:19 thing all of the HD recordings for webinars are being limited and only being allowed standard definition so this is not going to be best of qualities for the uploads that are going on right now from the webinars and there's nothing that we can do about that so you know [Music] check it on the patreon real quick make sure you guys got your post real quick [Music] are you guys waiting on me to take another dab is that what's going on [Music] I guess [Music] it's not what you guys I feel like a little [ __ ] a dab [ __ ] for you guys it's all you guys wanna take your dad show me his plan it's never hey SB Andy how's your day go what'd you do today need some help no I'm just [ __ ] one shot I already forgot what this one is again that's the coach tasted positive and he's more paper towels real quick cuz my house got so high I forgot to clean the [ __ ] banger after the last job that's [ __ ] I I guess I Cosby myself whoever said don't cause be yourself I can't be myself go clean it out real easy paper towels to clean [Laughter] [Music] yeah all of the rapidly science episodes go on patreon pretty much the same day or minimum a week earlier than YouTube a minimum and Matt doesn't post on lost leaf as a poster or anything like that out of respect for my patreon supporters he knows he waits again he's a week two to three weeks even suppose I mean it's not that I don't want the information out there for everybody but I wanted to I want to give some [ __ ] love to the people on patreon and economic access all that and they can pick my brain talk about it on live sessions or whatever brain different [ __ ] you know [Music] all right the tip of my II now is 395 and I need to grab another roll of paper towels real quick [Music] [Music] damn [ __ ] oh yeah [Music] oh [ __ ] [Music] in the filter [Music] oh Jesus son 525 that is a very very high [ __ ] gasps Jesus [Music] [Music] so the reclaim catcher works by basically a when you draw on the dab it gets stuck down here because all that reclaimed can't travel back up pretty much so what you end up with really is just tiny tiny pieces of the vapor that condensed back to rosin in here versus a shit-ton of replaying and if you have a really good deep-dish banger and you do low temp doubts your your reclaim actually can look really nice how well that looks but [Music] seeing us a thing FPV not everybody's email setup is the same not all coils are created equal so you got to get you know a good coil setup with this I can go three eighty and still get clouds [Music] you need some sort of cloud [Music] all right [Music] my emails from 7-10 coils and you have promo codes with them but up go my man go in the house [Music] did I even bring the [ __ ] Paper Towns yeah I did oh yeah okay don't really need to take another dad titanium holy [ __ ] [ __ ] son if you don't swap that over some glass you can get like a full email kit for

catch you guys on the next one I'm gonna call it a night I had a bunch of other [ __ ] I gotta get around to these", "A24Y3JyHLAQ": "this video is made of a user's request today I'm showing you how to winterize frozen in a small batch here I have almost a gram of rosin about a point 8 I made just before this video I'm placing into a beaker and adding 10 ml of Everclear I'm adding the alcohol to the rosin so that I can inter eyes it apply like bleep and mix until all of the rosin is dissolved into the alcohol [Music] here importing the rajma and alcohol into a graduated cylinder this is just for the purpose of the video [Music] I meant place it into the freezer and my cool for about 14 hours [Music] after freezing you can see that the wax fats and lipids have separated and sunk to the bottom [Music] here I'm using two syringes to pull out the fats and waxes as well as the alcohol separately this is also just for the purposes of this video to show you the difference [Music] it does help however to pull them out separately as it makes it easier to filter the cleaner portion compared to the waxy portion [Music] here I'm pushing them through a point to two microns syringe filter the syringe filter tracks the facts and waxes and removes them from the alcohol [Music] [Music] in the end I've caused it in alcohol and it's been winterized and I'm removed of any of its fats and waxes alright once you've done filtering you know how fully winterized rosin you can go ahead and use this for edibles or you can further refine it by boiling away the S&L and using it for bait pens or lowell devs my half plate has a built in magnetic stirrer it's a magnet that spins around and spins a magnetic stir bar this automates the steering process and speeds up the overall evaporation it may take some time for all the alcohol to evaporate keep checking back on it every so often so that you don't burn your rosin I don't recommend consuming concentrate that may have ethanol and then often if you are going to do this regularly you are better off getting it back through the final purge process [Music] after you've reduced most of the alcohol up I'd like to put another beaker on top to prevent any ball tools such as terpenes from escaping that having already in this final process removing the last of the ethanol now you can't truly remove all of it without a vacuum so I went to do this for as long as possible kind of medium to high heat right now it's heated at around 95 degrees Celsius I like to let it sit like this for a couple hours from four I feel it's safe to smoke and the ethanol has escaped [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "DrktgM8Qgh4": "this is a disclaimer this channel is for educational purposes and entertainment only for the cannabis community and other

tuned in it's your boy king mark we're here and we out here you already know if you hear you know what we're here to do we're here for another review today we've got something for you today we got some loud some straight loud we got some yard you know 7/10 always got that fire we're gonna review today we're gonna decide or actually we're not gonna decide what we're gonna have a little debate you know what is better in my opinion you know what's better saws diamonds for Percy rosin and we'll be discussing that in this video today and we'll be taking the DAP of both we'll be taking a dad with some saws diamonds I will be taking the dev of some rosin so we better find out you know I'm gonna give you my personal feedback an opinion on what I think is better but to each their own you know what I'm saying take this with a grain of salt you ain't got a listen to what I have to say you know everyone has their own opinion on things but enough of the chitchat let's get to it you know how I like to start my mornings with a DAB so let's get to it alright so we got the saws diamonds right here from Oasis some fire og saws diamonds dipped in sauce those are nice bro look at that sheesh shadow Oasis all right have you guys ever like just dip the fattest diamond ever and just and took the whole thing in the dab she's amazing bro I swear and then right here we got the rosin as you can tell I've already dabbed it I've had a I've had it for like a few days now it's why it's got this color honestly man I'm not gonna lie to you the smell on this one's amazing it's the foot it's the flavor sour 10 sour tangi crossed with watermelon skittles this shit's amazing it's tier 3 I guess they have tiers on on 710 now you know tier 1 2 & 3 but you know here it is and we're about a compare you know we're not gonna well I can't tell you like you know which we get will get me higher because I would have to take I feel like in order to actually like see what gets you higher you would have to actually take a dab of one and then the top of the other but like separately separate time so you could actually feel the full effects you know what I'm saying but what we're gonna do in this video is we're gonna decide which one is smoother which one tastes better and overall which one do I think gets me higher and which one is better so personally me I can already tell you like what I my opinion is because I have yet to try the diamonds and I haven't had any diamonds in a while so I can't like compare them too much but personally me rosin is especially 7/10 Percy rosin is absolutely smooth and there's 100% flavor in it every time every time sauce diamonds Sol's diamonds kill you and they have an extreme amount of like terpene flavor but the thing about diamonds is they sometimes either come like this with sauce and diamonds or sometimes they just come straight diamonds no sauce or sometimes you'll get lucky and find a few of diamonds and sauce but that's the thing about diamonds you never know if you're really gonna have any or not and your when you cop them and with this Percy you'll know you'll always have this good nice color this quality and this taste but enough of the talk was getting to the action hold on before we get into that just get a diamond now look at that bruh this is already a coup Deb alright let's get to it just let you guys know I don't really like the torch with a high flame I used to kinda lie I used to torture the really high flame but I realized I liked when I owned a reclined collector if you're the type who likes to you know who have a who owns one or a collector reclined just know that the less the less high your temp on your torches the better your refund will come out for you and will come out lighter and it won't taste like [ __ ] regardless if you think about at the end of the day when you're torching your nail your [ __ ] what where's the gas going you know what's going through your glass it's the gas is going through the glass so it's going it's gonna obviously it's gonna take effect on your reek line just a little tip you'll obtain just a little tip all right so we're about to take a dab of good diamonds I'm gonna make it you know what they're add another one step let me know in the comment section down below what form of wax you prefer batter Saturday rosin diamonds [ __ ] distillate whatever all right guys Cheers and good morning I cried not even gonna fret [Applause] oh my god look at me I'm done and that was just the first dab whoo Todd guys I'm high off my cheeks God so my thoughts on that oh [ __ ] nah but on some real [ __ ] though I'm [ __ ] loaded off my ass bruh I ain't no cat imma to like this I had diamonds in a long time and those were delicious no cat no cat that [ __ ] was fired like I'm gonna tell you like this when I was hitting it I only I had a diamond then and I had a little diamond I added at the end on top of it and when I threw it in there and it melted in my nail the [ __ ] bra so when diamonds are dipped in sauce it obviously are coated with sauce and even though it may not look like much but there's their sauce all dripping around them and it doesn't look like it when you have it on the pig but they're coated in sauce and that's just still burns too so it makes a fatter dab than on top of what the just the diamond that you did in you can't forget it's coated what sauce because they've been sitting there so when you get the [ __ ] dab when you get the diamond from your [ __ ] container it's gonna your pics gonna have a little sauce oil on it you know what I'm saying from trying to get those Diamond Brite tell me why when I took that dab both of them rocks were melting and to hell a more sauce and that [ __ ] was still sitting there and they just get both I am so late I'm so late but ok grating it I give it a good 8 in half 9 its flavor was great the way that she melted was [ __ ] amazing it was nice and light yellow it was perfect it was beautiful it was very smooth the reason I was coughing cuz I coughed all the time so like people are different but I enjoyed every bit of it they were pretty damn smooth they were good they were very good now let's get on to the Percy embargo Super Saiyan before I take this [ __ ] die because I needed charge my key and recuperate my energy I need to come back you know what I'm saying I'm about to charge my key and go super saiyan in this [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah as eaters Beaute is more important to food booth hey it's more important to water alright and there's this monstrous dab that's I swear to god sometimes this wax does not look right sometimes Tommy just doesn't look like another hard substance bro Jesus Christ anyway this is it now let's do this better damn you up [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah if any company would like to sponsor the kid feel free to hit the bigger your notes if they go now and get there [ __ ] me me up stop [ __ ] playing I would gladly smoke out your [ __ ] [ __ ] hear me I love to smoke and review your [ __ ] so go ahead and yeah you don't know if we're going on user alright Percy rosin sorry tangi watermelon skittles Cheers [Music] I Wow all right Mattel it is the saws diamonds were [ __ ] amazing there's no Catholic absolutely amazing it burnt great and you don't even need a lot because that [ __ ] just burns into even more when you melt a diamond but this is just insane why does your birds it's you in smokes I don't know I love it you just it could just be the fact that since rosin just comes pressed from hash board or weed now it just produces thicker smoke I don't know and I've really enjoyed this one way more I am so dead guys holy [ __ ] I can't even talk alright so if you want to ask me I'm literally high off my [ __ ] cheeks look at my [ __ ] eyes god I am lit and I'm enjoying every single second of it so if it's up to me the choice is obvious is it between the diamonds or the rosin drumroll please and the winner is the perceive rosin yes sir the reason I choose the rosin and bra the taste and smoothness of it is an undeniable it's like smoking an ugh maybe it's just the fact that you know it's pressed from hash or Roselyn itself is just respiratory and it just tastes so good but that's my that's my choice that's my opinion let me know what you guys think what do you guys like more do you guys like batter shatter sauce diamonds hash water hash what do you guys like honestly that should be my next one because I really like water hatch I enjoy it so much that I would have it's a tough decision between water hash and or hash rosin honestly I know it's another form but I love them both well let me know what you guys think links to all my other channels and other Co channels will be in the description down below you guys already know how to [ __ ] this [ __ ] works go [ __ ] it like comment subscribe hit the bell I'll see you guys next time please [Music]", "5FboBwdy_7k": "what up what up what is up guys this is the beer fridge by fogel and i use this to dry my hash you can see there's a few different stages here most of it's sieved up for the most part this top layer is all sieved up probably ready to press we'll wait till tomorrow down here this one needs to be sieved the second second shelf it could be sieve some more this one right here you can see there's still some chunks so this one really needs to be sieved a lot and then down here i think that one is the same same thing there's still some chunks all along the edges the middle is sieved well uh down here same as well so uh still has chunks to be sieved still has chunks still has some chunks pretty well sieved needs to get one more run through the sieve to make it look like this this one is sieved up and ready to go on the top now these trays were full like solid full trays of hash just uh scooped right out from the bags onto the parchment paper uh i use a stole this from the kitchen i use normal parchment i don't even use this parchment normally i use a cheaper parchment but uh i start off by pulling out a sheet and folding the corners and then i'll flip it over and have the parchment here this is where i'll scoop the hash onto and just get laid out as flat as possible i'll show you guys that method next time but once i get the hash laid out on here i'll bring it over to the bridge open her up slide her in and it stays in here for about three to four days it all depends you know you always want to go and check on it uh as it it will freeze first and like there'll be a little dry layer of hash on the top and you can go in here and use a spoon to kind of just gently scrape off that top dry layer and it will reveal reveal like a the wetter layer underneath you can also flip the patties too to get it dry sometimes i'll pull it out of here and stick it in the freezer for 30 minutes or so pull that out of the freezer give it a good sift and then separate like i have here separate the chunks that didn't break up and the sifted hash and then put it back in here to dry some more and before i had this i did the same kind technique with my fridge and freezer [Music] in the kitchen you know in the house a house fridge or freezer so that's where i started literally started out doing just paper plates [Music] started out by um making hash and putting on paper plates to dry and instantly the first time i did that i realized okay i can't just put this hash wet hash on a paper plate i need to have something some barrier so that's where parchment came in parchment paper plates um one paper plate facing normal with the parchment and the hash and then another paper plate upside down on top of it so it kind of creates a little dry environment and then i put that paper plate um somewhere dark and cool as cool as i could find that turned out to be the fridge why someone the smell wasn't um wanted in the house i got pizza boxes um just like this pizza boxes i live in southern california so i go to smart and final right here and they sell these bad boys um these are great see if that's just gonna fall down or not almost but yeah so i would just line this whole thing with parchment um scoop out the hash get it as flat as possible and then the same kind of tech i just break it up slowly i'll sieve it spread it out as much as i can and these things will just go right to the fridge stack up fridge or freezer i hope that helps you guys been really meaning and wanting to to share more of this technique um when i get a camera not a camera but when i get a uh a tripod i'll be doing some uh action shots you know you guys will see me doing some action working with the uh material shout out to sean flores guys artwork right here quick little story man i saw this uh piece of art on his page and i just loved it totally screamed me you know just washing making hash hustling grinding working and uh i bought um he had he sells prints and he sells you know the original canvas like really good work i bought two prints off him like normal size prints and he knows i was watching this and i like this but um i don't spend my money on dumb [ __ ] you know i don't spend my money on stuff that i want you know but i i really uh it was a small investment for the small prince but he gifted me this big print of the one i really wanted and i'll never forget it when you come across people like this like this is just like myself you know so this is to me this is the the universe throwing back all my good energy that i like to put out this is coming back to me so thanks sean you're the man let's go let's grow maybe well here we go guys fogle beer fridge hash dryer um you got the freeze dryer that is expensive couple thousand or you could do a beer fridge you know uh this thing you can get uh brand new i think it's like a thousand bucks maybe a thousand eight hundred bucks um way cheaper than the freeze dryer though you know and also once you graduate from the beer fridge and you do get a uh freeze dryer it's dual purpose throw some beers in there i see a lot of hashmakers like those uh heady beers those colorful cans and whatnot here you go so yeah uh not much else to say i [ __ ] hate talking because my nose is so stuffed up i'm sure you guys hate the way i sound but uh let's grow hash guys i got a lot of work to do all this [ __ ] is a material waiting to be washed keep my room as cold as possible because my freezers are my freezer is full very full full freezer overload full freezer ready to work i guess we'll slide into this uh a little uh sneak peek to the freeze dryer and the issue i'm having here the uh the hose sorry for the raw the raw footage too guys like i said i'll get a [ __ ] uh i will get a tripod soon but yeah so connecting here and then connecting to the pump you see how the pump has a flared uh compression fitting that's for these hoses so as you tighten it it compress it compresses and it seals up well the harvest ride doesn't have that connection up here so i ordered some parts you know but the threading was the wrong size this connects fine this connects but this part this threaded part is not good to the hose so i had to order a new part help from a buddy and uh yeah we'll get this thing going and we could wash up all this [ __ ] material fast i can't wash anything else right now because uh i got no room to dry it but it looks like we'll be doing some pressing soon guys so uh stay tuned i appreciate you guys let's grow this youtube channel let's grow that solve on this hash let's spread the love follow my instagram deal grows d-e-a-l-g-r-o-w-z um watch me grow just chasing my dreams man used to work a job used to be a hvac technician used to i knew i had this passion for hash for a very long time i just had to plan my escape from the nine to five as a lot of you guys are probably thinking and doing the same thing right now as well trying to plan your escape from your nine to five to follow your dreams well if i could be that example sure i needed that if i had someone else doing this i could i would equip my job probably a lot faster but you know trying new things it's uh it's scary it's risky but it's way worth it i'm super happy can't complain um so yeah if you're all about it follow me on instagram deal grows follow my youtube youtube videos here we're just getting started i promise the production will get better let's grow", "YsZa0UtdFGM": "what is up ladies and gentlemen we have some work to take care of here so we have a significant amount of yeah sure you can that is Scooby Snacks Black Label well Robin the press then before that we have to mechanical separations as you can see one of the butter drawers and separations here that we have are I'm anticipating collecting a very very nice terpene fraction and then isolating the rest of the TAC a the second one is all second breast junk we're going to get rid of all that [ __ ] and hang on to ourselves on this - yeah but for right now we have just a little bit of one-to-one aliens sourapple hurricane it's just dress it of course dry said not not library not or not live hash not fresh frozen very simply just a nice little salad rice dip that we're going to press to start off the day it's elliptical okay hopefully everybody can enjoy their view from that seat I'm going to go ahead and finish setting up here and we've started to see here if I can I'm gonna pull that over and begin to work with it almost right away just bring it a little bit closer whoo what an image stabilization be such a nice feature okay there's and gentlemen unfortunately because I use a cell phone as a camera it's very very very possible that we may be once you have angles at some point through this short little video and I'm going to do my best to keep it short after all I'm just going to do a little hash press and as I'm going the hash press so I'll kind of show you guys what I'm going why I'm doing it let you know right now I am setting my temperature controller I'm going to go ahead and set the top and bottom plates to the same temperature and that will be a hash press and I want to I want to be able to bring it out quickly I got wondering is certainly not too hot it's a lot warmer than that about 20 15 to 20 degrees warmer than I would normally press hash but this is just some directive very very wide or broad spectrum mixed micron if you will so I'm going to give it a little bit more heat and for the purposes of preserving a higher quality you know we are going to use to 15 micron bag we will actually not almost forget that expressed that we're going to use one 15 micron value and then we are going to house that 15 micron bag in a 25 micron and why are we doing that ladies and gentlemen strength right just that simple so without further ado let's get into right here I got a little spoon ready I got my hash we're nice and clean and gloved up and let's see is there anything that we're forgetting I did mention the camera died so the flash dies or whatever not laters and if the camera dies um won't just switch it plug it in the only reason I would have to move around a little bit is because I don't have a lot of charger but I did remember the one thing we need to do before we get started yeah finish off this big back ask dad I got a little bit left over from my most recent Instagram post let's just put in this morning and this morning I attempted to do make a big diamondback snake dad you know samus DHEA etc anyway I put a half a pound of sauce - vanish at her and point three at TSD a huge huge dad got it all together got it going and then this is I failed to fold first when I was dropping the day I'm into the nail I was hitting it too hard and I hold so much of it to the neck that was honestly you couldn't really see that that well on camera [Music] I wasn't hitting it from this angle it was more like this angle so anyway to check the camera see how bad it was okay I forgot to unpause the video sorry I didn't record it I had to make a whole nother snake pattern and shatter - green sauce 23 grams of ghta and so my waking baby a sentence I'd never I don't really do anymore but my waking Bay today or video a grand assure that it's coming in just maybe 3 or 4 percent higher 92 maybe 93 and then I saw with half a gram over happy I did the best I could be edited and make it watchable as I'm sure you can imagine it took a very very long time smoke that not hash and the video is like right around three minutes long so you know finally I'm finally starting to take a little bit cable over time and make usages and things like time lapse features and and and not being afraid I mean there's been a lot of [ __ ] like wait what I'm looking right now I wasn't planning my place for a break I would be packing this outer video and who knows maybe you will get hacked out a video before it was either way YouTube I miss you guys I have to put up any real processing content in a while we got a Robin press video they did really good a couple months ago so let's see how we do with a little video press was a match took some nice big fat dad's an ass as you can see from the quality it is very very nice if you can really tell through the bag maybe you don't press a lot of rosy for dry sift very very yeah so I should mention if you're asking yourself or about 2.6 grams of oils in the first day how do you hold but yeah I just walked out it was it's not what I don't normally smoke in the morning anyway I would rather get I enjoyed the hi little more when I put it off for as long as possible and then of course I than that [Music] we're about twice this bag we're gonna go ahead and flatten it out a little bit a little bit of Liberty there it should not break our 15 micron bag inside of it what I what I'm saying is that I didn't pack this down as far as it could go I actually spread it out a little bit now I'm going to be careful to one of my scenes up this is my housing bag or support Thank You mrs. oh look at that paper anything smashed into eggs and it's great to Robyn all right since we're only gonna do a single press thank you know I like to make media moment watchable YouTube videos let me just make sure that my hands are on camera ok so I have my browsing data right here now when it's in the fat when it's in the press it will actually be like this but whatever this is the scenes nice and it seems a good indicator for how wide it needs to be so I like to leave between and eight to three eighths you could just say a quarter of an inch but I'm not a [ __ ] mover so it's not always that but anyway I'm going to the quarter mesh on each side and then fold it and then you fold it just pull it back on itself literally it so we're going to do that same thing to the other side go ahead and get it [Music] we working a little bit of room but the pecker matters are just going to flatten out so the idea is to make it flatten out and being able to work within the space that you have created here without you know breaking through the parchment or anything like that you know you don't want to pull it so tight fit I mean your thinking your mind if you if you bring in these brothers or these sides so far up you can just direct all around and forward and you can just hit such a cool shot yeah TV not really unfortunately if you do it too close you're just going to expand through to the size of your Robin Robin paper or parchment paper and another one that I mean missing some schisms that's how you say that right pretty sure [Music] now I am seeing about how much of the parchment paper my bags when they take up on there and then I'm going to go ahead and make some doing it cuts that number one make sure that I don't have to just barely sit my if you cut it right at the edge of the bag you're going to barely be able to sit your parchment inside your plates neck sensor so you need to to be able to put it back under place if you have a proper if you have a nice big size press if you have a smaller personal press then you may be you know you may want to cut it nice and tight so that you can utilize those the plate it's basically that before this again is my upgraded browsin New York for wrong the brush New York I mean 25,000 breasts big bad bad ass over here you can't see it with the stand alone pump it operates the age obviously is a pressure gauge that gives me an idea let me you know that's me very very systematic to step up and know exactly where I am pressing sometimes we're not pressing very much so we're not going to have that all night for more than five now this is where it takes kind of easy things some people choose to do their origami differently yes I call it origami at this point is really in my do you like it we can oppress the modeling or we were sitting on for part of my favorite of all but the whole reason for this I'll show you is because I'm going with you and this will this if and we'll see if it should be a well and if this crust should actually in sweet this will provide for something for you look at something nice for you and then put together think about pretty far there on my extra space with absolutely will see it might not you might not be very much at all you know see the way that's not really what's important at all my flash ladies have the garage so suck it just barely administered pressure just up and again this is just a very small personal hash-table impressed did not waver he's the 15 micron back and the 25 micron back to house it aside and that we did a directional pole so that hopefully any yoga we get will come out now that we've given it 30 seconds to heat it's not that hard of a patty I can also tell from my gauge that the patty inside of it [Music] [Music] you never really get anything good on these bras impress New York bras impressive I don't understand you know we're just a total ripoff what the [ __ ] ever what's this [ __ ] [Music] so what's that for me yeah and for the record I can only utilizing one to fix one day I had in my exposing and I'm such a low temperature as you can see it's buckling and layering on top of itself again so it looks like the alien sour apple times slur Canyon is that squish it she's a squirter that's so [ __ ] inappropriate you're just trying to maintain one ton of pressure that's all I'm doing I'm not even increasing just maining ones name's Danny one time we've only gone two minutes in progress right now and considering we are over to continue our press now I'm going to go ahead and like a PSI trusting and I've had enough displacement now it won't oh yeah Wow this place it's displacing so quickly Wow it's making these huge if this if I was pressing at a higher temperature it would run run run run run in yeah then you guys would be like oh wow but just to hear but I can barely maintain suit under the brush there just key every time I get up to two times it's the needle just because of the hash forcing you know just flying out a bag anyway we are almost we're just past three minutes into the press so I'm going to go ahead and see if I can approach Richman's 6000 psi on the clock or on the jacket you know we could figure out the platelet pressure by doing just a little bit of quick math with the area of the actual bag that were pressing then then of course using that as a vector against our four by seven plates the math is not that complex but I can't maintain fresh 3p a 2000 psi or right 6000 psi three times but we are four minutes in and I feel like I'm starting to see some discoloration so let's go ahead and call it I call it I'm going to get one quick ring out [Music] geez that didn't you about all I can tell from the field of the bag on the way now this is gonna be able total waste of time I don't know I don't know how well sarcasm gets through the queue but either way you know what Preston in New York rosin press tools that we have no spoon this is my collection of late that I of course keep in my freedom you can use your hand which is silly lots better to use you know anything else in any person to be honest with you sometimes I just like to sit for a second or two but just let it sit for a second or two and they just do this to be just to show the bottom and some low tariffs and then after that we just sandwich it because obviously that's going to force everything to maintain nice and cool that should be a little better and a lot but working with here but surviving at that country we open up our little present which I have archived frozen is shattering out love already oh that's hilarious so I like using those things man the place the collection would and yes this clearly looks like it has a nice second press left in it so we'll see it can either become one of those turds like I showed you at the beginning of the video or it may become coconut oil either way this Robin looks pretty good I'm not sweeper pump on the on you know this being its first press quality so we'll get a look at it after we get it together here it's of course all of it butters immediately almost there's some of it that's maintaining its fresh press consistency it is very very terrific [ __ ] reach you may remember I said at the beginning of the video and I think I even mentioned again this is one part sour apple or alien sour apple and the other parts lurking so call it what you I call it alien sour apple times work this just wonderful it's each of those strains or you know buzz and trend from each of those strings very very gently drive shifted at a nice low temp remain or bottoming these buzz a little more surgical all right you do look a little modernization twist up a little bit ah maybe we walk into that bucket I look pretty fire actually falling off camera there excuse you guys look at it good bad not bad so with that ladies and gentlemen I'd like you to say hello to the newest upgrade in the 710 extraction is arsenal my rosin fresh New York 20-ton rosin dress and yes I did get twin 20-ton presses so the next thing you get to see for me is a video on proper assembly and troubleshooting of 2010 because I'm going to set up my second one using this was a point of reference and then after that look out for maintaining your tent on rosin Press New York rosin breasts I have a new jack that I'm gonna swap out on that so we're gonna go ahead and document both of those processes and share them with all of you I hope you enjoy and I also hoped you enjoyed helping and watching you make that little bubble rosin right

Somali eh I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis reviews today because of legalization 2.0 the new product categories I'm finally able to bring you a legally distributed extract now it's not the extract or the quality that you may have seen on the channel two years ago or any of the hash rosen's that I've had recently gifted to me by friends but at least it is an extract in the legal market it's something that I can purchase to really ramp things up and it's starting to feel more like the legacy market of purchasing cannabis in the dispensary now that we have these products so what did I get today we have BC Keef and this BC Keith is coming to us from can of farms I didn't look where canif arms is but I have a feeling it's not in BC but it might be that was a good ramble needless to say I don't know but it's called BC Keith and you can see it there maybe if it'll focus no I got another video there we go BC Keith can of farms you can read everything going on there see our duty steel still on perfect I picked this up yesterday for the low low price of twenty seven dollars for one gram of Keith CR twenty seven dollars maybe twenty seven bucks the green easy there are four hundred twenty one forty two point one milligrams of THC and total THC is three hundred thirty two milligrams so that'll be interesting to just see how much contaminant is in here with that note ice with an extra six hundred milligrams of something in there that's not THC and no CBD we can only assume that it is a plant matter but who knows this is the equivalent of it says content equivalent of four grams of carrying cannabis so that's interesting our Keef packaged on 2019 11:27 today is March the fourth start a cool cool dry place camp section and what's our warning adolescents are at a greater risk neo daily used for long period of time can harm brain development well I'm doing pretty good but if you're under the age of 18 click out of this video now cuz you're not even supposed to be here so there we go there is our beautiful product we have our seal Duty seal here and let's just crack right in shall we try on the new two camera so that we get a little bit closer of a view when we open up these products and now you can see our nicely set jar if I can get it out with a false bottom in the package let's check that out so just to have some more shelf space or something I don't actually know why you would need to do that but that's okay we'll see things in the future changing so here is our package and you know I wouldn't have been upset actually just getting this with all the information off the shelf but there's no branding on it and there's an apparent smell of cannabis coming off of it so there we go the nice blue glass oh yeah the blue glass yuan jar so that's a that's a nice perk for sure here we go and do we have a different warning frequent to prolong cannabis containing tea if she can contribute to mental health problems over time BC chief I don't know what where DC or why they call it BC chief but it's obviously not strand-specific and again packed Sean 11:27 pretty cool let's open it up shall we our first legal extract and our first legal extract has a nice jar with a child seal on it so of course there we go and that is the first look of our BC Keef there it is you can see I've got the nice close-up video now though recommended by a YouTube follower thank you so much for your recommendation so it is a little green it's uh it's looking like a pre you know it's um it's a it's a pretty rough tumble without a doubt I don't think it's um just take through it a little bit here okay so it's clumped up it does still have a little bit of moisture going on in it let's see how it smells it smells a little green to be very honest with you it's a little over tumbled I didn't expect like the most amazing Keefe hash whatever for those of you that don't know the word Keith Keefe is usually the sifted hash the that forms in the bottom of your grinder has been the slang term that I've always used for Keef but it's just a jet\u00e9 today anibus usually found in the bottom chamber of your grinder I'm wondering if there's even in this one just to show a contrast of what grinder Keith yes there is so that's my grinder Keith just a little bit this is probably really old and then that's the color of this so it is pretty close without a doubt I can't say anything about that so it smells a little green has like some really big woodsy aromas that I would relate to lemongrass sandalwood maybe a little bit of pine some fresh downed trees I'm gonna put a little bit of my fingers actually and squish it and just see if we can get anything going here that's what it looks like all my fingers and let's see if I can just smell it better mmm smells like very handsome Cologne sandalwood musk earthy musky a little bit of a citrus definitely is gonna taste good like as I smell it and I smell a cannabis aromas smells good my fingers are a little bit sticky after rubbing it but nothing crazy so I figured out you would use two ways to kind of evaluate this sample just because it is straight Keith I didn't know exactly what I should do I've always used my vaporizer it's not a dabble product by any means there is contaminant and particulate in it so I'm thinking that I will do a puff of the volcano vaporizer and then I have this bong that I got in grade 11 that I cleaned up and I thought I'd have a puff out of that too for you since uh since we're playing that game so let's just have a load up on our volcano here I have a new camera facing down so that I can show you all of the unboxings a little bit closer as opposed to holding it up so that is what I'm doing down there Sears our volcano bowl and I'm going to put a good load of the Keef in there we go spread it out so it's nice and flat I'm not in these balls so that we don't get any of that nonsense there we go maybe a little more for just for good luck we are doing a a review so there we go and I didn't wait this one either mainly because I just don't know how we're going to weigh it it was a pretty full jar of light Akif so I'm hoping that they didn't rip me off but what have we found with our legal cannabis reviews in the past that well 70% of them have been short so you know I could see that happening with my Keef but I'm writing tickets about so let's load this up air and while that happens there I'm gonna load my bowl up still have a messy but that's okay well two things at once two things at once there we go all right smells good in the air smells very cannabis e very woodsy I didn't get much but what I did get really tastes like how it smells musky lemony very much like Cologne that would have been worn in the 1990s I'm gonna let it sit on there for a sec just a little that Keefe warm up and I'm going to go back to back in this bowl of Keefe up because we're gonna take one one big friggin rip a dip of this I believe here we go that's that and now my ball should be warmed up [Music] do you like Keith I always love it as a supercharger it's really nice when you open up the bottom of your grinder and you find those dunes again I'm happy that these products are on market and for $27 I can say I'm oh you know I'm not upset right now with my purchase this time I let the hash warm up in the bowl sitting on top of the heating unit and it is quite tasty it all tastes the same every time I do musky sandalwood II delicious so it's yeah pretty good well let's have our bong rip and then give you our final notes and my final goodbye I've got this big-ass bowl of hash Keef pack BC Keith from kin of farms let's roll back little it's definitely fair to say I've had a bong rip in a long time okay it was good it definitely didn't suck so here we go let's do the rundown on appearance it's definitely not the best key hash anything that I have ever seen by any means but it looks nice it looks like blond hash from high school so there's that as far as appearance goes I'm going to give it a the jar they put it in is really nice and they'll end up and the childproof lid was slick so let's give it and this is for what is being Keefe I'm gonna give it 17 points 17 points for the appearance on the nose it wasn't jumping out but it definitely still smells like what it tasted like the nose knows that my nose said you should definitely smoke this for the nose I'd like to give it 32 points it could be bigger it could be better but it's definitely not lacking or upsetting me it's not jumping out but it does have these nice woodsy musky somewhat citrusy aroma for the taste I thought the taste match the palate really well again it wasn't huge it wasn't explosive in my mouth it wasn't like oh my god this is the best hash Keef whatever I've ever tried didn't taste bad in the bong definitely tasted better in the vaporizer so for taste let's give it a solid you know this is falling with the nose too right if the nose was bigger than the taste would have been bigger I'm gonna want to call it 15 points for the taste not bad not amazing that's 75% and then my overall impression based on my experience with cannabis based on my experience with the legal market all of these things coming into play you know what I don't mind this product it's definitely an addition to a joint or something that you'd like to buy to add into your basket to really ramp everything up so as far as that goes I'm gonna give it 17 points and there you go that's the score on our can of farms BC Keef pretty good for especially for $27 so well let's add up the points right here duh how many points is that 27 bucks a gram Keith definitely not the worst thing to purchase in the recreational market as these things become available this is the very first extract I've seen that's why I purchased it I guess I guess I'm pleasantly surprised it's probably it's it's in the 80s for sure it might be high 70s but it's in the 80s so it's it's it's not bad I'm not completely upset there you go thank you so much for watching if you tried any extracts let me know down in the comments I'm really looking forward to having more extracts come on to market but it's exciting to see this happening please make sure to LIKE comment share and subscribe and I'll see you soon Cheers what's my name what's my name the

grief like this that's really weird hmm well I know this is a little boring guys I'm just touching some stuff I'll get it go I'll get it figured out here in just a moment I'm gonna get rid of that old video I don't know what happened I don't know what's going on here today YouTube has been giving me nothing but frickin grief that's all I know for sure grief processing that one there that was the old one delete that and I'm back here and I guess I am live I don't know what the heck is going on folks it wasn't giving me notifications I just I don't know why it's not giving me notifications that I've gone live anyway I am live as you can see anybody that's here other people are just gonna get this after the fact I'm sorry it's been a bit of a slow start here I don't know what else I can really do I'm gonna play some some little hip hop there and I'm gonna be pressing some hash press today we got some good stuff here I'm actually pretty excited I've got a pretty fancy little setup going on here today and I think it's kind of cool I've got multiple cameras so check this out right here is some really really heavy-duty rosin man or heavy-duty I'm sorry it's not rosin yeah it's gonna be raw but I can't even talk man it's been a pretty long day today anyway there ya go some really nice dry sift it's what's going on here I think I just need to have a puff for a second hold on let me change back to camera regular camera tree let's just let's take a break I've been honestly sitting here for about three hours trying to set this all up and my cameras weren't working and then ambulances were going by it's okay it's gonna gonna have a DAB and relax for a second that's what I'm so how y'all be doing tonight say hello and chat let me know that you're here I am gonna be doing some rosin pressing and just a moment here I'm gonna press all six grams all at once all at once in one little press bag I got some I got a nice uh it's only a ninety micron bag it's not really my first choice but it's gonna have to do but buddy left this here this is some friggin wonderful he'll show me the on the press cam actually there you go what's up in the corner there but it's some wonderful wonderful ishka berry there we go I feel better now oh man okay now I was gonna switch over to the other camera here so let's get over here and do this there we go so here's my plan I've got this big old wad of dry set today we we hooked this up with bubble bags it had a little bit of moisturizer moisture because we used dry ice but I've been sitting it I sipped it through a nice sieve and got it nice and nice and loose and then kind of like air drying it all day so it's okay it's a little bit green turn that down a little bit there we go it's a little bit that should be better for the microphone sorry about that guys mmm it's definitely a little bit green we shook the [ __ ] a heck bag and we probably should have used a tighter micron bag so it's gonna be dark I've already squished some of this today and I know for a fact that this is quite quite dark and that's okay because it tastes like the fire of all hell in a good way if the fire a palate in taste goes anyways so what I'm gonna do here is try not to get these strings in the first line we go but I'm gonna just hook this up like that and then we're gonna stuff all of this into this bag like so most of it anyway when I get every last crumb of it but yeah course this freakin plastic sheet they give you they give you this with the bags this is terrible look at this thing it's just a fricken it's all static you just sucks ha ha ha that's freakin funny hey JB how you doing how you doing yeah uh I'll pull back the other camera there for a second how you doing are you doing so yeah there we go there we go quite a nice pouch full like a half a pouch full this is gonna be pretty nice but you're nice here I'm gonna put back to the other camera so you can see it I'm doing here a bit better use the surface for the moment but it's what I'm gonna kind of do is I feel like I should kind of do that trick where they stuff it inside the bag here but I don't know man last time I did that it all came flying out that's what I want to do but I think I'm not gonna I think I'm just gonna press it like this we're gonna do a little bit of pre press last time I did the fold envelope trick I put it in on itself and it it just didn't work man I don't know what is going on why nobody got no notifications that I'm live something's going on with my with my live streams here anyway there you go there's a pretty good little free press just like that man that's gonna put that right on top of there for a moment and then I'm gonna put this aside and I'm gonna start crapping myself some some parchment oh no I've done hit my parchment paper on myself I found it I found it here we go here we go here I'm gonna pull out the other camera for a minute I got a complaint to make check this out this is parchment paper you know what parchment paper doesn't have really pisses me off a good frickin edge you don't know it like if you use your counter man or scissors or something I'm just using a ruler to be honest but it doesn't that the cardboard on it sucks and you need to use this man and I think it's kind of wonky that that I have to use a frickin a foreign object when in this day and age of technology you know what I'm saying that should just frickin work you have a nice frickin cutter right on the damn thing every freaking roll of saran wrap and history does you know yes we know most of the nuke okay so I'm gonna go back to the other camera here I'm gonna do sort of a double pouch setup and I'm going to leave a bit more hanging out the one side just because it's gonna be it's gonna be a juicy one for sure guys I'm gonna fold this in about 50% on both sides there's no right or wrong way to do this man I don't know what Creek and I've only been doing it for a couple of weeks I've watched a lot of people do it I don't I just you know I used to do this at the paper lounge I used to work at a bait bolon cannabis lambs that is [Music] and there this is what I do it in right as I grab the mostly good anyway a little bit of a bad rip there but it's not really about those little pieces right there I don't know how well you can see that but it's basically just a fold fold in like that and then gonna run a little bit of a directional on this bottom part just to make sure and that being said I want a little bit of hello hello welcome where did I get the dry ice in Canada at African ice water stores men for real uh like in any water store just ask them they've got dry ice man absolutely they'll sell you a frickin $10 chunk man that's always just a like we got even five bucks I don't remember my buddy bought it you know back to the camera but yeah it's a it's no big deal man I didn't know it was a hard thing to find I just went down to the store and we bought it got some onion rings while we're waiting anyway turn that camera now this one here was more this is just here to be an insulator it's not about this this paper at all so I'm gonna put this up top here for now it's all about this little pouch I just made anyway one last one last shot of the pouch here what's going on I stuffed all six grams right into here let me see here I never looked just assumed I just got the liquid nitrogen I don't know what grocery stores having it but I can guarantee that ice and water stores do for sure so is what I'm gonna do is because of this fold I'm going to push the fold to the back and hope that hope that I can kind of push it out the front I don't know man we can only hope with this stuff I'll get a better view in a second here yeah I just want to get a tight in the right position okay how does that look looks like crap with this piece of paper in the way oh you know what I didn't do they turn my freaking press on oh my god I'm like why is my fingers it's not burning my fingers is it possible to press Keef without a screen I'm gonna say no I really Ament probably no I'm gonna I'm gonna say you can't like buds hold together Keef is just his dry sift man it'll just go out I'm gonna say that you kind of can't you could probably DIY yourself a screen perhaps but yeah I don't I don't think you'd get very much or get very far or anything any good without a proper but a proper like micron bag or something you know anyway let's just let that sit there for a second and have a fricken puff I gotta let that [ __ ] warm up I forgot I'll pay attention to chat here uh coffee filters like maybe coffee filters are really weak you gotta understand that's the difference like silkscreen silkscreen would be better than coffee filters I mean yeah I'd say coffee filters would blow out man I I really wouldn't I mean honestly I like a tea you probably get better out of a freaking t-shirt cloth than you would on a coffee a coffee thing man for sure alright what do I got kicking around here there we go I got a little bit of the there's the camera yeah it's darkness that was like some cleanup from earlier it's rosin but it's dark as darkness can be but that rosin behind me sitting there just kind of warm enough man what are the pleats at 1:30 in climbing they got they got a minute or something to go it's not a bad idea to let the hash warm up anyway this is a good nice nice slow progressive way to let the hash warm up teabag you're getting closer yeah like I feel like you're trying everything under the Sun except silkscreens you know what I mean silk screens of the key get them they're cheap like rip for real man you can order them on Amazon dirt cheap you can get them lots of places you don't have to use rosin bag silk screens work and I think I just talked this thing to cold so I'm gonna give it a heat Ryan The Stoned Canadian Gaming welcome wait a minute I've been just talking to you derp I just realized what your name said that's all I guess I'm stoned too I had actually considered starting this speaking of gaming I'd considered starting this with my VR headset on and being like whoa where am I that's like a gag or something I don't know so I'm a gamer too and I'm Canadian Anna stoner so welcome you're in good company I don't have a whole lot of experience pressing either um oh I want another one of those that was really good where the temperatures that it's not even there yet we're good um as I said I used to work in a vapor lounge in a cannabis lounge and we had an in-house press and I used to help people press so I have some experience but not a whole bunch oh man don't sweat it I had a um I used the girl I almost broke the girlfriend's hair straightener trying to freaking try to press some rosin she didn't like that too much hey oh man this stuff's harsh but I want one more Oh mark oh there's the camera Oh mmm be responsible know your limit dab within it over 19 or 21 or wherever the [ __ ] you livery teener yadda yadda yadda you know the drill don't be a child if you're a child [ __ ] take a hike get out of here this is for this is an adult stream I should actually start aged restricting my my streams I think I'm gonna do that maybe that's why it's not sending out notifications maybe I need to age restrict this [ __ ] a waffle iron dude that's awesome please for the love of the love of glob take a picture of that and tag me on Instagram with that one please that sounds hilarious I'd like to see that ha oh right wait a second hold on I got a thing for this or did I delete it oh I frickin deleted it won't want I had some special effects lined up here guys I don't know where they all are no that didn't work yeah all my special effects are like stashed right now but I had special effects I can improve this so and I'm gonna anyway we're at temperature here so let's uh let's go up the plates are there I want that back behind that plate enough already so probably right around there [Music] yeah I'm not gonna go to get that pop-up too well but no yeah that looks good yes it does all right I think here we go huh that one side is pushing just a little I'm use this ruler to stuff it back [Music] [Music] okay there we go that's good okay let's hope for a frickin waterfall here folks let's hope we get something something beautiful [Music] [Applause] [Applause] here comes I'm also running it at only 180 so I got to be a little bit careful here I didn't want to go to too hot the last couple presses were a little on the dark side and I was thinking maybe maybe if I went a little I was reading if you go a little lower a little longer is better when it comes to the hash pressing or the dry sifter or whatever raise that here we go yeah let's go good now if it's not boozing forward like this it's gonna be all behind it it's gonna be a big puddle behind I'm sure I definitely am catching everything that's okay at the at the when I press this at the end I'm gonna fold it over and press it again and you will be blown away at how much I get out the second time yeah I do not have a Twitter account for for old can of beard grows yet I've only got the Instagram thing I think I think YouTube needs to step up their game a little bit I think that's what's going on bubble go in there ha ha unfortunately I can't zoom that camera this one camera it's a pretty good resolution at least I think it is here's what I can do I can access my press camera unlock it and I can make the press camera bigger like like up to there how about that that's the best I can do unfortunately for some weird reason that cheap-ass camera cheaped out a little bit and bought a cheap camera but that one won't it's nice but it won't it won't zoom there's no zooming or panning at all it's it's where it is man you can kind of do some digital zoom you [ __ ] like that kind of but that's it a smidge more pressure yeah I'm gonna give it a nut I was hoping for a little bit better of a push forward on this you forgot your password on Instagram I can't help you with that my friend I'm sorry I think I'm gonna have one of these while I'm waiting do a little medicating as it were I'll be honest I I kind of like that I can get high on camera cuz getting on camera is a little bit of [ __ ] anxiety man how do you [ __ ] like there's only about four or five of you guys watching right now which is weird because it didn't post any frickin notifications I don't know what's going on let's regard that's beside the point but the point is I get a bit of anxiety when I get physically on camera like this and this [ __ ] helps me only if we get all [ __ ] dab it up and and relax right well I used to help host dab competitions I was like a dab tender speaking of which I think I'm gonna freakin crack this bad boy I used to be a dab tender at this fake lounge thing and yeah so it was uh I got a good sort of being a host in entertaining and stuff and I have another job along before that I don't want to get into that it's too much of my personal life but mm-hmm I've had other jobs that there we go I'm gonna change cameras here guys other jobs that basically trained me in the fine arts of sort of people talking oh yeah see look I told you it all went out the [ __ ] back look at this where the line was look at that two little drops that's all that came out where we can see well look at this getting ready for this peel back man it's gonna be like hold put it in a frickin grilled cheese sandwich oh yeah there we go right let me see yeah I don't know if I can I might be able to zoom on that one let me see if I can zoom on this camera that's camera two I'm pretty sure I can let's check this out guys let's try it I have all the control at my fingertips wah wah wah wah wah wah kinda not the best resolution but there you go this camera this is my old camera it kind of sucks I'm sorry this is sort of like an action camera wha-wha-wha walks okay anyway I'm gonna go back to where it where it should be on good adds up and back out of that anyway I got a good way to deal with this first thing we're gonna do is get this [ __ ] Oh sticky icky popped out of there I'm definitely gonna press this don't get me wrong I'm dealing with open that up a little bit more this way but I was wrong last time but we'll see we'll see I'll clean this up in a second here once I get a bit of pressure on it this bar is a pump where it's it [Music] okay see if we get something a little more visual for you guys this time oh god I got to what to [ __ ] in my way I can't see if I'm freaking doing this right hold on a second let me get this out of here cancel oh yeah that looks good [Music] here show you the other action camera action touchiered the pressing action huh we'll just leave it for a minute anyway that's actually a point right here wow this thing's the money I got I got this thing at a thrift store for like two bucks it's a nice nice chunk African marble it's got some wet on though hey that ice pack on it for a while there we go oh yeah he's cold she's cold but that's how we're gonna clean that off clean that off what strain is this this is actually the blue nightmare that I'm growing in my closet right now you're gonna have to check my last live stream from earlier today to see that I can't move this hello welcome welcome there med to Ontario welcome welcome um keep going remove them jerks yeah it's gonna be a little cleaner but here's the thing okay we used a hundred or no 220 micron bag with dry ice and we shook the [ __ ] bloody hell out of that bag man we that fricking weed was like dust at the end so this [ __ ] was greener than it should have been but we wanted sort of a good full spectrum medication and that's what this is man it's delicious but it's uh it's a bit on the green side man for sure but that was kind of intentional collected real nice though the cameras got some freaking darkness the darkness just commenting on the on the close-up camera oh the chips perform I'm gonna be careful with those big chunks when it's so cold man they come flying off sometimes look slow through those big blobs or at least maybe it's the thin blobs that yeah it's the thin blobs that frickin go flying just be careful with this [ __ ] man I hate it when I go chips and goes flying which it does happen here we go I'm gonna pull that up and there how's that one not far the ladies probably off there we go dark luckily I mean realistically like if I had better bags I would I could squish this again and start turning this into like ultra concentration like almost an isolation but like I don't I don't have anything better that was my last 90 micron bag all I got is some 160 bags and that won't do [ __ ] there we go also I'm gonna release this to so much in there still oh I could have pressed it way harder frig you guys see that it's all frickin yeah Wow whatever man I could just go into my [ __ ] my chip jar definitely some I watched a bunch of get sucked back into it I love you guys seen that but it was like and it sucked some back up there [Music] there we go see look at that my I gotta fix my filter a little bit cuz I don't care if people swear a little bit maybe if I just change up the III I think I'm gonna like spell shitty and my filter a few times well I guess that's what I get mod of mod chat mods for it eventually but anyway here's what we've got so far and let me get this uh you get this chunk out of the put this aside here in a better spot I stopped pressing that again it's just gonna get darker and darker even though it's sucked some of this back up into it which is pretty unfortunate but I'm just getting it a bit cold here the plates still pretty darn cold I'm gonna come back to this side here hey be careful around these cracks there yeah I don't know if I'm gonna bother pressing mints again a third time I'm like like I said I might just throw it into my my jar there I'll show you what I'm talking about in a second here if you guys do this you need to start a frickin a chip board they call it chip jar here we go all the different little big top ones are the top square ones are rosin and all the round ones are weed but you can you can use I like isopropyl or frickin ether moonshine or whatever the [ __ ] you want sort of Everclear whatever floats your [ __ ] fancy to make some like topicals or shitty oil or I don't recommend smoking it really only wouldn't be very good I'm not compared to the fire that your friction collected prior but you can make it it's good for edibles you can make like little even film gel caps with the shitty oil you make out of those out of those chips this that's not bad at all [Applause] okay okay now let's like like I said this was it was it was maybe even slightly misleading it was 6 grams but it was 6 grams with a lot of perfect green in it so just put that up in there for a second left that let that get warm so I can kind of squish it down a little bit and then we'll uh we'll see cold press yeah yeah well we we and like I said we kind of intentionally got a bit a bit green on this batch okay so this is how I'm gonna do this I'm going to make a fairly equivalent pouch and then tear it off my scale right there I'm not a that's pretty equal where's my scale doesn't look like [ __ ] for you guys well let's see if I do that can you see it now okay yeah I got cherry you okay no you're just gonna have to trust me guys it's not the angle is not right with here Jarrett okay zero not a very good red dirt um a gram and a half like labels 1.4 not freaking amazing you've got a frickin squish this pouch a little better this Pope has no love I'm gonna turn my press up turn it up above 15 degrees how about that [ __ ] I'm gonna turn the press up on books 15 degrees and then we're gonna press it one more time one more time I feel like it's really [ __ ] heavy and sticky maybe I'll just I'll keep this one maybe I won't mix this one in I might keep it separate there we go again stupid using a stupid ruler to fix the fact that these stupid [ __ ] Oh I'm also trying to like hold it up in midair so you guys can all see it that doesn't make life easier all right what about the camera the way I mean it doesn't quite fit but we'll just sort of find a middle point and call it a day I'm gonna do a quick quick fold like this [Music] okay I'm just gonna keep it kind of in that same position [Music] Oh put it back there we go the one on the top there right see if there's more love in there to give I knew it that cookin there we go there we go told you there was more more love to give oh I wanna drink I got to figure out a little bit better of uh use of all this up here I kind of want to put chat or something up there but it was proven hard to read last time maybe if I play with like font sizing and transparency I can make it I don't know we'll figure something out I will improve this method as it goes [Music] we're probably not gonna get a massive waterfall but I'm gonna let that sit for a quick minute and you know what I realized though had a dab of this yet like I had one earlier earlier but not since uh not what I just pressed I haven't so let's have a little tasty taste shall we I have other things that's just I have the email ox honestly turned off because I have cords draped kind of too close to it and it's too party here for freaking many other pipes right now I I squished what I had I had six grams of that extract of the the kief there the dry safe chief whatever you want to call it where is this stuff it's dark man is it friggin tasty now again for anybody tuning in I'll tell you why it's so dark because we used a big micron bag and beat the living crap out of the frickin bag like it over us money and got a lot of green out of it to get a real full spectrum like bulk med yum yum we thought about it honestly we were gonna use like a middle micron oho a middle micron bag and be a little more gentle [ __ ] it let's just go to town wowser oh man oh man hash bushes yummy this was gonna be a bit dark for sure nope the new phone sucks I'm taking it back the new phone today overheated in the garden in a 20-minute livestream what is this 50 minutes this is my computer this is my desk this is my office area my grow room is on the other side of the house I can't reach the frickin place with this camera unfortunately but that the new phone I got I hate it it's awful okay hey I'm gonna switch the camera back this multi-camera thing is [ __ ] cool guys I don't know what do you guys think of this man this okay this camera right here is my old camera it's technically a total piece of crap I have one camera that's even worse than this one and I'm not gonna use that one because it's a real hunk of [ __ ] this camera right here the squish camera is a new camera that I bought that I cheaped out on I should have bought a better camera and and that brings me to this camera right here that's the one this is a nice camera this is the [ __ ] money I could go for K you don't want to see me in 4k 1080p is [ __ ] polanyi trance haven't seen me dab on YouTube you haven't you haven't seen me dab on YouTube before I hope did you just catch me or do you did did you just miss me is that what's going on I mean I can have another down it's not the end of the world I think I will probably make this [ __ ] delicious I mean I was I'll be honest I was [ __ ] terrified to in Hawaii cannabis physically on YouTube and have my face I know like I match my where's my logo it's over here my logo and me I'm I'm [ __ ] pretty good but smoking physically smoking pot on camera feels weird but you know what I'm [ __ ] licensed a medically [ __ ] licensed so [ __ ] you

want that works pretty good dude with these what can move you get a chunk of marble slab or a chunk of metal and just keep that [ __ ] in the freezer you see if I can get something oh I'm gonna focus not at all not even a little bit hello this one pretty dark man dark dark dark okay I think I need to do a dab of the darkness to finish it off before I go I'll do a big [ __ ] dab to this okay all right how hot did I press I pressed it to temperatures today to temperatures today first one was at 180 second press was 195 to get this blackness out to really push it out of the frickin thing this was the first one we got a little over a gram and a half altogether out of six grams of like pretty [ __ ] green Keith it was not gold if it was gold I would have been using better micron bags and it would have [ __ ] turned I would've gotten out way better yield out of it yeah it's okay honestly we took some really really really shitty scraggly weed that was [ __ ] all the trichomes and is this live yes it is live we took this scraggly weed that was really full of trichomes my buddy grew it and we like I said we just shook the freakin bloody hell out of it like it owes money in a freaking bag full of dry ice and we got this nice green powder as you seen probably in the thumbnail I got a good video of the big super pile it was like this [ __ ] big I'll post that on my Instagram at some point probably tomorrow anyway as I said I'm gonna where's the [ __ ] camera there we go this is the back [ __ ] triple press I'm gonna take a big old dab of this and I'm gonna do it off of a pretty big freaking pipe because that's why not why not find one where is it oh it's missing the frickin bloody oh I see it though okay we're okay I was gonna say it's missing the frickin part the freaking money part but if you bear with my close-up of something shoulder maybe side of my face there we go it was on another [ __ ] piece way over there okay so this is gonna be the I wish YouTube wasn't so [ __ ] [ __ ] about music because then we could play like the final the final countdown but do the final dab down you know what I might even look see if I can find a MIDI royalty-free copy and then we can do that anyway what I'm saying or am I just blowing smoke I don't know probably I could be pretty fried at this point we're gonna leaven 30 what part of the country are all of you from that are

that wash was 789 grams in and then i got 122 grams of full spec hash from that yeah usually most places around here that carry like this quality of stuff it's usually 80 to 100 gram depending on where and that's in southern california just that's the typical range but honestly it's hard to find stuff of this quality in shops stuff like this usually stays his head stashed it doesn't find its way to shops all right here we go i'm going to give you guys the dab shot the one you've been waiting for okay okay i'm hoping that that's framed up okay check my camera first i think we're a go it's

think i'm going to do another mono crop and the reason is i don't want to pop seeds and not have uniform lighting up top especially because these are my expensive genetics so i think i'm going to go ahead and run another monoprop to do a side by side between the tfls and the raging [ __ ] don't get stuck on there yet in the raging kush [Music] [Music] i would rather have uniform lighting so that way i could pheno hunt properly it's hard to phenoh hunt when you have different lights going on because the lights control what the plants do so much it's gonna [ __ ] it up and give you skewed data so it's better to run them under uniform lighting foreign [Music] oh [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] bam and i'll create something for these so that they stay pushed together oh i got an idea [Music] i could tape those together [Music] and then it can just fold in half [Music] [Music] life [Music] [Music] so then i can just come in whole thing pops off wiggity wiggity wham slide it over here oh yeah all right it's doable so maybe what i'll do is i'll cut these in half add a couple more magnets and make it like a four piece sectional [Music] you get a yum yum [Music] that works normally i won't have all this [ __ ] in here either so we'll see and then so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] that's not sticky is this the sticky side you sticky all right you sticky [Music] yes [Music] ah [Music] it's not very sticky though might have a problem there [Music] so [Music] that seems a little off way off but there let's get it back on track [Music] i wasn't that far off actually [Music] [Music] not gonna lie i probably should have did it that way from the beginning it would have been way easier [Music] it's cracking so what's up enzo [Music] look at that [Music] yeah that's the top so we'll want to do that one too [Music] so [Music] so [Music] hmm [Music] do [Music] no that's not gonna be enough there so that don't matter i'll put something [Music] there there's nothing across the top there [Music] okay [Music] [Music] is there enough room to do that in here damn there [Music] so let's see how we're looking come over here take this slide up pop that on pop that on that's one maybe if we pull it over some so close the reason i put it on the styrofoam is because i'm not 100 sure that just putting it on this metal part is gonna make it work but we'll see anyways let me go ahead and just put this back up because i'll dick around with how tight it seals [Music] later pretty good though it doesn't need to be 100 light proof my life finally died plug in so let's see seamless cultivar this is the result of that bubble from the other day pretty good so let's smash some of this into a little jar for personal use [Music] so [Music] yeah everybody always likes when you take the top and you do all this [ __ ] to it [Music] i'm going to show you what all the influencers do to their their hash before they post pictures of it they push it down oh [ __ ] don't cut yourself right and then they take their dab tool and they just go like that a bunch of [ __ ] times [Music] that's it [Music] i don't know why i wish i knew i'm not hip to that one guys fire man [Music] all right let's take a dabbaroni one more little magnet here back in boston you didn't know what to do if you're running into like issues with your paws and you guys there's so many variables that it could be it's really hard to diagnose it you know over chat but um yeah if you guys need help dialing in your rosin pressing or your bubble hash processes set me up for consulting easy i have all these beautiful white little crumbs of rosin i'm trying to pick up off my dab mat here i like to waste [ __ ] let's get it watch my phone yeah just like steve said man it's more about the strains i noticed that give you different consistencies sorry check some notifications real quick well let's take a fat little blob not take that small little piece let me take that off there don't want to be greedy this stuff is really smooth and it expands like crazy [Music] hey that's for you guys [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] what [Music] uh [Music] [Music] oh yeah [Music] who's cannabis love there's a lot of really good pressers out there man for sure where did my child go what the [ __ ] i somehow pushed it away weird [Music] so [Music] so [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] true fantastic well it looks like two and a half zippers already on [Music] sorry i have to check the messages check in um people are [ __ ] blowing me up right now it's crazy cannabis love master i don't like that [Music] i don't like anybody that claims the name master grower [Music] [ __ ] [Music] i mean i see some decent grows but i would never ever ever associate the name master with it man not even close master implies you have nothing left to learn i don't get down like that anyways good content though good content oh man this high is great it just flows and flows and flows and flows ah all right well i i personally just think that anybody that calls themself master is a little too arrogant and needs to have a slice of humble pie i mean as much as i know i could i know my nutrient mixes and what they turn out to be because my nutrient mix is the same you know what i'm saying that's the only thing you really measure you know i'm saying yeah you could do that but that's to me that's that's the key to being a true master grower is taking the variables out and not guessing [ __ ] it's taking the time to do that extra step of measuring and making sure you're precise and taking notes and finding out specifically what works you know what i'm saying i don't know different strokes for different folks but if you're not constantly trying to improve your craft that's you know yeah i don't know i don't know anyways all that's left in here is the uh humidifier system that i'm gonna do and this is way though anyways you guys i'm gonna get out of here i got some more work to do before i call it a day so i'll catch you guys tomorrow peace", "PxuEtzjoQUA": "all right here's a little hash into Rosen tutorial got some unknown strain here a coffee filter unbleached cut into fourths and what you want to do is have this wrap part here on the center so you might have to cut a little excess off you do a tuck fold thing you don't want any of the sides exposed tuck full thing I have to cut a little extra off the top there don't get that right and I got this folded puc you want to make sure that the sides aren't too tight or it'll blow out the bag the quote-unquote bag if you will this is with a hair straightener we're doing a hair straightener method so we got it in the center right there notice the gap between the fingers sometimes you got to cool these things off this is set

there now get it away from the keys just take it back over here that was probably half a gram hash that's what you left with in these pucks afterward you can take them and reuse them for edibles or

but like that hike was enjoyable bro all right so it's joe drizzle welcome to mtv kids let me show you guys along with me here's the front yard pretty chilling bro here's the entrance right here bro

mindset again bro especially after the hike that buff ass hiking is heat 115 degrees plus bro we ate it though we're back but that was it for the video shout out to the homie for providing us with the syrup bro let's say it was fire i ought to get that [ __ ] again bro cause i was leaning for a while but like that she had me feeling good thank you guys for watching [Music] peace out", "bPtgrC2fuVY": "hey what's up youtube all right guys um i'm gonna start this video again i started it and then i [ __ ] up and i accidentally [ __ ] it up but anyways i'm gonna make some bubble hash on this video guys i'm gonna show you how i make it i got a 5 gallon bucket set up with all my micron bags and i'm i'm not running every single micron bag guys i'm running the 30 and the 70. the filter bag and then the work bag okay so i'm only filtering out the 70 and the 30 micron and i'm using 15 pounds of ice and buds you guys uh out these are a bunch of lowers and some trim that i have so it's hard to see but it's all frosty buds um so i have it set up now i've dropped in about already about two ounces maybe a little more than two ounces and i have another three there and it's all buds and trim guys so most it's gonna be a good yield on this one um for now i'm just gonna set it up like i said i got a layer ice i got it two ounces or three ounces of bud i'm gonna drop in another uh five pounds of ice another layer and keep layering it until i get there guys give me one second and i'll be right back with you all right guys i put in the other three and a half ounces uh all together it's about i don't know seven eight ounces something like that maybe half a pound uh but it's quite a bit of cannabis in there so i'm gonna go ahead and fill it up with water now and this is just tap water and this is uh my broomstick i just take off the broom handle and i use that as my uh as my uh mixer you can use a drill but a drill is uh too aggressive for me and it'll uh it knocks off the car film i just fill up the bucket so i see that there's uh just enough water in there to mix up all the cannabis and the water and the ice mixed together this is called the cold water extraction guys for anybody that's not familiar with this procedure and you can see there's still quite a bit of ice in there and there's just enough water in there for me to mix it around so what i'm gonna do is mix this up for about 15 to 20 minutes a little bit and i'm going to mix the ice the water and the cannabis all together and i'm going to mix the more i agitate it the more uh trichomes are going to fall off the buds guys and this green bag here is the filter bag it catches anything that makes it through this big and then after that is the actual uh the filters which is the 70 micron and the 30 micron i can actually add a little bit more ice in here because there's not enough ice all right give me one second guys all right guys i know it's hard to see that's why i brought out a flashlight but right there that's about the perfect amount of ice and cannabis mixture there's quite a bit of cannabis in there like i said and water mixture you just want it slushy you don't want it you don't want too much water in there you just want enough water to separate and agitate the material and the more you mix it and the faster you mix it the more uh more trichomes are going to knock off so you want to do this for about 20 minutes guys in about 10 minute increments so you want to do it for 10 minutes let it rest for a few minutes and then go back and hit it again and then you can do a second watch you guys this is just going to be the first wash and then yeah and then we'll go from there give me a second and then i'll bring you guys back around once i finish watching this [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] i'm just showing you guys how i mix it and how long i mix it for and how aggressive i am with it the faster you go the more you're going to knock off the trichomes but you're also going to break up a lot of the foliage and the buds as well and that's going to allow everything the more you make it the colder it gets because the ice and water mix together especially when you mix it it gets colder than ice actually is so that's how it works the process and like i said it freezes the trichomes off of all the buds and whatever filters through this first bag gets caught as far as the garbage and everything else the trichomes will fall into the different micron bags whatever you have stacked i do have them all but i don't feel necessary to run all those other microphone bags that's the 70 and the 30 i think are more than enough to filter out all of what you're going to need as far as the trichomes go try not to hit the bottom of your bag guys with your stick because you might tear it or rip it and then you'll you'll contaminate all the rest of your product just by mixing it like this will agitate it enough to knock off all the trichomes and this is pretty much like a light wash a 20-minute wash is really really light especially if you're using bud instead of trim if you're using trim you want to go a little bit more aggressive but you'll get more chloroform which means uh the green will beat screw all the material but in the end it doesn't really matter because you're gonna wash it and i'll show you when we get to that point i'll see you guys here in about 20 minutes after i'm done mixing this up all right guys i've been mixing for about 10 minutes now what i do is i pull the bag up and i just kind of drain it knock everything all the water through it and then i'll let it float back in the water and fill up the bag again and then i'll start mixing and i'll do it uh i'll let it rest for about four minutes five minutes and then i'll start mixing again guys but for now i'm gonna let all everything that i agitated settled through the filters and go through the filters and collect and then i'll see you guys here in about five minutes and we'll start to mix again all right guys it's been about five minutes i'm gonna go ahead and start mixing again and i'll do this for another 10 minutes i'll run about 5 minutes and then i'll wait a second like 30 seconds and then i'll start again it seems real repetitive but that's how you get the most out of your uh your buds or your trim as far as hashtags and then from this you can make it into rosin and you can do it a bunch of different ways to make rods you can do with the hair straightener you can do it with the iron you can do it with a hot plate and an iron sorry my cat's running around it's going crazy and by pulling up the bag guys what it does is it filters it pulls everything to the bottom and just leaves the ice and the cannabis in there and as it settles the water starts coming up underneath and you can start mixing again and there's still quite a bit of ice in there guys ice cannabis a lot of cannabis you could tell i'm not mixing it too hard because the water's like a lime green and it's not green like the color of the the leaf you don't want that to bleach through you can wash it off at the end with oral water or just tap water but give me a second we'll get to that point guys [Applause] [Applause] all right guys i'll be back with you when we go to the sifting process give me one second all right guys it's been about 10 minutes i'm still mixing it i'm gonna mix it for about another uh probably a minute and a half two minutes and then we're gonna go to the sink and i'll show you how i shift out my cannabis in my heart [Music] all right guys in order to sift out your cannabis uh these aren't necessary but they're good to have uh they're micron screens this is a 30 micron i think or 25 micron i'm not sure exactly these are 25 micron if it zooms in and focuses there we go 25 micron okay so these are 25 micron bags and what you're gonna do guys is you're gonna is i'll set it up here on my counter right there and when i'm done uh scooping it out of the bag i'll scoop it right on to there and i'll fold it over and i'll press it with the towel on the bottom of the top and it's gonna strain out all of the all of the water and it's going to leave just behind just the just the rosin just the hash so this is uh these are essential to have and you can buy them on amazon or ebay for like anywhere from uh three dollars to to fifteen dollars depending on how many you buy i usually buy them in bulk and you can buy them uh ten packs five packs uh three packs you can buy them individually uh but they're really really necessary in order to make the to sift out the hash you can you can just let it dry out on a piece of cardboard as well if you don't have any screens you can just get a piece of cardboard put it on there and just uh scrape it up after the fat on the cardboard and it'll just come right up like i said the cardboard will suck out most of the most of the water uh this is just a way to sift it out you put it on top and you squeeze it and i'll show you how that's done when we get to that process but for now we're still mixing up the hash and we're gonna give it another probably let me see if i sing zoom in if it'll clear up there we go so we're going to mix this up for about another minute and then i'll show you guys how we do the the extraction process [Applause] you you don't want to try to mix it too hard guys you don't want your material or water to fall between the bags because what will happen is it'll contaminate your hash that green bag is actually a filter bag so if anything falls in between there it'll catch it but you don't want to try to mix it too aggressive where it's splashing because the water carries a lot of hash and a lot of material and it'll contaminate your hash if it falls in between the flaps usually you're supposed to fold them over but this bucket that i have is a little bit wider than a regular five gallon bucket and these bags don't fold over so i'm just doing it like this and then you know i don't have any issues just don't uh don't don't uh don't fill your bags up too much and too much ice and where it's going to fall over or fall between your bags you don't want that to happen because it will contaminate your hash you'll have pieces of uh of bud or whatever material in your hashing and you'll see it too you can pick it out but you don't want to it's better just to do it right the first time you can even add more ice as the ice mouth when you're mixing as you can see there's not i mean there's still quite a bit of ice in there but you can add more ice and it'll freeze it even faster uh the colder bets the better that's why you keep your your fresh frozen in the freezer as soon as you trim it off the plant you put it right in the freezer and you just freeze it and that's why when you're freezing it makes it easier for it to fall off the track when you actually put it in the ice in the water all right guys we're going to go ahead and do our bag extraction i'm going to show you how that works right now let me back up my tripod and there's the other bucket that we're going to use and uh as soon as this thing clears up all right so what i do guys is i pull out my bag and it's going to filter out all the water and all the sediment all the all the hot is going to come out the bottom and i kind of mixed it up as the water is going through because it's just like stirring it up but all right guys and i'm going to go straight into another five yellow bucket so i don't use any of that hash water that's coming out the bottom because that'll go on my next run all right and this one right here is just my filter bag this catches all the trash any trash that may come through that bag or if that falls on the side so it's not really a 14 this one here is our zombie micron and it's pretty loaded i can tell you now because the water is kind of coming out fast and this bag changes pretty fast so what i do guys is i got the top just like this and i'll pull up the other bag make sure i'm not going to lose any of this water because anything that comes through this bag is going to get caught in the 30 micron any other hatch and i'll shake the bag let's see how fast that water came out because that tells me that there's some hash in this bag how much i don't know we'll see i used quite a bit of material so we'll see you don't want to let any of this water go to waste because anything that's falling out is getting caught in that second bag guys remember that we got a good little mountain here and this is actually some people prefer this bag over all the others as far as quality of the cannabis goes because uh this is the gold gold bag this is the one that comes out the most uh golden and actually i've had 30 micron come out golden too but it just depends on the material all right guys we're gonna come to the bag over here set the tripod up let's bring it up now it doesn't look like quite a bit now but once i run some water i'm going to run some water through this and all that right there is hash guys the gold selection and i'll tell you i'll show you how that looks like here in just a second give me one second so i'm going to lay the bag in there i got a cup of tap water right here i'm just going to wet the sides walls down wash any hash that got that got caught on the sides i'm going to wash it all down to the bottom screen and i'm going to shake it and it's going to all gather together in one spot um and no matter how much water you want to i probably lost a little hat from the bottom end because there might have been some 30 micron that just went down the sink but uh it's all right and now i'm gonna pick up the bag and let it all gather in the middle and i'm gonna wet it down let it catch all together just shake it this one is probably the easiest bag of hash to make because uh the micron is not so small where you can't uh or you can gather it with a 30 micron it catches everything and you have to really work at that bag right now what i'm doing is i'm just running cups of water through it and i'm washing it washing off any of that green color that may be in the hash and you guys will see that if you mix your hash too much it'll it'll actually turn your hash green now what i'm doing is i'm going to grab the bottom of the bag where the hash is at i'm squeezing it you see it and i'm going to bring up through the bag and then right there is our hash and you can see how good quality that hash is this is the creme de la creme most people like the 70 and a couple of other microns that that uh that they like but that's a good amount of hash guys if you guys ever run hash you know it takes a lot of material to make hash and you can see that this hash is actually really decent this will be really really sticky if i uh don't uh gather it real quick and put it on the on the microphone bag on the screens and i'm going to show you that process right now guys you can use a spoon or you can use a credit card or whatever you want see how that one just fell right out and you can just scoop it all on on the spoon and then just knock it down on the screen and you can even run more water through this and gather all the all the hash on here that you can't see that's real small because this stuff is like dust guys um it's just gathered together with the ice and the water and you see it after the fact is it's like a sediment and there's still hash on here guys but anyways what i wanted to show you guys about the sifting process so i got a cloth here just a regular cloth i'm gonna fold the the hash over and i'm gonna put it on the outside of both sides of the hash and i'm going to press on this guys and the water is going to get absorbed by the by the by the rag and the hash is going to be on the inside and that's your finished product guys or one of them and then you can uh you can squeeze this out a little bit more if you like um like i said i'm gonna go ahead and run the run the water through this bag and i'm gonna collect whatever i didn't miss whatever it was on there because i know there's quite a bit of quite a bit of material still in there and this is just the first wash guys this is not a aggressive wash by any means most people uh do aggressive and they wash their stuff really really really vigorously and that's where you'll get that green tint to your hash and you can wash most of it out but sometimes you can't wash it all out that's why not i try not to get that aggressive on my first wash and i try to keep it as simple as possible um so what's left in there is uh about another quarter teaspoon of hash as soon as i gather it all together but that's like i said that's pretty much the way it works guys it's not very hard it's not complicated and then i still got the 30 micron which is quite a bit too uh let me pause this video because it's getting long as hell and then uh we'll get to that all right guys i'm getting the last 30 micron bag as you can see it takes a lot to get this through because it's a it's a really really fine fine bag the 30 micron is really really small and this is what i do to get out because it it'll get real foamy as you shake it as you can see inside the bucket all the foam and uh i'll try to squeeze out as much as i can you're not supposed to do this but it just takes too long to do it any other way at least for me it does i get all impatient and i'll go to the sink here we'll open it up see how much hash we got in there and it looks like a decent amount i'm just gonna run the sink turn it half a gallon of water 16 ounces of water go through there and then uh it takes a while you got it this is the way i do it guys this is the quickest way to get it out of there and and i know it's cold that's why i clearly empty it out and then i do a little bit of tap water so it brings it down to temp um but it's not going to filter through this bag once it's uh in this bag but this is how you get off the rest of the water and it takes a while guys just be patient try not to force it through like sometimes i'll squeeze the bag the way i was doing just before i brought it up to the thing uh but this is uh the other way to get it out because if not you have to wait for it and it takes forever and even if you leave it sitting there it'll it won't drain completely you have to physically go in and drain it but once most of the water is drained you can just squeeze the bag and most of the house will be on the bottom and like i said this is a quick wash guys you can wash it three times or even four times i don't usually do it more than twice or sometimes three times it just depends on the material and how much i'm running just be patient that's all it is being patient i'll uh be back with you guys in just a second hold on all right guys look at all that hash in there i know it doesn't look like much but it's quite a bit give me one second all right guys so that's the finished product of the 30 micron it's like peanut butter but the best kind of peanut butter and this is actually more than the the 90 or 70 micron and it looks just as good that's why i really don't do any other ones and these two because they always come out really really similar and the quality is always the same if you're growing quality and you're putting quality in you'll get quality out and see how golden that is compared to that one it's very it it's barely any difference this one looks a little lighter to me but there's at least a quarter ounce right here of uh of product and it'll be real fire once it's dried and a lot of people put this under a press and press out all the water you don't have to do all that guys as long as you're putting your body weight on it and you're using the right micron screen you're gonna get all the water out and then it'll dry within 24 hours see look there's a piece of material that got through right there is that green a piece of a leaf or something went through the screen and made it through that screen but uh no biggie we can sit that out after the fact and uh i probably will i'm gonna go ahead and rinse this bag one more time run a little bit more water gather the rest of the hatch together and now i'm gonna do another maybe wash or two and i'll probably end up with about uh 10 to 18 grams of hash by the time i'm done i've cured done hash because i usually let it cure for about a week or two and then we'll have a nice uh oxidation on the outside but the inside will be nice and creamy and light colored i'll usually mix these together to be honest i usually don't uh separate them and then i'll press them into hash but everybody has their preferences on how they like the hash this is the way i do it it's real simple it's easy um you can even save this hash and break it up like some people do or you can just leave it in a ball and it'll oxidize and it'll turn into like a temple ball you can roll it and some heat with your hands or a bottle and make some even better hash full melt if you like but yeah there's a lot of ways you can a lot of things you can do with hash from edibles me my personally what i'm going to do is i'm going to press it into rosin and then use it from there and uh edibles or however i want to use it but that's the best way i like to do it because i can do my dabs smoke my oil that's how i like my oils personally but yeah so this is my process guys real simple easy it takes about an hour to do it but a little longer because this time i'm showing you the process as a step by step more or less and the bags that i use and like i say that green bag there is just a filter bag it's not it's not for any hash or anything uh the two filter bags that i do use of the 70 and the 30 micron that's it and then a filter bag to catch any junk of course and then uh the work bag which is the 30 micron which is in there in the bucket underneath the green bag because i'm still going to wash this material at least one more time but yeah that's how i do it guys so if you have any comments or anything you want to know anything let me know in the comments below have a good one stay safe and stay medicated guys have a good one", "zv324iwzTso": "[Music] [Applause] [Music]", "dQO7oqdzNfA": "but this you guys is what I'm most excited to show you I've never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge what is going on you guys my name is Jeff also known as popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe I got a lot of lip videos on the way like today I'm gonna be showing you when I picked up from silver stem cannabis in my last video if you missed that video I got to tour their entire dispensary bring you guys with me show you what it's actually like inside of there it's [ __ ] sick make sure you check out that video a link to it will be in the description but right now I'm going to show you guys what I actually bought and what it looks like because there's some fire ass products there when you buy weed legally it comes with a receipt I spent two hundred and seventy seven dollars it would have been two twenty before tax but there's some hefty taxes in Colorado but it's worth it because hey I can [ __ ] buy the [ __ ] in the store I don't need to have a plug I don't need to fly with my own it's nice just being able to go into a store and pick out some [ __ ] and even with the tax it's so much cheaper than it is in Pennsylvania like you don't pay taxes when you buy weed in Pennsylvania but the growers and the processors and the stores are definitely paying a lot in taxes and that goes down to you so you might not pay a tax but you're being taxed alright let's start with these I picked up these little tablets just cuz I've never seen these before they're called pressies they have desired effects on them like sleep energy focus they only have like five or ten milligrams of THC in them so they're not very potent but they come with some other stuff that are supposed to actually help increase the desired effects that are labeled on the package I try out the focus ones just see what it's like it's literally like a little tablet and says a little THC mark on it's pretty cool I know if you're supposed to chew it or pop it I'm really glad I read that it says right on the bottom swallow don't you alright guys I'll see if that 10 miligrams does anything to me but I'm gonna be smoking a lot on top of it so I probably won't even really feel it you know I get high as [ __ ] all day and I get distracted so much stuff this could actually like help me focus real a little like that'd be kind of cool now let's get to the live rosin you guys picked up some olio I picked up the strain tropic sunset its a mix between slur Akane number 4 and papaya punch number 3 I didn't even smell it honestly like the name just sold me if you watched the video yesterday though you saw him open up a package of oleo they have such beautiful packaging man it's really [ __ ] cool they definitely take the extra step to make sure there's a great presentation with the product and the products really good so you really can't go wrong with them and just like the homie said it comes a little dab tool I didn't let it sit flat last night so you can see a little bit dripped onto the side but that's not the end of the world oh my god you guys this [ __ ] looks so good I was sure you're gonna close up for this if you guys can see that like it's just a beautiful yellow has a very nice consistency to it it's like a liquidy sugar and that's what's so cool about rosin man there's so many different consistencies that it ends up being just loaded up the puff coke peak I hope you guys are smoking with me let me know in the comments what you guys are smoking on every go you guys man I just like flew away and went to heaven that tastes so good [Music] my god you guys even when I look on this you guys truly [ __ ] beautiful job if you guys are ever in Colorado pick up some holy Arase Jim I really like this dispensary you guys they have some top-shelf concentrates there flowers amazing that's what I'm about to show you next but just like with over 300 dispensaries in Denver it's hard to find like all the good ones so as soon as you find one that has like great prices and great products like I just wanted to keep going to it damn I picked up two strains I picked up at indica and sativa flower this is the mimosa this is one of my favorite sativa strains I love smoking joints in mimosa if you've had mimosa before you already know but if you haven't you got to try it man it's some great [ __ ] weed and this is a shame that the budtender sold Deon he was very helpful this [ __ ] like I usually don't for whatever reason strains that have the word silver in it I don't like I don't even not like them I just like tend to just like not look at it because I'm like in my head I'm like gold is the best of silver my aunt but this is called silver OG and like I don't know if we get much better than this like it is a heavy indica it is like that deep green with like bright white trichome still so it looks like it has like snow on it this little it looks like the Tegrity farms Christmas snow weed and like if that was true that would be very concerning I don't know how good the shots do it for the weed but oh my god you guys it is a fire I honestly think I'm gonna go back to silver stuff before I go home and get some more flour because they had some great strains out there I just started with one indica and one sativa preheating the peak right now cheers you guys that was a nice reheat what I really like about the earrings is you can put a decent amount of wax in there and like if you take a big dab it's not all wasted like you can just reheat it and keep smoking it but this you guys is what I'm most excited to show you I've never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge I paid too much money for this but I had to do it I said I wanted to try some cool cartridges while I was out here and I mean it happened this is from olio I don't want to skip over how great their packaging is they do such a good job on it that I feel like it deserves a little second I love you can kind of tell it has a little bit more of a foggy hue to it than a normal cartridge it's really cool how it says the strain on it too because sometimes you forget what strain you're smoking or if you have a lot of cartridges you can get them confused again using my cloud products rio+ different color but I just love these batteries they're one of my favorites cheers you guys wow that is one of the best AC cartridges I've ever had it's papaya punch that's gonna taste [ __ ] awesome but if being rosin versus actual distillate holy [ __ ] and like I can feel it like I'm getting really high off this like I can feel it on the face in the eyes this is not your normal cartridge this is crazy holy [ __ ] this is like one hit and you're high and it literally tastes like a rosin dab this isn't saying you guys the future man they can work on the price a little bit it would be way more feasible but what a great experience like I'm [ __ ] ripped I am so happy I got this this is the last thing we got through the liquid live resin cartridge I picked it off the name and the package honestly the [ __ ] is really cool and having a garlicy cartridge I've never had that before and it sounds pretty interesting chum the company Green Dot it's a [ __ ] [ __ ] to open here's the inside packaging cartridge is sitting on the side to push right through here to get the cartridge out then it gives you the stats on the back just peel here and don't use this if you're pregnant okay that this cartridge has a little adjustable air flow filter I don't really like these what it does is give you either more or less airflow I'd rather you just like tell me what's good and stick to it I'm gonna try minimal air flow and see how that goes Devlin gives you a hard hat doesn't Asus goes the rosin cart but still a good tasting cartridge well it's actually like kind of bad to the place garlicky it's not like sweet like that's why I prefer but it's like a very dank weed eat aced it's very heavy on the garlic I'll tell you that it's not even really a GMO taste it's definitely just more straight garlic it's a garlic explosion definitely prefer the rosin cart over this I'm going back to the rosin cart I need something with a better taste [Music] much better I think that's what we're gonna wrap the video you guys super pumped to try this for the first time way too expensive but definitely a cool experience that is so amazing this is probably the coolest thing I picked up in my opinion click like if you enjoyed the video let me know what you thought the coolest thing I got was subscribe for more videos I appreciate you watching my name is Jeff beaks", "JYLgNByhkRw": "what's up guys it's bud and I'm J geeks calm and today we are gonna do an old-school review like we used to do I figure since hemp is now federally legal and there's no reason that I shouldn't be able to post a review of federally legal hemp so let's give it a try hopefully you won't get a strike but we'll see alright so this is some CB flower I just recently got from Wisconsin flower dot-com it was sent to me as a sample just to try and I got four different products this is a sour tsunami and this is the first time I've ever tried this strain it's really good and this one is canna tonic and yeah also really good these two are actually I'm trying to think I think they're related sour tsunami and canna tonic somehow and ac/dc and all the strains like that but it's really cool to be able to try a couple of these old-school high CBD low THC strains really really cool so they're yeah so I just tried them they're very kind of floral sweet piney they're very similar and taste I think the only difference was the Kanna tonic I liked the flavor a little bit better and it was but it did have a little bit more of a bitter aftertaste but very good though very high-quality these are very dense nice-looking dogs and let's see they've got this which is really cool it's bubble hash not exactly sure what the bubble part means that I think the way this is John is uh basically it's filtered well basically the plant matters mixed in ice water and then you filter the water and the resin and all that stuff here separates so I've never done it but I've seen videos of it done you can look it up on YouTube but this is really good I drew I tried it as best I could I stuck a a chunk of it in my in my vaporizer and very sweet very floral a nice taste and it's also kind of cool because you can kind of squeeze it and mold it but product that was just the coolest thing probably that I've ever ever tried is this one and and I've actually tried it before but this is rosin and the way this is made is it's basically stick a bud into a press that's eated and then you squeeze it and it basically squishes out all of the resin and cannabinoids in and terpenes and all and this is it and using this [Music] it's a vaporizer but it's specifically for extracts so pretty cool and yeah it just tastes amazing this this is probably the best taste of any kind of cannabis product that you can have just amazing amazing taste super sweet I mean it just it's it's a mixture of like candy and flowers and just like and super super good anyway a huge thank you to Luke for sending this and you guys should definitely go check out his website I'll put a link in the description so you can check it out and yeah that's it for now keep an eye out for a video that's this is kind of I know I haven't done reviews like this for a little while but there's a little more coming really soon probably either maybe tonight but ponds tomorrow so stay tuned and I'll talk to you guys soon have a great night have a great day and alright peace talk to you later bye", "hdQt-Ej-2Ho": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with tokentim420 this is a florida medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 and medical marijuana patients all right like say hi to everybody out there if you haven't subscribed hit that subscribe button down there leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know how you're feeling tonight what you're smoking on token on what you're moved in um so today we got the token tim's mad scientist lab we are going to be making some rosin vape carts on our own save a lot of money um i will like give a shout out real quick um i got some of that girl scout cookie now this stuff was only coming in at 15 it was minnie's i couldn't see that online um and i'm not a fan of girl scouts but this stuff totally changed my mind this stuff's real good um nice flavor to it nice high to it not quite a sativity ah as sativa leaning as the last stuff i've had that was the girl scout cookie so like i said not bad at all all right so we're gonna make our own rosin vape carts now you guys know i've tried true leaves i just went and got another one we got the skunk ape blue river rosin we tried both of them for cure leaf i left the other box in there from the select um some people was asking if this was live resin or not to me it didn't really taste like that tastes more like the terpene like the cannabis infused terpene vape pens exactly like them so if you could find those vape pens cheaper i'd go with them but we're going to show you a way to do it real cheap and i tell you what they taste amazing all right so we squirted a little distillate in there i got i was trying some of them i got a little tore up had to take a break my water cooled off so it didn't work so this is take two on the video honestly um that's that papaya cake rosin from move or from true leave sorry um in there and then the distillate we're using because it's an indica uh the indica uh bubba kush coming at 78 percent so all i did was microwave some water and a shot glass put it in there you don't want to get it up past the stopper there you don't want to get back in there i want to get this part done before it cools off again so there was probably about three left in here on this syringe it's got a little bubble but it was about at three i put a little bit in there already so when it's warmed up it's just gonna go real easy in there yeah i guess we're gonna use all of it all right that's all of it are all that we're gonna mess with getting out at the moment now if you notice the pad i'm using is that five dollar baking sheet which is silicone so it's the same thing as a dab mat that i got on amazon it was like five bucks or two for five i can't remember videos if you go back as while back i just cut a piece off to fit the table so i didn't have to clean the whole table off so now all we're going to do is we're going to take this and we're going to mix it up now i have made a few of these before i did warm the rosin up on the one and then by time i got out here it was just kind of like a hardened back up more like a caramel just letting it sit out at room temperature seems to work better let me pull it off the view for a second and make sure i got it mixed evenly sometimes the distillate wants to stay on the side but as you know the rosin carts are about 60 bucks apiece and they're only half grams so this distillate i believe was 60 bucks from grow healthy which truly has them for 60 most everybody's around the 60 mark for a full gram so this right here will fill two vape carts um and then the rosin's uh 75 gram so you basically for 135 you're getting two grams um which you would only get one gram buying it by the vape cards like i said these are half gram vape carbs these aren't full grams only half grams if you also notice on true leaves the thc is always really low i'm using 80 distillate and 80 um rosin so these are still up in the 80 percent so we're gonna use our um we had some la confidential co2 cart which i got another one of these so we will be reviewing it later then all we're going to do is unscrew the top here now i will say that it helps to have a decent dab tool the dab tool i'm using is the one i got for five dollars uh from banger supply and if you use code token tim you'll save 10 at banger supply they got these for like 5.99 so try to keep it up here in the camera see what we can do so mainly what we're going to do is we're going to take the flatter end um or either end the flatter end kind of works better towards the end and we're just going to get a glob out there like that this stuff's stringy and looking in the camera is a pain in the butt all right we'll hold that there and then what i do is just press it around the stem and then put it down in there so let me go over here and do this where you guys can still see it but yeah you guys can see it there now i'm gonna go ahead and use the flat end just kind of scoop out a big scoop like that and then smooth on that thing and it's easier just to push it right down in there you guys can see that just kind of pushing it down now it doesn't go real good um so there is a trick we'll use here in a second once we get it pretty blobbed up all right trying to it's hard for me to focus i need new glasses so i keep pulling it off the frame to me to be able to see it now i'm just scraping all the gunk out of the jar real good i'm gonna do the same thing i'm gonna go over to a clear spot each time and just wipe it off on that and then take the tool focus there we go and slide it down that thing it's not wanting to focus if it does go on the outside just scoop it back up all right we've got about all of it now the first one i tried to wait for it to go down and it just didn't seem to go down quick enough so i'm gonna take a little torch and i'm gonna heat the glass down in here i'm not gonna heat the concentrate i'm just gonna do it like that without burning my fingers off hopefully so i'm just going to slightly warm the glass going around you can see it's starting to drip there where we warmed it up so just real quick that one bubbled on me and then it starts to it'll just start to run down in there then go ahead and take the tool and access there's a little bubble there we're going to pop that scrape all that off on there try not to get it inside there for sure we've already got it about half full it doesn't take a lot um a lot of concentrate that is you can see i only had about three in that syringe and i only put a couple dabs in there it really wasn't a lot so again we're going to take a little bit sometimes with this i can just scrape it right across the glass or like i said just roll it around that and whatever's left there the mouthpiece fits real tight over that silicone ring and it just pushes everything else down let's get a real good scrape on this jar real quick and then i'll show you the other ones i made and talk about them a little bit now i will say the flavor on this stuff is just amazing it tastes just like just like doing the dab let's scrape this off of there real quick all right now i could play around and get some more out there but i want with you guys i'll just dab that out with my dab straw later so we're going to stick that on see how it just squishes that on through there and we're going to screw that on now i found with some of them you'll have to go back again with your torch and this one's a little thicker you can see it's still thick so i'm just barely going to heat it if it starts to bubble you want to quit so i have to look at this real good and it'll take a second for the heat to transfer through to the glass still a little creamy there's still some up there at the top there we go this one must be a little thicker glass than the other one i had we're just going to hit it a few times now if you notice when we did that it kind of cleared up a little bit not a lot but so you can see the little holes down in there now where the wick is you'll see how that cleared it up some and i didn't bring the battery out i told you i got pretty medicated all right but we have made a few other ones um so i made one yeah this is it i used the move vape pen and this it worked great for about two days and the battery died and if you can see right here at the bottom it's got little um holes i thought i could take it off with a battery i grabbed it with some pliers and apparently i couldn't so i shattered it what i'm going to do is unscrew the lid i'm not going to do it now because i want the glass to fall off and then i'm going to heat the banger up and i'm going to put it in there upside down like that and just let all that wax come out now this was the um i used the skunk ape and the bubba kush um the skunk ache ape was from move or true leave again sorry i don't know i got move on the head now i did put some of the thca powder in that one also and it was really really really tasty tasted just like the skunk ape tastes a lot better than the skunk ape rosin car which we'll get we'll have a video on that later but like i said really really really tasty um and the thc is going to be up there and it's a cheaper cheaper thing so i'll show you the other one i did but first we got to do it sorry it's alive all right so i did make a live resin vape cart um this is with moves rainbow train wreck and you can see how it's cleared up a little bit more i hit it with a little bit more of the torch um but it tastes amazing there's a little clog there that's why heated this one up it was clogging a little bit but man it tastes amazing and the high on there i'm telling you the high is better than any of these vape pens i've had yet and i gotta write what i put on this one so i don't forget that's the rainbow train wreck which we know it's live rosin because that's all there is um but the skunk ape one i'm telling you you know vape card even these i hit these um you know 10 good hits off of them to catch a little buzz um i was only hitting that skunk ape three three little hits and i was blasted i the dying i made that i rolled up a joint um and after my three hits i had like this much left of the joint and i looked at that i'm like hey no way i'm lighting that thing back up so it tore me up pretty good so if you guys want to give it a try like it's not really messy you do have a little bit of residue left in these so you could either take a bud and roll it around in there and then roll in some keep and make your own moon rock or you could just take your dab straw and hit it you could also take a hair dryer and melt it down so it would get it in a corner better to get a little better dab out of it but if i mess around with it with like this one that has that little scoop on the end i can pretty much get everything out of that jar there won't be anything left and especially it's starting to cool off now because it's getting ready to rain here but especially when i'm working in a hot garage and it pretty much stays warm here anyways it makes it easier to work with it's not coming back up so it's easier like i said just to push push it all the way around to the corners i just take this one the longer straighter one and get the sides like that and what i'll do with this is dab it that's what i do with the other stuff that's why i mark the charge but i think it rub keeps rubbing off with my fingers so that one's uh we just made the papaya cake so that was this one we're just gonna put a pea on the jar so i remember but yeah that's what i'll just use when i come out tonight i'll scrape that again you can see like i said i just got that little bit i wiped off on the edge there just by taking it around a little bit and just keep scraping it back on the side and then when you get enough to take a dab you just take it all off of there and dab away and like i said with the other with the rounded one it works a little better getting everything out there real good this one's not bad but the other one's better so like i said it doesn't take long to get you a dab and then just drop the dab tool in the dab rig and you're good so that's my take on making my own vape cards um the live resin i did use the co2 true clear the sherbert so i figured it'd have a nice cleaner flavor but this stuff here wasn't bad um i haven't tried this one i just made yet of course i didn't bring the battery out um but i used it with a skunk 8 but that skunk cape's got such a strong skunky um smell to it it's hard to for anything else to come through so we'll see if anything comes through on this one but like i said the thca powder worked great in there too it didn't clog that one up that one worked you know it was almost all the way full and you can tell see there's not much left in there i smoked over half of it in a couple days it was so tasty and like i said the battery just quit on me so i don't recommend refilling those the reason i refilled this one and like i said we got it filled with just that little bit i didn't use a lot i'll show you how much i used on that um but this one's got the charging port on the bottom so hopefully we can recharge it when it does die now i only use this was a full gram i did lick a little bit and but pretty much i just used two i pushed it from where it was at the one to maybe just past the eight so maybe three milliliters of this stuff but closer to probably the two because it did fill that pin up and it's only 300 milligrams so like i said it didn't take much of this to fill that vape in and i did dab a little bit in my mouth dabbed a little bit in the banger just to try it the flavor wasn't bad the banger wasn't real clean so i couldn't get a good flavor on it so we'll save that for a review hopefully too well that's going to be it guys if you have any questions just leave them down there in the comments like i said this is an easy way you could also just put the distillate straight into the vape pen without the rosin and just make a bait pin that's what pretty much they're using is distillate but like i said with just a little bit of that rosin it makes it a real good flavor so you don't need a lot of that even you could probably just put maybe two little dabs in there mix it around put one in there see how you like it next time add more if you need to but like i said they tore me up good so i definitely recommend those of you who are feeling your own give this a shot let me know what you think of it that's going to be it guys we do got some more videos coming tomorrow we got a delivery coming and then we'll also do what's new in the florida mmj we

something good um and keep on toking my friends", "6j7OeSoYJEA": "hey you there welcome back everybody this time we're gonna be doing another hard press demo doing more hash as opposed to the other video I think was more flour probably all flour our member yeah I'm gonna go out to the sit room to write have the hard press setup and then I'm gonna show you a couple of things that I do maybe differently than the next guy and yeah I'll just take you through step by step it might not be quite as long as the other video that I ended up losing but it should still hit pretty much all the points I think so let's go check it out alright so I'm gonna do a hash run obviously two yellow bags like I said before we flip them inside out or there's a little funnel hmm forgive that on camera here so that's how I just pour some hash in there the bags are flipped inside out you know I didn't get this thing on fast enough to see it starting with about 40 grams of hash and they think I'm gonna put it all in about ten bags and then so we're gonna press about eight grams at a time yeah we're gonna fold these over to you can watch them fill in these okay I actually if I'm pressing with the hair iron I do prefer to make like a little patty first mm-hmm and like a pre squish flatten it out and then put it in the bags I think that works a little bit better for the hair iron but it's just a little bit faster because we're doing you know more than one press shut this thing heating up I don't think it's all ready yet still got a couple degrees to go you know you can just just press them do the fantasy this is what I've been doing so I don't like that bag open so we just give it a quick heat it kind of seals the bag up just like so so that it stays flat when we put it in there ten of them will get a squish wrong for you how I squish this thing's a little bit warm that's what he's able to squish them it's not really even that hot yeah is it it just turned this thing on it's obviously still got about 70 degrees to go I can still put my hand on here so it's not even 120 degrees yeah still working though this couch is really good though so if we let me show you what I do because I know people have been talking about blowouts happening with these bigger you know five and 2010 presses if you don't you know kind of ease into the pressure I know if you got like a hydraulic or pneumatic press it's a little bit easier to kind of punch it in there but this is like a little bit of a learning curve I imagine and we're back I'll tell them of the envelope so that this flap isn't gonna open up on me and like I said you can probably fit a lot more in here too if you gave it that pre squish you know I usually take like a piece of parchment paper and then all you know flatten it out with the hair iron and just get it into like a brick form just just warm enough like if I was smoking it not really too getting we'll just to press it up you'll fit more in here and I feel like yeah it's a nice like no blow out feature too if you're having blowout problems I feel like that having it all together is a good start to have with this thing it's got two plugs I know they have a one plug version now but I I mean I can go back and probably get them to do a one plug for me but I kind of like it because I plug in the heat element first and then I can just leave that on while it ones up takes about 15 minutes I'm just sayin it's about 15 minutes and it looks like we're still about 30 degrees shy so we'll be back when that warms up all right yeah so I got them centered in there again it's about eight grams with the other plates I think we can get up to like 12 or more grams with the single plate on there this thing keeps on bobbing up and down I'm just gonna go I think the temperature that we got it's about 161 I'd like to go about 180 but you know it'll be 180 in a minute we'll see what the difference is again this thing takes about 15 minutes to warm up I just turned it on not too long ago yeah so the problem people are having with hash is that it's blowing out because the hash can be a little bit too good I mean if you have anything really over three stars with your pressing four and five six star even it's going to end up squirting out the seams in the screen you know before it gets the adequate amount of pressure to keep the bad stuff in and the good stuff out so you've got a kind to ease it in and with the hard press there's just you know two buttons so you've got to stop it by yourself and that's like a double tap so I'll go in to where the pressure just barely gets on it like I'm not hearing any of the sounds of the press actually happened I'm just getting it there and I'll let it sit there for like ten or fifteen seconds and then I'll go in for another 15 seconds with all of the pressure so it does it is a kind of a learning curve you kind of gotta hit it at the right time so after a couple tries we'll figure it out it's not that hard but let me show you what I'm talking about [Applause] like that and as you can see nothing's really terribly sweating out yeah a little bit starting to go now we're gonna go in with the rest of the wait and see what she knows and that's what we get looks like no bull outs that was five stars is like between four and five star smells really nice I know if you're getting that yeah it's really stinky for sure thank the pineapple was amazing yeah so again that was four or five star if I would have just went straight in on it it was definitely one of like pressed out these little scenes on the side of there and if you're not flipping these bags inside out that's going to be it's going to happen a lot more easily too so we'll put that off to the side make sure it's centered getting that it's definitely getting hot now my house again we're gonna do the same thing see it's fairly starting to come out it's like the juiciest part of it just kind of want to get it to separate so that the harder stuff kind of coagulates together makes it hard to press out the big screen there we go you can tell these are kind of I mean when they're done you can see they don't look slick sticky or glossy you can see the screen kind of separates from it instead of it being kind of gooey like this in the middle so I mean you can always come through and press these a second time and I promise you you'll get on what what I would do is even double them up so like you come through the second time we just put two of them on top of each other like that and then just stick it through the machine I'll show you another way that we can get even after doing that we'll get even more out of them on a different day it's kind of you know if you're trying to get your bend most bang for your buck I'll show you how to do that too it's a different time if that looks like a really fat squeeze in the middle there and we're gonna finish these up and we'll be back for the collection I'll show you guys how I do that all right all right and we're back you got all these pressed out here see just that distinct and we're gonna collect it up and I'll show you how I collect them up I just let it sit here for a minute it's about sixty degrees in here so it's not super warm not super cold but you know just not super warm is important and after letting sit see pretty much just all comes off to the one cage and I mean this is and that is definitely the thickness that I would have this being it's a nice color but as this gets is gonna be really thick this big yield and that's gonna end up darkening up as we get you know more on there now there's a little bit left over on this one Karofsky put it on over here put a little bit of hand heat yeah you really don't need any of those expensive rosin collector glass presses or whatnot this is pretty much how I always do it works really well it was really fast [Applause] it's usually the edges even a point one but this is nice and sugary it's gonna look like flip that one over good handy and again this was a pineapple express bubble hash it was kind of I guess full-spectrum mush obviously the 70 and 90 wasn't in there there was a little bit of five-star 120 in there but mostly it was a four-star like the 37 you and the 25 you like I said thicker this thing good next one goes this is a by far like one of my favorite Rogers right now she really holds the flavor I mean the the parable expressed with some generals of Terps of just bananas I mean former concentrate you make actually haven't done dry sift of it yet but I'm willing to bet that it would jump or the church would even asked flippy-flippy it so importantly at the edges I guess you want to make sure to get it all in one pool and you don't want it too cold like I said about sixty degrees seems to be really nice 65 even if it's too cold it'll be too shattering and if it's too warm you know it'll just melt a little place and stick all over the place and I feel like people would other things people use their like a cold stone so you could take you got like a cold cutting board that's made out of stone he and put that in the freezer for a little while and set these on top but again I feel like that gets it way too cold and I also feel like any kind of freezing like sticking stuff in the freezer is is just it's freezing it then when you take it out all the condensation that's in the room is gonna stick to your rosin or go in it just like you like when you get out of the shower so if you're gonna use any kind of like cold things to make your rods and hardware I would use like the UH fridge for sure seems really dry in there and it's not cold enough to cause condensation usually unless it's just a you know unless you're doing rosin in the bathroom after you take your shower all right I'm gonna go through these really quick looks like this about it sat on it and so we're left with this giant like torpedo here it's like almost a mask look up in the sky it's Rosen man yeah sorry yeah so oh my god that's off camera so I just folded the sides in again whoa when I you know when I if I end up breaking this down will you know I'll make grams will repress them so there's nice and thin and you get that nice gold color I can manipulate this right now and you know and essence start whipping it up and in turn like just the nice gold metallic color it's weird how that happens to it looks like almost like metal but I just want to get weight on this it's a nice little slobby nice little slab or nasty it's always exciting to smoke definitely Rosen episode hold on alright so it looks like 25 grams it's not gonna let me oh well well yeah it's about 25 grams least if I could figure out another way to get the skill on that I don't know what that is as far as percentage its end up being you know 55 between 55 and 60 percent I'm guessing we're gonna go in for another press - that is definitely not all we'll get out of it I bet I'll get another final 5 grams or so out of the second press and then but then coconut caps or caramels or pretty much anything you would put in Jenny had a bowl or anything you would do with oil that wasn't gradient sticking all right well I hope that helps you and your rosin experimenting I will probably go back inside and smoke on this here I'll take a little piece right here let me show you what I was talking about like if I sit and I pull it like Laffy Taffy it's better with the big little piece but I want to keep this stuff kind of shattering and I think this is gonna this is a butter Apple smoke this right now another piece just like right now but it tried it you know it's Laffy Taffy it up real gold got that gold gold look I mean it really looks like metallic gold to focus flash it's kind of making it should make it clean I wish it would focus when I do that ere we go I'll stay focused right there like those gonna focus right maybe it up but if you can do a big glob of it I swear it just looks super reflective and nice I'm gonna go poof on that that smells amazing be back in a second all right let's try this again is a pineapple slab alright alright 25 something Lance the dabs we took all right I just wanted to thank don't make it right now okay so we're back inside and let's see I weighed that stuff for you and I'm sure I put that in on the way out just to make sure that you guys saw and this is I just took a small portion of that and you know check it out for myself I'd end up falling off my desk - shattered a bunch but that's all right flash really is yeah stuff is really really really white life is really making it the dark of it as you can see once it's pressed out it's pretty pretty nice it's a little bit warmer in here now so at least it'll be work better to work with we'll take a hit off of that I ended up doing the math too and we got about 64% on that first press I was pressing a really really low temperature if you saw so I probably could have got a teeny bit more but I'm always going to go through and I'm going to do my little trick to get I don't know probably get between 5 and 10 grams more off of all of that stuff and then we'll have that either the coconut capsules or or some caramels or something cool like that but other than that I hope that really helps some of you guys out that are maybe having problems with blowouts with your hard press I really tried to cover that well like I said it's it's kind of a learning curve but once you get it it's really easy I would definitely look for them to maybe implement something like that maybe not I guess that's fine the way it is yeah I wanted to make me take a Bangor hit too [Music] Oh then we'll put it on there that way it will end up knocking it all off again I could with this way looks like a decent dub I'm gonna bust out the nerd glass in cycler bang your hip banger still looks pretty good let's see this thing uh takes like I mean I'm still had about a minute of this poor old banger if I want a nice really chirpy hit I don't know that's kind of a big one Wilson definitely want to taste a really good one that if you guys want more milk make sure to check out a couple of the other videos on the channel always Melton ups a good hat probably about it and if you have any questions feel free to leave them below down in the comments or you can check out the information or playlists it's where I put the most frequently asked questions and terminology that we use you in community so we'll wait a minute for that I was thinking about making a new playlist to kind of one just for the hard-pressed it seems like it's a pretty popular subject so I want to make sure that I can direct people to that playlist so I'm gonna maybe take a look at that right now I'll probably still leave the other videos up in that playlist but maybe better like that and we still got about 15 seconds all right pineapple express rosin made from bubble hash Cheers oh yeah nice and smooth oh god that nailed us routines crazy crazy retention on that thing we've always had and get in here while this thing's still kind of hot just wait back here whoo yeah that was a brain clear forgot what I was doing for a second definitely nice smooth smooth flavor on that definitely got the pineapple coming through I could have probably taken a a bigger one than that but that's still really rocked oh my brain I'm definitely happy to see that rosin has come around full circle it's it's it's part of people's cannabis experience now and that's awesome I think it's a great alternative it's safe for everybody to do and it can be amazing if done right so that's about all I had to talk about I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll catch you next time", "t8SETC7J6fI": "here we go we're working with some bubble hash that we made here at Coral Cove beautiful bubble house right here just put it in the freezer to get it more of workable so we can put it through here grate it so it breaks it down smaller to help bring bring out the moisture moisture is a killer you get moisture trapped in there and you don't properly cure it you're gonna get you some oldie ash you do not want that gorgeous mm-hmm persecute some stuff we made the other day it's almost nice and cured and dried or taking some of this and we're gonna repress it see what kind of turn and the quality that we get from it here's some more that we made sitting there getting nice and cured here in the frigerator right back to here we're breaking it up a little pieces kind of getting ready to grade to the grater there so we can have it broken up so it dries that are cures that maybe the way to mood because here's some of the rosin that we just made this morning from the hash bubble hash that we've made the other day here so some nice rosin a nice color beautiful hey it's uncle stoner check out more of the videos to come he's out", "zw5P6DHiQYM": "yo what up YouTube alright guys I got my temp set to 175 we're just reaching temp now I just dropped it in I put in a half ounce a little more than a half ounce a bubble hash and just Keef and a bunch of hash little I say about just over a half rounds I'm barely putting any any pressure on this cuz I double begged it let the dirty your microphone screen I just don't wanna have a blowout so I'm taking my time with this low and slow letting it get to temp and then I'll let it heat up for about so you could see the rosin is already trying to melt out but I'm gonna go ahead and let it heat up make sure this the core is nice and gooey before I start to press I don't wanna have a blower like I said I I read this is a totally different way of me pressing guys I made a little like a little pocket and I uh all the rosin is gonna come out through the front every last bit of it like I said I'm not sure exactly what I should yield shouldn't be at least a quarter ounce little more than a quarter ounce maybe 10 grams of rosin and I'm done I'm hoping but we'll see but it should be a decent yield it shouldn't be anything small that's why I went ahead and I put the channels on the side of my parchment paper so that way when it starts to run down it'll actually stop at the edge here and we'll see how much comes out guys like I say I'm not putting any pressure on this the plates aren't even touching it and it's already starting to ooze out like I said it's all about the preheat on the on the on the material you don't wanna you don't want to put it in there and automatically put all kinds of pressure on it cuz you'll blow through your bags unless you're just pressing flour you can do that if you're just pressing a gram or two but if you're using bags it's the best take your time and then lower the tempt better but the product will be as far as you on the product really to be honest some plants will put out more or some pencil to put out less oil or something cloths that be some will come up or shatter like around for a little bit some other to use some of its a little a little bit older but it's still all fire it smells amazing like I said most of this should come out the front like I said I made the little pocket envelope so that way doesn't go all up the sides it pushes the drink out the front starts to cool down immediately it smells amazing really fruity I dropped in about poly four or five different grades of hash from the 80 to the 30 and everything in between she's definitely flowing and like I said I still don't have a lot of pressure on him easing her in the more that I put the faster it coming out whether I'm like I said take your time I'm only running at 175 degrees which is really really low I could have bought even went a little lower this hash was so was so good that it actually started to melt altogether just from touching it so that's how you know it's good quality hash it'll melt in your hand just from the heat of your body so far so good she's running she's looking good that's pretty good amount of well looks a little darker than than what I usually do but it's alright she smells amazing I was planning on making some edibles with this I'll use some of it to dab with as well now I'm putting all the pressure on guys it was not just I can put on I guess as a 12-time prayer so you can see all the different colors and grades of hash inside of this oil it's actually not too bad I bet you thought I'd put it out and find out Little Dipper right it smells amazing it's a big ol blood to lava I think I like this little pocket method that I did I think I'll do this again next time and Ike I say you get it pushes everything out the front I think I'll go out the sides as you can see and it's double triple layered as far as parchment paper goes so I like it I mean I've never done it before so really really good I got a nice little run and didn't quite meet the end of it but that's quite a bit of rosin guys these are my little magnets you can just see how my phone's about to die guys but hopefully you guys liked this video I'll leave it in the comments how much I pulled out in the in the final wait if you guys want to check that out but um yeah have a good one guys stay safe and stay medicated", "CM7BgO_-Huk": "[Music] [Music] [Music] Mina McCain Katrina over FEMA it's like Virgina when you're barely green up like every drug dealer when you really need to rely on the

"this is a follow-up video on the live run so before I get started I went ahead and made some changes to this because I had the wire hanger go over the corners of this because the front plate like this broke off so I wasn't able to put a hanger through there but I did find a little tab on the back side that I could slide the hanger in front of it actually is removable but I need my players I don't really I don't think I have oh here we go but it comes out it's from the plate is removable so if this shorts out or anything I can change it easily just put some new plates on it all right so all right so I here I have just over a ground before you get started I always like to squish it through so it doesn't slide around when I'm pressing it so I'll just go ahead and before it's turned on it's not hot and the nice little talk like that might even just press these together [Applause] when I try and stick it these together and then I'm gonna turn this off after all right so what I have here is just some parchment paper make sure it's parchment paper and that wax paper all right so I got you squished together let me see what a good there we go nice and frosty all right so you want to make sure you got all the debris off of the parchment paper that'll be in your roster what I'm going to do is I'm going to put it on this side and then I'm going to probably squeeze it squish it about 2:1 once the two more times turn this on first I'll let it warm up and I will get back to you guys when it's warmed up all right guys I'm back and it's all heated up we're good to go so I just put that right there in the middle close to the edge and I want to put it all the way at the edge because I want to get you guys a shot of it through the side seeing all those good juices fall out so I wanted to do just realize I made a left-handed vise grip press all right so get it in there push it towards the back yeah let me see if I can focus into that all right you just keep pressing you hear some sizzling might that go on for a little bit you actually can see someone coming out right there it's bubbling all right and then release that was a good one and as you can see right there this works just as good as the real deal and I can probably squish this about once more looks like I got a lot of it so I'll go ahead and do that are you guys here I'm gonna do another close-up of the Rosen oops snapped this one's a little longer it's gonna sizzle and then you're gonna see some coming out on the edges squeeze a little bit more and then release there's really no timing for this I mean pretty much the school by ear line as you go if you haven't done this before all right so I'm gonna throw this in the freezer real quick and then I'll just try to get it all stuck together then I'll show you guys once it's a hardened alright I'm back again and I'll just show you this real quick a little close-up on this the Nugget that I pressed you can see some oil this is gonna be left behind you know can't really help that it's just a little bit though this is not completely done though you can actually probably press this one more time and after it's brown and decarboxylated you'll be able to you can just pretty much eat this like a chip grind it up put it in some coffee I mean look at a lake at least a little high depending on how much you ingest cannabis so I did go ahead and I threw this in the freezer for about 30 seconds and the dial on hot plates was about at a 10 to 15 so about half way you can see that this is a nice golden color this is right here is the first one and you can see how just [ __ ] gorgeous this is it is a bit warming a show it is still kind of gooey but I threw it in the freezer so I could hurt it a little bit when I scrape it this down here is the second round not bad at all for just over your grand all right so I am gonna scrape this and I will get back to you guys so in order to make this easier for you guys what you're gonna want to do is put a little bit of water and a baggie freeze it and then put the parchment paper on top of that baggie and start scraping it's going to make it a whole lot easier it's going to come up with ease thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed it and you any questions or comments comment down below", "LOElLD68v8s": "get a good life [Music] [Music] we're back we're doing another press with

of pressure we're running this at 109 degrees or under 90 degrees we just breached up to stage three we're still pressing we're gonna scoop this to collect or again where if you guys just joined us one of bras endeavor so we're at stage three and counting each stage is about 53 seconds the liquify time was 30 seconds 160 second total stages total cycle 45 46 thousand 46,000 pounds on the on the game we just went up to stage four so we're at 7,000 pounds of force which equivalent to about a hundred and forty thousand pounds 75 tons of pressure under a hundred and thirty one hundred under 130 square inches of surface area it looks like this is definitely going to reach what the test was the test tested at twenty nine percent return and I'm pretty sure that this quarter pound is going to throw about 25 28 grams let's see we'll see it's almost off the parchment paper under there when we are at Stage four we're fitting it fish finishing up this full cycle you guys just joined us is more we're here at a stiched area here shooting a function video this is what the will be you're going on YouTube the self collecting we're at ninety three percent ninety three percent runoff so you got eight percent maximum amount of oil being stuck within your your your parchment paper so there's no need for scraping it's almost all self collected yeah we just finished the cycle we're back at home so let's pull this out it's for what have we got in the oven here what do we got okay that's quite a lot of oil I mean that's a quarter pound JK there was a twenty eight grams per bag for bags let me

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "q772B_dsYgQ": "so the most questions I've been receiving from the Rossum tutorial video is where to get these filters from this is a 25 micron filter for ordering them on eBay they come in a4 sheets a little bigger depending on how much you want to order and you can cut them to size for various types of hash weights to ground well then whatever you want to do depending on what you like to achieve and sometimes when I'm just cleaning bits of already made of oil then I use very small bits and wrap them up but this is about giving people the opportunity to do it for themselves where they might not have access to gain this kind of stuff so simple solution French coffee press or a French press coffee press or whatever you want to call it it's a particular type of one it has the three parts sandwich on the bottom and it allows you to unscrew this part you don't want to have one where they've actually glued it all together and you'll notice that on the ones that are poor quality they tend to have a nylon filter here but what you ideally want is one that's in three parts like this where you can take it apart and this filter that's left behind I would say looking at it could be between 50 and 90 micron but it's difficult to tell but it's better than nothing and it will clear your hash and clean your hash to a relatively good level although you may still get some residue when dabbing although that's a small price to pay for at least having access to some kind of good filter and you can always wash it once again once you've cleaned the oil in order to make it a little bit cleaner than it originally was if you can find anything finer than this then please let me know because it'd be nice to share with other people that this is the best I've found so far that's available in most normal shops or supermarkets", "U_ii5v41qGI": "welcome pots price pros we just went over the fact that the camera you press the camera button it takes the picture it doesn't record this is that right Joshua oh shut up hey alright so one I need to depress a little bit of rosin cuz it didn't have any more left so I figured you know what let's make a crazy quick rods and press video for y'all alright so what are we going to be present today well my friends we're going to be pressed in 36 grams of hashish this is hashish that is made from the sugar that comes off of now we don't hear advocate the usage of machine trimmers to pot squash bubbles however a lot of growers do use them so we were able to get our hands on some nice aged hashish from machine trim now this stuff it's probably about 8 to 12 month old so whether you'll notice about that when you put some stuff that's at age is it'll come out a little bit darker quite dark actually but that's not a bad thing it was like oh man that mouth and it's brown it's dark that's bad I'll [ __ ] off man light colors come from nubile track rose a jet track Chrome's will [ __ ] you up just as much if not more so in certain capacities but they're just really dark when they come out now one thing to remember too it's normally our pressing tamp in general is 104 it works for everything at least in terms of what we have found at celcius for you Yanks out there it's probably about a 218 5 and Fahrenheit I think but so when stuff is super aged okay um you're gonna have to press it twice to get the initial pull I'm normally gonna then after those first two press it another one to two times you keep pressing until [ __ ] comes out you can keep your bras and separate or you can just put it all into a big knob and flow get that's what I do so the first thing we're gonna [ __ ] do is you're gonna take your first paper we're using parchment paper do not use wax paper and you will make a [ __ ] mess okay we'll put the first one down there or take this Thome our press is not heated yet that's alright we're gonna keep it on while it's heating up cuz that's just gonna help to start to activate and release the shiznit we are using new press bags that are canadian press bag made they can handle up to 20 tons and they are bigger than the rosin evolution bags and cheaper so I will get you the name of that if not in the video I will do that in the comments of the video or not the comments the information but I am sold I will continue to buy these one thing I will show you when pressing hash is I've so at the top of the bag just get a rough loose so on top of there just to help the good [ __ ] stay in fact do you know I'm Sam so it's gonna take a minute or so to heat this up I've got mine programmed and ready to go so once I just turn her on she's good to go so this is an achene YZ knockoff version of an American wood it works just fine I wish I would have known that it was a knockoff when I ordered it I found that out after buying it because the original itself would have cost me about 100 bucks more and I would have spent that 100 bucks but this one the one thing I find interesting about this one where it's different than the American one is that they've they've just kind of gone basic on it and they've run two separate controllers that's why there's two separate plugs running each controller one controllers running one plate the other controllers running the other plate that's kind of interesting for what it is it works well we will be eventually here at pots pots growers be making you a new age kind of a breath and what does that price gonna consist uh well we're gonna go get like a six to ten ton and dust real just press and then we can we can buy the controllers and plates from a second company and then all we got to do is install that attached on the industrial press that will be run by an air compressor and we'll crank your [ __ ] [ __ ] on is it gonna be overkill well yeah but it's fun so why the [ __ ] not as you can see here our left controller is reading a 52 right now 53 we're at a 48 on the right so we're waiting till it hits 104 degrees centigrade and then we'll be ready and then we're pressing for about 45 seconds there's normally what I do I use the same press times for flour I use it for everything you know in earlier videos we went through [ __ ] and we fermented and [ __ ] around with [ __ ] and for me personally I just find that this works the best in terms of having a median that works for all different types of pressing materials whether it's flour and straight-up keyfitz old age add things or as Josh here he has a close friend who's developed a you know a way to do live rosin we get to experiment with this one where they're doing a dry I sipped off brand new plants they cut them down live and freeze them alive and then harvest that [ __ ] so we're gonna eventually try that it's just you know lifetime money goddammit right alright so what are we doing right now we just wait yeah 81 is 74 we're waiting sorry that this takes a while I probably should have preheated the press before I started the video I even thought about that earlier but [ __ ] it so how are you today is on well have a nice day is the pod squad squall Robert feeling good as you can see the clones are doing well the slowly taken we will not talk too much about the clones right now cuz we will be releasing on Saturday a one week of vegetation video update um you can see some yellow got certain leaves one that began during the cloning process we planted them a little bit later than we meant to as well as well you're planting a case there's gonna be some mild damage to your - to the root balls which is going to exhibit and some of the first second third knodel's up to the top but as you can see the new growth on all of them is looking gorgeous and sexy the one that knowing think about this rosin press here is it beeps and then the other controller hits 104 is gonna beep to the what beeps the whole time all you need to do is take it apart and cut the power cable the hot wire feeding into the speeds ahead won't do it any more I haven't done it another one of those things where I mean to do it just haven't had a chance to now she ready so remember this first press is just waking it up and then we're gonna go right into a second press right away there we go always take especially if you're using like kind of a more of a knockoff version one take it slowly when you're bringing it up to pressure if you go too quickly you might snap you might Bend something then you just [ __ ] your machine given the knocked off nature quote-on-quote of it you know just take it [ __ ] low take your [ __ ] slow you know what I'm saying and just you know be prepared to just do it we got 20 seconds left on this press what we're gonna do is we're gonna open the press up right away we'll show you real quick and then we're gonna go right back down onto it because we something when it's been aged this long you got to do it so we're pressing again 36 grams of hash and two rosin we'll show you that I'm gonna keep pressing it and collect it and then I'll put a little clip at the end of this video showing you the final product all right now we're gonna open that up so as you can see next to nothing has come out right right so now let's show you what happens when we double tap it's like Zombieland double tapping now there we go now we're gonna wait another 45 seconds while this [ __ ] is pressed and and then we'll show you what the first press excretion is gonna look like and I'm gonna press another two times we will not be showing you all those precedents I'm just gonna keep making it and then I'll put a clip on in the end it's gonna show you what the [ __ ] came out of those a Chad we did it is they're gonna say that's right well you know bras and press videos are fun you know we're pressing 36 grams of hashish right now so that's telling them to use it right I think that's pretty cool Road House Road House ditch right these cones I've given up on cuz we forgot to flush out the inside of the air pump that we had a resurgence of the goopy [ __ ] so basically one of the tricks is is I think what I'm gonna do going forward is is flush out the inside of the air pump with isopropyl alcohol just to kill all that [ __ ] yeah we're gonna pull that up and now as you can see press one is yielded a decent a little mouth there but when we get that out and we keep pressing this on first and second two and three with ages [ __ ] it often will excrete more than later presses so for now we're gonna let that cool off I'm gonna harvest it I'm gonna keep pressing this [ __ ] we'll check in with you show you what the [ __ ] table look like you know there first everybody welcome back pot squats but we are done present there is the bras on see if we can get it to autofocus hey yo but as you can see my autofocus is being a charged auto focus off let's see if I can now tell it to focus on its own accord well I'm sorry everybody it's just not focusing very well there we go as you can see she's looking nice and sexy now that is called rosin and that's called davon made from old aged hashish the essence that hashish has been squished out it made into sticks there you know I'm saying hashtag boom so but before we end this video we're gonna show you Josh buddies you take the phone right now please and thank you I'm gonna rip this [ __ ] off and see how much it weighs so we just got a piece of parchment paper there that we put on there we've tearing it we're at zero now I'm gonna try to get this donkey take off this [ __ ] thing Oh [ __ ] it up your autofocus was off that's why yeah the autofocus on its phone twist Rudy there we go so obviously we've still got a bit of rosin left on that but not a big deal some of the rust is gonna come off with your hands you could wear gloves and that's totally fine I just don't for me I don't give a [ __ ] but so the moment of truth turn around just well you need to look this way drum roll please no no no no twelve point three grams of rosin 12 point two grams of rosin so what we need to do in order to do is mrs. Potts lash did you pull up the calculator on your phone quickly for me and divide 12.25 36 I tried to do that my head we got roughly thirty three point six eight four five percent return it's pretty good basically petting on the edge of your eyes in the age of your Keefe or the age of the key theme to the - if you're pressing on your return is gonna usually be anywhere from the very low-end 15-20 percent I've had returns up to as high as about forty seven percent forty seven percent either comes off some of this particularly resonance of a strain into because will do that fresh you're younger things will have slightly higher through turns but those are the aged fresher ones so if you'd go like the live rosin thing my experiments anyway with it it returns a little bit less than it ages and returns a bit more and then it returns a little less at the end but regardless of anything this is a 12 point two gram gob rosin that shit'll get you high [ __ ] and the fact the matter is you know that's not bad that's the bit of a taupe there toko - you know I'm saying but this is hot flash but was saying it word do your [ __ ] mother well do another Rossum press video tune in next time on Saturday for us to give you the update on the bench and clothes piece to [ __ ] out mother [ __ ] love you", "5tYnsLLORno": "why I love it yeah I don't feel good thank you for joining us again it is here hanging out in the garage managed to catch Rick this time getting ready for rosin press cinch you can't have my bad oh I haven't seen this in a while I forgot that that selfie stick I had has a cover been some time since I've been hanging out in the garage oh we just chilling watching Rick do his thing today he was up last night sifting a bubble hash washing the cannabis to collect that bubble hash [Music] yeah so he washed this and then sent it overnight in the vacuum oven now it's optimal for squeeze there - two trays of the bubble hash ready to do the thing yeah good to sit down [Music] 25 micron 2.5 by 4.5 inch nylon mesh bag break pulled the bag lifted inside out Oh see the bag show up like this what Rick did was flip it inside out so that the seam is on the outside he uses two bags one inside the other for these different bags mixing it up well full-spectrum you dude or vaping hidden Chad says how you Rick are you doing but good day for you good game for us most definitely I don't forgive my dude that was drawn back by hope you had a good morning after we be chilled there he's just dropping into all that bubble ash she had multiple samples and he just mixed them together to get one larger load we're using these 25 micron two and a half by four and a half inch nylon mesh bags its flipped inside out he's gonna put two together for one press two bags for one press this is what they would look like afterwards you could collect RI so you can make alcohol tincture with these thereafter I've seen many folks like Pedro's grow room the dizzy grower they do it you could throw it into a coffee machine where you put the grounds and running with hot water and drink that you just won your hemp our company GG nice and the stage is playing it - that's awesome thanks for hanging out and playing those games with us chillin there watching the whole sesh that's cool I appreciate that that's exciting you know cuz I've been talking to a few folks and I do a bunch of these bigger collaborations you know like I'm doing the AG rain and empires it's something where it's like oh you know I'm good down I'm doing like a sponsored session playing the game to showcase it but it's been really fun actually getting to chill with you guys and like just enjoy it together you know that's it so like that's one of the last games I expected to to play with you guys like that you know when you get to the enterprise let me know lajiye yeah are those a normal app supply items purposed or are they new to the industry the simpler banks will no these are for the dealer - bags they're tea bags they've been around for a century and just start being used you know from the last ten probably years of US personnel for this and made specifically for it as you can whities it this is it's nylon and then there whatever it is it's good for ya Obama temperature from plastic and then the the other ones silk yeah so before yeah like major quotes that were in the game doing stuff like this before anyone else like BC bubbleman I have my HP unlock it'll be three for twenty one point six over twenty one point six zero the bag out are the scale-out filled the bag so you now watch so there's yeah these are new industry-specific yeah Rick was say like yeah they've been using the same material for different things coffee tea silk screen printing BC bubbleman is known for that that's where he got started with his own sessions using the same material that they would use to make silk screen printing first was a silver screen it was framed piece of silk screen that a silk screen are used for making as you do you need your HQ a lot for that I'm sorry to get to the enterprise it over get it in here betting it yeah purposes keeping it folded like that and I take it from this stage right here which even out as best possible they're put in there hold that one over I take it to this press over here cats later a letter the cat-lair yeah we don't mess with it because it's the cats lair I just I don't need to anyway I just want to set that there close it properly put a piece of paper over yeah we come in peace it's okay buddy won't touch you babe you want to touch the battery promise this is a three-tone manual repressive and he said that say this is my I can never find Peter Barca that's been on here for a year now and I just stand on it give it only that much pressure because it was actually attached to something and I really pulled down on it with my weight and it would get serious with the way it says right now this much right here is enough to make it actually start to ooze stuff out with no heat ooh feels mighty wet we might have a little issue here feel that yeah too much water in it still still boys you're knocked out buddy I don't want to run into you yeah no worries it's Louie here for a peer to peer review in that pot top oh yeah he's all sharing that inside we've learned a lot from other folks too Barney this is way too wet but presses right now the rossignol snap crackle and pop moisture in it yeah we really hard to get down so I got to figure out it quickly get it out meanwhile I swear this don't like warm up that that the skillet on the stove top Moisture banks pressing urine my first press help was with the heads I lived with we made shirts off the screen so I hear you they're just so little to convey in short messages the panel super-agent the other way to try that was just instead of plays there yeah Oh what we do for for drying it without getting into an oven or a microwave we have a skillet with a metal top and he turns on the skillet eats it up puts the cover back on and then sets it there he's just setting it on top of the metal plate so this is the shot press that we use for pressing our rosin he got those aluminum blocks custom machined by a friend that has a shop it's connected the top and bottom plates by 4 stripper bolts and springs he's got these two PDI's for heating elements what yeah what he just did was actually just set it on top of this to let it let it heat up it's not yeah it's it's warm but it's not gonna like bake it off or anything microwave might bake it off yeah that's definitely not a good idea two points that are touching metal working on this piece of metal yeah just resting it on top of those except for burritos and tear water yeah you know those things things you're going to eat consumes that are good for that but no don't go don't go trying to dry something in the microwave that's not a good idea that's the first yeah it's a larger block of metal compared to what people are normally using they'll use thinner blocks or smaller blocks all together you know so the use of those those yeah I think I said pdip ID and you really only need one if you have smaller blocks that's totally fine yeah you know the hotter you go more terpenes ear burning ah - street gear you know head what's up oh are you sure I don't think we're holding you that hostage and what's in the house more than out power in the garage [Music] oh dear Lord I know all's well feeling it's doing the thing [Music] Oh all the goods in the buckets still life is it taking the material Alton they so this is he's here Hey Bobo as well hey guys they posted a picture on Instagram with the grow tent behind us we can't show you during the daytime because the lights are off from 8:00 right lead the morning to 8:00 at night yeah it's on the flower cycle twelve hours on twelve hours off but I posted a picture of the first day transplanted an updated photo where they were doing so hot after watering and another update there after about a week later where they have bounced back in flower cycle they're doing good now the cat is entertaining what do you got going down [Music] moisture chest why though it's a garage buddy yeah laughter normally labs don't have that yeah they don't they don't have a vise [Music] you've seen his fat head wait there's that's not the same temperatures way lower the pin setup those bolts Pandorum days here they're called stripper poles there's actually Springs on the cavity for the springs to fit in when it's closed that way when I release the pressure it automatically pushes it up this is part of a punch press which would you know as a replicating machine in industry of metal plastic paper all kinds of different applications actually seems like we have a spider [Music] sorry pop history can't are you done being a hostage you'd like to go now consent from Europe over there 30 loans or even pound animal repurchase or reunion freebie oh definitely recycled that's a recycled cat for damn sure because he came here and hung around for the last year oh yes all last year he was here from the year before so must like this this is working properly here yes he chose us we are worthy he used to give us dagger eyes glare at me and try and piss in my car if I left the windows down yeah you did mine too yeah and and then we kidnapped him years later and asked both of our dogs they learned to respect him and he doesn't bother you anymore No Oh papa stray cat I'm sorry Anna - yeah you just like this space yeah that's this is the schizo cat yeah I would definitely gets a little weird on you all right it's right there in your face when I'm in this basement he's the first animal I've seen that definitely showing signs of pts I've never seen a cat give the thousand-yard stare I was even a blob one day and now you guys were here I was streaming it and and he was he was getting all lovey I was petting him and he went laid next to me and fell asleep and he starts trembling in his sleep no this is a grow tent it's it's beat the hard tech walls are extra insulation the we're on a gigantic concrete slab it's been in the 40s and 50s and drop into the 30s at night so we initially put up this wall to be honest with you because my cats kept trying to jump onto the top of it and they clawed the [ __ ] out of one wall so it's got light leaks now and it was protected from tax lightly insulation thereafter [Music] [Music] growing your garden looks very nice there the local hemp grow picture [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] papers all right we're not allowed to go an h-back yeah cool man thank you that was a really nice gallery in the garden yeah there was leftover chips they just been sitting around for now I need to find a reliable source for supplies to make alcohol teachers Thor guard and then I can make more RSO style teacher with these pups that Rick uses there's been floating around well certainly this method as well yeah the the our is oh I put my folds up and we seen to the rear slip it in there and so like it's hard to tell where you're at in the center okay uh tears Joey yeah man definitely I just need to find a reliable source for alcohol we'll make our own everything okay yourself good yeah we have hash that we washed water hash bubble hash this is a DIY shop press with those aluminum blocks the plates are held together with stripper bolts and springs PID heating elements are attached on both sides left and right top and bottom he's got a heat probe right there yeah evening yeah I can trick about 180 max those those plates the it'll it'll get heat up to that but it doesn't really because it's wicking the heat aways more rapid rate than the bottom which is barely insulated but it does make a difference I found when I have a ball set of the same temperature I would get up lower temple on the top for a longer time and it would take way longer for it to CW yeah I mean this is the press the time I press anyway is between one 180 and 200 this likes to come out at 180 usually don't like crazy yeah oh damn there them in Terps the bubbling is the Terps and that steam is that water water hopefully it's all gonna leave like that right now which does help push it out though yeah - there is it will act as a sponge yeah full of moisture yeah there was moisture in the bubble ash still he actually took the second tray of bubble hash and put it back in the vacuum of it this one he just like the the plates were heated so he had it all together already when he put the two nylon bags together you could see as the bag squeezed there was moisture coming out of the bubble hash still so he just set the bag on top of the plates and let him heat for a minute before doing this pressing yeah that steam that is moisture the bubbling is terpenes burning olive oil yeah from the higher tamp now that's a really nice color that's a really nice color what hopefully we'll have a half house here for us yeah this is oh how much was that 21 points 21 point 3 grams of bubble hash in that nylon bag yeah yeah a combination of pressure and heat these aluminum blocks have been heated with those PIDs they've been incorporated into the shop press incorporating the bubble hash into nylon press nylon screen bags 25 micron two and a half by four and a half inch nylon mesh bag filled it with the bubble hash pressed it roughly 180 degrees Fahrenheit yeah this is switching it all when you first put it in this year wouldn't have a chance to get out and it will the bag yeah yeah infected angel this is most certainly not a press that you could buy at the store stop this one in particular this was assembled with multiple pieces look at that right there is a different piece those are all different accessories just thrown into one setup they sell outfits like this for about similar anyway for without this of a big maybe narrower and wide we are a DIY there are folks out there that are doing it major Pedro's grow room that Deuter Pedro has got it down if you do not see what he is doing here on Twitch check it out on Instagram as well Pedro's grow room the dizzy grower please those are the folks that are like this is this is their realm yeah Rick's been exploring the different parts of this processing the cannabis wares that we get we had a lot of stuff that we've been playing around with since summer yeah people have started selling setups online where you could buy a press like this and it has the heating elements and the plates ready to go [Music] yeah low temps a really good company they've been out there they're doing the thing major we've been following their endeavors for a while I recommend them as well low temps been been in been on point that looks like the devil's food yeah there you go how the parchment paper is folded no custom there's a really cool way to do it but I'm not origami I'm Rick you know someday maybe yeah yeah see Thor guard you could see there's porous air pockets in the puck still that most definitely still has some stuff that you could run through at a base or so this thing did weigh say was seven grams six no it had 21.3 then all we there's two bags we got us a fat half gram baby that's point zero three there yeah nice 15 grams of rosin returned from 21 grams of bubble hash buddy that's the way we do it no we don't dabble with CBDs they're not very much here but not too many yeah factory this is a result of processing the closed trim was that what you add or did you close the Lark buds lor feet close trim bud yeah yeah close trim large small buds washed with distilled water bubble hash yeah yeah distilled water and clear ice yeah that's a fatty there yeah it's a nice return man yeah that's just half of it there's still the other batch out there needs to be squashed yeah there's another batch but it had moisture in it so I sent it out yeah you could still see it in this I could see that yeah there's some oh well we're gonna smoke it it's personal yeah it's not something we're selling it's DIY we're learning as we go and this was a learning experience the bubble hash was more had more moisture than normal um he he put it on the the metal plates like he just sat the the puck this one that before he pressed that he put it on here to dry it off someone was trying to recommend microwave dry oven could work we had a skillet with a metal plate that we could heat up and do the same thing yeah but you're just gonna want to try and get a dryer beforehand I mean this we don't mind this isn't anything that's gonna be an issue it'll be smoked up before that becomes an issue people will tell you that extra moisture in the rosin could be detrimental if you're storing it for long and people will make it to store and have it for multiple months like six months plus and if that moisture is left behind in there it can be a hazard that's how that's how you get the the culture in the rosin in the concentrates yeah freeze dryer oh yeah dude I'm telling you once I get a freeze dryer in my life we're next level I try to go in when we leave jerky mocha die just leave it as is and those trips are going away yeah they're just on their way to being gone yeah I just I just myself I don't I don't really see a benefit in in like putting the bubble hash in the microwave to to to get it dryer you know that just is it seems extremely unreasonable yeah exactly yeah it will get moved if you if you store it for long periods and it has moisture like this this that if you if you store this for a long period you can get mold in this concentrate because there's more moisture than normal it is not decarboxylated there you go so recommendations decarboxylate make sure that your bubble hash is nice and dry we use a vacuum oven freeze dryer works here here your hash before pressing and you get better results less moisture no zero moisture that that also has a different effect on it I've never stored it in the freezer I'm uncertain folks will store their concentrates like certain sauces and stuff in fridges and stuff look first classes yeah a freezer could could give it it could be exposed to moisture again as it gets ice and stuff in it at ease dad oh yeah that's like that's Jesus Louise if we had tons of this this would be cool and dry for storage refrigerators good a freezer will reintroduce it to moisten have to hit up the president for a book the president you know for a dodo I don't hit the taste of this you able to instantly cure all problems the world you're probably going to tweet about it then and it'll be a bad thing flavor profile that's still at the common I'm lost for worse I don't even know what to say the flavor is I've ever fire I mean it's a it's not a cush it's not a berry it's not a cam it's it's purple but I've never tasted this purple but like yeah oh for sure yeah like like mad if you if you had if you had a proper sealed container that you could host your concentrates in in the freezer it'll it'll have a it'll stand a chance you know like if you were to try and just take this fold it up and throw it in the freezer you're gonna have a button talk close show yeah that's that's something for sure if you had like a proper container that sealed it kept the moisture out sure it worked yeah definitely I don't know I don't think I have any at the moment oh my lunchbox actually yeah please have those back man like this this will help it like this kind of container oh geez cheese and crackers what you do the cat's name Rick calls him buddy I call him pop the stray cat he is a hostage aren't you we're holding you against to it will but it's better than your previous living conditions so you're like good for me [Music] [Music] that's awesome haha isn't it something yeah all right now put that there booty blues the second please but of course like John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt I bet I'm from California born and raised I've only been hanging out briefly throughout the North American Southwest yeah [Applause] Oklahoma's nice yeah this band name is really good with that they've lost though I agree with that yeah I got merch I got actually a switching stores I got approved to make my merch store with the stream elements you guys don't know I'm endorsed by stream elements check them out a stream element dream team I'll use their software it's [ __ ] badass they have helped me put together a more appropriate mobile stream yeah this was made by nug assassin og custom the first one ever I have one more place than spending these but I'm switching over to a new spot so y'all I just said it Jermaine I don't know if you missed that California you check out the info below the broadcasting video for commonly asked questions I get asked that every day at least 10 times a day oh I want this yes to do that I vacuum obviously yeah more of an eagle lemon yeah that was a very lemon citrus flavor right great yeah it did it was it was like it was two steps closer to pine-sol lemon citrus but not chemical taste oh no actually oh gosh I just got a hint of like orange like orange peel yeah Rick was washing the material and he had the bag with the material still and it smelled like a fresh orange grove yeah orange blossoms orange blossoms and orange rind that's what that's what that was very much tasting like yeah that's that's a negative I do not make my own ice we don't have a water source like that we just go and get clear ice from the store that's the best advice we can give you without telling you what to do and what to buy it's a that's a personal preference kind of deal you know putting some thought research into what you want to do [Music] [Music] [Music] you know you're not alone out here oh that's a nectar collector yeah it's where you have a glass rod that's a straw and there's a little bubble or chamber that you can put water makes it cooler to hit ah keep breeding never stop learning pay attention that's really where it's at yeah understand the basics before you start looking into splits specific topics understand the process as a whole before you begin to fine-tune steps in the process it's critical [Music] [Music] I get the carb cap-vert back Oh baby [Music] I'm cleaning it right gonna get like that [Music] [Music] swallow eggs oh geez or whatever [Music] that sounds nice hey Graham we're in my garage I used to film in here like 95 percent of the time [Music] [Music] yeah it's pretty stable kinda goofy but we're still fresh whoa [Music] yeah that was very much citrusy I have a strong flavor of orange blossoms yeah I'm good for a moment that was that was pretty good what do you mean what do you mean what do you say beat the crap out of a jolly [Music] [Music] this applies to to wash bubble hash are very cost effective compared to a pricing tumbler broken gaming just depending on what you want to do it's a little more work by hand to get that that Russell versus the versatility and ease abuse of the tumbler yeah we have oh man we used to use the silicon spatula 10 the paint sorry the plastic paint mixer head and now rick has a metal one that has got better results with this one [Music] without extra insurance little beat stump up and you'll get a lot of green because out of that extra kind of extra clear or water cold to wash through your product as you're sifting it through the screens don't think it's done when it's there into the fresh water with the under pressure like I do here I have a bottle that has a little tiny hole and I might squeeze it out it's good then tree now yeah this helps my friend the paint mixer does well on a drill he did that with a plastic with the plastic head and we use this for mixing our supplements and this this is is what would you could use a paint mixer for beating up that bubble hash when washing it Rick upgraded that was a destroyed though individual cookin all off from ice it doesn't like ice as I imagine that doing that [Music] [Music] yeah I have not tried dad Ross's snow Oh lineup [Applause] will there be a video on the stuff I missed I'm going to upload this video to YouTube Graham for sure we've explained the majority of this process and what happened today for this KRAS impressive oh I don't fit is there gonna be a pop quiz yes I gotta start doing the PQ pop quizzes see if people are paying attention and keep you guys prizes that sounds like a good idea cuz I'm always like why did I just get through telling you of constantly getting these these silly guys I want to be smart and I'm like wait a minute you've been sitting here this whole time aren't you listening pop quiz then you get some candy yep Lay's returns our but it is goal three grams I've never oppressed 30 grams but we're going to press 30 grams today we're gonna test these bags I already know how to do it so we won't ruin them but that's just a thread that's a more than an ounce and three-quarters [Music] well morning larkey trim big leaves all nine yards we're outdoor I've mentioned it forgot to mention what oh that's magical dude oh yeah thank you Mike I appreciate that yeah now the moisture test comes out in the first wish yeah Sour Diesel would be wonderful we got a sample we grew it for a little bit and it was not what we were looking for I'm looking for the og Sour Diesel it used to be in a little shocking come on over by Eagle Rock learn from experienced research study should we throw up the advice command my friends because that's legitimately what what we did Rick's been growing for a while taken in all of his own experience taking his experience from previous hobby skills employment I think much better and incorporated it into what we do now little moisture yeah yeah you could also yeah exclamation point info there's a wealth of information that's present on the World Wide Web what I gotta clean my rake well here's yeah yeah it is true THC P&C BDP THC phosphor CBD phosphor they found the cannabinoids are multiple that they believe is like they just are doing they've always been there we just are learning more about it's not new I've been saying it this entire time there are hundreds of strains different phenotypes terpene content hundreds upon hundreds of cannabinoids it's there's there's so many it's it's like gonna have 27 people growing Sour Diesel and not one of them would be the same yep and they all miss our diesel emanate and if they were checked back in their lineage with DNA testing office salaries yeah we were recently informed of another thing within plant plant esters plant alcohols this is something else that the plant produces to give off that pungent scent and taste a lot of us covertly send and taste to the terpene profile of the plant but it is also these things like the plant esters yeah oh like there's there's Gorilla Glue as a string and like we were saying you could have one strain and have so many different phenotypes those phenotypes vary based on genotypes the genotype is that period in which our breeding plants and it's affected by certain parts of the environment and how it's grown we've been talking kindly about the plants anthocyanins the pink pistol og church that we have in our backyard garden we had plants that were pollinated during a certain fall season growing outdoors while the plant kicked in the anthocyanins to grow stretch get the purple coloration to collect more energy and light where there is less energy in length and while that was going on and was pollinated and so this is what they would call a genotype and the seeds that it produces give off a wide variety of phenotypes that then are based off of that genotype and so we got a round of cannabis that we call the pink pistol OG Kush because it was a oh jee plan that was giving us fuchsia pink hairs and that was something a phenotype physical attribute attributed to the mother being grown and bred in the cold and the anthocyanins taking it you know thank you for listening to my rant about plants all right I just kind of like my eyes roll in the back of my head and I started talking about [ __ ] that's good [ __ ] you can hit something like that your brain functions as well right yeah that was that cannabis - yeah that's what it's all about yes Pee Wee's the pheno is mom yeah it's really cool I have pictures of it on Instagram it was really unique a bunch of the hair is actually turned normal like at first instead of being white or like they go white turn fuchsia and then go back to normal turn origin stuff you know it's cool it's really neat seeing that stuff ya understand what it is that you're doing with it you know I don't mean the bag like on what we were talking about yesterday I know freewheel that's here we were talking about he said growing weed is easy you could grow the plant for sure you could take a scene or a clone transfer it from pot to pod in the Sun let it grow and give it food thank you something will you can buy it the shelf or whatever but not a lot of people understand what I just explained like none of that you know it could be done but understanding well your what you're doing is a little more complicated you know that it's like so many things with it that that are very complicated oh man I was looking at that that YouTube channel you posted the other day is pretty good man there's really wild see a cannabis like that those are land restraints we were talking about different types of genetics and stuff and like where they have plants growing outside in Nepal where they've been growing for hundreds of years that's where you'll find that Landorus small ranches often 30-footers to make their temple match our presidents rude that was drugs so yeah I can't believe it affected that part of the world no clothes I did not go to school for plants or anything I used to work for a farm I used to shadow farmers a horticulturalist Master Gardeners working on projects and regarding channel in regards to composting and stuff I took multiple seminars training with a couple folks that help Jeff lowenfeld make his trio of books teaming with microbes teaming of Plenty teaming of nutrients I do my own personal research I've been working with a lot of stuff firsthand working with Rick voluntarily just doing my thing he let me take over the propagation vegetative cycle chamber and work on that for the last seven years and I just like kind of what's BS I'm sorry like this leave ladder Folsom grower was claiming they had found old special seeds that whose rosin and well it can't be a thing yeah I don't know of years back now had seeds from 96 1996 was a date on that handle though from Barney's farm yeah yeah I'm I'm more about like I said peer to peer review insight negative criticism couldn't go out the door I mean you're more than welcome to talk about things and have points but like provide input with information and a source or something besides that that opinion you know counterproductive it doesn't really add to the conversation with anything besides I don't know what it's not definitely not productive that's not what I'm here for not here to talk [ __ ] I'm here - oh oh yeah don't berate educate how's it going that's tricky stuff right there [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] I have a YouTube channel I post videos very seldomly there's a bunch of you see it's like how exactly the successful braided joint but there's actually like floating videos and this one today is going to get uploaded because it's very informative and there's a lot of information that I provided that I also was able to obtain from chat like I said the inside and peer to peer review it's crucial it's critical there are folks that don't understand these things and to be able to clarify provide proper terminology for these processes it's it's beneficial it's critical it's healthy it's good for us to be able to do this intere you know yeah I've been sitting daily allsorts activity variety streaming games cannabis cultivation different parts of the process yeah so there's this culture you should totally look it up about this dude that's doing the scope project to revive older strains we dig coal to heard back in the 80s a lot of folks I repeat in this video during during the 80s we went to that indoor culture growing inside under the radar trying to be discreet with it with scented smell and so we did lose a lot of varieties that gave off those things like I said the plant esters es th ers these plant esters the alcohol plant alcohol is something else that like I said they contributes to the taste and scent of the plant and when we were doing Oh God what we were doing all sorts of bowling of the herd trying to grow discreetly in the 80s we lost those those varieties that were producing those things in masks like we said people have been breeding to get higher cannabinoid producing but higher yielding buds shorter Bushehr plants it's messing with that genetic system yeah straight namings ridiculous but that's something else completely different from what we're talking about what's been discussed what's going on with the stream I don't know like I'm growing the OG Kush we have we have friends that are doing the thing but it is what it is a name is just a name you know look look to other parts of the cannabis beyond the name you know while we can have those places that origin genetics that are from Landrus and the original stuff it's like us humans you know people go out and talk about how they are one race you go and take a DNA test the human race there's all sorts of different pieces of genetics from different regions of the world you know yeah and so that will be the same thing with cannabis you'll either continue inbreeding Landrus or you'll start crossing stuff and get new things change is good there's nothing wrong with that yeah so once I'd like to see it nope premature failure there of too much pressure in the bag less steam more product bubbles are slightly clearer colors golden [Music] right now we're using a combination of pressure and heat heating elements attached to these aluminum blocks pressed in a shop press we're using nylon 25 micron mesh bags to impress this bubble hash is going to feel now it's time to get crazy was pretty good earlier in the video we talked about the moisture that's going on here this stuff could definitely have gone a little longer in the vacuum oven to dry it there's a little more moisture it's not enough to be an issue if you're storing solvent lists concentrates like this for long periods of time the moisture content that is present can be an issue storing for long periods of time with that extra moisture can lead to mold in your rosin so do not take something like this and store it for long periods of time as I've described a couple times in the video thirty point zero three grams a vacuum oven is an oven that removes all of the oxygen and air pressurized chamber that is also heated good evening from France I hope you're well Oh Rick has been making bubble hash he took material larf buds and closed trim tiny clusters of galaxies that still had a high trichome content washed it in distilled water and clear ice with bubble hash bags overnight it sat in the vacuum oven and then today we collected the material put it inside these bags so looking for but I don't even see them oh right here it's not a t-shirt press no this is a custom machined set of aluminum blocks held together with stripper bolts and springs one of our friends has a machine shop and he made it for us we have these pids attached to those aluminum blocks roughly 180 degrees Fahrenheit we had two of these bags inside out so that the seam is on the outside inside one is normal outsides normal that's good all right and that right there is over 30 grams of bubble ash in that bag pressed lightly over a period of time yeah freezer is a bad idea in general for long-term storage if you had some sort of sealed container that would protect it for moisture you would be okay if you like threw it in a sandwich baggie and tried to put it in the freezer you're gonna introduce more moisture again yeah grip that's a clean-looking bag right there buddy all right Ausmus higher she smells like we're in an orange grove and it does yeah the bud what was it there are terpenes that are water-soluble so the moment you like when people try and spray their buds and flower even if it's something that is not a certain chemical just water itself terpenes are water-soluble so you lose the flavor that that's exactly what happened to freewheel and stuff yeah freeze dryer would help this extremely it would it would it would uh pose it freeze dryer for the bubble hash and then press this soft by point zero five about three quarters of an ounce nice that's a 75% return okay so 30 grams went in nine came out I was it that was nine in the end yep nine Oh actually it's right spot on it's 21 grams 21 gram returned 22 grams both at 9 plus 22 is 31 it was 31 30 was 30 excuse me all right it is 21 grams on the nose 21 gram return on 30 grams of bubble hash yeah and the last stuff to come out the most golden the first wash comes out the dirtiest I got a that's from beating it up so much and eventually get myself one of the company that I got my bags from actually has a real good priced washing machine and still getting cheaper elsewhere very specific so yeah I've heard of wash curing before on your buds but definitely I wouldn't do it myself because water suck terpenes certain terpenes are water soluble and you get that as free willing just described the secret but thing that's not a good thing to be honest people enjoy the terpenes for sure and losing them people get concerned about that honestly that's when you start getting people accusing you of having PG RS well yeah I've already had that's just because I have rock-hard mugs on just about everything that we growing I go I use this like yeah we use that to of my father I go it is the seed you know bro dad if you were using the same thing oh the same way yeah I was not a straight-a student student I actually went to summer school I'm always draw almost every day every year of my my school days like they're great on technically extra schooling I guess oh God I went to 13th grade if that counts I went to grades all normal but I like school so much I had to go to 13th grade [Music] [Music] how the stuff seems to be powerful [Music] this man crackled and popped what's the first batch yeah this is mine we talked about the moister thing hopefully yeah I think him and I are both that way water bad dry good watch the video learn more this was a very thought-provoking conversation that we had with everybody I'd appreciated we covered some very interesting topics and I hope that their stuff that we showcase and talked about that you could look into further and understand more [Music] already know that you smell super fire [Music] everything is looking good yeah contend with what we got with the material we put into it most certainly oh I kick the carrot [Music] yeah [Music] cool [Music] typing on phones yep [ __ ] Millennials honestly I'm legitimately streaming more while staying at my cell phone it's because I'm streaming mobile games now how does he get away with it how does he get away with it streaming with 40-plus people when he's staring at her cell phone all day did you know that's the thing today whoever you are wherever you're at I see you yeah the world's much brighter now actually I love exploring they're late because of that because I'm like walking around the day and everyone's just doing that staring at their phone taking pictures of their food I'm selfies and you just kind of like skip on through hey man whoa is the return on the first one remember fifteen so we got a thirty six grams of rosin out of suppressing the would be good typing yeah I can't do thumbs anymore mine are ranked his are the same way yeah bathtime pecking pecking works I do it like I'm on my I'm playing the mobile game with with the hampire and I have it on my selfie stick side way so I'm just like typing with three fingers a lot and a pecking it's how I roll haha that's so funny oh this is very good power to the penis power to the unit right now stones and temperature is gonna start drawing a pretty random to go it the power exactly turn it off considering you don't after a PID and I'm going to get it that's the whole and it's no one tells you the things are yeah we got the whole dress for sale though they have what you can put in your vice people you said careful on speakers and air curlers all the time whatever your own but then again who might have one of them commercial ones middle years we need to know what you know past the end we'll shop rs.20 time not a lot of shop work press lotta cash so what do you think if you were to try and get this as a whole how much would a constant watch Singapore on sale for $2,899.00 break through these 3200 basically it was the same press three inch deep three blocks when it had we need a single PID with the double dual single PID heat it's both please crazy special setup right now which is the future you know as time drill things improvements I think we have here for outdoor uncle here Weiner [Music] for sure I like how it turns colors with the black/white so these dirty spots that were a sh dirty we need up once again and there could be a further step I'm sure but I wouldn't want to taint it with alcohol but that's how they make break it down to its mean and greedy and decided up really down with that honesty in reality beasts are both full spectrum because there's four bags that gather Keith and I was in the past like mixing the ones that were from this two bags that were from the same bag you know what I want to say the two runs out of the same bag would go together talk about this time I might flip all the runs out of punch and run mom oh hi how could all that not put all the bags out of each run into one press as far superior everything to flavor the smell cleanliness - hi never doing in two different ways no reason to unless you have something coming out back then out of ten will get high again this stuff is gone hey Paul thanks for the so again man Lord once Hey yes loose the Turks have to be on point I think you're fine with what you've done said that all right [Music] that says thanks again for sharing what you guys do all right you guys want to see I'm cleaning my bomb right now get in the quiet porkchop oh it's all right it's all super loud here when it's in there and smoking Americus [Music] I'm not sure it formulates charge this needs to be plugged into work yeah [Music] [Music] oh yeah is this real life who is it are we done this was not decarboxylated yeah if you decarboxylated [ __ ] see multiple people consume the cannabis in that manner don't let it go [Music] add the past everyone Soho make a stew rtu wait you use all 20 tons no I don't think so yes I do right here the biggest breasts this one had 30 grams and Edna said 20 I blew out put out massively but to start off a little easy by hand even the background Jack and squish it down the hill you start seeing it development as a slowing as it slows a little from this initial counting and a little more pressure and so you can stupid pressure with your hand string bottle chair then I put the - adopter leverage slowly disability instead 20 times what it said 20 tons is pretty much sitting position I pull down like the way it's set up rather than actually but it could be better this needs a little bit stronger sniffles screams right now plus I'm heating up they're not really used to I stress spring steel they're here in fine spotless didn't have two things what's up guys welcome to the stream [Music] oh yeah we already made it I have a I don't know if I uploaded the picture on disk or I have to double check real quick [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah resin is a real term for things I mean Latorre residue after combusting cannabis plant matter that's a thing [Music] sorry I was cleaning my bomb just in case it gets wedged in between the tire and the car and the car accident you gotta pull it out think about it man I sure as hell didn't [Music] yeah [Music] [Music] all right are you doing there both paying propane accessories 31 [Music] yeah yeah oh yeah I got get in on those [Music] [Music] come on how you do it I'm doing pretty good just hanging out doing some stuff with friends online [Music] it's obviously the law it's a it's a bunch of walking and I can I don't over you'll be up for it okay ah yeah that'll be great uh-huh yeah mom totally pick me up at noon whenever you're ready I'll be ready [Music] [Music] [Applause] okay drive safe be careful out there exactly later mom as my mom I tried to figure out why turns out my my notification ringtone oh I need to change it I don't know why my notifications on my phone oh no what is it no nevermind oh I have a custom ringtone for my girlfriend that's why I was like oh I usually figured that's it and I forget that the normal ringtone is everybody else I need to make it quiet as [ __ ] four random numbers I got Robo called it at 6:00 in the morning I have my my phone volume full-blast and I I ended up being jolted out of my sleep with my phone blaring in my face - a robo color no one was on the line they did I answered it and they just hung up on me yeah sorry so I'm cleaning it I was in the middle of cleaning at my mom ko and now all we damn [Music] [Music] I saved my guard cap you cannot do gold thinner banger [Music] glow oh that would be something [Music] oh yeah for sure I know all too well my friend all too well [Music] yeah I look at I remember oh I know what you're talking about yeah Oh [Music] [Music] alright thanks for chilling guys that was a very successful rosin press sesh I'm gonna upload this video to YouTube when I'm done so please check it out there's a lot of stuff in here that we talked about wonderful peer to peer review and pot talk we had Rick on the stream which is a rarity and he joined us and shared his insight we had we had a lot of cool discussion I really appreciate it guys thank you so much for hanging out for this I'm gonna come back on the PC and hang out I'm gonna play sea of thieves with my girlfriend and everybody get on some stream captain and chill yeah well it'll totally let him know he went to the hardware store to get more propane it's gonna get cold again and we're trying to protect our plants from that out here yeah it's gonna be in the 30s again so yeah do do do come back for the next session you're more than welcome to pop by check out these videos on YouTube I try and pop on Instagram and everything for it yeah oh gosh so that was 36 grams of cannabis concentrates that we press today wonderful stuff it actually has a strong fragrance of orange blossoms oh gosh very fruity Airy all right I'll be right back okay", "PG88Ezyr8cc": "hey guys youtube's been real awesome about the community guidelines so if you are over the age of 18 you're cool but if you're not please don't watch this [Music] oh [Music] [Music] my last harvest was just over a month ago and it was a pretty good bounty [Music] i had all the jars full of some big chunkers but i was also left with a bunch of small buds and shake [Music] now i'm not into eating edibles i'm more of a joint or dab kind of guy and i don't mess around with chemicals so that means bh no thank you i keep things solventless not just for health reasons but honestly it's it's for the terp reasons i do it for the terps sullivanless is is the bee's knees now that does leave me with two options nice water hash extraction aka good old-fashioned bubble hash or that's a good one using gravity in these dry sift screens aka dry sifting [Music] [Applause] so in the past i've had my share of bubble runs okay the bubble wrap itself always goes smooth especially since i always work with fresh material that wasn't too old for harvest [Music] the yields and the color was it was on point all good signs of some decent quality bubble hash but when it came time to the drying process that's where i noticed a lot of that nice color being lost i was drawing the bubble hash in these boxes and leaving them by an ac unit and dehumidifier [Music] just like that grind it down microplane it i even started to microplane the bubble first just to see if that would help the process but i still noticed the hash go from amazing top shelf color to looking like well looking like some dark moroccan ash once it was all dried and i noticed this happening on every run i would pull great color but dry the hash into dark chocolate and if i press that bubble into rosin i would just end up with some bad color hash rosin ultimately it wasn't working but i didn't know where the kink was and it was the drying phase [Music] i was told i needed a dry freezer so you know i went online to see what that was all about and uh it was all about five thousand dollars for one which is very expensive piece of equipment and i'm not sure i have the balls to commit to a purchase like that at this point i would almost want to have an entire room dedicated to hash for that to be viable and i simply don't have the room and i'm certainly not sacrificing my gym space [Music] despite my lack of quality when it came to drying bubble i did have another option these dry sift screens [Music] this method uses gravity and agitation and since i was working with material that was already dry i didn't have to sacrifice any loss when it came to quality [Music] and of course this quality would spew out on the rosin press i'm happy oh look at the color that's fresh off the press color bro yeah that's really nice now on all my hash videos i always get a few comments from someone who like doesn't really dab and and they will comment why press the dry sift into rosin seems like a big waste i just smoke it in bowls and joints that's completely fine makes sense if you're not into dabbing but the reason why i like to press it into hash rosin is because it creates a more concentrated version of hash after all i am starting with trim which isn't very strong [Music] just for the heck of it let's just say between 10 i don't know maybe 20 in thc and then of course when we break that down through the dry sift screens we are left with obviously less weight but also a stronger product that could be i don't know once again just for example 50 [Music] thc and if we grab that tricep and press it into rosin we are once again creating a more concentrated version upwards of 70 thc for example once again i'm making these numbers up but this is kind of how it goes [Music] and since i do keep things solving this right from the beginning the hash horizon not only packs an incredible punch but it also has a starburst of terps when it comes to the taste and by the way that does not mean i'm not going to keep some of the dry sift for supercharging joints so i'm about to start my first run aka the quick bounce method i'm just using the one screen the 110 mesh count aka 149 micron i'm pretty sure honestly the conversions can sometimes get confusing but i'm pretty sure that's right now to make this entire process as efficient as can be i'm grabbing my dry material directly from the freezer and quickly dropping it onto the screen the material needs to be bone dry and frozen two key factors in increasing the dry sift yields this first run is supposed to be quick with minimum agitation i don't want to overwork the material break it down too much causing contaminants to go through creating a less melty first run dry sift quick clean and i'm removing all the material off the screen before i place more down now i do want to mention that this is in no way advice on how to dry sift guys i'm simply just showing you what i do with my leftovers from harvest take from it what you will if you really want to do a deep dive into the dry sifting world there is a lot more to learn from static dry sifting to different karting tech i'm honestly just showing what i do in honestly the least technical way possible i guess this is just how i quickly clean and collect some heads from my trim if you're one of those crazy [ __ ] that want to know more about dry sifting just check out channels like mark the bubble man or even john berfello there's a few of them out there that go pretty deep into all the different styles of dry sifting a lot more deeper into what i'm doing the first run is always a rewarding one the fact that i can spend as short as 10 minutes dropping shake onto screens and have such a pretty pile of some first run almost full melt sift it's pretty [ __ ] a-okay with me so today i am doing a second run now for this second run i haven't always used the four screens sometimes i just use the one screen only the 110 mesh and i just work the material longer however there is a nice little extra filtering effect when rocking all four dry sift screens the very top screen is called the working screen and it's 60 mesh count aka 250 micron the second screen is 90 mesh count which is 190 micron the third screen is 110 mesh count which is 149 micron in the bottom yellow screen is 200 mesh cal which is 74 micron so on the second run i will work the material on the top screen for anywhere between one and three minutes before discarding into my trim bin now this is something i wish i could say i thought of myself but it was a friend actually he came over one night and was like dude pull the bin out this is another way to catch some additional heads which other words would be lost if you know i discard it into a bin like i used to i've ran all my material through the top working screen and now i'm down to the 90 mesh count aka 190 micron [Music] into the naked eye this big pile of dry sift looks pretty clean but looks can be deceiving after a few minutes of lightly carting back and forth a lot of the heads fall through to the bottom screen and was left on top of the 190 micron screen is dirty [Music] contaminants [Music] and finally getting down to the bottom 200 mesh count aka 74 micron screen where i have myself a pretty darn clean pile of heads [Applause] drop a like if you uh if you like rick and morty hopefully there's a billion likes on this video because of that for this second dry sift run um i spent 30 to 40 minutes probably in totality working the material and what was left on the very bottom 74 micron screen aka 200 mesh count for anyone who's keeping track uh was a pile of dry sift that totaled 30 something grams roughly like 31 grams and i would call this dry sift half melt status this is not full melty melt amazing dry sift this is just amazing dry sift that's half melt that was a bad analogy you can take that polish and implement other cleaning strategies like static dry sifting and or the carting tech you can use those two as options to clean up a dirty palace sift so if you are like me and you do want to press some of the dry sift that you managed to collect into rosin well cool over the years i've done double begging tech where i would grab the 25 micron bag from rosin evolution and stuff that inside a 160 micron bag and the only reason why i was doing double bagging tech was just to avoid or reduce my chances of actually having a blowout honestly it freaking sucks when you have a blowout when you're pressing your hash it's like it's not really something you can salvage if you have a blowout the hash will literally spew out of the rosin press like it's taking a [ __ ] gnarly [ __ ] and it's just unfortunate because it's like ruined and it was something that happened a lot when i was uh rosin pressing earlier on that's why i used to use a double banking tech and it would reduce the chances kind of of having a blow up but what i also noticed was i was still having blowouts bro because i was just coming down too quick too fast when i take so much time off and then come back to pressing rosin you kind of have to like relearn the the nuances of everything so as of recently i have just been using the 125 micron bag for pressing my hash and when i do get it into the press i just take i don't want to say take my sweet time coming down with the pressure because the longer it's in the press the more degraded the hash can end up so there is like a sweet spot when it comes to pressing the hash super low time too no blowout i'm happy oh look at the color that's fresh off the press color bruh that's right what i've noticed is i come down too quick and i end up with a blowout so that's kind of why i take my sweet time uh increasing the pressure it's just to avoid the huge hiccup of having that [ __ ] blowout man [Music] now on instagram i've seen a few people like they are yielding like 80 return off the bubble they are pressing into rosin and i've never been close to 80 returns i've done 50 and 60 returns but never more [Music] and i've done this a few times i've never had anything spew 80 percent return something something was in my mouth that was weird i just had a bunch of chickens jesus christ swear to god my [ __ ] tits are getting too big for this shirt one thing i do regret about the sif screens that i purchased is the overall size these are 12 by 24 inches and honestly when i bought them i thought this was the right decision i'm just a home gardener i'm not some commercial op but that was a mistake it honestly was a mistake i should have opted for at least the one size up if not just should have got just shoulda woulda but coulda but didn't i should have got the two by three feet size screens which are [ __ ] mammoth but honestly worth it should have done it didn't you can um still make work of the larger screens even in a smaller scale operation that's what i'm trying to get at took me an entire [ __ ] paragraph to okay episode two of the closet series will be coming out next i'm going to basically start working on the video the second this one's done i am sorry for the massive delays i have not just one grow up i have actually multiple grows right now all going which are all being documented heavily from seed to harvest and i've been trying to keep them under wrap however i'm not doing a good job at that because i'm telling you guys about them right now oh my rick and morty poster fell down perfect so we are at the correct height for optimal dabbing just want to say if you're still watching this video to like the video because you know it's a pretty long video and if you're still watching it that means you like me [ __ ] also subscribe for better wheat this rig i think is called decline recycler i think i'm not gonna lie i'm not too sure so if you know exactly what kind of rig this is to drop it down below i have not taken a dab from this particular rig in probably a hot year hot year why do i say things so weird it's been over a year since taking a dab off this rig my go-to rigs as of recently have been um bottle rigs for some reason i just really like the way they chug and um also probably because they are the newest you know pieces to my collection so i've been you know going ham on those bottle rigs but they do chug like a [ __ ] [Music] first dab of the day okay that first dab was [ __ ] so we're gonna do another dab here um [ __ ] [Music] oh [Music] that was a little hot it [ __ ] still had a lot of flavor it wasn't too too hot it's just a little hot i am [ __ ] high right now holy [ __ ] hey guys thank you so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it um please don't forget

to press from Keith to bubble on the 36 micron end of the spectrum 70 to 90 and then the 115 s better for flour to get started got some gloves and get these ready so I've got our quick flip tool here anytime you're pressing with a bag you always want to turn it inside out so you have this easy little tool you just slide it right on the end here put it through and then press it down I'm going to press out the corners and the reason that you want to turn it inside out is that you don't you don't want any blowouts so now I've got my bag inside out my corners are all pressed I'm ready to go so today we're going to be pressing some Cinderella 99 cross with the white this is a great strain we really think it's going to yield quite a bit put that in my tray you have just about a quarter of an ounce here that we're going to pack up so we get a lot of people talking to us and they're asking should I grind this up before I put it in the bag how do I do that we don't actually recommend that you do because then you're getting trichomes that are in your grinder or wherever you're processing it I'm going to take these Nuggets and I'm going to put them straight in the bag and then break them up so take these put it right in start breaking this up with my hands so again not grinding before I'm putting it in the bag I'm kind of breaking it up with my hands in here already so one thing when you're packing these bags is that you really want to make sure that you don't have any big stems in there so if you're pressing some material that happens to have big prominent stems you're going to want to pick those out what you can see now is I'm actually just working this down to the bottom of the bag and I'm trying to fill it out and make it as even as possible so any gaps or spaces that you have in your bag that's where your oil is going to get trapped so is what I'm trying to do is I'm just breaking this up with my fingers filling it out making sure it's nice and even you could definitely fit more than a quarter ounce in one of these six inch bags and with the nine inch bags you can get just under an ounce its evened out so here we've got our bag it's just about ready to go now one thing that I'm going to do here is I'm going to put down and I'm going to put some pressure on it because you want to pack this as tight as it's going to go ahead of time so that when you actually start pressing all the oil has the right path to come right out of the bag got a little extra space here at the end so is what I'm going to do take a pair of scissors and cut off so I have just about an inch at the top there we go cool so I've got a little bit here at the top a little bit of space and then when we're ready to press is what you're going to want to go ahead and do is flip this over before you slide it in so you have a nice little envelope so here we go here is our bag it is ready to press so this is ready to go as soon as we're ready to press we'll go on over you",

guys I'm Preston five and a half grams of some rosin I had to reset it it started to move on me that's why there's rosin on the hot side of this parchment paper you can see it starting to sizzle through as I reapply the pressure a little leap the shooter come to the ditch [ __ ] really crap a little darker because I'm running a little bit of hot attempt should party lower at about 20 degrees but it's alright we're still getting a lot of runoff oh I just put it in here Bowie [Music] all right guys this is the finished product I'll probably press this one more time just to get the little bits out of the bag for the most part is out all of it looks like pretty decent quality to me I'll let you guys know how she tastes have a good won't be safe", "7KDXXoIL28Y": "[Music] what's going on guys my name is Jeff Austin is popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys are smoking with net let me know what videos you want to see in the future make sure you follow me on

hungry huh yes thank you so much I appreciate that a lot did you bring me your ball oh my god you're so smart let me feed you done we're smashing it and indeed smashing it it's you smashing it all right doggie is bad way back yeah he'll jump on me eventually cuz it kind of freaks out when I talk to the camera for long at a time I noticed some the second lives are the first live stream also happen Andy you're heading out much love if you don't know what I'm dabbing now some sappy live resin I'll probably have a video on it eventually but it's uh it's called dayglo it's a local growers own but turned into the librarian you don't know the difference between live rosin and hash rosin I'll try to explain it explain it so with ash rosin somebody that knows their [ __ ] uh probably okay basically passed rosin is made from taking fresh bud like a large amount of it and depending on the way you make it you could it's two different way so I'll explain the the water hash way so you can make hash rosin by agitating a bunch of weed with water and shaking it up and straining it into bags so like the trichomes fall off into the bottom of each bag you scrape that let it dry out and then you take that product and you smash it on the rosin presses something like what I have and that's how you make hash doesn't like this [ __ ] it's all super pure solvent Lissa doesn't take any chemicals like most wax like has butane co2 or propane in it to extract it but any type of rosin is solving this no chemicals no [ __ ] other than heat and pressure water but then with life rosin slightly different hash rosin me made with the hash of the weed this is made from fresh fresh buds they're probably super fresh right off the plant frozen and then thrown in a nut Smasher like that it depends the type of weed it varies I've press stuff at the same exact temperatures and you can get many different variations of colors like super dark putty or [ __ ] you could get light color like super shatter II stuff she's still here yeah yeah it's cool didn't like good types of weed and being able to press it and figure out the types of consistencies because some weed doesn't press good at all another strength and steel [ __ ] get like the best best looking [ __ ] lighting color claiming this stuff is so shattering though that's sort of saying that hash are not hash causing any type of rasa specifically rosin from pressing nugs neither can have crazy different textures and stuff this one's super shattering it's been out of the fridge for weeks and it's still okay had to get the tool hot to get it off with the did it I did it a dad time do balls about to pass out Duvall one more DAP time and you could you have my blessing to fall asleep angel say dad time one move over one dad time yes captain sleep tight my friend just might be my last stab out of this pretty toasty hour-and-a-half is what I was probably gonna do in a song sick oh those real taste holy [ __ ] b-ball good

I'm trying to figure out in this", "RQppj42jV7M": "what is up it's your boy chronic i don't know how much of this you guys are going to be able to see in my face i'm going to try to angle it just right um it's your boy chronic we're back with another how-to so this time we are doing dry ice hash so as you can see i have dry ice in here um i've got my trim this is just just all the excess trim that was uh from hera so this is jack herrera trim we're going to be using one of the this is the 220 micron bag i have a set of bubble bags that i use and basically what i do is i go ahead and make sure all of this is in here and it doesn't slide out i make sure that i've got it all in this container sitting on this dry ice make sure it's uh really getting cold and then from here i go ahead and i give this a nice tie and now there are easier setups this is just my setup this is what works for me um you know this is just how i do it it's easiest for me you guys will see here in a second now another important thing i'm going to bring you guys over here hopefully you guys see this is this collection tray you definitely want a collection tray of some sort that's like a stainless steel or medical grade stainless steel or something uh you can collect with and uh the last thing you'll need is hey would you be able to grab me one of my business cards can you have a second okay last thing you'll need is a card to collect with i use a business card uh they're clean it's easy so let's uh start the process so basically i'm gonna scoot over towards you guys bring you guys a little bit closer and angle this down hopefully that stays there basically you just uh flip this over as you can see i mean all of that already and you wow and you basically just shake it up you just give it some tumbles thank you sweetheart business card keep it close to the tray uh basically guys you're gonna do this dry ice hash sifting for about 30 to 45 seconds maybe a minute until the color starts to change once the color starts to change that's when you're going to go ahead and collect you know do your first collection move it off and then do your second collection um basically as uh wow there's so much here as there as a it collects and breaks down with this dry ice more plant matter is going to come out so it's going to be more uncured so i usually do about 30 seconds um to 45 seconds minute tops for my first run because this is all trim and i know a lot of this is actually pretty quality i'm gonna go ahead and just do a minute so we're going to keep shaking just for a little bit longer i'm going to do my first collection and show you guys what we got so i generally also go based on the color tone so i am not only watching uh or counting in my head just like you know how i i am at i'm watching the color of the hash that's actually coming out so we're gonna go ahead and stop so i generally set this off to the side just like that take our collection card and we start collecting and we just have mounds and mounds and bounds of hash so this is uh the way to collect dry dry ice hatch guys so you're gonna watch me a few more times basically uh do this and i'm gonna do the rest with uh the rest of hera and i'll come back after i uh you know you guys will see the time lapse and everything of that but this is basically the general concept um 30 to 45 second intervals one minute max you really want to watch your color color is everything your nice golden tones are where you want to be sitting for your first run your your mid golden tones with a little green is where you want to be sitting your second run more green towards your third and fourth runs fairly green on your fifth and sixth run uh the seventh run i usually just don't even do i put the the material uh to use by doing edibles or putting it in my magic butter machine so that's how i make use of the last little bit of material that has trichomes on it so there's that so that is what we just collected um we're going to go ahead and do a second run don't do that guys do not do that barely got any out so we're going to scoot this over generally i don't like mixing these so i do actually press these separately these are my different press runs they all taste different they all have different quality for sure i press at about 190 degrees to 200 degrees for about 100 seconds and uh right now i'm using 90 micron i usually do 35 micron for hash but i have to use what i have to use uh so yeah that's what i'm using you guys will see that in the next video this one's just going to be uh the dry ice hash extraction so we're going to go for round two and it's looking mighty golden and nice still so that's a good sign lots and lots and lots and lots of heat so guys another key thing um you want to freeze your product before you actually use it this trim has been sitting in the freezer since i actually trimmed her um it was dried and cured everything was dried in here not cured sorry everything was dry so it was all dry product proper humidity um i didn't trap any moisture any unwanted anything unwanted but i definitely uh i definitely froze on my product the next bit of run we're going to be using is actually sitting in the freezer now i always suggest freezing it um you know the colder the bud the easier the trichomes are going to fall off you don't want to make it too too cold um you know you don't want to keep in the freezer for prolonged periods of time you can damage the trichomes you know a lot of people think crypto freezing is actually like really good to store your butt there's actually studies that show it it reduces the potency over time so you know there's generally if i'm gonna process um right away you know within that first three to five days i will go ahead and put my stuff straight to the freezer from um you know trimming however if i'm not going to process i go ahead and cure my bud or cure whatever i want to cure and um once it's you know cured i'm ready the day before i'll throw it in the freezer you know that way it has 24 hours to sit so we're gonna go ahead and stop this is gonna be our second collection i'm gonna kind of scoot it away from this edge here so i can set this down man just loads and loads and loads of thc guys just insane set that down right there you know what i actually have a tool for this let me grab it i don't even know why i'm not using it alrighty so now that i got my actual scraper that uh is designated for this because i'm a dingus i forgot i had it um oh my god look how easy that is the card was i was struggling with the card all right guys so there's our second run looking nice and uh pretty still gold still fairly golden brown golden still fairly tan like a sandy color with a little bit of green that's what i want so we're gonna go for our third one here in a second and i'll show you guys what it looks like and then i'm gonna get to doing uh more more dry sift hash here's the third one we're gonna same thing 30 to 45 seconds maybe a minute max looks like at this point it actually is coming to a halt on how much is in there so yep this will be the last run that i do for the trim and i'm going to trim with the used rest all righty she's getting pretty green so it's a good sign that more material is coming out than actual trichomes so we're going to go ahead and call that the last run for the trim and i'll go get actual hair bugs next which you guys will see some time lapse footage of so what the hell little fuzzies came falling down alrighty so then from here i take this out there's going to be dry ice in here and i'm going to want to as quick as possible get this stuff out guys don't touch dry ice with your bare hands it's bad it can hurt you but uh basically i take all the dry ice out because it's not done it's definitely still good all right guys we're back all right so i got my little collections and i need a sharpie alrighty so here's what i do here's third run of anything so all my third ones are going to go into this one this is how i stay organized keep myself clean and not contaminate my product it's important guys if you're going to do your own stuff at home damn it shut some of these lids don't shut whatever that's good enough um okay we're gonna be pressing today i don't give a [ __ ] about these lids so there's three there's two [Music] uh all right then let's take our product so we take the excess stuff that we did we're going to be using for the edibles go ahead and dump it all perfect so here it was seeded out so i'm just going through here and picking out any uh last seeds i see and we'll find they're healthy because you know here s ones are always awesome alrighty let me show you the last little bit of this before i go uh ocd picking through here with seeds which i'll be doing before i uh probably sift it before i put it in the stuff that's amazing so i'll show you how to prep this if when it's not already prepped and then that'll be the video guys so uh with product you definitely want to take it all off the stem so make sure that you take all the stems out um break your product up that works as well as just like you know chunking it off it is going to get broken up but i prefer to not have stem in my uh dry sift just makes it easier that again guys over top shake shake shake and you know

welcome to my jar Tech tutorial well not really jar take away my version of jar attack the reason I say that is because there's a bunch of ways you can do quote-unquote jar tech but the way I like it is to make the material really buttery and really hard so what I do to get that material pretty much all I've done so far is I squish seven grams of flour I put it it got it from the parchment and with my tool and I've put it on to a jar with no lid in between plates and it's out 1:29 and sitting at that for about 10 minutes so I'll come back to you guys and probably about half an hour to an hour once that's a little bit more buttered up so I can whip it and I'll let you guys know what I mean by whipping it then because you can see that's already kinda starting to butter up and that's what we want but we're gonna let it go for about another half hour to an hour so see you guys yep so what I have done here is I've pretty much just taken a little dab tours you can see right there there's now a little bit dirty and I've just stirred this rosin around I noticed that one part was getting really buttery but the rest was staying really runny I actually even noticed that it's trying to build like some sort of I mean try to zoom in there some sort of like little diamonds or like some hard pieces of rosin super-dope but um as you can see it's been whipped now and I'm just gonna put it right back in here this was about half a minute back this was about half an hour in that we whipped it so once again it's just insane out 1:29 it's been in there for about half an hour we just whipped it pretty much stuck a the blossom stick in there and stirred it around mixed it up for about 30 seconds to a minute and then put it right back on the plates and now we're going to sit there for maybe another hour maybe another 30 minutes I'll be back to you guys when that's 1020 minutes from the last video maybe I don't know 30 minutes in - after the whip as you can see we're having very nice crystallization you can see him some big diamonds starting to form we're gonna let this keep going let it keep buttering up and so they could keep doing its thing beautiful we're probably about an hour in since the last video and what I have here pretty much is a very stable a little bit buttery you can see the Terps popping up on top but it's pretty much starting to harden up and as you can see this is that consistently and see I said I wanted from the beginning although I'm still gonna let it go for probably about another half hour or so everyone and how's it going this is pretty much all finished up I started at 11:53 it's now 147 so probably took like a little over two hours I don't know but this is pretty much then the results as I like it this is very hard all of this pretty much puffed up and became very solid like it's all butter and that's how I like my rosin so if you guys don't like it like that you could have left it at the point where it's diamonds or whatever but once again this is just a little tutorial on how I like to do my rosin tag and the kind of results I like to go for kind of things I do and how I do it but yeah guys this is an official tutorial if you guys want any of things I used pretty much all I used was unlocks master unit two heaped up to press the rosin and to heat it up and if you guys want you can use this kind of code yeah I'm stoned and I'll save you guys a bunch of money on these presses or on DeYoung the mini that I used because this is where I made the rosin so I'm yeah if you guys more a mini or alex master you in there like that just discount code yeah I'm stoned one word you guys will be able to save some money at Knox Master Lock yeah guys it's the finished product I hope you enjoyed and thanks for watching", "QAkbtBShyp0": "hey everyone how's it going Eric here with peer pressure we're gonna be showing you our top five tips and tricks for getting the most out of your flower rosin so whether you're pressing at home on a hair straightener or using an industry-leading press like our peg speak rosin press we've got all the tips and tricks so you can get the most out of it tip number one quality in quality out this is the most important thing that you should know when you're making flower rosin or any rosin the better the material you're starting with the better your results are going to be and the fresher it is the better the clarity as material tends to age it's gonna oxidize and you're gonna find that that rosin is gonna come out darker so if you're looking to make the best flower rods and you possibly can get stellar material and press it as soon after its dried and cured as possible tip number two relative humidity makes a huge difference with flower rosin now you can go check out our other video where we did the full in-depth test but what you need to know is that your flower should be at least at 55 to 62% humidity before you press it this makes a massive difference in your yield so just make sure that your material is properly hydrated before you press it tip number three choose your temperature based on your desired results so we encourage a lot of experimentation and you're gonna find that most people are either pressing on the lower temperature range which is about 160 to 190 degrees Fahrenheit or the higher temperature range which is anything from 190 to as high as 250 degrees so depending on what kind of consistency you want to achieve that's where you're gonna set your temperature on the lower range you're gonna be looking at more of a butter on the higher range more of an oil or a shatter so when you have some material that you're playing around with we encourage you to try both ends of the spectrum and see which one you like the most tip number 4 choose the right micron bag type now you can absolutely press flower outside of a bag and get great results but that's usually only a gram or two you're gonna want to press in a 90 or 115 micron bag or at the most 150 we recommend not going any lower than 90 because that's when you're gonna see a huge drop-off in yield so if you're pressing flour in a bag make sure to stick in that range and finally tip number five if you're looking to make the highest quality flour on possible you absolutely don't need to overdo it on the pressure now you can definitely over press your flour rosin by applying way too much force at your bag and in fact we've seen great results not only with yield but of course with quality pressing at the lower end of the pressure range anything from around 550 to 1600 psi at the bag so when you're applying way too much pressure in the many thousands what can often happen is that you're pushing out plant fats lipids you know the waxes as well as all of those undesirable plant materials into the rosin really over pressing it so if you're looking for the highest quality rosin we recommend trying the lower pressure range and seeing your results thanks for watching we hope that you found that was helpful for more tips and tricks make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel and follow us on social media at Goa peer pressure thanks again for watching

hard to everyone that's locked in locked on coming straight to Babylon and from Babylon we shall always escape today I have something for you but it's not the normal it's just me sampling some has frozen that I've had for a while but before I finish it I want to share it with you because basically let me tell you what has frozen is hash frozen is when you take hash put it in a fine screen paper and press it in the machine it's not same difference as if you wants to play press flower cannabis but still oppressing the cannabis you take the trichomes or the part of the THC that has the psychoactive properties and distract it from the Berlin but once you get that extraction you extract it again from the hash and make rosin so it's taking away all the fatty greeny stuff out the rosin has whatever you want to call it that you don't want it makes four per clean-tasting high THC goodness matter of fact just let me show it to you real quick you see that yummy goodness you see the color you see the parenting and the smell is so strong the smell is - smells like Purdy we'd like the best and the finest weed you ever smelled it's really good this one let me see if I can get a better image for you guys that's about it I don't have my camera I'm using my cell phone hey the smell this one I don't know much about this I don't know what strain where I don't know any genetics of this one but I do know it smells vainglorious makes me wanna holler get out the game but too many people already know my name mmm-hmm okay next step let's taste it see what is uh see what the effects are I can't give you the I don't know the genetics but I can't give you the taste in smelling the physical properties okay quick summary has frozen not just regular bouncing has frozen you got to remember that so if you're looking forward and you want to pick some up remember to ask for fresh frozen hash Ronson it has a process to get that color it has to be fresh it has to be frozen it has to be made then it has to be immediately freeze-dried if you want the color and sustainability and taste but anyway let's start with the heating process yeah I know this is a real whack torch is what we have to work with today to get the results we want we get our nice and hot we're gonna taste this hash rising right before your very eyes [Music] I like low temps so the probably almost perfect for me see the flame on there you see who see nice and high anyway let's go and see what she thinks about [Music] take this take this really fresh it's really clean it has almost like no no expansion on the long snow Carson to throw just like a real heavy start filling in your eyes immediately I love everything about hash which is my favorite way to consume cannabis still clean no other particles unwanted chemicals there's like finest of the finest wine Terence of the clearest water tears of the stars at night with the twinkles in the eyes just saw the goodness you love about cannabis you know if you really in the fix are all set immediately I could feel the euphoric sensation just teaming up and down the back side of my body and I'm pretty sure that in 10 to 15 minutes that will produce its final course of helling activity to make sure that all the benefits of having a per hash sample it's going to shine through and shave that the best results come from the finest material", "5Uwgd1wtlWU": "Jerrica sheer back with the first video from Barcelona I'm going to be uploading and editing the video today and may be uploading it need to get a video from Bobby still yeah so I thought I'd just do this little video this is some of the 73 grated cheese from HQ from Barcelona this is the best-looking hash they had to be honest and it's still not even like I think maybe three star force star may be taught it yeah they need to start getting a bit better I think but I that were just going to do a little rosen video of all this I'm not sure I feel two ways but I should do that okay point 28 we pretty much just pick this up for like the last minute for all the money I've left in my account at HQ because I didn't think I had at me and then yeah I was just uh [ __ ] it might as well just pick up a gram of some bubble co DS and to be honest much better bubble here or what I've had recently so its fold this up so now I gotta follow up into a little light packet here I'm gonna go press it I'll be back in a second so I'm pretty much as compressed at 140 Rosen okay so pressed it two times is still like a little bit of residue up there so I might be able to fold it one more time for the left and there we go I'll show you this so those the first press still looks like you maybe get a bit more off of that I'm not and then here's the second press so we're just going to click this real quick and then yeah well it looks all right something best could have been better living better yield from it as well but the skip my little scraping start picking these up mm-hmm it's not nice being back from Barcelona already just realizing that everything's back to normal life were uni everything it's just not fun trying to get the majority of it so I don't lose any eight minutes long did not know that all right here's DeRozan I'll give few of it there you go that is some of the cheese Rosen and I'll just put this up and get a good job of it and see how it is we are brought back some entries i'm about five everything are worth dabbing and then I brought back but all the non seulement is to show you how [ __ ] there I they are appallingly bad don't understand

call", "RQqhS98GLDE": "well guys I'm Lea this is tio dabs today we're going to go to rosin pressing some hash some bubble hash I picked up today I pressed some little bit turned out to be really nice stuff really tasty like it again this is Bobo hash bubble hash that's being pressed into a rosin but wash I guess you'd say anywhere so some great is this again I believe this is a 25 micron fiber pouch I guess you could say we bought from trial and company so you just put your flour or hash in there and squeeze it and gives you some nice product I get squeezed there instead of like when you don't use this you have all the plant material it's stuck to your rosin and you just press that you don't mean if you are pressed rosin you know I mean you've got plant matter sometimes get stuck to it and it's not nice you are just half your drawers and that's it no plant matter nothing else just your dad's right so that's why I bought this and tell you truth bricks like a charm works really really [ __ ] great [Music] crystals yeah it's really simple all using is this cheap iron [ __ ] really cheap iron and yes she's paper ready to go take offs on his dad's I have here for my next video the Widowmaker yeah that's for the Widowmaker after their next video so they take our bubble hash here we got some bubble bubble hash what I do is I squeeze into a shape that I'll fit nicely at the bottom here so I do it the other one turned out to work really good so just a little square here at the bottom that's all make yourself a little hash square I'll show you guys it's hash just make yourself a little hash Square here so you guys taking the longer I participated it's got enough here good enough see those little square hash open up her really oiled up Reds the bag here sticker hash back in it open back up - in there this guy use your fingers put in place see there the hashes that's bottom we just roll it up like we roll a joint nice and tight well paid enough this i beat super tight just as long as it's together this metal now a second camera so you guys it's you I'm doing here alright so again here's our little hair straightener really cheap so it's kind of tricky with one person but stealable so for me I'm just going to fold over the parchment paper like that because I had two big flops here like that so said I'm just gonna close enough like that for now there's enough space for it to get caked anyways stray stick that yes see let's try to censor it on here as best as possible we start cranking the [ __ ] out of this well hey guys so let's do this up here make sure ice is in the middle before I start squeezing right down a little bit a little too hot my species right right yeah so you can see just late for us already got [ __ ] on a goop coming out of there it's a little bit tricky when you're by yourself it's doable just gotta be careful look centered just slowly see slowly target because you are working with plastic here and [ __ ] so you don't really want to kill it right yes when I give it a nice amount of pressure that's a nice cue pitch there guys dressed like that for a sec I got tons of force let's check turn this off [Music] oh my god some well over there that's okay I'll get everything look at that guy's bubble hash rosin okay sort of see through the back there because we had heated up first time we had it on there was just staying on there so that's started seeking through so uh yeah so one thing you got to do when be careful you're doing this you gotta be fast like bring it on don't waste time just be fast get hot you thought I'd slap it on press as quick as you can especially when you're working with hash because you want the you want your actual rosin press right you don't want just a hash press no I mean it won't taste nice won't taste the same as natural rosin has fresh press huh so yeah this is the fridge well I'll explain in the fridge they cool off and then I take it back out and then it starts hardening and then I tack it off after that guys and those recyclers got a nice little downstem on it with the reclaimer honor because I noticed there's been a lot of only had this for about four days or five days but hitting it Lawson there's a [ __ ] ton of freaking resident oil or whatnot just going down there and going into the perks so if your get down stand with the reclaim wants to clean this [ __ ] every [ __ ] week you know I mean at least we got to reclaim back which is a nice bonus so uh yeah it's versus both hashaway and again guys with this right here I could press this again like at least there one or two more times and I could take the way already pressed here that's in my plate put it all together put it back in here and press it again so I could probably quite a few times to get still some more material a lot more material which is nice so let's do a nice hash rosin dad guess what the finished product looks like nice and strong tasty doesn't taste like hash really has a nice nice taste to it scoobert there you go cheers guys very tasty very very tasty like I said it doesn't taste like hash it's you know like when you're smoking hash you got the hash taste it doesn't taste like that it's taste nice taste like shatter you know I mean a rosin has that distinct Turkey taste which is really really nice considering all I paid what 25 bucks a gram yeah ruble hash pressed it out and I got myself like a gram about this stuff so a gram for 50 bucks she's not home I mean it's live rosin which is not bad it's homemade and like I said probably get more into grams I've been dabbing on this hooray for a bit today so but I get like a gram and a half give or take depending where your setup is right like we're just using a cheap cheap cheap setup like anybody can do this with [ __ ] 20 bucks do one more homework yeah all right let's do mr. blobby butane oh there you are butane guys meet some butane can't do dad's the butane well I guess technically can yeah you know it you will be a soon eventually that stuff's barely stay let's get it so made [Applause] to make something yourself without buying from the companies all the time make it yourself across fuck-all to me so that Lots left so at least another I'd say 12 dabs on my paper and probably got in there too got two or three papers like that's not bad my bad for 50 bucks listen impressive the strength the strength that it's really impressive huh just clean off forever yes matter if it's a little bit hot just trying to burn off all the leftover dab on here [ __ ] taste Oh first few drops into the reclaim know if you could see that photo it's up there yet it's gonna go from there down to there huh yeah guys I think this is gonna be it for this video if you liked it hit like but hit that like button and if you want

and lots of hash info tons of hache coconut oil I love this stuff I can't get enough of this I need this my body craves this I'm so happily finally in Canada I'm actually happy that Canadians can access quality cannabis like this and I get this from kin of farms I'm a legal LP no I'm not an LP I'm a legal person in Canada check it out canna farms tell him Sean 420 sent you peace", "ULPSuoU0p5I": "you're live um blowing out all right so when i'm doing um dry ice what i gotta get together is i got about 15 i'm gonna guess about 18 pounds of dry ice the 5 gallon bucket um and a bubble bag so the bubble bag i like this one is a work bag um i would guess this one is like a 220 micron so it's pretty breezy so i use um whatever bubble bag is your work bag that's pretty much where i base my stuff out at and then you go about grades about how long you shake it at that point instead of trying to go through micron bags the super easiest way um so i already got a couple of things in there so what i'll do is i will fill all of the flour in there this one is fresh cut so i'll just take it and with my index finger and my thumb just pull it and then just pull it all clean and not have to trim it in there this is a super easy way when you have to do a lot of material you can just get it done quickly and then it really just doesn't put a lot of resin on your hands still because all that resin's pretty much on the top of the leaf so we're going underneath all that you can imagine if you got a lot of outdoor this would be like so quick and fast and then when you see the process you'll understand how you can get a lot of material done especially let's say if you put it in like a five gallon bucket of water and kind of let it sit there for a while while you're doing the rest of the plants but this is a way that if you have all that larf if you have any extra bud that's just small or some plants just didn't turn out really good all the way this is a way to just get a whole bunch of all the trichomes off of that thing in a matter of a couple of minutes and then be able to smoke it right down so you're not wasting anything i already trimmed off pretty much all the leaves that weren't sugar leaves and then i'm pretty much left with just the material you can do this dry um i've done it dry a lot i take off everything that isn't sugar leaves if it's dry and then what i'll do um is put a hundred grams into this five gallon bucket with about 10 pounds of ice is is a great ratio i like wet or fresh because um you get a lot a lot less organics in there and all you get are the trichomes because you're not breaking up the leaf and then the leaf is falling through along with your trichrones because they're getting busted up and becoming smaller all you got is trichomes because your organics are still wet and the fiber's still there to keep everything together so that's why i like doing it that way what i'm left with is how i don't know maybe like one fifth of this bucket full of fresh the fresh is starting off looking like that not superpower but enough to where when i'm done i'm going to be super glad i went through this process i spent 22 dollars on my dry ice and then um after that's done then you add the dry ice be uber careful you can think i've been burned on this a couple of times and i'll show you where i get burned but this stuff will burn you but i try to get it down to about um half the size of an ice cube and then some ice cube sizes you know some bigger so i will add everything on the top oh yeah this piece is wanting this big chunk together that tells me that i got some pretty good dry ice really fresh stuff if i didn't get fresh stuff i would be looking at um and i'm closing my eyes while i do this if i didn't get flat stuff they would come apart a lot easier oh man if your chunks are too big they'll just pulverize it and they won't really get everything critically cold you don't want all big chunks you want even some fine powder in there that fine powder gets everywhere and it will seriously get this stuff to core temperature really fast i am going to have to use a different tool this is providing a little bit of a problem come in with a hammer thank you beautiful assistant all right [Applause] a little bit to mix everything around and then this is the point where you want to leave it sit a sec now that that's going down i'll take my bag and i'll pop that bad boy over the top this goes all the way down until i have mine goes around the side and comes down my work bag so i get to actually have a lot of area but you want all screen on the edge of this bag and then i take this zip that pretty tight this will help for when we're popping it upside down because all this bag is going to want to do is slip and then from there you want to let it set for about five minutes so it can get super duper cold this is the part where i usually smoke a bowl because this next part sucks balls and once you start you basically can't stop the next part's gonna take about 30 minutes there's two eight to ten minute sections where i'm gonna take this bucket turn it upside down if i turned it upside down then i'm going to be shaking it over the the paraffin which is going to catch all the key and then later i'm going to be able to scrape that up and do a second one and then a third one my first run my first eight ten minutes will dump me a nice amount of keith that's gonna be top shelf keith great smoke your first um even couple of minutes will be blonde so if you even wanted to separate that out you could separate your blonde out and then keep going and then your second 8 to 10 minute shake will be a really good smoke but it starts to get a little bit of organics in there your third shake and you can do that until the end of time and that will provide you with all your cooking material you can put that in olive oil you can put that in anything and it's seamless you can't even taste it um usually i use that for oils and alcohol expression you'll also notice when your bucket's getting good because the sides will start getting frosty and this is telling me that the bucket's getting to temperature i don't really want to shake it until it gets to super temperature if you shake it too early before then what you're going to find is it takes a while for the keith to actually go through and then at some point there's this flood that starts happening and that's when it's at core temperature so you want to do that right away and not rough up as much organics as possible and that's what's happening by your second and third one it is pulveric by the time i take this off and show you the material it will basically be down to ground dust so that's why you keep degrading as time goes on but i definitely like this better than water because you don't have to dry it you don't have to filter it through that 20 micron bag that takes like an hour to eight hours to overnight to even drain out and then you're smoking it right away and i've had blonde hash out of here as blonde as almost the card that i scrape it with white so i mean you can get really good quality and the amount you get out of this is way more than you're gonna get out of water and um man almost as much as you're gonna even get out of bho you can take the keith and do just about anything with it i smoke it with bud but um you can smoke it straight which i will do right away my favorite part of this whole process the fresh keef basically tastes just like scissor hat it's something that people don't usually experience this is really super [ __ ] cold on my leg now i'm going to turn this over and right when i turn it over it's basically up now i'm gonna have to at some point turn this back over and take a rest because i'm not he-man or superman or even a muscular individual really so i have to take breaks with this 10 15 pound weight but um when i do that sometimes ice gets caught in these crevices and then when i flip it back over and put my pinky on it like this what i'm actually doing is contacting the ice that's how i freezer burn my finger a big hunk of skin fell off it kind of sucked so i'm really conscious of that part that's at this point probably the only way you're gonna get burned [Applause] all right here we go i like an up and down motion [Applause] that'll give me a good indication of how good okay that's the first minute out of our let's say eight or ten our first run so this would be like our blonde hash let's see where we're at also we don't want any wind current in here this stuff will drift like everywhere and my wife will kill me so let's see where we're at i mean i wouldn't say that it's blonde like white but i would definitely say if i slap that on the table i don't think anyone's gonna be like oh dude i don't smoke this has a ton of terpenes in it now that it's fresh this has like a ton of terpenes versus dry the only thing that i have to be concentrating on with using fresh versus the dry is i really need to dry this out this needs to set out and not in a plastic bag or anything i usually just fold over one of these paraffins for about 48 hours um it takes a while to get this all dry there's the ama card that's one minute it's probably enough to fit in the palm of my hand that's pretty awesome sample one plop that so let's go down the rabbit hole see what seven minutes with us because i'm guaranteeing now we're at core those are temperature favorite part i bet this is my family's favorite part too in the living room i still only got one viewer sometimes i gotta scrape the ends too because it gets a little stuck on there [Applause] so dude i gotta get lacking too i seriously gotta get a credit this is like that sawyer like this is actually a lot of fun like i gotta really say i'm having a blast doing this are you sure you don't want me to operate the camera you get it behind here and shake a couple 20 minutes up so i can on i don't have to scrape it off of both just have to scrape it off oh man this stuff's so wet and gooey i don't have that option sick so that is probably like another five minutes you can see the color difference right off the longer i go the more i start popping in some more organics which if you flushed everything and have everything right it's actually not that bad but if you didn't flush everything or you had a mistake that you had to harvest early because something happened and you didn't get to flush it in time um that first batch last really still tastes good once you start integrating that non-flushed organic now you're asking for it mine happened to be i would say pretty flushed so i should be straight but still i know if the second batch could actually be not the best badge or it could be all right which the way this is shaking i think i hope it's all right no questions yet because i'm so [ __ ] thorough with this goddamn tutorial sweet i like that [ __ ] cobra cat even though that's wet you can get the and i'll still pop that in the bong and it'll go down to white ash that wetness will go away real quick [Applause] oh yes drop [Applause] absolutely yeah okay so one it started slowing down and two if we start looking at the color now we got green that's telling me this is the very the very cutoff of smoke ability once it starts going green i have a lot of trichromes in there i have a lot of really good active organics in there but what it's probably going to be is a little too harsh to really be called good keith so if i keep going i'm going to be going into baking territory which honestly i could eat an honest amount i could eat a yard amount of edibles and not get high so i don't really want to go into cooking territory so i will stop here so let's see we got cause i'm betting the shit's fire what did that take like 10 15 minutes if this was dry i definitely would have gotten more out of this but since i did it wet it's actually going to be a little bit more quality but a lot less quantity usually what i get back is about anywhere from 20 to 33 percent 25 return on dry totally easy so this will get a 25 return on your dry if your dry is any squat of good even doesn't even have to be super fire oh i thought that was gonna be a lot more [ __ ] rounds dude it was a little disappointing this not like my material was super fire to begin with and had a ton of trichomes to begin with so honestly this kind of makes sense you know usually i would be expecting at least probably double this to three times more so this is cool but how much dry ice did you use there was 15 18 pounds in this one that's pretty good exactly like it smells um super smooth i cannot hardly even feel the smoke it is wet so you would think this is pretty much the harshest doesn't necessarily have to be that way when it dries out it can get maybe a little harsher when it dries out it could actually smooth out so that's why you want to let this dry out usually what i would do is just fold it over tear this section off leave it overnight and then flip it like a pancake every 12 hours or something and then make sure the other side dries out and yadda yadda because this as you can see it it wants to stay it has the consistency of um that play sand that you can form that's exactly how this feels so it wants to keep that form and that's that's why it's hard you got to get all the way in there to get all of that moisture out and yes i'm going to smoke this whole thing so i'm grabbing it with my goddamn fingers if you are wondering so uh that is the whole process for making ice hatch so if you have a whole bunch of larp at the end whole bunch of plants that don't make it good at the end um no one's gonna [ __ ] do [ __ ] with them you want to even cook with them turn them into keef this keef is going to go into butter easy oil easy you're not going to have to do this double boiler you're not going to have to do a straining process you leave that keith in you don't even have to straighten it out so you put it in oil heat the oil up boom you're done and it won't even taste like there's cannon in there so you can put it in stuff like candy and everything that would be frankly kind of weird it tasted like that cherry canna does not taste good pineapple can it does not taste good either i found so i kind of use like this stuff and then you could even use this stuff for cooking but um usually what i'll do is dry all this out put it in a bag after it's all dry and dusty and then i will put like an ounce into that bag here and then shake it up and then you have keith covered um buds are called out here they're called moon rocks basically so yeah that's what you do with all the stuff that you usually put in the garbage or not know what to do with bam i got mine at safeway um i think it's like 210 a pound that's basically it y'all i've had a [ __ ] of a day you guys got any more questions see what the difference is i wish i had actually had a torch for this it is pretty flat that great's not that bad either i could almost mix those together but i don't want to do that i think i want to separate those yeah they're still a little wet but it was it's not that bad at all i definitely know that green's probably something i don't want to [ __ ] with but those two first grades are actually pretty good i would say i got probably close to 27 grams between those two grades i would bet somewhere pretty close to there maybe 20. let's be safe at 20 and 21. but um pretty good amount for just putting some stuff in that was mid light that was mids for sure and then that came out really good now now it's something i can actually be enjoying the smoke i'm gonna wake up and then just be like oh hell yeah let's pack a bullet you know i wouldn't be waking up and just being like oh yeah let's wake up and fill a whole blunt full of mids yeah [ __ ] that but now it's actually something that's desirable um and that i can use so i will see you guys later", "5ixbPbV2k-k": "oh yeah so this is some THC that we need today fresh on the press very nice stuff just gonna snap it in there oh-ho-ho all that just", "8U5_sO7enTQ": "what I would hold up man okay christen was zero man you quit Chris and can was cracking which slope hit me the menaces we did live but Soviet Chris what we were doing

my leaving the store I looked down seen that book was the same one he walked out with so you see I already made the right choice right please man trust your mercy this thing even if you they you know someone might like this bill hey man trust that first instinct if you don't then you can always go back and keep it in its gonna come back specially for some spray that people ask for people a lot they will keep especially if they know you're gonna purchase it why not why not let's see we know one of the woman gotta see if she got that kid I bet you can over there if you do get some [ __ ] you can always take this right here and bring it back to life well each way you say sprinkle me sprinkle me man that's it you don't have to deal with a lot of that don't be in there trying to cover up the whole brunt because you don't want to see you touch that's gonna be a mistake two reasons one you're wasting two you don't need that much because it is so hot potency when you get to adding three board of two scoops you better be three forty four scoops ready because if your tolerance isn't that high you're gonna have a real serious problem man you're gonna pass out and whatever time he was supposed to be doing what I will he was supposed to get to that's out you ain't gonna get nothing that extra curricular stuff done today that's yeah that's out so remember remember has any concentrate that they are more potent scuse me than the flour the concentrate for everybody trust me go back you're look I could not for me my sprinkle a little in my help mighty go as far as even taking me down man but I hope that email you can pump and have to gonna give me a puff Go Daddy start out Fusco shout out hi him shout out swisher Sweets family what we call a lot get at us man we literally try out

I said I don't have a real bad aftertaste in my mouth block Barney nice and smooth no backlash from this over three or four is there they looked at great didn't have much of a smell I don't say two of the four so far looked a great off top beautiful boy you agree yeah smell what you get and you should see and I don't know if that's from being from sitting too long or front I said lower low maybe write the full cure I don't know they let it cure in the door and you collected that Musk but I'm not smell wise it's nothing none potent nothing they were just oh wow what is that it wasn't there that for the smell the look Oh beautiful beautiful device right took little nuggets in dump our sugar on nice white nuggets Frosty the Snowman no it's man deep red right British weren't just like try cones on it man like I said they are fuzzy they even have like a yellow which looked warm man the truck home cool charcoals little hairs that hang off the ears they're nice they not just super thick and you could look at the charcoal man you know I've seen some that be thickest as the boy toothpicks and you can hide a man I mean from the tip up on my wood to pick you see my little fibers of trichomes that would be that thick those are you ones that are gonna be heavier THC content because they hold more trichomes on that now excuse me what THC crystals is cover now the bigger the tracker on the more air you leak and cold so remember that man eats a little distinguishing point about your book can't tell you something different about it man ask your bud tender talk to him keep waiting look but this one I want this what I'm looking for this is what cam said I need go get it don't come this mechanic he's a doctor I just know how to medicate myself and I know what I like but those that are in my shoes or Chris's shoes that know how well they need to be medicated follow my steps and I will make sure you're in no pain buddy cuz I know do our level patient like the strains I like because we are going to make sure that our th-those that's the difference between me some of you other Brewers man most other growers of the smokers patients me I rather walk around with one ounce of some gas did you got that other got it my pen two ounces awesome okay you have to have the other guy who won't take three ounces listen man could it be better those are three days with you I am the first I will take one - up some powwow scum knock me in the dirt then I will take three ounces of that [ __ ] I got a smoke four and five months of no no the insane in the membrane 35% TAC Brian maker 32% TAC these higher grade pushes marijuana's medicines are the ones we value are the ones we have I don't sinb lunch man but as of right now we not saying that multiple months of the entire Pacific but that would be only for two reasons one recreational use to medical to keep me not hurting so either way I have a medical card to purchase it to do both okay and mainly it's for medical reasons yeah because I do have I have my sensory nerve was cut in my right hand okay it tasted funny give me a scratchy in month oh wow not gonna wash bad nasty like make my thirty like I wanna cause but I'm holding it back but other than that the smell the taste of our tongue the smell not so much look beautiful the taste I don't have a problem with it I still need a little scratch in my throat you know when I pulled on a deep but it's not a book that I will put down it's not something that I would not smoke again [Music] they're gonna see them by halfway through my blood I am fighting to feel the high you know it's more of a cerebral not feeling too much of my body or nothing you know nothing my chest the banker think about the taste cuz you get there and you really see told you that since I get over I feel like every time I see Steve he might just did some segment I'm just saying you might be a one at the end like a dollop he and dr. Mills gets man man he gonna be fine don't be see the rittany and I even took too much he'll be fine when Judas seen him sit there you need 500 milligram brownie you know me take that out to dad they're 300 out of month I want to find enough medicine and medication can keep me there in the beginning so I don't have to go that high bro we'll go that hot and then come down to where he finds itself you know what I mean hey and go to outer space you are right but that's like you're in this but no mom you sure like that I'm at home that'd be down I'm finna be you see me smacking nice fruity taste that back in when you know when you mouth like the salivating and when you swallow your saliva Nick nice like Oh real fruity on the back the aftertaste is wonderful and the high again like I said it's cerebral I don't feel nothing you know in my hand is no tingling nothing in my chest making my heart beat none of that you know I mean you can get boiler that give you an anxiety to a good cushion that will give you a panic attack attack art and good anxiety I'm a plenty of people that has happened to me see that's my bro won't certain smells of spring he won't be 1 by coz I got related with my experience ribs and he know the last time he had the attack with that blue I smell by if they any resemblance to me they look fuzzy cloudy right he won't see the frosty looking nice snug Asteria corner looking [ __ ] that's it just stay away from because a lot of reminding the crystals is different right what is one on this bike buzz mm-hmm fuzzy fuzzy young another windy difference so fuzzy don't you wonder if it's real rise you know right now you got the muggles there whistles on but those those the one that doesn't go on right that was a fall off when you sit there playing with the bug to that other frosty those is like little hairs how to eat a little individual part of the down to those small pieces of water leave their limits that still may be trimmed back yeah and as you can see I'm down to the hagnes blunts burnished slow go slow and ain't what I want some you know beautiful table scraps but I said the back here didn't have much of a smell you look wonderful man and the high is there as well man so I say three out of the four touches is there it didn't have the work to smell words of [ __ ] but the taste the the tanks the look and the actual high madness I would say three out of four on it this isn't a book that will come on my door it's only 20% but it was something new so I said they had another one and a push that we won't get they had what was

episode of canna basics first we're going to make dry ice cave then we're going to press it into rosin and then we want to convert that to e juice this episode is brought to you by dayz screens glass screens quality reusable glass screens and cleaning supplies are available at parley car Matic calm and we'll talk more about them later now in this first episode we're going to be making our own dry ice Keefe and of course we're gonna start with cannabis flowers to do that so the amount that you use is up to you but we're using about 10 grams and if you're using less than an ounce you'll want a one gallon bucket more than an ounce at a time you'll want 5 gallon buckets and then micron screens I'll put links to where you can find these micron screens on Amazon but they're bubble bags bubble hash bags there's what they're generally called and you'll need at least one about 120 or 93 microns around there and then probably a larger one like 220 you'll also want to make sure that you have some good protective gloves for your hands when dealing with frozen co2 because it's very very cold colder than regular ice and also you'll need about 10 pounds or less you usually have to buy it at 10 pounds at a time and that should be enough to do a couple ounces ok the first thing we're going to do is to load our bucket for this demonstration just to make it easy math we're using 10 grams of cannabis flowers we're going to put that directly into the bucket and then on top of that we're going to add our dry ice the dry ice I broke it into little smaller chunks with the hammer a minute ago and I'm using about pound and a half or so with this 10 grams [Music] and once it in there you want to cover it with your bag and for demonstration I'm using this - 20 microns green bag but you'd want to start with your smallest micron screen probably around 93 or I'm using a 120 micron but then once you have it in there you can just toss it around for 30 seconds to a minute just to make sure that everything is nice and cold before you start actually doing the shaking process okay so now we're going to go with our first run and this one I'm using the 120 micron which are smaller screen so once you have everything cold and children ready you're going to turn it upside down so that the cannabis and the dry ice falls on top of the screen and then you start shaking it gently up and down like a pepper shaker and make sure you have a nice clean surface I have a stainless steel table that's very clean but you could also use parchment paper [Music] and then after you've sifted and you start not getting much the sift coming out when you shake the bag it's time to start collecting it you can use a credit card or just a business card or some sort of flat edged material and then just grape it up and then you can put that on a parchment or into a bag or whatever you wanted to use to store it in we weighed this and we had just about a grand about three-quarters of a gram there so now we're going to switch and we're going to do a second run and then just kind of show you a demonstration of what the difference green sizes will do now we've got a two 20 micron which is almost double not quite double the size holes and you're gonna see now when we're starting the same plant material that we use before we're gonna get a lot more through of course we're getting through a lot now of plant material but this is a good way to make sure you're getting all of it out of your out of your cannabis all your THC [Music] and you'll see on the second run we've got a lot more than we did the first time like about five times more yield but the potency of this is going to be a lot less because you're getting a lot more plant material so for our purposes moving forward we're going to use this for cooking and different things like that and then the first batch that we use before is what we'll be using to press for our EGS in the end we're just showing you what we were able to achieve there we had 3.2 grams there just over three-quarters of a grand there so we had just over four grams of Keef in general which was about a 40% yield [Music] before we move on I would like to talk a little bit more about Daisy screens and thank them for sponsoring this video but Daisy screens are like your classic glass screens I remember these from back in the day and the 90s we used to use these kind of glass screens quite a bit but one thing that's really cool about them is other than they keep your bong a lot cleaner and you know a better way to smoke by using a screen is that they're reusable unlike the mesh screens that just burn through and wear out over time these glass screens as long as you keep up with them you can always bring them back to new put them back into your poll and so you're good so one pack of these our last year a lifetime so again visit polychromatic comm to learn more about their products and cleaning supplies make sure you stay tuned to roughhouse studios because our next video or our next canopy 6 video is going to be pressing this into rosin and then we're going to convert that into EGS so be sure to visit ruffhouse studios.com for hundreds of cannabis culture videos made just for you this is matt from FL studios thank you for watching [Music] you", "8hp58_uVKCo": "[Music] so i'll turn this off now that i'm going live [ __ ] that feels

[Music] oh my god [Music] i've had like this [ __ ] pulled muscle in my chest shoulder and my lats it's just like anytime i move this shoulder or arm it just instantly tenses up hey baby classy thank you [Music] damn dab you got four and a four by four two hermes one lit blue male one pregnant i'll chop [Music] what's up just about [Music] do you're highly disappointed in the rent cuts that you're running why what's going on [Music] with your cuts [Music] [Music] so [Music] i'm just checking work [ __ ] looking at the chat all types of [ __ ] [Music] you got that boost cut [Music] i can't even tell you what the final smell is they don't have their final smell yet when i run the hash i'll let you know what the final smell is [Music] right now it smells like plants oh man if i get my back to pop right now it's so fantastic oh there it goes a little bit [Music] oh man [Music] yeah i was going to order some mango tech sleeves to protect my arms while i'm digging through the the plants and all that [ __ ] but i didn't do it in time so i'm gonna just have to put on like a long sleeve shirt i have uh some long sleeve shirts that i could wear for like chopping down that i didn't want to wear them i just wanted to wear my sleeves what's up ready to hit hot fire how do you do that how do you tag people when you talk in chat i don't even know that oh you gotta do it on the computer if you don't have smell you might need to check um you might need to check your your environment it might be too hot in your room it might be too cold in your room [Music] nah it's not lung related it's a muscle i can feel it like when i raise my arm and i have my hand right here i can feel the the pectoralis muscle like rubber band past my hand which means it's just really tight and that connects all right in here and the laps right here it's not like deep inside my rib cage it's the actual lats like i could grab it and feel it [Music] hmm oh here we go here's a good stretch i'm gonna hold this for a second i gotta just be patient with [Music] the morning stretches i do are so critical for my back i just got done doing some but [Music] the moment you [ __ ] sit back down it like undoes all the [ __ ] that you undo [Music] all right let's go 81 degrees with 50 to 60 humidity damn your humidity's too low bring your humidity up at 81 degrees your humidity should probably be of around 65-70 which means that you might be causing some issues with them transpiring too much you know what i mean oh these are good by the way these are called hempias they're delicious six grams of omega three and six is gluten free vegan and soy free soy free is the key that is the [ __ ] key [Music] [Music] and now let's whatever's in this jar we're going for this next la kushfit [Music] i don't know how i sleep with my arms because i'm asleep [Music] 84 and 45 holy [ __ ] ready you need to up your humidity too bro your humidity is [ __ ] way too low bro you're stressing those plants though [ __ ] out [Music] you guys need to follow vpd charts [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] hmm if it's wet in your tent just from going to 70 humidity that means you don't have enough airflow in your tent you need more airflow higher humidity more airflow [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] there's different vpd charts too you guys should be aware of [Music] make sure that the vpd chart that you look at it's an accurate one for your room that shows the calculation based on the difference between your ambient air temp and your leaf surface tip because like if you're looking at a dpd chart that shows a two degree difference between ambient and leaf and then you look at one that shows a four degree difference between ambient and leaf the the difference in where your vpd curve is at is pretty significantly different um so it's one thing to keep in mind you know always use vpd man you can't go wrong i got about 25 minutes until the [ __ ] hydro store opens up i wish i could start cutting them down but i just i need more neck first and this is going to be a long process a long process i'm trying to think how much net i need i need at least six eight foot sections so i'm gonna get a 50 foot [Music] 50 foot net four four foot by fifty foot if they have that size it might be five by fifty but i'll get one of those six inch squares [Music] one per light i should easily be able to uh hang all that i think like because i've done this so many times by myself i have a methodology that kind of works well but this is my first time doing oh a room this size sorry i can't stop stretching i'm just trying to stay loose or actually loosen up i'm so tight right now yeah it's gonna be a lot of work try to go look in there again it's okay i have way more of this rod way more i think i think i probably have in there it's hard to tell because everything's so folded over now but probably anywhere between [Music] low end eight pounds absolute minimum high end maybe 12 13 [Music] i don't know it's hard to say because i've never ran this configuration before so it's hard for me to eyeball it but it's somewhere between 8 to 12. i i know four pounds is like a big range but i'm not really sure what's going on with the weight of the strain either and the lowers and all that i don't know it's hard we'll see i'm going to um hopefully get it all hung today [Music] and uh the plan is as i go through to remove any um dead leaves anything that's you know already yellowed off completely anything with burnt tips really close to the nugs it's gonna get snipped now so that as it dries those don't pull into the nub and then basically i'm going to leave all of the sugar leaf all of the healthy fan leaves and leave it all on the plants and i'll hang it up that way and then after the um first probably three four days of drying i'll come back in and i'll take all the large fan leaves and trim all of those off just let them fall to the floor and then clean up the floor after i'm done um and then from there i leave everything on and everything gets washed after that so i just let it continue to dry once the nugs are almost snapping off they're pretty much ready you could freeze them at that point but personally i like i like and what i found work best when working with nug run is to allow it to actually dry out more um you know if you let it get almost too dry right just where it barely starts to get too dry that first you know half a day where you're like oh [ __ ] is it time yet is the time yet and you keep checking on it and you know some are snapping some aren't if you give it just a little bit more time to where almost your big buds are snapping and then just take it straight off the branches you don't have to trim it nothing i just grab the whole branch buck the whole thing straight into a bag throw the branch away and then you put everything in the bag that way it's brittle and your trichomes still haven't you know dried out like that and it makes breaking down the bud when you go to wash it ten times easier you end up getting way more yield because especially if you have real dense nugs it's easier to break apart if it's dried out fully i mean fully dried if you still have any moisture inside that bud inside the plant matter it's not going to want to break apart and if it doesn't break apart you can't access those trichomes inside so typically what you want to do if you know you're going to wash it is go ahead and let it dry out and you do a quick dry not a very long dry but not too quick because then you ruin the bud right so usually about six to eight days is where i target um around 65 to 70 degrees in the room and around 40 humidity the first day and then after that i go up to about uh 60 or maybe 55 and uh just let it cruise and check on it often make sure there's a little bit of airflow in the room and then yeah usually by day seven everything's ready to start coming down the progression between day five and seven is very rapid so you have to be ready for it and um yeah you don't have to cure it you don't have to burp it none of that [ __ ] you dry it just the right amount get rid of that green hay smell buck into the bags get as much air out as you can tie it up real good and put it into a chest freezer it'll freeze real quick you'll preserve all your terps you know it doesn't oxidize all crazy you know it works really well that saves me a lot of time on the trimming and honestly the most intensive part right now is uh just gonna be cutting them down without actually knocking everything over because i try to be real gentle you know but right now with how the nets are [ __ ] leaning so much i might have a hard time plucking [ __ ] out and cutting it you know out of there i might i gotta figure out what the [ __ ] i'm gonna do but either way that shit's gonna get knocked out i might call into work for the rest of the day i don't feel like being on call today i don't have any appointments on my schedule though what the [ __ ] are we off today why don't i have anything going on today i mean it's tomorrow [Music] but not do that all right never mind i don't have to call out there [Music] usually if i have like a [ __ ] ton of work i have to do i'll just call out i don't have time for [ __ ] [Music] why do i freeze the bud um i freeze it because that's how you extract the trichomes when you make bubble hash you freeze the bud first makes the trichomes brittle and fall off easily it makes the bud break apart more easily so you can extract those trichomes from the inner parts of the bud and it makes it so that the chlorophyll doesn't leach out into your end product oh this is the bill cosby the great crosby rip cosby [Music] i'm high already [Music] i gotta order a new chest freezer today i'm gonna go ahead and get a 20 cubic foot chest freezer the one i have out there right now is a seven so yeah it's just time to big boy up right i need room to place all of these [ __ ] packs and i am not going to fit [ __ ] i'm going to assume it's going to be like 10 to 15 big ass turkey bags in there it's just not gonna happen so i gotta order that and i've gotta order my um my ice machine today [ __ ] me i was looking at uh the manitowoc ice machines and they're pretty expensive but stop telling me what to do [ __ ] i can't go pov and get going i have to go get the nets first so that i can hang bro yeah see once you're back you're excited huh you're more excited than i am for this chop i think yeah but i gotta get the big freezer um and then the the freeze drop not the free dryer the uh ice machine because i'm [ __ ] tired i'm not going to target don't worry you guys i might go one time before if i have to go before i get the ice machine but i mean i'm going through like 200 [ __ ] pounds of ice at a time and this is not you know what i can get today i can get the larger reservoir for the ro container back here and get rid of this 59 gallon drum because that's not enough water so i think i'm gonna upgrade that to a 200 gallon wide body open top like the same height almost which makes it easy for me to load the ice in check the levels you know insulation will be nice on it where's my tape measure [Music] stretch my ice guy loves me you mean [Music] target i gotta make real quick all right so that's a 29 inch door and i'm gonna look online real quick but i think that the um 200 gallon res [Music] is 28 inches let me see see if i can find it online real quick i know they got at the hydro store but there's so many [ __ ] different reservoirs here uh the container 200 gallon open top excuse me open top flat bottom 200 gallons it is technical drawing shows that [Music] it's 50 and a half inches tall [ __ ] me it's 45 and a half 5 8 inches wide so i can't fit that one because i here's a [ __ ] issue i can't even go into the hydro store right now and shop around and measure anything i have to [ __ ] place the order um on the phone with them or like walk up and try and tell them what i want they open in 10 minutes so maybe i'll just [ __ ] head over there and like [Music] now i'm just going to call them first let's see because i don't want to waste my time going over there i want them to have my order ready so that by the time i get there i can just pull up and throw that [ __ ] in the truck otherwise i get there and [ __ ] takes forever man [Music] oh here we go here's the one i wanted 36 inches long 36 inches all right so that's a 36 so that's not gonna work the 200 gallons [Music] [ __ ] well i guess i'm not going to be able to put the 200 down [Music] want to see i can't keep washing with this 50 gallon because when i do i end up having to um top it off with an extra like 15 to 20 top off water or ice you know i should just be able to add all the ice i need all the water i need have the right ratio it melts down gives me the perfect amount of really cold you know 38 to 42 degree water that's the goal i don't know we'll see [Music] it's hard to find something that [ __ ] fits because everything's like 36 inches and my door is 29 inches i've seen those on like square tanks that fit up against the wall and one of those might be practical but i don't know where the [ __ ] to find them or what they're called i've looked for them before bro stop filling up five gallon jugs [ __ ] that noise uh just like i could [ __ ] stretch out these lower verbs can't i get it in the room sideways then put it up no man it's a [ __ ] circle the bottom is hard plastic circle it's 36 inch diameter and my door is only 29 inches there's there's no way to [ __ ] finagle that into the doorway [Music] let's go with some of this cookie dough yeah i'm not using a collapsible [Music] reservoir um actually you know something i need to take care of in here pretty soon is i need to re-run some electrical and i'm going to switch this sides where i'm going to take this vent rack and move it over here because i've got the extra two layers coming so i'm gonna go ahead and um move my workbench behind me and maybe downsize to a shorter workbench and uh put the the veg track over here and uh then i'll be able to fit a bigger washer or a second washer in here [Music] hmm grab some water first [Music] it's all dry i'm not dehydrated i haven't [ __ ] really drank any water just [ __ ] woke up drinking coffee and dabbing [Music] wow the focus on this gopro is trash anyways cheers happy monday get some damn work done today don't be lazy uh [Music] [Music] she [Music] melissa i haven't i haven't shoot me your information again please because i remember you sent it to me and i have no idea where i went i don't know where you sent it to me at or how long ago and don't tell me publicly but send me your shirt size too because i still have a bunch of the uh shirts from the vendor that [ __ ] up so i need to get rid of them or send me a shirt or two okay i got you it's on patreon i got you ah they changed the look of patreon a little bit [Music] [Music] [Music] you got it nah but i'm only sending the people i haven't sent them to yet i owe some people some care packages still all right i got i got you shout out to all my patreon members yeah i'll shoot you an empty jar see if it makes it through customs first [Music] so all right 9.57 i'm going to go ahead and uh give the hydro store a call here in a minute okay what i need ordered and then uh go pick it up so i can start this harvest i have gloves i have a mask i have scissors i have alcohol i need the nets i have zip ties i can't think of anything else i would need it's been a minute but i think that's all i need [Music] yeah the rosin is going to be [ __ ] amazing from this run honestly it's gonna be good it's gonna be good oh i can't grab too many ipas they make me sick well just alcohol in general my body is uh slowly but surely starting to reject it so even after just like three or four ipas i get nauseous very fatigued it's like very sick before i even get drunk and i just get sick hey the package fantastic it's 9 59. let's go ahead and give them a call [Music] [ __ ] [Music] i better not be allergic [Music] hey what's going on man uh this is uh anthony i needed to place an order with you guys [Music] okay sir who's this mark nate what's going on me uh fun man's chop day we've got a busy day oh yeah you're tired you're tired um do you guys have the six inch square plastic trellis i need like um a 50 foot probably no don't tell me that okay can you hold that four and a half by 100 for me and i'll come scoop that right now i appreciate you [Music] um what uh reservoirs do you guys have there right now like the 100 gallon and up like maybe 100 200 gallons [Music] okay [Music] yeah uh is he in today all right cool i'll see you thanks dude [Music] all right so they've got a four and a half foot by 100 which i'm gonna go scoop that [ __ ] because they either had that or six and a half by 100 and i don't want that that's too long that's they're too wide you know so i'm gonna go scoop that um see if they have the reservoir but i'm really tripping on that today and then i'm gonna come back and get cracking i'll probably grab an extra pair two of scissors and uh yeah [Music] i'll uh try to make a notification on youtube and instagram and patreon maybe um before i start the live session but uh yeah it'll probably be in the next hour or two so stay tuned get ready hit the [ __ ] bell make sure you guys have notifications on [Music] we're gonna start this chat from start to finish i'll try and stream as much as i can and which is probably not going to be that pretty when i first get started until i get into a groove all right so bruce", "srW13xJetJE": "hey Aloha I'm getting ready to make some rosin from my bubble hash using some of these materials and mostly my Dooley tech 3000 press machine three hundred dollars or so was on Amazon thousand pounds of pressure great a little clean well worth it I'm gonna load three of the bubble hash pieces into the micron bag I want to leave maybe a half inch or so cushion around the sides of it then she I'll push it together so that it stays together in a nice group and it's level so that all presses approximately even leave it through the heat press but then I want to cut off part of the bag so that when I fold it over I have about all three quarters of an inch or so on the other side as well to make it even but secure enough so that the bag doesn't blow out I've cut the bag and now I'm gonna fold it over and I'm gonna use for glues some of the dads the older dads on the tip of a toothpick as the glue as I fold the bag over to keep it together and it just reuses it as it heats up it melts with everything else I'd like to do a double fold I'll do a little short fold-over first then I'll apply the dabs as the glue and fold it over again to make sure I have a good seal on this end so again nothing blows out the side all right we got that sealed up nice now I'll get my parchment paper and get ready to place this in between the heat pads once they're warmed up and ready to go all right starting it up it's pre-programmed already I'm gonna go like about 185 183 is my temperature and about 95 seconds or so for my time again this is a thousand pounds press but when I first press it I'll be going very slowly to make sure none of the material gets pressed out too hard too fast before it's actually melted just wanted to know gotta fold this parchment paper in half make sure the shiny side is on the inside and then I'll place my rosin bag inside and ready to place in between the heat press once it's completely warmed up alright and we are ready to close then fold I once it starts at the time again this I have not engaged it fully I'm just partially pressing down pressing a little bit harder I like to push it down and slowly as you see the timer counting down right now two minutes or so so I start a little bit more maybe like two ten and then finally once it's ready hit lock as I push it all the way down and then we'll just wait for the timer to ring and collect our goodies I like to use the ice pack or cold pack under the screen that they provided or the silicone mat that they provide and the tools that they provide and it helps cool the rosin down as it comes out of the press at such a high temperature easier to scrape it off the parchment paper alright that piercing sound tells it let's be ready gonna lift up and see the rosin he didn't drained out of the bag gonna carefully remove it remember these plates are extremely hot so be careful as I take it out and place it onto the cold mat spit that off then one is ready I'll slowly carefully peel this bag off I'll put it in another parchment paper and hook it back up and let it run a second time while I scraped the first one well you ready to scrape I'll put the next one through again same one out of time see if when you just get a little bit more out of it I'll use the silicone container so other scape the rosin out put stores nicely inside there then comes out nicely this point it's beautiful beside that scrape it up all right first time through nice little amount now what will happen is as I seal this and let it sit for another 1224 hours that will melt down and become a really nice orderly looking mixture like this this is from the last batch this is now of the same bag second time through the press and we got a nice amount of additional rosin to be able to harvest put it into our container from those three pieces of bubble hash from our trim and there's a harvest of rosin starting to slowly melt a little bit as it gets to room temperature just drops all the way down to the bottom in a container but there'd be a lot of nice Dappy at side of that", "KzcyieO722M": "just on the celeb time time time [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "MS6BjTDtiOM": "cap dank here again in the smash lab today we're going to be using the nug smash or mini and we'll be showing you how to do a three and a half gram press on the new nug-nug smash 4 mini first of all what I wanted to show you folks is how to adjust the temperature setting on the mini itself you're gonna come to this particular button here you're gonna hit that button and then it's gonna start to flash and you can move your setting up or down and today we're gonna do this particular press at about 200 and let's say 15 degrees then let's make it to 20 okay once it's it can go over hit our button and we're ready to go now we have to wait for for the mini to heat up to our to our pressing temperature so in the meantime we'll get ourselves a three and a half gram hundred and sixty micron bag again we're gonna load it bottle textile so what we're gonna use today is we're gonna be using some of this key lime pie that was grown by Miller farms in rough-and-ready California just want to give a shout out to them so let's wake up three and a half grams of this beautiful flower I'm on the money okay like I said we're gonna load these this bag bottom textile which what that is it's been a load up and flatten into a coin versus some people just load them in flat and the nut smashers are really made for bottle tech that's how they design these and it's gonna give you maximum yield bottle textile so again what we do bottle textile is we fold in the corners right they use a little tool like this because it definitely helps to get the corners into place once you get the corners in I don't think to adjust it with my fingers yeah once again that's about what we're looking for bottle textile so let's let's lay it up beautiful flower okay bottle textile what we're trying to do is set up ourselves with a really good foundation here and just continue adding to that and what this will allow us to do is if it's packed in here correctly we will be able to you'll get a coin puck at the end of the press out of this and bottle textile should be something like that there okay that's about again what we're looking for once we load it up this point we want to cut the bag till we leave about a half an inch okay and again I'm gonna fold the top like a present and the last corner here it is when we load into the machine itself okay so looks like we're getting close to our temperature here so let me get a piece of parchment paper come down here you're gonna open up our open up our our plate these are 2.5 inch plates start our press what we want to do is slowly bring the plates up see how the bag is kind of accordion in on itself start the extraction process yes and we're gonna let our press go for 2 minutes and 30 seconds during the process with the mini you definitely want to keep it under maximum pressure and I think I see some rosin yes starting to flow they're golden beautiful resin about another minute here on the press [Music] about another 30 seconds or so here looking good ok we got 10 seconds left here paper together release your plates looks pretty good to me once again captain dick here in the smash lab with the nug Smasher mini", "apG7e05vly0": "[Music] I'm [Music] [Music] [Music]", "J_ZZ2T4UMm4": "hey how's it going just looking at this on the Sun and I noticed doesn't quite show up as

up for a camera and get a really good camera with a macro lens I want to get Raiden deep they're for you medical cannabis is very expensive here in Canada I'm sure it's probably expensive in the
