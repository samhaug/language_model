{"ojGDhDv1Nbw": "hey there welcome back her buddy this time we're gonna be checking out something new again I got some hash I've never tried before from Jah organics or ever tried their hash before this seems to be called pink champagne a rose a it is six star I thought this was interesting how they did this - they just got labels obviously printed out with all the stars on them and then they'll mark them you know depending on what the the star value is it's not a bad idea I kind of like that these jars I mean just just to start with that these jars are a little big for this amount of hash I mean I could probably fit half ounce of hash in here maybe a little bit less as you can see this is a gram and I mean it barely covers half of the bottom of the jar so I think the jars a little overkill but the smell of this stuff ah it's it's amazing it's very unique it's got a nice floral e like soap smell like a real nice smelling hand soap I know that doesn't sound like it's a it's great but trust me it's it's good in this instance like that like it's it's better like the blue dream kind of has like a floral e soapy flavor that's bad this is the opposite of that I want this in my nose mmm yeah it definitely smells amazing it looks like I don't want to flip this upside down but looks like he wrote 9tu on the bottom or they don't know if it's natural guide but not surprise me if there's some female hash makers in the game that are killing it yeah so I know it's been a little while and I just wanted to smoke out with you guys I have plenty of good hash to bring to the show a lot of them are gonna be more review videos right now or stuff that I make I don't really review what I make I kind of just blaze it and BS with you guys I got a new dab mat that was gifted to me I actually donated for this hash too which is a little bit rare I suppose this stuff just looks so good and I really wanted to bring something new that I have never reviewed before this stuff is actually very very nice but I do plan on bringing maybe some just just to smoke out with you guys some stuff that I made I just recently made some more sift and I still want to bring I have a big old jar of the pineapple Express so I wanted to poof some more of that it's been a while since I had that on here a couple of other things I have some Pacific Northwest roots too great or not great but review trying to think of what else I can't think of it but I'll definitely try to be cranking out a couple more videos I know I've been slacking real busy time spring and all that everything is going crazy and constantly either working outside or in the garden so yeah snow that stuff one more time that's so nice obviously this is it's a six star so that's what they're rating it we're gonna give that a try the stuff is available at Northwest alchemy they have a good collection of just the finest hash makers here in Washington State there's still missing a couple of people but that's okay they got everybody else nobody I don't think anybody else stocks this many different hash makers product in store so it's a good place to go for your hash needs for sure so let's give this stuff shrine a time to clean this gold-digger seems like it just gets caked every time I ever since I put some put events in the drives can't see me hit this thing clean if you guys want more melt make sure to check out a couple the other videos on the channel always melting up some hash and talking about it if you have any questions about hash make sure to check out the informational playlist there's a lot of the frequently asked questions and terminology that we use in community screen cleaned off here I also was a I was gifted this dab manner enough I already mentioned that or not bye bubble modes I mentioned to him that I was needing to get a new dab map for the show and he just tossed me one of these that he had laying around so I figured I'd put that on here I do like it it's just been sitting on my desk these guys definitely got some good meds about if you haven't press this first let's check out a culture whoa come home Betsy come on they wanna see it there we go that's a good shot pink champagne mmm very nice color very nice color oh she looks presto made it out to the dope cup this year don't know if I talked about that too terribly much it was pretty fun definitely not what I expected there was no I mean I usually go to those events looking for seeds or glass or you know something cool like that and it was just basically a hangout there was all kinds of the Spencer EES given out dabs and other you know business people that were dabbing out and maybe selling t-shirts there's a dab like a looks like two or three men bong that people were waiting in line for Giants coal that was kind of cool they even had a like a bowl some cannibals that you get thrown off of it was pretty fun I ended up getting into like I guess the VIP area or like some bar I didn't realize there was a bar there with alcohol which was kind of cool but you needed a special bracelet but they did have just letting me in I don't know I think the the bouncer watches the channel here so he recognized me all right I told him who I was and he recognized my voice and he led us up there let me and my friend up there and it was sweet dude it has like open bar food like the full spread for sure and everything was free a little dab booths it was awesome it's definitely made the trip a little bit more enjoyable that we got a little bit special treatment and then we got a little bit of liquor in US and some dabs and stuff just got funner so that made the dope kept kind of cool I think I forgot to mention that last time ended up getting some says he's wheat products I know I mentioned that now I do remember I did mention something about the dope keV but that was really cool saw Bubba moans there they had a booth right next to the mechanical bull though he does not remember their being in mechanical bull even though they're like right next to it I thought that was kind of hilarious oh yeah mm-hmm definitely intense that lauralee yummy sweet clean soapy smell you guysyou the my phone gonna let you fire some fire I'm definitely impressed so far by this stuff the smell and the way it looks is absolutely amazing I'm going to try to get this all on there at least most of it see I've been doing this like not covering the whole thing a screen I'm working out really good let's see how the video turns out though that's been hitting really good but I don't know I'm not look as good good work this stuff has been getting warm on my desk too as I said all right thanks for hanging out and listening to me ramble try to fill these videos up with some other than just the hash hopefully a couple stories what's the deal dealer you don't like the down man the daily driver for sure definitely looking for a new piece to you I'm hoping to make it some of these events with some glass and find a new daily driver or at least a new piece conversation piece something like that so the SHA organics Pete champagne Cheers that rush to my head whoo Wow so much flavor and so much potency definitely rushing over my brain mmm as soon as I get all that I'll be able to talk about it more but man it's still coming he's definitely there I can see why people are really enjoying this stuff I heard a guy tell me this is like his new favorite bubble hash strain from these guys I mean this period the flavors really intense just like it smelled way more intense well almost like a lemony og in the flavor but still that like really fresh and clean it's like sweet florally hand soap but it needs such a good way I'm usually not a fan of stuff that does that as florally perfumey we're soapy flavors but this is really really nice Oh super-potent definitely a six-star pretty much nothing on the screen left really really enjoy that actually I'm pleasantly surprised by the quality of the stuff after that either just recently and just that I think these guys are new because I had never seen him before before heard about him I mean I can't really say anything bad about this stuff realistically um get new jars okay that's about it the stuff was on point fire I would definitely swoop this and smoke this in my everyday life let's fire sure I've got a little teeny piece left tube not really uh enough for a hit but we'll do like a pineapple Express pink champagne mix hit yeah I think I rambled long enough holy cow it's sixteen minutes yeah it did alright I hope you guys enjoyed and I will catch you next time", "bPtgrC2fuVY": "hey what's up youtube all right guys um i'm gonna start this video again i started it and then i [ __ ] up and i accidentally [ __ ] it up but anyways i'm gonna make some bubble hash on this video guys i'm gonna show you how i make it i got a 5 gallon bucket set up with all my micron bags and i'm i'm not running every single micron bag guys i'm running the 30 and the 70. the filter bag and then the work bag okay so i'm only filtering out the 70 and the 30 micron and i'm using 15 pounds of ice and buds you guys uh out these are a bunch of lowers and some trim that i have so it's hard to see but it's all frosty buds um so i have it set up now i've dropped in about already about two ounces maybe a little more than two ounces and i have another three there and it's all buds and trim guys so most it's gonna be a good yield on this one um for now i'm just gonna set it up like i said i got a layer ice i got it two ounces or three ounces of bud i'm gonna drop in another uh five pounds of ice another layer and keep layering it until i get there guys give me one second and i'll be right back with you all right guys i put in the other three and a half ounces uh all together it's about i don't know seven eight ounces something like that maybe half a pound uh but it's quite a bit of cannabis in there so i'm gonna go ahead and fill it up with water now and this is just tap water and this is uh my broomstick i just take off the broom handle and i use that as my uh as my uh mixer you can use a drill but a drill is uh too aggressive for me and it'll uh it knocks off the car film i just fill up the bucket so i see that there's uh just enough water in there to mix up all the cannabis and the water and the ice mixed together this is called the cold water extraction guys for anybody that's not familiar with this procedure and you can see there's still quite a bit of ice in there and there's just enough water in there for me to mix it around so what i'm gonna do is mix this up for about 15 to 20 minutes a little bit and i'm going to mix the ice the water and the cannabis all together and i'm going to mix the more i agitate it the more uh trichomes are going to fall off the buds guys and this green bag here is the filter bag it catches anything that makes it through this big and then after that is the actual uh the filters which is the 70 micron and the 30 micron i can actually add a little bit more ice in here because there's not enough ice all right give me one second guys all right guys i know it's hard to see that's why i brought out a flashlight but right there that's about the perfect amount of ice and cannabis mixture there's quite a bit of cannabis in there like i said and water mixture you just want it slushy you don't want it you don't want too much water in there you just want enough water to separate and agitate the material and the more you mix it and the faster you mix it the more uh more trichomes are going to knock off so you want to do this for about 20 minutes guys in about 10 minute increments so you want to do it for 10 minutes let it rest for a few minutes and then go back and hit it again and then you can do a second watch you guys this is just going to be the first wash and then yeah and then we'll go from there give me a second and then i'll bring you guys back around once i finish watching this [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] i'm just showing you guys how i mix it and how long i mix it for and how aggressive i am with it the faster you go the more you're going to knock off the trichomes but you're also going to break up a lot of the foliage and the buds as well and that's going to allow everything the more you make it the colder it gets because the ice and water mix together especially when you mix it it gets colder than ice actually is so that's how it works the process and like i said it freezes the trichomes off of all the buds and whatever filters through this first bag gets caught as far as the garbage and everything else the trichomes will fall into the different micron bags whatever you have stacked i do have them all but i don't feel necessary to run all those other microphone bags that's the 70 and the 30 i think are more than enough to filter out all of what you're going to need as far as the trichomes go try not to hit the bottom of your bag guys with your stick because you might tear it or rip it and then you'll you'll contaminate all the rest of your product just by mixing it like this will agitate it enough to knock off all the trichomes and this is pretty much like a light wash a 20-minute wash is really really light especially if you're using bud instead of trim if you're using trim you want to go a little bit more aggressive but you'll get more chloroform which means uh the green will beat screw all the material but in the end it doesn't really matter because you're gonna wash it and i'll show you when we get to that point i'll see you guys here in about 20 minutes after i'm done mixing this up all right guys i've been mixing for about 10 minutes now what i do is i pull the bag up and i just kind of drain it knock everything all the water through it and then i'll let it float back in the water and fill up the bag again and then i'll start mixing and i'll do it uh i'll let it rest for about four minutes five minutes and then i'll start mixing again guys but for now i'm gonna let all everything that i agitated settled through the filters and go through the filters and collect and then i'll see you guys here in about five minutes and we'll start to mix again all right guys it's been about five minutes i'm gonna go ahead and start mixing again and i'll do this for another 10 minutes i'll run about 5 minutes and then i'll wait a second like 30 seconds and then i'll start again it seems real repetitive but that's how you get the most out of your uh your buds or your trim as far as hashtags and then from this you can make it into rosin and you can do it a bunch of different ways to make rods you can do with the hair straightener you can do it with the iron you can do it with a hot plate and an iron sorry my cat's running around it's going crazy and by pulling up the bag guys what it does is it filters it pulls everything to the bottom and just leaves the ice and the cannabis in there and as it settles the water starts coming up underneath and you can start mixing again and there's still quite a bit of ice in there guys ice cannabis a lot of cannabis you could tell i'm not mixing it too hard because the water's like a lime green and it's not green like the color of the the leaf you don't want that to bleach through you can wash it off at the end with oral water or just tap water but give me a second we'll get to that point guys [Applause] [Applause] all right guys i'll be back with you when we go to the sifting process give me one second all right guys it's been about 10 minutes i'm still mixing it i'm gonna mix it for about another uh probably a minute and a half two minutes and then we're gonna go to the sink and i'll show you how i shift out my cannabis in my heart [Music] all right guys in order to sift out your cannabis uh these aren't necessary but they're good to have uh they're micron screens this is a 30 micron i think or 25 micron i'm not sure exactly these are 25 micron if it zooms in and focuses there we go 25 micron okay so these are 25 micron bags and what you're gonna do guys is you're gonna is i'll set it up here on my counter right there and when i'm done uh scooping it out of the bag i'll scoop it right on to there and i'll fold it over and i'll press it with the towel on the bottom of the top and it's gonna strain out all of the all of the water and it's going to leave just behind just the just the rosin just the hash so this is uh these are essential to have and you can buy them on amazon or ebay for like anywhere from uh three dollars to to fifteen dollars depending on how many you buy i usually buy them in bulk and you can buy them uh ten packs five packs uh three packs you can buy them individually uh but they're really really necessary in order to make the to sift out the hash you can you can just let it dry out on a piece of cardboard as well if you don't have any screens you can just get a piece of cardboard put it on there and just uh scrape it up after the fat on the cardboard and it'll just come right up like i said the cardboard will suck out most of the most of the water uh this is just a way to sift it out you put it on top and you squeeze it and i'll show you how that's done when we get to that process but for now we're still mixing up the hash and we're gonna give it another probably let me see if i sing zoom in if it'll clear up there we go so we're going to mix this up for about another minute and then i'll show you guys how we do the the extraction process [Applause] you you don't want to try to mix it too hard guys you don't want your material or water to fall between the bags because what will happen is it'll contaminate your hash that green bag is actually a filter bag so if anything falls in between there it'll catch it but you don't want to try to mix it too aggressive where it's splashing because the water carries a lot of hash and a lot of material and it'll contaminate your hash if it falls in between the flaps usually you're supposed to fold them over but this bucket that i have is a little bit wider than a regular five gallon bucket and these bags don't fold over so i'm just doing it like this and then you know i don't have any issues just don't uh don't don't uh don't fill your bags up too much and too much ice and where it's going to fall over or fall between your bags you don't want that to happen because it will contaminate your hash you'll have pieces of uh of bud or whatever material in your hashing and you'll see it too you can pick it out but you don't want to it's better just to do it right the first time you can even add more ice as the ice mouth when you're mixing as you can see there's not i mean there's still quite a bit of ice in there but you can add more ice and it'll freeze it even faster uh the colder bets the better that's why you keep your your fresh frozen in the freezer as soon as you trim it off the plant you put it right in the freezer and you just freeze it and that's why when you're freezing it makes it easier for it to fall off the track when you actually put it in the ice in the water all right guys we're going to go ahead and do our bag extraction i'm going to show you how that works right now let me back up my tripod and there's the other bucket that we're going to use and uh as soon as this thing clears up all right so what i do guys is i pull out my bag and it's going to filter out all the water and all the sediment all the all the hot is going to come out the bottom and i kind of mixed it up as the water is going through because it's just like stirring it up but all right guys and i'm going to go straight into another five yellow bucket so i don't use any of that hash water that's coming out the bottom because that'll go on my next run all right and this one right here is just my filter bag this catches all the trash any trash that may come through that bag or if that falls on the side so it's not really a 14 this one here is our zombie micron and it's pretty loaded i can tell you now because the water is kind of coming out fast and this bag changes pretty fast so what i do guys is i got the top just like this and i'll pull up the other bag make sure i'm not going to lose any of this water because anything that comes through this bag is going to get caught in the 30 micron any other hatch and i'll shake the bag let's see how fast that water came out because that tells me that there's some hash in this bag how much i don't know we'll see i used quite a bit of material so we'll see you don't want to let any of this water go to waste because anything that's falling out is getting caught in that second bag guys remember that we got a good little mountain here and this is actually some people prefer this bag over all the others as far as quality of the cannabis goes because uh this is the gold gold bag this is the one that comes out the most uh golden and actually i've had 30 micron come out golden too but it just depends on the material all right guys we're gonna come to the bag over here set the tripod up let's bring it up now it doesn't look like quite a bit now but once i run some water i'm going to run some water through this and all that right there is hash guys the gold selection and i'll tell you i'll show you how that looks like here in just a second give me one second so i'm going to lay the bag in there i got a cup of tap water right here i'm just going to wet the sides walls down wash any hash that got that got caught on the sides i'm going to wash it all down to the bottom screen and i'm going to shake it and it's going to all gather together in one spot um and no matter how much water you want to i probably lost a little hat from the bottom end because there might have been some 30 micron that just went down the sink but uh it's all right and now i'm gonna pick up the bag and let it all gather in the middle and i'm gonna wet it down let it catch all together just shake it this one is probably the easiest bag of hash to make because uh the micron is not so small where you can't uh or you can gather it with a 30 micron it catches everything and you have to really work at that bag right now what i'm doing is i'm just running cups of water through it and i'm washing it washing off any of that green color that may be in the hash and you guys will see that if you mix your hash too much it'll it'll actually turn your hash green now what i'm doing is i'm going to grab the bottom of the bag where the hash is at i'm squeezing it you see it and i'm going to bring up through the bag and then right there is our hash and you can see how good quality that hash is this is the creme de la creme most people like the 70 and a couple of other microns that that uh that they like but that's a good amount of hash guys if you guys ever run hash you know it takes a lot of material to make hash and you can see that this hash is actually really decent this will be really really sticky if i uh don't uh gather it real quick and put it on the on the microphone bag on the screens and i'm going to show you that process right now guys you can use a spoon or you can use a credit card or whatever you want see how that one just fell right out and you can just scoop it all on on the spoon and then just knock it down on the screen and you can even run more water through this and gather all the all the hash on here that you can't see that's real small because this stuff is like dust guys um it's just gathered together with the ice and the water and you see it after the fact is it's like a sediment and there's still hash on here guys but anyways what i wanted to show you guys about the sifting process so i got a cloth here just a regular cloth i'm gonna fold the the hash over and i'm gonna put it on the outside of both sides of the hash and i'm going to press on this guys and the water is going to get absorbed by the by the by the rag and the hash is going to be on the inside and that's your finished product guys or one of them and then you can uh you can squeeze this out a little bit more if you like um like i said i'm gonna go ahead and run the run the water through this bag and i'm gonna collect whatever i didn't miss whatever it was on there because i know there's quite a bit of quite a bit of material still in there and this is just the first wash guys this is not a aggressive wash by any means most people uh do aggressive and they wash their stuff really really really vigorously and that's where you'll get that green tint to your hash and you can wash most of it out but sometimes you can't wash it all out that's why not i try not to get that aggressive on my first wash and i try to keep it as simple as possible um so what's left in there is uh about another quarter teaspoon of hash as soon as i gather it all together but that's like i said that's pretty much the way it works guys it's not very hard it's not complicated and then i still got the 30 micron which is quite a bit too uh let me pause this video because it's getting long as hell and then uh we'll get to that all right guys i'm getting the last 30 micron bag as you can see it takes a lot to get this through because it's a it's a really really fine fine bag the 30 micron is really really small and this is what i do to get out because it it'll get real foamy as you shake it as you can see inside the bucket all the foam and uh i'll try to squeeze out as much as i can you're not supposed to do this but it just takes too long to do it any other way at least for me it does i get all impatient and i'll go to the sink here we'll open it up see how much hash we got in there and it looks like a decent amount i'm just gonna run the sink turn it half a gallon of water 16 ounces of water go through there and then uh it takes a while you got it this is the way i do it guys this is the quickest way to get it out of there and and i know it's cold that's why i clearly empty it out and then i do a little bit of tap water so it brings it down to temp um but it's not going to filter through this bag once it's uh in this bag but this is how you get off the rest of the water and it takes a while guys just be patient try not to force it through like sometimes i'll squeeze the bag the way i was doing just before i brought it up to the thing uh but this is uh the other way to get it out because if not you have to wait for it and it takes forever and even if you leave it sitting there it'll it won't drain completely you have to physically go in and drain it but once most of the water is drained you can just squeeze the bag and most of the house will be on the bottom and like i said this is a quick wash guys you can wash it three times or even four times i don't usually do it more than twice or sometimes three times it just depends on the material and how much i'm running just be patient that's all it is being patient i'll uh be back with you guys in just a second hold on all right guys look at all that hash in there i know it doesn't look like much but it's quite a bit give me one second all right guys so that's the finished product of the 30 micron it's like peanut butter but the best kind of peanut butter and this is actually more than the the 90 or 70 micron and it looks just as good that's why i really don't do any other ones and these two because they always come out really really similar and the quality is always the same if you're growing quality and you're putting quality in you'll get quality out and see how golden that is compared to that one it's very it it's barely any difference this one looks a little lighter to me but there's at least a quarter ounce right here of uh of product and it'll be real fire once it's dried and a lot of people put this under a press and press out all the water you don't have to do all that guys as long as you're putting your body weight on it and you're using the right micron screen you're gonna get all the water out and then it'll dry within 24 hours see look there's a piece of material that got through right there is that green a piece of a leaf or something went through the screen and made it through that screen but uh no biggie we can sit that out after the fact and uh i probably will i'm gonna go ahead and rinse this bag one more time run a little bit more water gather the rest of the hatch together and now i'm gonna do another maybe wash or two and i'll probably end up with about uh 10 to 18 grams of hash by the time i'm done i've cured done hash because i usually let it cure for about a week or two and then we'll have a nice uh oxidation on the outside but the inside will be nice and creamy and light colored i'll usually mix these together to be honest i usually don't uh separate them and then i'll press them into hash but everybody has their preferences on how they like the hash this is the way i do it it's real simple it's easy um you can even save this hash and break it up like some people do or you can just leave it in a ball and it'll oxidize and it'll turn into like a temple ball you can roll it and some heat with your hands or a bottle and make some even better hash full melt if you like but yeah there's a lot of ways you can a lot of things you can do with hash from edibles me my personally what i'm going to do is i'm going to press it into rosin and then use it from there and uh edibles or however i want to use it but that's the best way i like to do it because i can do my dabs smoke my oil that's how i like my oils personally but yeah so this is my process guys real simple easy it takes about an hour to do it but a little longer because this time i'm showing you the process as a step by step more or less and the bags that i use and like i say that green bag there is just a filter bag it's not it's not for any hash or anything uh the two filter bags that i do use of the 70 and the 30 micron that's it and then a filter bag to catch any junk of course and then uh the work bag which is the 30 micron which is in there in the bucket underneath the green bag because i'm still going to wash this material at least one more time but yeah that's how i do it guys so if you have any comments or anything you want to know anything let me know in the comments below have a good one stay safe and stay medicated guys have a good one", "hQ-2ooQuUkU": "[Music] hi and welcome to canada basics today we're going to learn how to make bubble hash [Music] bubble hash is one of the oldest and purest methods of making concentrated cannabis and uses only ice and water as a solvent it's easy to do but requires time patience and some elbow grease so let's get started here's what you need to make bubble hash when it comes to making bubble hash you are going to need some bubble bags and these are usually vinyl bags that are designed to fit inside of one gallon or five gallon buckets and they have a silk or micron screen bottoms and those that vary in different sizes 25 to 220 microns and you're going to need three to five different sizes of those you can find links to those kinds of bags on amazon in the description you're also going to need a wooden dowel to agitate the cannabis you're going to need some ice about 10 15 pounds of ice you're also going to need some cannabis you can use any grain of cannabis that you want for here we're going to use about three or four ounces of outdoor grown cannabis if you're using outdoor grown cannabis or any kind of cannabis you're going to go ahead and manicure it down to its buds so go ahead and pull off the major portion of the leaves until you get down to the pods unless you're actually using shake and trim which you can also make bubble hash out of shake and trim but we're using the buds and we're going to go ahead and manicure that down the next thing you're going to do is to layer your bags inside of the bucket we're using a five gallon bucket you may use a one gallon bucket also depending on the bags that you have but the thing that you want to do is you want to layer your screens inside of the bucket starting with the smaller screen first so in this case we've put our 25 micron screen in then we put our 73 micron screen in now we're putting our 160 micron screen in and then lastly we'll be putting our 220 micron screen back in and micron screens and that a micron is the measurement of microns with 220 microns means that 220 microns will fit through each hole in that screen and then so the smaller the number the smaller the size of the holes so and now that we've added our screens and layered them up and now we've added our cannabis into our 220 micron screen we've added about three or four ounces of cannabis and then now we're adding in ice now the ice is being used in this case to lower the temperature so that it freezes the trichomes and so that the stems of the trichomes are brittle and the trichome heads break off into the water so you want to use as much ice as possible so we're putting as much ice in we're covering up our cannabis and we're coming about six inches from the bottom of our pocket and now we're also going to add water and you want to add water so that it covers up into barely covers the cannabis which is in the the bottom of our top bag so you can tilt the screens or tilt the bucket to find out if see if you estimate if you have enough cannabis enough water to cover your cannabis but that's the idea is that you want to have enough water to cover your cannabis as well as up into the eyes and what we're doing is we're freezing the the trichomes so that the stems become brittle and the trichomes heads fall off and the idea is that to break and agitate the cannabis so now we're agitating turning and using our wooden dowels to actually literally just agitate and mix the cannabis being sure not to poke holes into our micron screens we're going to keep agitating as much as possible you can do this for several minutes 15-20 minutes or so and then after you do that you're going to let it settle and we've uh what we've done is we've broken frozen those trichrome heads and we've letting them uh fall into the water and then they've fallen through those micron screens and this larger micron screen we're now taking that out it's been several minutes after it's been agitated and it's been sitting for about 45 minutes and now we're taking out the the top screen the 220 micron and setting it aside and now we're going to pull up our first green which will have trapped some of the uh larger pieces of cannabis and our thc and trichomes and also some plant material so this first layer of screens that we're pulling out is going to be our least pure it's going to have our most plant material it's our biggest micron screen and most of the thc has actually fallen through this screen so but you can see there we've pulled out a little bit of bubble hash there and it's a darker color hash and then now we're pulling out our second screen and in order to uh save the cannabis that was left on the screen that we didn't wash off we're inverting it carefully and then dipping it back into the next green down into the water that's in that screen and that is to wash the trichomes off into that next screen so now we're removing the second screen out i believe this would be our uh 73 micron screen and we're we're letting the water fall out of that we're not going to squeeze it we're gonna let it fall out and then you can see now that the trichomes that are left there a little lighter color than the first set and there's also more of them and there's a lot less plant material here as you can see compared to the previous hash that came out it's a lot lighter color but again we're rinsing the remaining hashtag we didn't scrape off into the next batch or into the last screen so we make sure our screen is nice and clean and then we've come to our last screen and this is our 25 micron screen and we'll see this is the finest screen and this is going to make sure that pretty much anything left on here that's any thc is going to get trapped in this screen here and as we scrape that up you can see it's pretty easy to collect the cannabis or the thc that's collected there or the hash and it's a nice uh lighter a little more blonde color than the previous two a little bit more pure and you can see that's why those screens are used so that you can get different grades of hash and the next step now a lot of people would use a micro on screen here we didn't have a micron screen we're just using some cheese cloth or a muslin cotton muslin bag here and we're squeezing out the water it's just being pressed out gently with some palm pressure there to press out the water and what's going to be remaining is bubble hash and what we've got here is three different grades of bubble hash depending on the three different screens that we used and and in the end we're actually going to combine all of our hash altogether so i'm just showing you the different screens there for demonstration purposes but if you're only going to use one grade of hash in the end uh there's really no need to have multiple screens you might just use one or two screens in that case but for demonstration purposes we're using multiple screens to show how you'd get different grades of hash and now that we've uh we've gone one run of our canvas you can do this two or three different times or even up to five or more times with each batch of cannabis so this is the second run with the same batch of cannabis just with another run of the water and ice this one actually sat overnight this second run we got a pretty good yield off of it even better than the first and then we even decided to go ahead and run a third run off of the same batch of cannabis and so even after collecting two pretty good batches of bubble hash with it we went ahead and decided to go the third one and even after the third running we're still getting some more hash out of it you can see after the third time the cannabis is getting it looks like a lot like seaweed it's very foamy it get agitates a lot easier and it also gets foams up a lot easier as the last two or three batches were gone but once they pressed out the the phone goes away and you can see that there are three different batches of bubble hash there at different stages of drying out and you can see that the uh the newer batch is much muddier looking uh the batch in the center there is the first batch we did is dried out from overnight this episode of cannabis is brought to you by the roughhouse studios smoke shop selling raw

"2oAAoRWXYDA": "[Music] hi friends it's sasha welcome back to my channel i have my friend adriana here again today actually since you last saw her she created her own youtube channel so we're gonna link that down below and i'll say at the beginning of the video there will be a part two to this so we're doing i mean i guess it's kind of diy dabs since we're doing the part two it is because we're making hash today we're gonna make bubble hash we got the bubble bags freeze pipe is actually sponsoring this video we have one of their little bubblers right here and they were kind enough to send over the bubble bags and adriana brought her just like a little setup yeah i'm glad i have your support for this because it would be a show without it yeah we'll make it work um but yeah we're gonna do a part two on her channel and we are going to take our bubble hash and then we are going to press it and make rosin with it so that will be really fun we're going to take a hit to start off this video and then we're probably going to be outside because it's best to work in the colder times a little bit cooler yeah yeah but it's like really warm 53 i think it said yeah something like that it was like 30 yesterday so ideally it should be anywhere from like 35 to 40. yeah it's okay we'll deal with it honestly the sun is setting so it's only gonna get colder i know it's perfect fine all right well cheers cheers oh i just realized i'm christening this piece it's a new one this one too i haven't tried this one oh you didn't try that one last time i tried the um rainbow yeah i didn't leave it in the freezer for that long but it's still like cool nice and cold mm-hmm there's one one more i love that our videos end up being like either nature or crafty that's what it's been so far i love making stuff mm-hmm really i appreciate that it's fun besides my other big passion is pottery i love crafting oh that's right i can't draw fur yeah but i just can't do two-dimensional stuff but when i can sculpt something yeah i love it i have so much fun that's really this is kind of creating something yeah definitely all right i guess this video might be kind of vloggish styled we're just going to like roll with it and see what happens but i guess we shall bring everything outside get set up yes all right we are setting up i just like the bags and the little stirrers in there but we have this five gallon bucket there's ice in the cooler we lucked out her uncle has an ice machine so we didn't have to go out and buy any saved our butts and then adriana actually brought over so it's a five gallon and a seven gallon bucket but the bottom of the five gallon bucket is cut off and i was telling her how i helped a friend make bubble hash and we literally like were sitting there holding the bags waiting for them to drain they were so heavy it was crazy whereas this method the bags aren't like sitting in the water at the bottom of the bucket they're just kind of suspended above it so that just kind of does that whole process for you and so what we're going to do is we're going to start with the lowest number micron bag and we're gonna start layering them um lowest to highest perfect here look at this setup so i can help you so we're gonna do all of them right yeah we'll do all of them just to try it out do you um have water outside i wonder how the i can do it inside i can go fill it up inside and then just bring it outside yeah inside might be better just because i don't know if the pipes are frozen still from like uh yeah i wouldn't trust him you know [Applause] so i got those all on they're nice they're there yeah so what i'm doing is just making some thin layers of ice ice and then i love that word [Music] [Applause] all right oh also adriana brought a sprayer yeah she's official that's gonna come in handy when we're trying to spray the hash off the sides oh yep i feel bad i'm just like standing here watching her freeze her little hands off no honestly honestly it's gonna be funny because one of us are gonna be standing here again stoned and the other one of us going to be standing here stirring yeah we're just going to swap yeah yeah okay just expensive have some bubble hash all right we're getting towards the top all right now we've got all the weeds in there and then we've got layers of ice in between them as we kind of explained do you have any estimate of how much blood is probably in here it is like trim larva like they're really small buds but probably like a quarter pound if that like four ounces yeah okay nice um we're gonna go put water in it and let it sit for like a couple of minutes cool now it would be just as easy to do this on a smaller scale what do you think is like the minimum quantity someone should people first it's different because if you want like a personal head stash this is what i would suggest like a five gallon but um to test out like how well different strains react to being washed yeah people do it in a mason jar whoa so that's cool something as small as like a liter yeah mason jar you can shake it up and do a mini version of this all right cool just want to give people some things to do yeah sometimes like sometimes when you're washing certain strains will be oilier than others and it just won't the trichome hood won't break off as nicely as other strands yeah so it makes sense it depends hi we're back indoors so what i'm looking for right now is a certain motion and you'll see it when it happens see oh yeah okay we're like everything almost stays in place when you move the bucket in a sense it's like genuinely a workout there's no idea that's why i said we're gonna be switching at one point i'm gonna be like sasha no i wanna help all right i think beautiful cool how long do we let the weeds sit in the water we can let it sit for another like two or three minutes okay and then you start stirring for would you say ten minutes yep we're going to put an alarm on for 10 minutes and then that'll be the first wash i want to go like this there you go hi baby [Music] yeah you look much better i love this jacket because the pockets instead of being like the same material as the outside it's like fuzzy on the inside i don't know what else is in there oh yeah it's like sweetie yeah mine's like straight up fleece oh yeah that keeps your hands so much warmer though it's like wearing gloves all right the alarm went off so oh it's time to start let me know when to tap in oh guys a lot of help [Applause] so weird being out here when there's no roof on the thing oh yeah i know so i kind of like to create a vortex motion kind of like a wash or wood yeah some people say washing it in different ways like this almost like switching it up yeah i'm someone who like just has my experiences to go off of you know yeah exactly and what i've learned from other people along the way you want me to feed you a giant now do you want to try and like almost get low or just kind of keep pushing i believe if you get the vortex motion going it's all going i have to like adjust how i'm holding it because my nails are so long that they're like digging into my skin i have really long nails right now i'm going to be like why is my forearm so sore you ever do that just like yep to kind of get the corners and yeah and like the stuff that's been sitting on top for a while mixed in there yep that's why those flatter ones are good to like get the pictures yeah you really don't want to fill up a bucket any more than that though yeah [Applause] like the nice i'm not not calling you strong but i'm not strong but people who can like do the vortex for like 10 straight minutes sometimes it like builds all the way up to the top like if you try to go really fast see how it feels yeah and as the ice melts too it'll get a little yeah easier now if you have a mason jar you just like literally just shake it yep oh cool and then you'll see i've never done it that way i've seen it people do it that way um like on videos and stuff i do believe you have to put a culture on top of sorts okay actual glass container but um i know you can find videos and do that but yeah it just shows like real quick the separation we missed 420. we said we weren't going to and we did there you go here i'll go here i'll take [Applause] over you're gonna watch some footage here of me struggling with a lighter burp actually oh you're going faster than i was oops you can start see the bubble yeah you can start like agitating it a little bit more afterwards oh okay oh it's probably especially now the ice is melted too yeah and you can actually like do another wash with this too okay and aggravate it even more one minute you can try to finish it out do you want to come on yeah sure okay good yeah all right we do need a spoon that's the last thing i forgot okay um [Music] put the spoons in there this is where we use that thing our sprayer oh the sprayer i was like what thing you know that thing over there the only other thing that's really out here does it help to have a second person like squeeze the bag or is that really second person really comes in handy when you're stirring like yeah get tired this can be used for a second wash too so you can like oh cool empty this right back in the excess water that's left after this two you can use oh wow yeah that's cool all right so let's put that in for now the 160 oh yeah that's right it goes backwards this part's fun oh okay spraying the edges yep perfect nice that seems like a success so far do you want me to hold the bag i'm sure if you want to hold it open so the class is probably helping you too actually just thinking that i was like wow this looks so much better on camera and i was like wait it probably looks so much better in person too orange bag okay let's do it real quick so this is gonna be probably our highlight highest cool okay marshmallow jacket all right ready i'm gonna hold it from this corner yeah do you prefer me to just that's okay you can record it i got it the color looks all like wonky because of the yellow this looks cool that's a decent color [Music] a little bit darker and taller than easily desired but beautiful oh it's actually we should collect that we should go like that it's like muddy water i might actually be able to microplane that tonight oh yeah yeah that's real nice consistency all right um i'm tapping out yeah good this is awesome look at that all right we are already replacing the paper towels that were underneath this little mesh thing so if you don't have one of these you just use parchment paper for this or you like need one of these i suggest you grab one of these okay comes like in a five pack on amazon for okay for wicked cheap and it's just a 25 micron little sheet cloth whatever yeah um we can use parchment paper after we microplane it okay um that i personally haven't used it but maybe you can i just don't know personally yeah this volume oh yeah that's nice i'm impressed look at us yeah it's gonna be even more exciting when you take the dab yeah i'm excited i'll probably put some on a bowl do you think i could put some on of course we can oh yeah how soon hell yeah dude we can do whatever we want we can do it right now i mean it's there's definitely going to be more yeah yeah yeah if you want to just say like yolo like let's do it all right expect a little snap crackle pop yeah we'll use the first one that we don't seem to be the driest right okay that one is right there he's back in there if you guys hear voices in the background brendan's playing games with his friends and talking about microphones i think okay so we're gonna try and smoke some of it normally you wouldn't do it this fast we want to try a little bit before she leaves but yeah the fun of it we'll get together like within the next week and a half i would say and make that hash and it'll be really really fun to dab that um and we'll probably do that like i said over on adriana's channel so let me finish this and then oh hi cat so i don't think i'm sure a lot of you have seen my videos the freeze pipe before but i didn't kind of mention that this top part uh detaches and you can put it in your freezer because there's glycerin in there and then it makes your hits extra cool it's still pretty cold because we had it outside for so long yeah like it's still really cold well the smoke looks so cool yeah oh my god it does do you follow hippie hey hippie hi his name's cassidy um she does these really cool story posts of standing behind her ring light and like sticking her bong through it so you're not like looney tunes how the thing pops through the circle at the end like that's almost like how she's hitting her bong and the smoke looks so freaking cool like it's insane ed tell me it's not better okay so we've gotten like a bunch of inside jokes on my streaming from him like randomly yelling things and like we can hear it like one time he was playing a game with his friends and he yelled what a goal and like yeah this was like almost a year ago i want to say and people in my chat still say it they'll just normally go whoa don't stare i think it's more of like the looking up kind of like it's supposed to be good for some reason i feel like i heard that about hiccups like if you put your head all the way back you know what works for me for hiccups every time every time all right i'll have to try that next time please do document it i i will i will um because i get hiccups bad sometimes where i get like pain yeah i get like my collar bones because they last yes so long i get mad what the here we go i'm paying you back for that time that maybe that all right there you go so if you just like one corner i don't know he's good all right let's see how this goes all right we have a bunch of just okay i don't want to say wet but pretty wet bubbles [Music] look at that we all just figured out each other's spices dude i'm not kidding i think we all were just too loud you could see it bubbling in the beginning because yeah that's so cool oh i can definitely taste it it's like i should put flour in it but i got like a vaporized yeah there's a little bit more flour in here i think oh it's too late you're gonna have to clean that i'm sorry i'm not using it oh my god it's great it kind of melts it all in there a little bit try this one and the reason it is sparking which is probably obvious for most of you um is because of the moisture that's still in there it gives you a little sizzle oh god it's honestly like that my throat is more successful hey you're like i'm done sounds good are you good i'm great thank you for having me good morning thanks again for just being in another video we're gonna i don't know maybe do more diy-ish sort of things a little more i feel like i have to talk extra lab because brendan's playing games with his friends but um yeah i'll have adriana's channel linked down below i'll have freeze pipes instagram links down below and i will definitely see oh wait no i won't see you guys soon actually that's right so this video is going up in the third what did i say wednesday yeah wednesday the 30th before the end of yep and then i'm gonna stream tomorrow uh as you guys are seeing this on the 31st not like through midnight or anything like that but i'm going to stream for a little bit and then i'm taking like two weeks off so but in that time i'll be on your channel so head over to my channel check it out but thanks again for watching thank you freeze pipe for sponsoring this video and i will see you guys soon you", "c2zn8hrEVdo": "yo yo yo what is good you guys welcome back to another live stream getting ready to get down with this mendo breath wash it's been a long ass [ __ ] day but it don't matter we got [ __ ] to do we got to get them that grizzy so got the freeze dryer i just started it up right now it started its freeze cycle so it's going to take approximately 20 to 30 minutes to get down to an appropriate temperature to be ready to handle the hash in the meantime i've got everything else set up we'll go over that in a minute once we get everybody else in here and uh we're gonna be washing two pounds of some mendo breath nug that was cultivated by hambone gardens and uh dudes an excellent grower smashed it with this [ __ ] mendo breath and the um the wedding crasher he has coming down right now [ __ ] phenomenal um so i'll be running a few pounds of that next but um yeah we're gonna get it done what's up loan loan i was just talking about you earlier i need a paddle bro i need a custom paddle pay you cash your dabs whatever just let me know i need a custom paddle made bro so uh we're going to chill for a moment i'm going to take a dab or two we're gonna get everything kind of started and then uh once it's time to start i may go ahead and put it on members only mode so that way as i'm working if i look up and i see a question i know it's from one of the members and i can make sure i respond if i have time or at least get back to it lego you're gonna get in this runts guts right now yeah i feel like it's almost a sin almost to mix it with other [ __ ] but i'm gonna mix it with some of this ice cream cake oh [ __ ] [ __ ] balls isn't it crazy these two different rosins came out of the same room harvested at the same time processed the same exact way and they have such differences in color texture and smell and potency i mean everything it's not a one grammar it's a 0.3 maybe price machine is playing catch up right now i probably went through about 250 to 300 pounds of ice today getting the reservoir ready to go if it was summer and i didn't have this ice machine i probably wouldn't be making ash right now there's just no [ __ ] way i'd be able to keep up you guys make me wash too often damn it now i'm going to throw you down here for this melt shot because it's not often that i do the runt and the ice cream cake together in harmony i'm gonna sit down though because i feel like i'm about to [ __ ] myself over so hard so let me just sit my ass down right now okay yep am i comfortable yep i'm comfortable now cheers you guys [Music] oh yes let us go cheers it's all about to be uh on youtube bro uh you know when you blow smoke out and you think you're done then you go to talk or cough and more smoke just keeps on [ __ ] coming out that's how those low temp dabs hit all right let's get things started i gotta remember where the [ __ ] i'd be putting the camera in [ __ ] welcome to the daily dabbers all eyes on me all right let's get you guys so you guys know this setup i went ahead and bought some five gallon buckets today instead of using the uh big 20 gallon lids we're gonna use the five gallons since it's only two pounds we're not washing if it was three or four pounds i would maybe use the 20s but the fives should be able to handle it i gave them all a good alcohol bath today rinsed them out with real good cold water and made new bucket lids like i said so now each one has its own all the way down to the bottom so i'm using a 220 here then a 160 i'll collect everything between 160 and 220 and use it for edibles or test pressed whatever and then i have a 45 everything between 45 and 160 i'm going to use for full spectrum rosin and then 25 to 45 we may or may not end up using it we'll collect the first two to three washes if it's dumping we'll keep collecting if it's not we'll pull it out and not use it that's also going to be for test pressing so we got that and then underneath here we got a little pump a little eco plus pump power cable comes out this way it's plugged in when i need it to turn it on um and then the dump comes out this way a little ball valve here i'll turn it on when i need it and i drop it into here and uh got a p-trap and that goes out to my drain outside which drains it out in a way we got a huge 160 gallon res with ice cold water in there a couple hundred pounds of ice this [ __ ] has a jacket but it needs a beanie because it's sweating got the cold sweats and then we got the avanti not gonna be washing in the avanti today we're going to be washing by hand with the spoon 20 gallon wrapped in a pele using rosin evolution all mesh bags 5 gallon here 20 gallon here and uh yeah that's the plan just got it sitting on a cooler down here so it's stable and it's more at an appropriate height for me and i'm [ __ ] killing my back you know what i'm saying only thing is i wish this was longer and bigger and had a better handle come on loan where you at dog take care of me baby take care of me [Music] so what are we gonna do we're gonna do a couple things here finish prepping [Music] probably gonna need to add more ice in here once we get the where was i gonna put this over here like come on dog how high are you probably gonna get more ice in here later once this gets going spoon get it cold now we're gonna start prepping this okay oh yeah i'm gonna make some rso and i finally found my mason jar i'm gonna use it's my old gallon that we used to keep on the counter to drink water to fit perfect all those mace or all those hash pucks and it's got a spout even perfect i don't think he weighed them 100 percent i'm not sure if you mark them no so i'll grab the scale and get these weight up oh yeah you're gonna come with me in the house oh my magnificent wife brought it back outside to my workstation without me having to ask her and i didn't have to go get it that's because she's better than if it was something of hers that [ __ ] would still be out here i'd still have it she'd be pissed you guys know how this goes if you're married [Music] you know just that's just the way it is so anyways i'm glad she brought it back let's get this weighed out black and white of your logo yep got you okay whatever you need please i got you let's make it happen okay we're grams we're tearing out we got that [ __ ] okay 530 so 515 in this one and 515 and this one as well they're both exactly the same so about a thousand so the quality on the bud i'll show you oh [ __ ] [ __ ] wow i'm glad this is what i'm going next jesus that [ __ ] is dang that answer your question woof the smell it's like sweet sweet caramel gas this fire so we're going to get some ice on this first layer and then some bud some ice and there's some bud a ninja mice and then some buttons and some ice okay so we'll be back let me grab some ice so so [Music] [Music] two inch layer on the bottom here i guess i could show you super fire job on this man super fire job let's see how she dumps okay let's go grab some more ice i'll be back you guys can chill chill [Music] chill probably gonna have to grab my five gallon bucket okay we'll do one more just to make sure it's fully covered [Music] um so that's good we're gonna want this out of the way what am i stupid what what am i stupid almost forgot a bag and you know what's dope is he dried it the way i asked him to he dried it exactly how i asked him to and it came out exactly how i thought it would get some more ice so so [Music] so [Music] cool [Music] before we fill this up and get this heavy as [ __ ] we're gonna move around here [Music] hey i'm [ __ ] freezing my tits off already and this is even my thick one i'm about to run upstairs and get my thick one the [ __ ] thin one right here the summer one all right [Music] tetris tetris it's nothing like playing a tetris [Music] tetris yes yes chill right there chill right there um so i mean i can put you guys on the headset if you for want chest strap [Music] just sift it do some paint roller tech [Music] [Music] chef so [Music] there's like a fat ass nerd right there oh [Music] [Music] yeah goat i gotta get set up for streaming i'm gonna buy a whatever i need [Music] make it all good issue is my modem keeps dropping the internet connection it's not my router it's my modem because the internet says where the the motor or the router sees me stays connected [Music] the ice is so [ __ ] clear i couldn't even tell that most of the buds right here actually submerged already this first this first wash is going to be tough boy there's a lot of ice in here and this [ __ ] paddle is too small for this dub i just want to get all this submerged not sitting on the top don't worry i'll make the ocean sounds go i'll do it for the avanti all right that is about as we gonna get right there boy i tell you would cool 20 gallon 220 yeah took me three years to get the gopro yeah well back when i first had a gopro like the hero 3 you couldn't stream from the gopro at least not directly from it and i wasn't into streaming and all that background so i had no idea all right we're gonna let those hydrate i need it there we easy go to get that all underneath there all the ice is in the bag and now i just want to make sure that all of these buds stay underneath the water level so that they get hydrated it's so the water is so [ __ ] clear i mean it looks like you're not even looking through water almost at least on the gopro that i'm looking through she looks wild what's up no limit giveaway winner i've been getting so many copyright strikes let's try not to get one tonight what do you say got water on my laptop i'm gonna take another dab everybody ready everybody matching [Music] [Applause] [Music] two two two um [Music] silly [Music] is i gotta turn the bluetooth speaker on real quick yo this [ __ ] blood smells like kind of like like a baby ate too many caramels and

until i found them cape and cal they're they're good heroes in their own right forty-five percent of small businesses [Music] [Music] we all gotta eat you're gonna end at the fullest [Music] people that really [ __ ] make me wanna crap i'm just spinning [Music] [Music] [Music] that's moving good i like the feel just to write about a movement in there [Music] oh yeah [Music] [Music] the nugs in here are [ __ ] stupid fire i mean just [Music] all right my man hammy threw it down and if i'm not mistaken this may have just been a small tester tank i don't even think this was a full sin i think this was a tester the wedding crasher you pulled down [ __ ] fire you guys are going to go bananas over that honestly i'm only going to be running a couple pounds of it you guys might want to start putting in your pre-orders now because if there's a big enough demand then i might be able to run some more for you guys but if it's another two pounds that's just gonna be gone like i'm not even gonna put it out there for nobody it's just gonna be gone off rip off vip clientele it's crazy but estimated yield today um you know going off of the runs that i did previously with the runts that were pretty damn frosty um you know 20 average return from starting material to hash and then from there um you know average 75 to 80 percent back as rosin so [Music] we'll go from there we'll see probably about 130 to 150 grams of rosin out of this when all said and done but it really just depends not everything dumps the same some stuff you think it's gonna dump really really good because it's frosty but not always the case but this is [ __ ] gaff i can the smell is just all up through my nose still like sweet caramel baby [ __ ] tammy you neglected to tell me there was a baby [ __ ] smell in there it says sweet caramel [Music] flyer this is like sweet caramel and baby [ __ ] there's no just floating by [Music] [Music] keep on floating bye [Music] [Music] dried before freezing is the only way my personal opinion is if you're washing it fresh frozen you are losing out on the maximum potential because i feel like once you let it dry you get rid of some of that water content the terpenes become more concentrated you lose that chlorophyll taste i haven't had fresh frozen yet that didn't have that green fresh frozen paint to it so drying is a must in my opinion quick dry though not a normal 14 day dry like a six seven day dry works good uh-oh internet might have dropped you're gonna need oh it reconnected huh seeing here people always ask me if there's like a way to stir it personally find your groove whatever the [ __ ] works to make the motion in the ocean you do it i personally like to do a grabbing motion so i'll push all this down and stir it and come up on this back end push down stir come up on the bathroom so that's that's kind of my technique and then go back the other way you get you know at the top layer you know i'm only about three or four inches below the surface right here i want to go oh you know that's bottomed out right there i don't need to go bottomed out but every once in a while i do want to go to the bottom and pull that material up so i can mix that right push down and pull towards me that's another one i like to do [Music] [Music] so uh [Music] oh yeah oh yeah we in here [Music] ah [Music] is [Music] oh yeah i don't know if you see them i see it i see them heads in there and there's a lot of them so we're going to let this chili chill chill you know the dividend diversity in honor of our 50th anniversary and while we do that scholarship funds because we believe in the pursuit of purpose and the difference you make in the world [Music] what [Music] you let your wife borrow the scale one time [Music] don't do that oh [Music] time to fold all [ __ ] days [Music] so [Music] so [Music] number two ain't no feet [Music] my oh no mystic needs to feature me on one of their songs i got bars man i can't afford that feature though can't afford that feature i want 10 racks for every [ __ ] four bars [Music] all right trash let's take a dab of roni eat your bronies yeah bro this is mystic [Music] [Music] um [Music] i feel you ain't smoking and uh [Music] that [ __ ] in there y'all don't know he's talking about me right [Music] i wish [Music] [Music] i'm dabbing runts and i'm smelling mindo woo wee woo wow [Music] oh [Music] [Music] so so the way that i do this is i use the avanti as a storage vessel can i move you over there that far i don't know maybe let me see yeah so i use the avanti as a storage vessel [Music] [Music] [ __ ] cold in here like foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so what i'm gonna do is i didn't realize you're like right there on my [ __ ] ball sack but i'm gonna empty the uh the washer real quick because uh this is a fresh run and that's what we do in between every run you guys know this stick that drain hose in there plug in the washer turn it on switch to drain mode boom it's going to start draining so i'm going to take the plug for the pump that's in here and i'm going to go ahead and put it in to my power strip here now when i need it i turn it on when i donate it i turn it off and i obviously just blew that down with over 130 programs and certificates gives you the opportunity to start or continue your education wherever you are what do i have plugged we're committed to making your experience english and rewarding when you choose open you join a community where success and affordability okay that is right now one more time this time i'm gonna make sure that i'm getting fresh cold water out of the [Music] drain [Music] it's 58 degrees in here [Music] and dabs got me feeling warm [Music] we haven't changed [Music] [Music] cool yes i smell it boys i always smell the water in here it's not a habit i don't want it to smell stale at all this smells stale then you got a [ __ ] problem but i rinse pulled out water through it before and after everything i do cold ro water it's deionized and desterized so came out nice and clear and the reason i do that is because i'm getting ready to use it as a storage vessel for the bag that i'm about to pull out which means that i need it to be very clean you know what i'm saying clean and fresh [Music] [Music] my process for this is not a a gracious one by any means not at the moment especially because s9 steel works just went mia and hasn't answered any dms in weeks about that 2400 vessel i was trying to purchase from them they told me oh it's going to ship in a week and then [ __ ] m.i.a so i'm kind of upset with them you know what i mean that's kind of [ __ ] right [Music] [Music] and [Music] so fantastic i've been lifting [ __ ] trash cans full of ice up over my shoulder all [ __ ] day long filling this up i think it took [ __ ] like 10 of these at least if not more now the advantage i had with my other one when i was running um the 20 gallon catch containers is it was a lot easier to catch all of this but i'm lifting this up so i could use a pump i could scoop this [ __ ] out honestly [Music] but let me see how heavy this is first go from there i'm going to come up with a more disabled veteran friendly way you got what i mean so i put this in the corner so it can't roll away [Music] and then this is pretty solid i'm just going to take this up kind of set it on here slow pour and hopefully it doesn't go away you know like [ __ ] 20 gallons of water compassionate [Music] [Music] [ __ ] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] oh my god let me show you what's coming out of the bottom of this [ __ ] bin right now oh i'm gonna change my underwear first [ __ ] god damn son [Music] you guys already know what i'm gonna do with hash like that right you guys already i'm skeeting all over y'all bangers with this [ __ ] drop [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] so before i filter what's in the bags i'm gonna fill this up so that everything in here is gonna stay really really cold it's gonna stay colder when it's filled up with uh water versus when it's open air right now so look at what we're catching in the [ __ ] 220 come on look where's this y'all see that [ __ ] 220 come on bruh you dumping in here we dumping in here good job you pulled it at the perfect [ __ ] time my perfect [ __ ] time that guy [Music] [Music] uh [Music] i need a big ass hammy slap trying to put a pork chop up here [Music] and actually you would be the first co-lab that i have a sticker up on my wall from wow oh that's not enough water i'm gonna go less water than last time but more water than this [Music] oh [Music] here's here's a good trick people say how do you know if you have enough ice you have enough water you want enough ice that it's gonna keep the water as cold as possible right around like you know 30 38 degrees is cool enough you know 28 to 38 is good you don't want to go above 42 and uh [Music] make sure it's covered the material enough to where you can easily move the material around with your stirrer with one hand and then you know move all the material it's not like they're fighting it just kind of fluidly move [Music] and it's covered and uh yeah that's good enough and then now i'm just going to take the back of the spoon and kind of push everything down right below the surface this is where having that ice on top helps because it helps a little [ __ ] sweet there it uh helps hold the bud down underneath the surface of the water so if you need to add more ice now is a good time [Music] okay we're gonna let this chili chill chill and then after uh we get done sifting this we'll come back and stir this [Music] um [Music] i need to go inside and get batteries because the 10 more washers staying [ __ ] dead right now for free visit minute clinic at cvs today no cost flu shots with most insurance restrictions apply so clinic.com replacing tetris here you ready [Music] [Applause] him [Music] takes me back to high school buckingham [Music] [Music] [Music] now i'm going to open up this valve yo this thing the magnets are like going like [ __ ] ah that's not what she said [Music] is [Music] right sorry i'm trying to get you guys set up [Music] i have to sponsor this man and get him some proper recording equipment all right that's good enough [Music] so [Music] [Music] this is the 220 my boys [Music] [Music] what [Music] trash [Music] alcohol wipes [Music] [Music] oh yeah [Music] there we go that goes back a nice one this goes to the side now here we have our 160. this is going to be test press material most likely but we'll see what happens [Music] it's up to the farmer what happens really with it it could become it's usually the way i do it is it's test press and then depending on the quality it either gets mixed in with the rest because some strains really do feel better at the higher microns so depending on how well it does you know it'll either go with everything else or it'll just get made into edibles or something [Music] it could be pills could be whatever stash for the homies right like a lot of times this 160 will make fire head stacks for the homies and you don't have to dip into your uh you know your normal full spectrum spot it's not gonna hit the fan [Music] okay cool so there's just not a whole lot of that and that is good good good that means majority of what we want is in the 45 where it belongs [Music] taking this where's deals at deals is in here [Music] shout out to the cultivator everybody [Music] okay oh my god oh i love it when the 160 comes out looking like this you guys remember how the runts 160 came out looking well hammy's mendo it came out looking just as good i do not i have never said that about another person's material that i've ran except for my own like straight up be honest as [ __ ] call it snobby call it what you want but i've ran a lot of [ __ ] material and it takes one hell of a [ __ ] grower to pull off 160 micron hash that comes out looking like that like and i'm not even in good light damn it but it's a little [ __ ] caked up mountain the [ __ ] white 160 here looking proper you guys know because you've seen me process enough material you know not a lot of collab material comes out looking that good period and that's the 160 we're not even on to the real deal holyfield yet so set this one aside now you're not ready for this 45. [Music] [Music] oh [Music] we're gonna get rid of some of this water first so we're gonna pick up both the 25 and the 45. give them a little shimmy shimmy [Music] hammy um what ppfd were you running for your 11 13 do you know what dli you were hitting sorry i'm loud right there oh [ __ ] the wife's gonna come down and not be able to walk wife's coming to take it down [Music] oh [Music] some people don't go as long as me on the first wash i like to get all the chlorophyll that i can out on the first wash the first wash was always going to have the most contaminant it doesn't matter how long you wash it for so you might as well just go ahead and get all the pores all out that you can [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm going to spend a little extra time just washing it down making sure i wash my floor full out the best of my ability remember what i tell you guys you're not just filtering the water you're washing the hash you're not washing the nugs okay you're you're washing the house [Music] ready baby do you have shoes on you got chocolates on okay cool come on in baby they can't see you it's pointing straight down [Music] i think it's cold i don't know it's 57 degrees in here [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] who's your dad [Music] jesus take the wheel i still got work to do you swap the deck real quick on the banger [Music] [Music] those of you that are hanging out i go live every day every morning doing gross [ __ ] processing [ __ ] talking [ __ ] doing [ __ ] just cool [ __ ] man we got some cool people come check it out [Music] it's called the daily dab [Music] i put it on members only mode most of the time where everybody could watch and you know but only members can chat and ask questions and you know but for the first 20 or 30 minutes it's usually open to everybody [Music] so come on over and check it out [Music] wash the [ __ ] half don't just filter it wash that [ __ ] homies wash wash it wash it wash it wash it how much water is going in that bucket it's gone you don't even know it's empty all right [Music] [Music] um you guys aren't ready for this [ __ ] i'm not ready for this [ __ ] watch excuse me excuse me chef chef i'd like one mindo breath hash burrito please hold the cheese extra salt for all of my haters that's a fat dumper for our first year my boy tammy who washes your hash like me let me hear you say it nobody breaking babe nobody i'm just playing [Music] but i do it with love and care like it's my own like it's my [ __ ] home you guys want a high def picture of that from the phone um [Music] let me turn off that [Music] i almost forgot that i unplugged my sump pump out there so i had to go plug that back in [Music] one [Music] um [Music] [Music] so [Music] yeah i i found out you [ __ ] yes you weren't in here when i was telling you you're a dick that's the first thing i [ __ ] said is it smells like a straight hot baby diaper oh funny he dried it with my quick drape my quick dry technique baby i told you guys i've been doing it that way for five [ __ ] years now five [ __ ] years let somebody tell you that they've been doing it longer this fresh frozen [ __ ] shenanigan ring what in the [ __ ] is going on with that all right we'll capture the rest of this next [ __ ] go around okay i got it now we're going to see what the 25 looks like and if it's worth um keeping at all and if not we're going to get rid of that [ __ ] and not mess with it because it slows down the filter process for everything else i thought yeah pretty much everything else above it so great [ __ ] baby [ __ ] you know um my buddy goodbye [ __ ] has a cut of ice cream cake that's the exact same [ __ ] way and it is your [ __ ] god awful stanky good [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [ __ ] you 25 micron appreciate you savage um so savage said how long did it take me to get where i'm at now any growing tips you want to work your way up so basically um i started growing at the end of 2014 with my very first grow and my very first time getting high i started with a 4x4 tent a 600 watt air cooled hps and a 15 gallon tote where i did deep water culture with two plants [Music] i ran a strain called gold leaf from a site called i love growing marijuana and i had acupuncture gold and something else and off that 600 watt i ended up yielding uh 21 ounces um which i was [ __ ] thrilled about because my first grow in a [ __ ] 15 gallon dwc show [Music] so the 25 is going to go on the same tray as the 160 on the other side though so growing tips i would say do as much research as you can about basic plant science and plant nutrition photosynthesis right what the different nutrients do for the plant how they show up as deficiencies or toxicities all of these things have been thoroughly researched and documented in scientific ways not on forums that you can get a really really good understanding of what you're going to be doing before you go to do it which is going to put you ahead of the game and you're not just going to be doing something based on the fact that somebody told you to do it when it comes to your grow you're going to do something based off of somebody recommended something and your research shows x y or z so you know then you choose how you want to buy it or not apply it but um you know it just i would say stick to learning from like dot edu's you know look up just scholarly journals um try and find out pretty much as much science as you can about the plant the anatomy of the plant and its functions the circadian rhythm you know i would say start off by picking a very simple nutrient program like a two-part salt based program it'll be cheap effective and um reliable consistent athena is good um hvg like ham bones running is really good all right it's gonna be a long one folks i think i'm gonna have to uh [Music] all right this chat is bumping i don't know how you guys are keeping up with it i'm on top chat right now i just realized that all right so now i'm on live chat let me get this out of the way it's still got a small amount of draining it's doing but not a whole lot better yet oh no don't die i plugged you in at that three percent i plugged you in though if it dies i'm coming right back y'all already know baby so oh my god i forgot to move that over for the wife so now i gotta go over here move it from over here over here [Music] anymore i cannot wait to move into a bigger [ __ ] area i underestimated my own growth and didn't realize i was gonna need as much space as i do you know here's what it is it's not a bad thing good thing no problem right first yeah it's time management how you want to throw your bag like that's why i have a nine to five hound bone has a nine to five andy hustles you know what i'm saying you gotta do what you gotta do when you got [ __ ] family to provide for and you wanna live a certain lifestyle and provide you know a certain amount of security and for your future and your children's future you gotta you gotta hustle you gotta put in that overtime you gotta sacrifice you know like tonight i'm gonna probably get three hours of sleep if that and that's okay i'm gonna wake up early tomorrow with the kids so my wife could sleep in and i'm gonna [ __ ] hustle throughout the day like it's another day so that's just what you do [Music] how cold did you get the room at the end tammy [Music] i like how far the it calyxed out i don't see a lot of people crown their buds out as much as you do it's something that i was taught to do as well if your calyx's crown out towards the end you nailed it and if you don't know what a crowned out calyx is it's probably because you're getting that pgr [ __ ] where it just looks like a [ __ ] golf ball with sprinkles on it i get so tired of people trying to tell me that they don't pgr their bud but it literally has no type of calyx terrain there's no it's just a straight just [ __ ] dense ass hard ass smooth surface that doesn't happen [Music] naturally one thing i've experimented with a couple times that works really well if you have the ability to chill your reservoir a little bit and you start tapering it towards flush it'll start bringing those colors out a little bit more and i noticed with the temperature drop it affects you know some plants more than others because they're more exposed to that temperature and the wind and they get that wind chill coldness but if you hit them at the root zone it affects like almost all of the plants the same way and so you can drop the internal temperature of the plant and get some of that purpling the same way and get it more across the whole canopy you know you do it in combination with the air temps just don't drop it too much in the root zone or otherwise you're gonna pretty much like stop uptake i ran a whole entire crop at um 58 degrees which is the temperature at which you can hit 100 dissolved oxygen supposedly and uh since i ran it at 58 degrees since the start of clone i didn't run into any issues with uptake and they were super productive and uh one of my best fields did that aeroponics [Music] nice oh my god smack that ass mindo sexy [ __ ] [Music] yeah you guys take advantage of the fact that um we actually have the grower on right now that's a very rare occasion that we get the grower on with us so definitely take advantage of that we're gonna let that chili chill chill for a minute [Music] [Music] froze it all without drying ah that sucks too late [Music] too now i have to run inside grab a drink real quick we're gonna let this settle for a second i'll be right back and we're gonna continue to party [Music] [Music] don't really know", "MS6BjTDtiOM": "cap dank here again in the smash lab today we're going to be using the nug smash or mini and we'll be showing you how to do a three and a half gram press on the new nug-nug smash 4 mini first of all what I wanted to show you folks is how to adjust the temperature setting on the mini itself you're gonna come to this particular button here you're gonna hit that button and then it's gonna start to flash and you can move your setting up or down and today we're gonna do this particular press at about 200 and let's say 15 degrees then let's make it to 20 okay once it's it can go over hit our button and we're ready to go now we have to wait for for the mini to heat up to our to our pressing temperature so in the meantime we'll get ourselves a three and a half gram hundred and sixty micron bag again we're gonna load it bottle textile so what we're gonna use today is we're gonna be using some of this key lime pie that was grown by Miller farms in rough-and-ready California just want to give a shout out to them so let's wake up three and a half grams of this beautiful flower I'm on the money okay like I said we're gonna load these this bag bottom textile which what that is it's been a load up and flatten into a coin versus some people just load them in flat and the nut smashers are really made for bottle tech that's how they design these and it's gonna give you maximum yield bottle textile so again what we do bottle textile is we fold in the corners right they use a little tool like this because it definitely helps to get the corners into place once you get the corners in I don't think to adjust it with my fingers yeah once again that's about what we're looking for bottle textile so let's let's lay it up beautiful flower okay bottle textile what we're trying to do is set up ourselves with a really good foundation here and just continue adding to that and what this will allow us to do is if it's packed in here correctly we will be able to you'll get a coin puck at the end of the press out of this and bottle textile should be something like that there okay that's about again what we're looking for once we load it up this point we want to cut the bag till we leave about a half an inch okay and again I'm gonna fold the top like a present and the last corner here it is when we load into the machine itself okay so looks like we're getting close to our temperature here so let me get a piece of parchment paper come down here you're gonna open up our open up our our plate these are 2.5 inch plates start our press what we want to do is slowly bring the plates up see how the bag is kind of accordion in on itself start the extraction process yes and we're gonna let our press go for 2 minutes and 30 seconds during the process with the mini you definitely want to keep it under maximum pressure and I think I see some rosin yes starting to flow they're golden beautiful resin about another minute here on the press [Music] about another 30 seconds or so here looking good ok we got 10 seconds left here paper together release your plates looks pretty good to me once again captain dick here in the smash lab with the nug Smasher mini", "PD38e6gk1SA": "man ain't nothing wrong with smoking weed weed is from the earth god put this here for me hey you take

this product has really come through the ctmp very minimally i think he's going to do one at a time before from agl what we got today is we have some bubble hash i'm very excited about that i didn't get it when agl had it out i missed it and it's actually been a couple years since i came out and no bubble ash has come through the ctmp sense and i've never actually had bubble hash in my life ever

ball we're gonna see if we make it work and see if this [ __ ] actually bubbles up i'm sure you're wondering if it does i'm wondering if it doesn't find the [ __ ] out together all right so as far as the product goes this i got some truly might especially down in bristol connecticut best [ __ ] dispensaries taking these guys awesome you gotta check them out [Applause] this is from ct farming this [ __ ] was a very limited run dave was telling me how he ordered a couple hundred units of this [ __ ] and they still gave him like 40 45 [ __ ] 40 40 foot out of me so obviously it was a very small

okay so now hopefully a little bit perfect there all right so now you can see the hashing there let's see if this [ __ ] bubbles up i honestly don't know if it's gonna have a [ __ ] idea we're playing out together i'm just hoping the [ __ ] shot goes through and let's see i totally apologize i'll let you guys just stand i figured it'd be worth it use my hotline on this i'm gonna get this [ __ ] plank in half and see if i want to go near the center bubble i'm gonna try to come in from this backside guys uh [Music] this is good all right so i don't know if it bubbled up that should taste like the bomb all right hold on hand it back to normal here try to get back in the [ __ ] zone how'd that shocking guys didn't even work look at this shit's still smoking i'm smoking about smoke this [ __ ] oh my god y'all i'm so balled up on this review totally i don't have a normal element i apologize guys hold on all right it doesn't fire that was all basically hash really smoked day in that flower it burns so slow i don't have a bubbled up that good that's a really good hash product as you can see like i said it easily stretches out into a huge amount so for the value of it it's very good i'm thoroughly impressed um i'm gonna go [ __ ] around it's a little bit more my first time [ __ ] this [ __ ] so kind of a virgin debut i recommend it good though um definitely good [ __ ] ending of [ __ ] i feel a lot of my [ __ ] it's [ __ ] weighing me right the [ __ ] i feel like i got an elephant on the back it's a little bit strange hit me before too it's really [ __ ] really heavy sedating really really really heavy sedating um and it's really creeping up on you too like get this real slow onset but like [ __ ] like really power back and then i already see it in my face so yeah [ __ ] i'm excited all right guys weird [ __ ] wow see you peace you", "JEc8S-NYomU": "[Music] all right all right guys we're the first to do this 2 000 milligrams so on the nuxmaster mini there's really the unit was designed to do two different size smashes um it's really designed for travel personal use trade shows um to go and set up heat up quick and uh then extract either a gram nug or three quarters to a gram nug in a piece of parchment paper with no [Music] bag that's one of the presses that it's made to do which we have here in the back some dosey dough and then in the front we have some chronic kush it's also made to do a three and a half gram smash in a three and a half gram bag like this bottle loaded bottle textile um we advocate that extraction method so all of our surface area to pressure calculations on all of our units have been done assuming that you load the bags bottle textile like i said the mini was made for two two different smashes a single nug smash and a piece of parchment with no bag or a three and a half gram bag smash loaded bottle textile now both of these different uh ways of extraction the different weight of extraction are going to require the same pressure because at the end you're going to get the overall same surface area on the extracted material so if you're up to a one gram nug with no bag it's probably gonna be a little bigger so it'll be a little less pressure that you're applying you know um if you go closer towards three quarter of a gram nug with no bag uh it's going to be uh more pressure on that surface area because it's going to be smaller so you'll learn that as you get a unit and you start to extract you'll see the different different results in and out from the different product and whatnot especially if you're on the growing side so we're waiting for this oil to melt over here we thought it'd be a great time to read off some of your youtube comments on the latest videos believe it or not we actually read all of your comments so let's try to keep it positive um latest video was the bubble hash let's see what you guys are saying so connor 4k hey what do you guys do with the already pressed flower as you can see this is exactly what we do we like to make potent thc oil with it and it actually comes out really clean and really high quality don't recommend smoking it i would personally do the oil 10 times out of 10 with the pucks let's see what else we've got here shady 580 cop watch nug smasher is by far the best on the market you'll get your money's worth and then some my small one is paid for itself many times over i really need to get a bigger and bigger one now production is up well shady 580 we got the nug smasher pro ready for you here just give us a call and we'll get this sent over whenever you're ready what else we got better than watching porn nick garden i'd agree with that porn for stoners i dig it complete wash 86 i could see there's a some similarities there so jared stallman how much material did you start with to get that much bubble hash at once was it nugs and trim or just nugs um for that i don't know the exact amount because our friends over at 11 11 cannabis company uh provided us with the bubble hash but it i do know that it was a fresh flower trimmed right off the plant it was still live so if that answers your question let's see what else danny thompson it's like watching da vinci paint i'm seriously considering picking up a nug smasher at harvest time this year i used to be into the whole backyard blasting thing but figure now that i'm growing the garden of my dreams with all my favorite strains why half-ass it when it comes to concentrates that keef was beautiful i'll always have a soft spot for keith full melts i definitely agree with you blasting is cool but rosin is a lot cooler all right i think that's enough for now let me know you guys thought of that we can keep reading them off like i said we read all of your guys's comments so try to keep it positive if you can [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] hey guys make sure you check us out at nugsmasher.com to check out all of our awesome products we also have tons of great information on our site including calculator tools and terp files be sure to check us out there at [Music] nugsmasher.com", "cqa2Vtt6gP8": "you're smoking man growin and watch it fall down [Music] hey what's up tgc it's Scottie real hanging out with love for the plant what's up brother hey how's it going it's going really good man it's going really good and we were hanging out love for the plants friends with frosty McNuggets they came up a couple of weeks ago they gave us a little schooling on some solvent lists actually that was just last week wasn't it was last week lizard compliance man time flies when you're having fun man but frosty talked about a solvent hash last time or solvent extracts I should say man I'm dating myself man and I wouldn't love for the plant to talk about solvent lesser or basically what a solvent less water hashes out we're talking yes yes water hash bubble hash is just a form of solvent list okay so and that's what I would you know I'll be focusing on today we could talk for an hour on each kind of solvent list show me that high end you brought a couple high end yeah hashes right you brought like what's it called the six star water hash that I like to make fun of right yep otherwise known as full melt yeah and gooey you can put up a picture of this for us man yeah check it out it's uh it's totally it's like a white powder it's strange Oh I mean and it really it breaks down to being just try cap heads that's what it is just try cokeheads okay so I know that when you're doing your wood dry sift and everything like that you're trying to sift the broken heads from the whole ones and all that right same concept when you're doing water extraction pretty much for the most part yeah except you will come out with if done properly you will come out with a cleaner product been dry shift okay so we were talking before and I remember I went god I think they had like a six bag system bubble bags yeah I don't know if they still make a just bubble bag still a brand man oh yeah yeah they're uh onion brands in fact he has a couple of different tiers of them now excellent yeah they used to have like a three bag system which for somebody like me I was just glad to make something I could smoke out of my [ __ ] leaves trim yeah like right now they have four bag by bag eight bag you know depending on one's needs right will dictate which one you want do you buy them off with calm men no kind of break that down yeah when we're talking about like a 5 or 8 bag system it's having different micron screens so you can have the different grades of trichome heads or treasure talks or just separating your plant material it lets you have different grades of hash and then condoms it's now in it from there do you need six different grades of hash is that how it works so I'll give an example you know just to follow up on what guru said like these bags right here I have a five bag set right not optimal because I go from 120 micron to 73 micron okay there's no ninety in between so qualities are for some cultivars 90 maybe that sweet spot oh wow does a the type of the cultivar the type of cannabis that you're straining makes a difference on the size of the trichome absolutely Oh that'd probably determine yeah in fact even in fact different cultivars even have different shapes of trichome heads Wow and that makes sense why some guys are telling us they're getting crazy big yields off of off of these strains oh yeah the cultivars oh yes there's a huge difference in yield from one cultivar to the next we we've seen yields of over over twenty percent right for like a three ninety eight bubble or there are some others that yield really well and actually so I'll name a few like really girly for obviously that's one that would doesn't surprise them any people that are really well yeah but I'm sour Kush banana Kush those are some little some less known ones that that yield really well really yeah I actually have some Atticus yeah yeah there you go I mean I would put an emphasis on if you're going to watch something lost one that you know I tell you it will produce well in fact we brought we try to bring in like some old or not a little bit like some trendy strains right whenever I was working it at that facility well I'll get into a little bit later when we brought in those Jayne's we were only getting a yield of like three to five percent when we're used to getting like 18 to 22 percent and we did everything the same so that's how much it matters and that's why you often hear some people talk about well I tried bubble has in this case you're sure they may actually be good at making bubble hash and just had the your own cultivar the whole time you know he's they'd be good at making bubble hash it definitely is an art I used to make it I was doing it said I was just psyched to get something smokeable my friend or my hell without one of my growing partners was an artist like a true you know to paint and draw and everything like that we would leave him alone for the night with a six-pack of Budweiser and and a wooden spoon and that's all he would use man but he would grieve would just make the best [ __ ] hash I mean it was like dabble hash in the 90s you know what I'm saying is amazing The Devil's in the details is what you're telling me right yeah absolutely all right so you're gonna hook us up with little details moons are absolutely so all right cool yeah I mean first off just what interrupts I'm sorry if I'm going on Amazon or I'm going online with the [ __ ] do I buy what do I need well so you'll see a wide range in price on the bags right and I that was a mystery that you know I'd always wondered what the real differences between the different qualities of bags different levels of bags right I actually asked one of the more reputable actually the person I respect the most he was probably going through 100 different bags and I was like so tell me break this down for me what what do you what do you not get with the cheaper bags like from you know like a cheap Amazon this is like a bubble man bag yep and he said the screens are pretty comparable actually maybe a slight difference right but what you but what you're going to get with your cheaper bags are little pieces of thread that come off and it gets into your hash and it was funny because that's a big deal yeah so I made something home actually this is one of those cheaper set right and you know I you couldn't see the threads until you put it up in a microscope and you know you're looking at trichome heads if you make really nice bubbly eyes your eyes you're looking at it very closely and we started noticing little bitty tiny like red threads and [ __ ] and when you go for what Bo what who's the bubble man bags right yeah yeah bubble man is okay I'm is what you know that's like you know calling his bags out because that's one of the people I learned from that's what I was gonna say shout-out to that guy because he put so much education out there yup yup that's exactly I'll be back in the old school I mean it's yeah I was watching his videos and Prohibition land just couldn't wait I remember I was in Canada and I saw bubble banks for the first time and I was on vacation with my wife and my girlfriend back then I think I had 200 bucks left on vacation there were $285 I was like empty your wallet I need trust me this'll work but I was so excited to bring those things back for me it was like letting the gold cuz I couldn't figure out what to do with all my trim and 20 lights a trim that's a garbage bag of trim right yeah these were amazing alright so we got the brands now as far as four or five eight you know what do we buy if I'm just its that matter how much of a kind of sir I'm trying to be yeah absolutely okay if you're you know if you're just making bubble hash for Bowl toppers or yep or if you're just going to press it you know if even if you want to press it out into a rosin which we'll get into a little bit later right yeah I mean you can get by with a lot of things it's just a matter of you know as I go through the different things it's just a matter of maybe a 5% difference you know you can still get top-shelf bubble hash by not doing some of these things or you know maybe not having a the best bag system but you're just talking about incremental gains with some of the things we'll be talking about so deal deal all right so it well first off I'm intrigued man big plants big trikes yeah I mean definitely it's the you know when I worked for the oh well just go ahead and say so you know I I have a lot of experience just making bubble hash at home watching all you know watched all the videos read all the forums a lot of trial and error right but shortly thereafter I started working at one of well at the time was the most reputable saw solvent list company and the state of Colorado so yeah you know I kind of took my personal experience in that professional experience right and came up with just a list of tips and tricks you know that I just learned over time and a lot of these tips and tricks you would you won't find in summation all of them and in like a single video how-to video yeah that would be hard-pressed to find you know everything all at once these are these are tips and tricks that I've picked up over time sure they're probably I know there are others that I won't even talk about um but I kind of view these tips and tricks' is like the magic that happens between the main steps okay I'm making about will hash like if you got watch a video on how to make bubble hash right they'll give you those basic steps and you better know those basic steps very well right but there's some magic that happens in between there yeah I mean and there's ways you can screw it up - yeah I beat the hell out of the out of the material before man so yeah so I will get into it man yeah let's get into some of the specifics if we could yeah so take me through the process we got our Bowl bag showed up from bubble man from here you PS man got them what else do I need well first of all you want to work in a cooler environment I prefer like 50 degrees obviously you wouldn't want to work in the freezer we can wrap things are going to start freezing up sure but yeah in in Colorado we're we have very cool weather most of the time so I'm probably just working outside that that's very convenient okay so cool degrees so fun if I'm in Florida or from something you know my buddies in Florida or something like that can you work inside a refrigerator or something do you have yeah think about that no I do not man but that sounds like a decent night yeah okay sounds like something wacky that I would tell my I need to do yeah I need you to work inside the refrigerator okay man yeah trust me it's gonna be dank yeah all right so so we can work outside 50 degree temperatures something like that what do we do with the material now and and what do we mean anything I know you got a couple tricks up your sleeve well the first thing is you know optimally you want to use reverse osmosis water but we all know they draw back first of all RRL water is costly and but and it's also taxing on the environment so you can make a judgment call and whether you want to do that or not but just know that that's what the the top shelf past that you're seeing out on the market right now they're using RL water is that different than distilled water as far as a guru it should be clean right you're just trying to get clean water right in water yeah without minerals in it right with the no minerals in it distills not gonna have that or not gonna have much of that at all okay cool but clean water yeah all right next step what do we do man so you'll just well you harvest your plant yep so we I'm dry it what the [ __ ] is a freeze dryer man why does guru want a freeze dryer do we need one so as we go through this the bubble hash making right the very end the final step well I guess the final step of the bubble hash right would be to put it in there freeze okay sound and you know everyone's talking about that right now because it's a huge investment yeah but okay so we don't need so all we do is we dry our plant normally do we need to cure the plant so so there yes you can do cured flower most of the top shelf bubble hash or rosin that's being made out on the market right now is actually being done with fresh frozen material and that's where most of my experiences fresh frozen so we're trying the work we're not drying the trap so chop the plant you know you can let it set sit for up to two hours people have different opinions on that I like letting some of the moisture out of it right Wow tourette yeah and then put it in the freezer right let it freeze for at least 24 hours yeah and then that's when you can start the extraction process with making bubble hash and now we're not we're not breaking it up or anything we're not using a grinder you don't want to grind it too much but you also don't want too big of colas in there so we are using a grinder no it's just more of a it's just more of a manual manual cut smaller budge honest yeah okay fair enough man all right so come on give me some tips man so how long we soak in this for okay so let's get to get yeah I want the DVC to be at least Bank right off the bat yeah you know yeah so one of the little tips that you know I see out there some whenever I'm just searching around but not everyone and some people have heard it but then they forget it right is too when you put your frozen material into the washer we'll get into washers too but you put your material into the washer you let it soak for 15 minutes okay and that's going to allow your plant material to softened a little bit so it won't become brittle right now you're saying washer hang on a second yeah you're talking about the little bubble later machines man those things are cool I thought I was just being lazy yeah but they came out with them I don't think they're under they used to be under 200 bucks anyhow they're not expensive I thought they were a Chinese washing machines is what I thought they were like for a little tiny apartment to watch like one piece of clothing at a time I don't know anyway their coolest [ __ ] man those things ooh so that's what I call that a bubble later what do they call those things yeah I know there are different names sure but yeah I mean so many people at home will just manually sure maybe with a wooden spoon that works really great especially if you have the really smooth you know really smooth motion and do everything right all right but most of my experience has been using the washer sure and we've done a B test at the at the process at the company that worked out right and it the washer just yields is so much better and it's really the labor - okay I mean it's like start stirring it it's fun at first it's like trimming at first it's hot and then it gets old pretty cool yeah a lot and you could run two or three of those washers man I've went through those washes yeah they were great I mean all the top shelf bubble hash that's coming out they don't have workers in there stirring this no no I'm sure it exists but washers I agree with you man okay so I was just so we got a 15-minute soak yep thirty minutes oh and then we're throwing in in the machine we're turning on the recess for how long how long we running them actually so before we turn on the machine I want to point out that during that so before or after that so good I've seen it done both ways you can actually and what I'm about to say is fairly controversial among solvent less people okay because the moment you say dry ice people want to run because they think in the particulate in the end product right about using it to keep the water cold absolutely right so you you have your you have your 220 micron bag with your fresh frozen material in there right your ice water what you can do is just kind of pepper pepper some small pieces of dry ice and around the outside of the bag okay so we've got an ice water I forgot to explain that we though you've got to fill this bubble later machine yeah I've got to fill it with water with a bunch of ice you know whole trick to do it cold absolutely yep and then you just drop some dry ice in there and you know that what the dry ice does is it'll just take the temperature you know we had one of those infrared and thermometers take the temperature from like maybe 33 34 to to like 31 and since it's always moving it's not freezing so sure you can get it down 30 31 and that matters just getting it down a few more degrees helps in quality absolutely yeah really yeah and since you soak the material you're not going to get much particulate come through and what and what little comes through your catch dude you are [ __ ] detailed now looking at some of your some of your tips here yeah and he says frozen utensils so you're keeping the spoon that you're starting your ass so most people I don't have a sorry about that what you got hook it up you know most people's going to use a spoon similar to this right the easiest tip in the world is just to keep keep it frozen man like you're touching those you're trying to keep everything as cold as possible so you just keep this in the freezer so I'm curious you're and you're like independent research I know you guys have been playing with solvus do you keep your utensils frozen I mean it would makes having thoughts to do that okay see if it definitely makes sense to do that just because you're you're trying to you spent so much time keeping everything riding around 30 degrees then why would you want to touch it with something that's like 50 days in the process yeah so hey so okay so one of your other tips I mean these are kind of sir tips here man they got you really get the ball you know you get like a 2% game from them yeah and you're saying game from that before you know you have like a 10% better product you know I remember my buddy was in the racecars and he was talking about that he was like oh yeah like after 1/2 percent performance increase from that I'm like what a [ __ ] you spend $2,000 on a half percent or whatever but in this case man for if it cost you nothing to freeze the spooning you get a little bit little nudge here in the edge there oh that's how you get that six star man absolutely yeah anyway so one of the other tricks that I never used to do we I used to just take the the sink sprayer spray some water on the sides because what happens when it when the bubbly the bubble air these things bubble up well they used to say if it doesn't bubble it ain't worth the trouble right so it bubbles up and you'll get all sorts of collection.you bubbles all over the side there man so I would spray him with little sink hose but that wasn't very cold water yes what a lot of people are doing now is you get like a pump sprayer like you said like that metal guru would you throw a picture of this metal Chapin sprayer up man it's cool as hell yeah these are always available I would say just use it you can use these things for spraying other things but just use this one for spraying plain water yeah and this is really for kind of spraying and doing like a secondary wash on your homepage you have there to try and like spray through any trichome stalks or anything that might be left over and kind of clean up the trichome heads that are left in there I just thought really cool keeping stuff from sticking to the sides man yeah I know yep and another little tip is don't just use water use ice water all right lady go not throw some ice into that sprayer sure so okay so and now so what do you stack those bags on top of each other yeah yeah you know the the highest micron bag in my case is 220 would be on top right and then you just go down to these smaller bags now the 220 show that one because that's the different bag the 220 is the one that holds all of all the material there's a 220 so actually I'm glad you brought that up so the bag that goes inside the washer two-twenty bag right so that bag is just like you zip it up you know that's Rosa material in it's just a really simple bag that's just nothing but a big screen it's almost like the size of a screen 220 microns is big if the idea is to let it just to let everything wash through there without letting a bunch of plant material go through yep so then you do a second 220 after that again just to make sure that nothing leaked out you know that 220 mine has like a crappy zipper on it so yeah okay so you'll be in the later steps to to go ahead and get some of any any plant matter out yes what we're trying to do there okay so that's our that's our first one now what do we got after that so you know once once you go all the way down you know get you so each bag will have its own collection sure right and you know that's where that sprayer comes into play and then you scoop it out is that yeah yeah yeah how do you prepare that I mean I've done the horrible thing I've actually been like how [ __ ] I want to smoke I squeezed it yeah what do you do and then I've just let it dry before and it comes to kind of comes out is that really kind of strange how do you prepare it you'll scoop it out I mean it's I don't really know what to compare the consistence mud yeah it's a really since we have freeze dryers now you you don't have to get as much moisture out of it as you used to okay back in the day people would put screens on it and like press it with the paper yeah but you're smashing your tractor that's what I always felt like I was doing something wrong but I'm alright yeah so but now you know we can just scoop it out and almost just a very liquid form and just spread it out and then the freeze dryer will we'll pull all the moisture out all right have we gotten to the freeze-dried stage at this point man now is a good time you're talking about right why does guru when a freeze dryer so bad man it's all about turf preservation man yeah every year spending so much time and energy keeping everything cold through this whole process right that why would you want to ruin it ruin it and drying it and not lock in all those terpenes that you've spent so much time to save and collect and the freeze dryer lets you do that because it's just gonna pull out all the water or a frozen temperature so that you I mean so a freeze dryer is basically I dehumidifier inside of a freezer pretty much yeah it's a really simple way of putting it there I mean like the starting just a small at-home one is like three thousand that's what I was gonna say a three thousand dollar these middle fire inside of a freezer mm-hmm that's a hell of an investigator no because goober and frosty are going to create a do-it-yourself I heard something about this man I heard something about this geeking out here I heard the last time they defrost he was here just tell guru not to buy a freeze dryer yeah I talked to him I loved it man alright so as far as the preparations go when we're done what can what can we make out you absolutely yeah so once it comes out of the freeze dryer right so what just get a friend with a freeze dryer find a rich friend and tell him how easy it is to do this [ __ ] yes and let me know when you find there that's why I don't make much myself hey sure freeze-dried lots of other stuff too you don't have to just freeze dry half that's what I've been telling myself lately please try anything in half like food that's good for 20 years just add water so without a freeze dryer we can make basically a basic bubble hash right right so without a freeze dryer you're you are letting it air dry but even with the air dry you're going to have moisture kind of stuck in between those trichome heads that are all in you know I've got a chest yeah so so you know because that moisture is there it almost creates a consistency that you really can't break up those trichomes very well so you know the most common method is the micro planing anyone who's done bubble hashes you're probably done this or at least seen it done on videos yeah just spreading a really clear out so yeah driver you so that freeze dryer not only does it preserve Terps it saves a hell of a lot on labor because there is no micro planing with that I mean you said if you pull it out of the freeze dryer and it just pretty much breaks apart it's right incredible okay so we're getting to the freeze-dried I heard they have easy payment plans gurus have a Facebook targeted you as well yeah you get that in a rosin press from okay oh yeah okay so there's nothing I don't have a freeze dryer can I just take the my bubble hash and press it yeah absolutely so I'm trying to think yes people aren't gonna have access to a freeze dryer I can get I can't wait to get into what we can make if we get our buddy to spend twenty five miles but let's uh so what can we do for five hundred dollar rosin press what can we do with that okay so you can take that bubble hash right and put it in like a thirty six micron screen you can you can do you can do like a 72 micron screen as well cool the place that I work they actually use like a metal it was like a big sheet just huge industrial sheet they just cut pieces off of it okay I really like that metal versus the nylon so yeah you put it in just a really low micron screen right and press it at you know 151 155 and so this is it in terms of like the temperatures with a lot of people press Ross a net this is a pretty cold or low temp press yeah yeah one that's even at 155 just to put it in in perspective sure like I press flower at 185 to 210 you know depending on like quality okay so real so it is that cuz it's the water in it is that what you're doing it for I think it's just because it works better if you don't even mortar P and preservation right okay it's just not pressing at a high temperature just to avoid volatilizing off any of those terpenes that fall into like that temperature range makes sense to me man makes sense to me all right now guess what I got good news brother so I just found somebody with a freeze dryer man oh yeah I roll a brother man yeah oh yeah now what can we make man okay so you know from that point that's where some of the latest product that's on the market with the end product I mean it almost looks like butane extracted live resonator P early in a lot of its will even call it live rosin do we have anything this show see I'm sure I'm sure we can figure something out was all nice okay so there are some techniques in Vault so once you create your rosin you know you press you press that bubble hash out you have this rosin there are some post extraction techniques that even I don't know because I've been out of the game for over a year sure so there have been some new shogi right it's moving fast man yeah so yeah I can't keep up sure and there are some things I don't know yeah I've seen just bits and pieces I know some people are taking the rosin putting it on like 90 degrees I've seen different things but I can't definitively say this is what you do to create I've even seen stuff where people have gotten acid recrystallization solvent Leslie absolutely with rosin that has enough terpenes in it today I was the acid in that reaction where you really get like like diamonds and sauce right but solvent list diamonds and sauce somebody has been reading cannabis anca me I'm telling you man they were there there was like a formula for this in the 70s man there was AD gold made this book cannabis alchemy that was just the most they talked about what the heck was that man recrystallization I remember he had verses acetates he would make man and I was like I remember that [ __ ] that once I bought the gallon of ether I was out man yeah if anyone out if anyone in the DDC knows more about this ok let's talk about it let's start a discussion because it's immunity I think that's one of the benefits of having the DVC you know we can we can share some really good knowledge you know there there are those of us who worked in the industry at times and there are also people who just geeked out at home and focus nothing on nothing but cannabis and the man's an artist yeah yeah we need to pull that knowledge together so some of this post extraction process right if anyone knows a lot about it I know a couple people you know I know a couple of DGC members that do a lot of solvent list extraction and I bet they know quite a bit so let's start it hell yeah but it teach me something man first off is this real are you kidding me man I know what sauce is I know that that exists man sausage I get a little terpene yeah so so what just like with live resin each dispensary is creating a you know trying to create their own brain sir and they're calling a different things you know I see it called Jam sauce like solvent less sauce right you know you have to be like 17 labs here in Denver they're calling there's like a rosin Jam right isn't that what they're calling it yeah I would go to that oh yeah I mean dude so the stuff coming out of 17 labs it's just ridiculous and part of that Falls just to where their garden I mean it's a fear of quality and quality I can get some of these like six-star water hashes in full melt has less you have your garden dialed in to begin with yeah makes it makes so it again I just want to get back to this if I pull my [ __ ] out of the freeze dryer well how can I make what do I mean I can make any of these things I can make sauce I can make jam or you can take that you can take just what comes out of the the freeze dried right you know that we call that you know six star hash is what we've talked about a lot sure it's also just called full melt okay you can you can just drop that full melt right on your dab you know right on your nail and dab it that way and there shouldn't be any right I'm about to do that you know what some of that white stuff yeah me too okay so if I don't want to walk around white powder then man what can I do with it man that gets into the post extraction processing that some of those techniques okay and of course you know I'm talking about after you press it out sure yeah there are many things you can do from there to create different consistencies interesting man interesting all right man I learned something you know I get high yeah you're not a smoke man Stewart let's check out some of these goods survey this is really good appreciate the hell out of it yeah look where you're headed thanks brother yeah look for the plant check them out yeah [Music] [Music] it says to do [Music] true medicine [Music] Oh [Music] today [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "EX72E6EmUuY": "we got opal hash all right to start it off we have some 45 to 70 micron old trim that I've had laying around we ran that through the washer and this is what we got out as a result so we're gonna put that into a bag and press that out one little tip for you guys when you take your bag and you fill it with your product and you have to cut it you always have this tail end piece right and what do you do you usually throw it out instead take it put a little crease in it put it into your press put it around 200 and just put it on there for about 30 seconds or so you take it now you got a crease in it and you can put your product in there and it's not going to open up on you you can fold this other side and press with it so it's a good way to save your your bags because they are expensive and if you don't press a lot use a little bit of a bag just put a little fold in it use it like an ironing board and give very little seam so next up we have 70 to 120 old trim same thing we're gonna bag this up press it out this stuff looks a little bit better and then lastly we have our Jack Herer 70 to 120 micron and this was the best stuff this was my lightest wash that I did and the best quality that we got it I wish I had more Jack Herer trim but this is what we got it's a nice solid block it's been oxidizing so the trichomes have been turning a little bit darker throughout the past 24 hours that's where freeze drivers come in handy you can keep your product very fresh it doesn't have to oxidize the drying out when you do bubble hash will cause it to turn a darker color this was light beige and now it's turning a little bit Brown but we're gonna go ahead put that in bag as well and press it out so our setup we have our microns all labeled out with our product and it's on our parchment paper so if I take the parchment paper get it all set up and then I can get my bag ready to go to put into the press as well and we'll lower the temperature we want to keep it pressed down around 165 we'll go with that temp we don't want to do too high because then you're gonna burn off some of the terpenes lose flavor and you still need some heat in order to press it out through the bag so since we have a 25 micron bag we're gonna go with a little bit higher end temperature if it was a bigger micron bag we could probably drop it down to 150 140 temperature-wise to press out but we're gonna keep her up 165 get everything all prepped up load her in and show you guys how we do it okay guys let's see what we have to weigh out for Jack Herer our first hash press and see what our return is going to be so first up we're pressing out one point two grams of Jack Herer next up of the old trim run 72 70 to 120 micron we're pressing out to point six four grams now last but not least we got the old trim out 45 to a 70 micron and we're pressing out four and a half grams of that so those are our weights let's get them pressed out and see whatever turns can be okay so we got her in slowly apply pressure let it heat up and we'll get this good [ __ ] out of there just look at guys that's a good yield on that we'll just let the heat of the plates melt the the hash a little bit push it in so now we know that the plates are snuggle on it we're gonna apply a little bit of pressure so that the hash can fill up the bag before the oils start to come in just like that straighten out our bag paper straighten out the paper slowly apply pressure and we'll go for another two minute press or so looks like it might be so it's just a justice there we just lost a little bit of fuel cause of trying to do that need to get that back back in there more there you go a little bit of adjustment needed I think we had a blowout indeed we do to have a blow soon will collect what we can offer that fix it and do another press 45 to 70 old [ __ ] let's see alright 4270 old trim apply little bit of pressure to fill up bags [Music] [Music] alright guys so well that was a little bit of a mess I didn't get quite what I expected I probably should have double bagged everything I I had too much pressure and as you see we had blowouts so what I did with the blowouts is I just kind of accumulated them into a pile and just made a little bit of what could be called a piece of hash we'll see how it smokes later on but that's what I did with all those kind of chunkier pieces now with the rods and we're going to go ahead and collect it all weigh it out and set it in a container and we'll show you on how we do we'll show you how we do our curing with it so that's another good little glob there and it looks about the same as the other you old maybe a little bit more now for the cream of the crop with this rosin don't want to put it in a little jar jar it up and we're gonna cure it want to heat mat and take the Romulan sauce here get this in there seal it up so we've been using the dab press heat plate here for about past six days and we're using it on the rosin from the jack herer just pressed from straight bud and so far we're getting a nice consistency of cure on it bring it up here to the light as you can see it's turning real saucy we got diamonds starting to form in it and that's just from keeping it on this heat mat with a glass beaker over it around 86 to 87 degrees so now we got a higher quality product we're gonna try and do the same thing and just keep her around 70 or 87 to 88 degrees for about a week and see what happens we're gonna go ahead and take these and put them into a jar and we'll do the same thing to get the same kind of cure I'm gonna char it up now we'll come back in the next few days just to show you [Music]", "zqgGWXMW5Tc": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] greetings fellow humans suburban herb here and welcome back today we're making bubble hash it's one of the easiest ways to transform your product and all it takes a few items time you need some ice some kind of the finest fine and a bag extraction set so cop a squat Stang a snack ziggy-zag and let's make some bubble magic together stand over the end to see the next step of the process when things get squishy I got it stick step back oh yeah let me do it over in South Richard don't even offer to help [Music] so how does this bubble Thackeray work the basic idea is you want to chill your product to a point where agitating the ice and water causes the trichome heads to break off and ultimately end up in your collection bags for anyone who may not know trichomes are the mushroom-shaped resin glands that resemble tiny hairs on the cannabis plant and in this resin resides all the cannabis II goodness that we want to extract the THC the CBD and all the rest of your favorite cannabinoids are just hanging out in this crisp so what kid do you need bubble bag kids come in different capacities like one two five gallon being the most common as well as with different quantity of eggs three five eight the minimum you want is 3 the maximum I've seen is 8 I think four or five bags probably ideal to properly we find the end product here we're using a three vac system from triple extractor these are very sturdy high quality high-end bags I can definitely recommend these they feel like they'll last forever there are also some very well reviewed kits of all sizes from bubble bag dude on Amazon and a very affordable price I'll put both links below in the description so how do these bags work anyway well bottom of all bags contain filter holes like a mesh which are measured in microns the smaller the number and microns the smaller the hole in this video our bags are 220 75 and 25 microns in size the smallest numbered bag in your set gets put on first and they follow an order the largest numbered bag off the 220 will be the bag to your product and the ice and water will go here we're using five gallon bags which can be used for processing say two to six ounces we are using three ounces of sugar trim from our white widow basement grow so what's the process it's pretty simple it layer your ice and product your product is gone and then cover the ice with water you want to let this sit for five to ten minutes and now you're ready to get to work since it's actually the motion in the ice water that is severing the trichromats and not friction ideally your water is full of ice but can still be stirred fairly easily switching directions periodically so how long do you stir first run might be 5-10 minutes any subsequent runs ten to fifteen minutes or until your arm falls off ten minutes probably three minutes in yeah [Music] so what now it's time to remove the working bag set it aside so we can get access to the lower bags and get our first look at the goods the record a little squeeze never hurts and here it is the money shot in our kit this is the 75 micron bag which means this is what we would refer to as the smoke a bowl has plenty of trichomes but also a fair amount of plant material and squeeze through those 75 micron holes so what can you do with it well as the name suggests you can smoke it or you can hang around and see what we do with it later in the video right now it's collection time you'll want to stretch out the bottom of your bag over the top of your bucket remember something like a plate as we do here and you might even want to freeze a couple spoons beforehand as they can make collections just a little bit easier after scraping as much off the bag as you can rinse any remaining residue into your next bag to collect in your next bowl to dry it 25 micron sheet over paper towel or cardboard is ideal however anything absorbent will do you might also want to break it up into little pieces as this will help speed up drying and ensure no mold will develop on your soggy sheesh [Music] that leaves us with just one final bag 25 micron bag whose contents are often referred to as full meld - ha as with all bags you want to gently coat the product to the bottom of the bag drain the water and that is it that is one bubble hash run complete as a rule we would normally put the same product for second run and there's no reason you can't do more if your product seems to still have life in it you might want to add a little more ice and perhaps stir a little longer for subsequent runs but otherwise the process is the same that's it so what did we yield enough 1 run from three ounces of trim wait for it boom 12.6 three grams of bubble hash and what am I gonna do it at us herb smash this is the nug Smasher oh gee it's a 12-ton rosin press made in the US of A rosin is a solvent 'less extraction made through the mechanical process of applying heat and pressure to press out the terpene and cannabinoid rich resin from cured flour sift keep or hash these rosin presses are a truly chemical free clean and affordable option for your concentrate needs not to mention as you can see it's fun as [ __ ] now I did call them affordable and that's definitely arguable the nut Smasher line starts with the mini at 700 Canadian or 500 USD that's a fair amount of cash however there are some things you need to consider when it comes to these nug smashers 1 these units have a lifetime warranty and are quite possibly literally bomb-proof my OG weighs 75 pounds and is made of unobtainium that's a fact nug smasher also offers an upgrade program give you 80% the current value of the Smasher you own towards an upgraded unit what these guys stand behind their machines these could very well be a better investment than gold right now you can't wait another second a buy one drop down the description for a link [Music] so what do you do with this magic elixir once you've extracted it well that's the beauty of rosin you do just about anything with it you can dab mixtape' juice add some to a joint or a bowl or make Matt edibles rosin you can add it directly to your food while cooking or easily infuse it in oil or butter since there's no plant material in rosin you won't ruin your favourite foods for that unwanted green flavor you want one now don't you well while you're down there click on

Suburban herb thanking you for dropping by my world don't leave yet blitz has something to say [Music]", "PtKmqC4Fpjk": "[Music] hello everybody this is Dutchman 420 as you see I am getting ready to on a run of bubble hash if you wonder what these divided or bucket things are this is called the Frenchie cannoli style of making water hash or ice water hash each divider has a separate bag this is the longest divider takes the 25 which is the bottom bag I like to use a 45 bag if you're doing Frenchie can always stop this is a catch bag for the hash that he usually uses and I like to put a 90 on and then on top of that a 73 and then I put my 220 bag the one that everyone sticks in the machine with the weed I put that on top so when I pour my mixture through that catches all my nugs because I put my notes directly in the machine one other thing I notice where mister Conoco is making hash they give you the shitty accordion hose that comes with the machine you get rid ditch that [ __ ] [ __ ] man and get yourself a real hose with an elbow and a plug and then you don't have that water shooting up a hoods every time it's spinning around Plus trichomes got caught in that accordion too that they give you so you end up losing material in there so first thing I did was modify my washing machine and you don't need to buy one from bubble bag dudes like he did you just buy a cost wave washer or one of those cheap $50 washers on Amazon or Ebay and modify it you don't need a little bubble bag dude thing on here I can put dutchman for 20 washers and sell them I'll sew him for 75 and blow bubble bag dude away because all he did was buy Chinese washing machine and stick bubble bag dude on there so anyway let's get busy and make some fine grade French you can always style bubble hash yup we got our buckets all lined up we are ready to start all right here's some of my starting material it's some of that okay blower nugs and [ __ ] like that and it's not the greatest quality it's not a giant [ __ ] pound bag if we eat like mr. Kuhn okay one thing else I don't do is I do not put my material in the freezer what is the use of putting your material in the freezer if you just stick it in ice water bath because all that's gonna do is just thaw the material out and when you're doing your third we'll wash it's just gonna turn to mush this material will hold up much better in the in the water and the ice for more washes than if you freeze it freezing it serves no purpose unless maybe you're gonna dry sieve it or something I don't know but freezing it is not a smart idea so don't freeze it and don't not catch everything in one bucket use a catch vessel underneath let the water flow through the buckets with each divider on and that'll eat in the civic process what it does it swirls around through each divider bucket and settles down much better than if it's just one pool of water and all the bags are stacked on top of each other and then you just pull up out of the pool this runs through and all the waste water goes to the bottom and then I just don't piss out and by the way I do save well I don't even use a one ninety bag I the tallest bag or the highest number of bag I use is the ninety and then of course the t20 so really that's nineties got to go here in the seventy three goes here sorry about that I just woke up but uh so cuz ninety seventy three forty five twenty five and then the buckets stack on top of it themselves accordingly and then of course 220 that I've just put on top to catch all the nuts coming out of the machine because I put my raw material in width of ice and water I do not use one of those bags that bounce around in the machine you lose product in those and you cannot properly caress the trichomes off of the nugs if they're trapped in a enclosed area the water cannot circulate properly basically all your notes are doing or bouncing around in the bag and you don't want that so let's get started now what I do is I just slip this over the bucket and I'll make it so that it's not sagging down to the bottom so that I can this is not touching the table then what you do is put your you don't want to do it too tight if you get this like so it feels like it's gonna rip you want to pull and loosen some of the material but as you see this is a much better sitting area it's flat the water can pass through and catch the trichomes and go to the next screen then what I do is I put my bag on here there we go and repeat the process and then when you put this divider bucket in same thing creates a nice area to sieve at your trichomes this is the Frenchy cannoli method and yes it is very time consuming it's helpful to have two sets of bags I like these full mesh bubble bags from bubble bag dude they're pretty cheap and it comes with a 45 bag which is the most important part to me because this is my money bag right here this is the [ __ ] that gets the best hash the 4525 has a bunch of contaminants and [ __ ] in it even though you'll get a lot in it Frenchy cannoli gives that a way to concentrate makers and [ __ ] like that make tabs or he probably trades them for nugs or something I don't know if he just gives it away in any way that is the divider buckets all right I just looked at that look at birds man that is a nice run there man this is the gold bag this is my money bag my 45 and this [ __ ] wasn't even cold [Music] that is a nice pull for a [ __ ] second there second runs always way bigger than the first but I mean generally when I do runs I'll do about five to six I watched I don't see anything else coming out but uh here's the 73 but this is a sick [ __ ] 45 pull here man - all right so here's what we got from the 73 it's a little wax here looking a little lighter and the 90 now just a little note if you have a grinder and it has a chief collection thing in the bottom basically what's in the bottom of this grinder is the same thing that I'm collecting up from this machine more or less I'm not sure what Mike on screen this is on the bottom but this is what they called dry seven when you do this because what you're doing is agitating the material and letting the smaller trichomes fall to that screen that's in the bottom of this behind er so the screen acts as a sieve and then the kief goes into the bottom so depending on what micron screen this is in the bottom of this grinder this is the grade of resin head that I have collected here and yes you can take this stuff and press it into a shish I've done it before works very well I'll show you or you can check out my video pressing resin heads into hashish I think I made one about a month ago or so but uh anyway just an interesting fact let's keep on trucking all right so I've run out I so I'm gonna go run to the store and get a 20 pound bag or so maybe two and [ __ ] come back and run batch three or run three through here cuz I gotta at least wash it three or four times you know so there's oh we got on a second run I did label it looks like the 45 is really what I'm getting the most 90 and 45 or the two biggest yielders in the 45 I am very happy about getting the most out of that because that is the best [ __ ] if you ever watch any Frenchie cannoli videos whenever he's pulling that [ __ ] out and scraping that giant pile up you noticed the bag it's white so 45 bag people anyway let me go get my ice and I will be right back well here's what I got out of six seven runs I did I press the 45 273 the 25 and the 90 and separate chunks I think this is a 90 that's the 25 it might have some mixture some other [ __ ] as you can see and it's exactly good uniform but the 90 and the [Applause] 4573 don't look too bad either I think as I watched I try to get more and more contaminants in the 25 and that's why it looks like it does but it'll smoke they don't show up that's it I got six grains 6.01 six I'm like that seems to be disappearing right in front of me", "iWAWcVpnTE4": "hello ladies and gentlemen today I'll do a little how-to video on how its Droid bubble hash it's very simple what you see in front he was the the hash I just got out of my bubble bath so underneath this year and all this back to camera out a little so there we go they came out of the bubble bags I put them on this paper towel to dry a little usually what you do is there is a special material you buy that you'll draw your hash on I'm just using this for now and I'm also going to be drawing it on a cardboard normally you would use the special material that's made for this stuff because if you're doing it more medical way you don't want any of the fibers from the paper towel or the cardboard sticking to the hash while it's drawing but it works perfect this way it works fine so now you're gonna need a spoon and you're gonna need a little strainer like this and if you'll see I don't know if the camera can tell but there's different color hashes here those are from the different bags the different microns micron is a measurement of size you're usually when you get bubble how she get three bags to start but there's many more probably start at 90 microns 75 microns and then 25 microns and 25 being the smallest and to give you an idea what a micron is is the human eye can't see anything less than 60 to 50 microns that's the average unit so what I'm gonna do here is I just drop my hash in take a spoon because I wanted to get into little crumbly square little square tiny pieces that way it's going to dry once it dries like that that's crumble hash right there you could call it crumble or whatever you want but it's bubble hash as you see the pieces are all falling out little smaller ones like that this is just one method of drip front nose drawing the hash so let me just do a few just start tapping if you tap it a lot of it falls off and you'll see it gets stuck on the bottom side see that's a really green one that's from the the worst bag and that was the second run that's why it's that color once you run your material twice in the machine it gets much greener the second time there's one from the first bag it's much less being there's a few green stuck on it but it's much more white you know and what you're gonna do after once you have it all out you'll just spread it evenly among once the cardboard soaked all dry he'd want it piled up on top of each other but you should notice a big color difference the lower microns of the bag like 25 compared to 75 is a more quality stronger so you could sit really see the difference in the by colors and the second run that's the second run that's the first run but from different backs that's the 25 micron that's the 75 I don't know I'll just keep going with the rest of this for you guys quickly I'd break it up like this and now once you're finished with this like I said you flatten it out totally if to have an even surface so it dries evenly you'll go around the once or twice a day and you're going to move the pile around to make sure it's all not all sticking to the cardboard or too much together now this is just one way to do it like I said people would complain and say oh you're doing it on the cardboard use any of our stuff this is a harder cardboard I wipe it off with a damp cloth before I do this let it dry and I haven't had any problem like I said that's just one way of drawing it you could also just have break it into little pieces if you take this and you're broken into smaller pieces even smaller than that you could just leave it on the side like that believe that they're like that and I'm just showing you one little run here I don't really care that it's mixed mush it's just for my cell phone this pile I'll just put it the mixed one there's a few little mix pieces in it like I said you could leave this in crumble you could put it into little pieces like that you can make a temple ball you can press it there's so many things that could be done so there we go that's done I'm gonna leave it dry for a few days for sure like I said I'm gonna flatten it out evenly amongst on the surface once it dries it really darkens up like crazy I'll put up school Nerdist so you show a little size comparison but anyway that's that people I would show you the whole process but I'm not set up properly for the camera enough but definitely I'll show you a full equipment I have to make the bubble hash in another video thank you everybody why", "bYdCOS_d3xk": "welcome back to the talking head I'm Josh McCain and this is your cannabis business podcast today we're gonna make hash Frenchie cannoli style famous hash maker that you're going to need a couple of things products for one we've got some trim you'll need a scraper you need some kind of matte weather silicone or otherwise you need some ice and then access to a hose or water bucket different micron bags they come in all different shapes and sizes I'm going to use a few of these friend she uses four different bags he starts with one ninety then one sixty forty five to twenty five if you don't have those exact numbers don't worry about it I don't either I'm starting at 220 followed by one sixty seventy three and then twenty five you should yield about ten percent on average but we ran our last batch came up with not so great you know pucks here a bad product and bad product out has probably already been Keith we're gonna try new bags same ice same cold ice same method and see what kind of result we've got I've got a nice bubble machine is gonna be helpful as well you're gonna want to towel some alcohol to soak the microns because after the first and maybe third wash it's gonna clog up you'll no longer have that sift function so we're gonna fill this up a third of the way with ice a third with our material and then again a third I'm gonna have a trim sandwich [Music] five or six times the first one we're gonna do for about want to make sure to start everything clean make sure to clean as you go so after this first round we're gonna clean that micron bag I'll show you that in a second after we drain this simply just take those run it through nice and green we run that through all of our four bags you can separate each bag with a different bucket if you want I'm just going to run all the bags consecutively and put some water in it fill it up and then run it for two minutes so we're gonna use our tool bitch bag after getting most of the hash we're gonna end up cleaning it with some alcohol so could scrub it get it really clean so after we clean the smallest micron bag in this case it's a 25 micron bag we cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol at 99% whatever you've got to clean it real good put it back in there and network going to flush the second time after it ran for two minutes I feeling it a third time we're gonna run for six minutes now [Music] you may find that the filter and the machine clogged so by turning it on and off that will spin it hopefully unclog it allowed to drain more so after the second rinse we're going to check the filters of the bubble bags the trick to that is kind of just pretend like the panning for gold we wanted to shake it make sure that there's enough air so for example with there's holes at the bottom of this bucket and if you don't lift it up and give it air it's harder for that said water to drain through as you sift to get the water to drain out a lot faster otherwise you're gonna be there for days hoping it just drains out [Music] top bag is retinues you just toss that out throwed the backyard yard waste is illegal interstate open this up like a piping it's freakin south you can also grab a cold frisbee throw it in the back here this makes for a nice little pleasement just read this out a lot [Music] this is a 25 micron bag so after about 3/4 of the way through we have about two and a half percent yield normally you're looking at at least 10% because we're using unusable trim we don't expect so after it's dry 4.2 ounces here so it's all mixed in from the different micron bags you can see the different colors but just like data shit in shit out so we're finally done what the hash was very long process took a while we did about two or three different bags per day obviously over a few different days we'll leave a link to the show notes of how friends she does it takes him about an hour per cycle I did it a little bit faster because the product I was using wasn't as good obviously Frenchie and only professional and does a phenomenal job starts with the best product I didn't have that luxury but for us we're done so with that we're gonna roll this one up I'm Josh Kincaid this is the talking heads don't forget to Like share and subscribe or don't an amount [Music]", "6qj_ybKWsqk": "hey everybody's Siobhan here with gross sisters today we are making bubble hash [Music] alright so we have got a bowl full of frozen nuts what I've done is added I just put them in the frigerator for about 20 minutes and they are frozen so what we're gonna do is we're gonna dump them into our bubble box and from there [Music] so I'm adding a little bit of water to the ice mixture to kind of aggravate it and what we're doing wife elbow hash is so cool is that we are creating a freeze of the THC of those triumphs and knocking them off why call ash is so cool it's because it's a solvent lift hash we're using blueberry muffins today 3 this oh hush so now what we're going to do is shake it around and aggravate all those trichomes the teach seat to fall the other thing that's cool about these bags is that they are gauged from a very high gauge to a very low Cajun so what we're doing is as our procedure we as we go through what we're doing is we're catching the different stuff so you're going to see that there's gonna be like more material and chlorophyll kind of like in with the bigger stuff as we get to the thinner stuff so the reason why I have separated my two bags is because these are really thin holes and we're just gonna go ahead and use all of the water that comes through all these ones there's because that's gonna take a minute it's gonna take too long to drain this just moves the process a little bit faster self [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "IqzhwZhVeAQ": "what is going on YouTube pub everybody's having a wonderful wonderful day today's video is gonna be all about what we can do do as I trim and what not and one thing I'm really gonna get back into is making some awesome bubble hash cuz it needs to come back I'm wearing a wint I know everybody's making the concentrates worth it but guess what you can make bubble hash and impress that and make even better concentrates with the Rawls on press so we're gonna be taking you through that we'll do a press probably depending on how much boba hash I end up getting back if you've never tried true bubble hash it is amazing and you should definitely try it super crazy easy super crazy healthy it's literally your trim you need some ice in some water and that's you know all you need is a nice long story stick and that's that but oh and the bubble bag so we have a Leo 5 bag setup so we have a work bag and then a floor base here from if it's 160 again a 25 micron and four different levels of hash you can use this for edibles from certain levels all the way down to some really nice full melt prettiness so we're gonna take it through it step by step if you knew the channel make sure to subscribe make sure to give me a like so literally what we had going on I had this bag in the freezer it's from this last harvest the strawberry schnitz little whatnot and we have a bunch more too but you can see there's some little mugs and stuff in there we've let it dry out completely I couldn't fit it all in the freezer because my wife would kill me so I want to add that much in the freezer so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put in there put that in there and then let some ice in there for a little while but to let that melt down I let this dry out I recommend you doing that as well there's two methods in doing this I've seen done both ways some people like to do their bag inside of all their bags I like to be a little more rough with it so I just have two five-gallon buckets you can get them at Home Depot and yeah so unless I sit up in here for a little while cool this down so that's the name of the game is getting this really nice and cold I'm going to start melting down there then we're gonna add some water and I'll be back with you all right so now that I've had a piece of pizza and drink a piece a little bit of Red Bull I've put ice in here before I started doing all that so that way I start cooling down those trichomes cuz that's what we're trying to do is keep those trichomes as cold as possible so they fell a plant material so now we need to add water I've had this in my freezer as well for a little bit that's optional so I'm gonna get it to the copra metal water where I can actually stir this and get down to the bottom and get a good nice rinse that's literally all we're trying to do so I can get the flow going and we'll be right back all right so I got my trusty dusty Red Bull with me cuz I'm gonna need that and I got a nice soup tea mixture going here so as you can probably see so what we're gonna do now ensuring this as hard as we possibly can for as long as you possibly can add ice as it starts melting the more the better cuz the more trichomes we're trying to get all those trichomes to fall off the plant material all through this work bag and then we're gonna pour it all into these bags and separate itself and make our hash so I'm gonna get the stern and I'm not gonna make you watch super crazy long and me just sitting here but you do want to make sure you get all the way to the bottom full mix everything good add ice you should go to keep it cold colder it is the more trichomes we're gonna fall off so I'm going to beat the crap out of this for now and then we'll be back all right here in constant [Applause] 20 minutes now much as I could you can do a second round I'm probably going to do a second run so what I'll do is I'll drain this take this work bag out outside of my boxes clean boxes as clean as it can be anyways four boxes Pat but and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna pour this the water that's in this tub after this work bag has been pulled out we're gonna give it a little shake and then everything that's left in this tub we're gonna go ahead and run through these and we have mouths spaced out there's four of them here and they're in here you want a little bit of room left at the bottom of the bucket so yeah we're gonna go ahead and get to that yes you got our work bag pulled up here drinks all right so we took you out of that I'm in here I put that one back in Nick so I'm gonna do a second rung so we have about a quarter left of this bucket lift so I can see it a little bit more in there as you can see it's part of the reason why we call it bubble Heche because it is bubbling all right so that's the first run and I'm gonna give you a couple of quick pointers for the second run what I like to do is I'd like to pull my first bag all the way down as you can see so I can get it up there and I'm gonna slowly pour in this after I take this work but I got just the water that's left in here how much slowly pour it in there so that way I have an even nice cleanup area I'm only cleaning this up the hash can get nicer every bag that we go through so I'm also going to keep a little thing of water and every single bag we go through once we get it all in here I'm gonna come back and I'll show you I'll scrape it will go on move to the next bag do the same thing one more little pointer when we are gone I like to pull my bag all the way up as much as I can so that way there's a little bit of room between the water and that and this bucket and I like to pour some fresh water on top giving the bag and a mic of where the water line is a couple inches in between so that way it pushes any extra loose trichomes that may be stuck pushes them out and then we will use that water all right so I've drained it through here through my other bags and then I empty took them all out emptied that water in here so that way we were left with an empty bucket now and then let it all drain in there so that way we had a nice empty bucket to start with because you'll notice there's some little granules on the side so what I like to do as you can see all the other bags are pretty much like this level I pulled this one up a couple inches so that way there's a little gap in between bags and what I do is I'll have a little bit extra water and I just want to do a nice small pore along the sides real fast just to get it down there just enough to give us a nice little area and then we're gonna pull this bag up nice and flat now let's pull it up nice and flat and we're gonna grab a credit card or something of that nature and start scooping it and setting it on our little pile alright so what I got here is a 25 micron press mat what I'm gonna use for this is to collect all that and put it in here I'm gonna give it a press and get some that moisture out on top of one of those cardboards and then I'm gonna use the dab man to separate everything so I'll show you what it looks like all right so that's what we collected from the 160 we're gonna fold it over on itself and press some of that water out this is gonna be mostly used for like edibles stuff like that I might even press it in some rosin all right so you got that 160 you here took up my dad match set it over there for now cuz you don't want the water moisture on there yeah we're just gonna give this a little swish on that cardboard and as you can see it'll start pushing some of that water out alright that's what we're left with there you see there's still a lot of green in here whatnot so that's why this one isn't the best for smoking but yeah put that on there I'm gonna kind of chunk it up together use my trusty dusty card and just trying to get some of this stuff and pull it back to the middle and I'll put on a dead man all right now we're gonna move on the next bag do the exact same thing since we got that I'll square it away over here you know we're gonna keep on separating it and so we have all the bags cleared alright so there you have a couple of different forms of hash this one's pretty much best for edibles whatnot probably impress this one and some rousing really good smokeable and then the finest smokeable will just be nice and gold once it dries out a little bit this would be a little bit better colored but some of the product I ran was like couple months old from my not last harvest but my harvest before that so yeah looking good though you just let this dry chop it up a little bit if you'd like to help it dry a little bit faster says somewhere dark kind of warm so that way it dries out because we wanted to be dried don't want any mold happen or anything like that but that is how you make hash if you would like to see how you press hash into some super fire rosin stick around stay tuned and hit that notifications bell", "t8SETC7J6fI": "here we go we're working with some bubble hash that we made here at Coral Cove beautiful bubble house right here just put it in the freezer to get it more of workable so we can put it through here grate it so it breaks it down smaller to help bring bring out the moisture moisture is a killer you get moisture trapped in there and you don't properly cure it you're gonna get you some oldie ash you do not want that gorgeous mm-hmm persecute some stuff we made the other day it's almost nice and cured and dried or taking some of this and we're gonna repress it see what kind of turn and the quality that we get from it here's some more that we made sitting there getting nice and cured here in the frigerator right back to here we're breaking it up a little pieces kind of getting ready to grade to the grater there so we can have it broken up so it dries that are cures that maybe the way to mood because here's some of the rosin that we just made this morning from the hash bubble hash that we've made the other day here so some nice rosin a nice color beautiful hey it's uncle stoner check out more of the videos to come he's out", "DcAsT3wJRQE": "hey guys what is happening team here from marijuana si for another instructional video today I'm gonna be taking you through the steps of making bubble hash using a hash washing machine shout out to Mitch from the craft cannabis sessions force for giving me this awesome gift I'm really trying to make the best of it and use it so I've got two jars of trim it's outdoor season here in South Africa I've harvested I've got a whole lot of leftovers that I've been collecting and I'm going to show you the incredibly simple steps to making your own bubble hash it's as easy as one two and three first I'll fill up the hash machine with some water and some ice pour in the trim normally I put the trim into a laundry bag but shirring lockdown unfortunately I'm just gonna wire it in I'll give it a good clean afterwards and then let it go for about 15 minutes on the on the wash setting and then I'll run it through the hash bag in my hash pocket and see if I get any results alrighty guys here we go first I'm going to add a little bit of water into step number two mix that in there I scold inhibitor with the ice blocks a good ratio of ice to water [Music] frothy and that's that guys while we let the trichomes now settle in here I'm just gonna move this to the side we go to the next part so this is a luxury if I didn't have this I would have beaten them I've beaten the the water and the hash mixture in the bucket but today I'm blessed so next we'll move on to the next step the different hash back it goes from the smallest micron at 73 90 120 160 and 190 you want to do is you want to go from the smallest bag to the largest pack so you there we go just like that we're gonna be making some hash hash bags over here allowed the trichomes just settle and it's just as simple as releasing the water or water through so for the final step it's time to see if we got anything you simply just remove the hash bags I like to do it sort of in a chattery kind of motion and this first one as I suspected loads of plant matter I'm just gonna cost that one aside number two [Music] [Music] sweet guys so that was a round of bubble hash how I make bubble hash if I get enough I'm hopefully gonna press it I've been saving a hash for a while what I've been growing so yeah this is it I'll show you the end result sweet guys thanks for watching if you enjoyed this video please subscribe give me some tips on how you make babel how I could do it better next time and yeah look forward to the next video these guys lots of love beam from marijuana si", "pPSVlINiWB8": "hey guys Eric here with peer pressure today solving this question is some variation following I've made six star or otherwise premium hash in a bubble magic or hand stirring in a bucket so what gives with the brutalist we get this question all the time and now that we are getting heavily involved in coming out with technology for ice water hash washing this is something that we wanted to address very openly and honestly and talk about a lot of the benefits that are brutalist series of hash washing vessels provide to anyone that's trying to make premium ice water hash product so it goes without saying that great quality ice water hash has been made for a very very long time and while the origins of it are often debated we can always give a lot of credit to bubbleman for helping make it a very very popular product coming out with a ton of educational material and showing people how it's done now with simple washing devices if you've got a great quality product you've got really cold water and ice there's a good chance you're gonna come out with a pretty decent product out the other end almost no matter what you're doing a big thing that we always like to tell people is that no matter what wash process you're using make sure to use RO water because what is in your water is going to be in your hash and one of the biggest misconceptions is that distilled water is something that you can and should use for washing hash now we don't think that that's true because what we've seen and there's evidence out there pointing the fact that when you distill water if there's residual pesticides in that water it tends to concentrate them not get rid of them so with RO water because it's being filtered in such a way you don't have that problem so if that being said when it comes to our Brewers hash washing vessels the biggest things that they are going to offer over using a bucket or especially a non insulated thing at home first and foremost food grade this is huge in ensuring that you are not getting any mold or bacteria that are growing or inhabiting your vessel with simple proper cleaning care you're ensuring that you've got an FDA food grade sanitary product that's going to make hash that can pass testing if the original material did as well so having a food-grade vessel is absolutely huge the second one ice consumption making sure that you're getting enough ice as any hash maker knows who's made a lot of ice butter hash it's a lot of work and ice makers can be very expensive they need to be cleaned often as well there's just a lot of work and cost involved with getting enough ice so the brutalist hash washing vessels are heavily insulated and over the course of a day you're gonna use about half as much ice as you normally would which over the course of weeks and months and years translates to massive cost savings making your life much easier to keep your barrel at a flat 34 degrees for the duration of your wash now another huge advantage are all the ports on it enabling you to customize your setup so that you can route waste and drain water one way you can skim water off you can attach a sight glass to see how your wash is actually going it's almost like a snow globe check out some of our other hash washing videos it's absolutely incredible as well as attaching pumps and all kinds of other things to it so that you can really wat manage your water properly managing your water properly is one of the most important ways to efficiently and effectively produce ice water hash and of course we've got the stainless steel false bottom at the bottom of the brutalist vessels where all of the trichomes can settle more gently underneath it and be protected from the back and from ice and from other things swirling around in there which I hope you don't have much else than that that gives you a more gentle isolation process now all of our Brewers hatch vessels are all made in North America made from premium quality insulation stainless steel super easy to wash people also ask us quite a bit bonus question why hand wash it seems like a lot of work and the truth is is washing does take work especially by handy but the key advantage that hand washing gives you is much more control over your process so as anyone who has truly made a six-star full melt ice water hash will tell you it can be hard to do in a non manually dated way because when you're trying to make a six-star a true full mal product which many claim but not as many make it requires extremely gentle and often brief agitation that can be perfected in the form of hand washing now if you're going for a full spectrum you typically are gonna wash for longer you're gonna use less bags to filter it out it just gives you more control over the process to come out with different products and different quality levels in order to have more SKUs to provide more products that you can turn into rosin products that you can simply dry and sell on the shelf so our brutalist vessels are fully customizable we sell three different setups the base the pro and the commercial with different configurations and what a lot of people are really surprised to learn is just simply how much product you can actually wash it one time with these vessels with our sixty five gallon our largest option you're looking at 15,000 fresh frozen grams at a time and and we've had customers go up from that so we're already hot on the trail of coming out with open wash liners and all kinds of other great technology to increase volume while washing to make it as efficient as possible and to make hash a much more scalable and lab friendly process because in a laboratory environment you're needing things to be food grade you are needing things to be efficient you are needing your pipes your hoses your water management to be as deliberate as possible with the room that you're washing in and our systems really enable you to set themselves up to accomplish all of those needs for any lab environment or home wash environment as well so if you've got any more questions about the brutalist our systems or any of our other products just leave those questions in the comments below we'll try and answer them as quickly as we can thanks for watching make sure to tune in next time [Music]", "6foOf4sH2T8": "yo what up YouTube alright guys I just ran some bubble hash I still got a [ __ ] little more to run this is just a little bit running around right now this is what I came out looking like these one that's the first I'm gonna take it out into some bedding that guys give me one second hopefully you guys can see this alright that right there is the first one that I run and I think that's the 90 micron and that one is this as a 30 micron same first run and that's the second one of the of the 30 and the and the 8 and the the 90 micron mixed together so that's what I ended up getting out of it I haven't weighed here the way that I take my my water out of my half guys there's a couple of different ways to you can just crumble it down and let it dry and put it on some cardboard or you can use a mat like this this is basically just a 25 micron mat and you just get the hash together you squeeze it together I'll show you on this one just squeeze it together and you squeeze out all the water and you can put a towel over it and so got all humidity out of it and what you're left with is the ball of hash and you can do this a few times you can do this as many times until you don't get no more eventually what's gonna happen is gonna get so sticky it's gonna stick to the mat as you can see it's already done in the past it'll get so sticky that it'll start sticking to the mat and it'll be really really really like putty and then from there on you can let it dry 24 to 48 hours depending on how dry you want it I don't like my hat my hair just stays pretty moist because it's pretty sticky it's usually dank I don't really use a lot of trim this is more buds than anything else but you can see how good the quality of the hash is and this is bubble hash guys people always talking about drying their hash out breaking it down there's a lot of different ways to do hash guys not just one way there's hash as part of the oldest concentrate ever I mean like the first concentrate on the oldest so there's so many different ways to use it and so many different ways to dry it and in consume it that people just don't realize how to do it or they just think that they know what they're talking about a lot of people in the world that you know that's fine you like to do it your way but everybody has a different way of doing it it's not just one way of doing it and your way isn't always the right way or the best way you know I'm saying just like this might not be the best way but I'm trying to show you guys the difference is and how to do it because a lot of people out there will give you bad information misinformation they don't know what they're talking about there's a lot of different ways to do it guys it's not just one way and I tell you this because it's not that difficult to make hash guys hash is probably the easiest and the most but the most easiest thing to make the concentrate ways just unless you're making like dry sift or something sorry guys my cats are trying it out you can see the quality of the hash that came out real gold and there's a little bit of plant material in there I got in there but not a lot this is all for personal use anyway I'm gonna probably press this all in the rosin guys I'll let this I'll probably press it out a few more times like I said what I'll do is I'll put it in the map I know it looks dirty that's all the rosin from all the other different types of paste and you can get a towel put one on the top one on the bottom you can push out all of that moisture and then what you're left with is just a block of hash or a couple blocks depending on how you do it I said there's a little bit of plant material in there but that's alright I'm thinking that mmm I'm gonna I'm gonna press this all in the rosin guys I probably have about pounds of that I'm gonna press enter into rosin guys and I'll show you exactly what I'm talking about most of this gonna be pressed into rosin guys you can see it's all buds and I got I got [ __ ] loads of it it's not the best trim in the world but it's a lot of Platt so right now I just this is stuff actually that I had in the freezer it was probably a bag about this size right here it's probably about half the size of this bag right here this is another one I'm gonna do tomorrow this is some other stuff that I have here and like I said all buds [Music] [Applause] and these are pretty contact guys that's all wet still come in the plant that was never dried this one that I just brought it was dry guys I let it dry out for about about four days before I actually froze it it was in between right but right before you got to cure it I guess but I just like I said I ran it made it easier on myself because I got so much material that I have to run it just makes it easier for myself and like I said I run the 25 micron I run the 90 micron and then I run the filter bag along with the work bag that's on the bottom right here and that's how I make my bubble hash case very simple very easy like I said it's one of the first concentrates ever made people like I say it's not hard to do guys and there's no wrong way to do it or to not do it here I'm saying and the only thing you can do wrong this by mixing your material too long because then you'll start getting client matter or the way the ways where I got plant matter of my is because these bags aren't exactly five gallons and they don't slip over the side so I have to leave them and stack like this and when I mix sometimes [ __ ] falls in between the bags and that's why I got material in my hash this is supposed to catch it this this bag here but like I said if it goes in between the top its there's nothing I can do it's gonna go into the next bag over and that's what happened what I'm mixing the the hash and all the buds and the eyes together but next time I'll make a full video guys I just wanted to show you guys the end product and how I put us out the water out of my out of my hash it's really easy guys there's not much to and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to make hash if you having to sit there and listen to other people's BS about how they do it and how the right way and the right all this you know I mean hashes oil that's all it is it's just the using ice to extract it from the from the plat matter after you extract it you can press it out like I said you can just put it together in a ball put a rag on the bottom right on the top and you can press on all that moisture and by tomorrow this should be dry enough to press even by tonight even people have different different ways that they do it this is the way I do it and I've never had an issue with you guys if it's still a little moist you want to leave it you don't want to press anything that's wet guys you want to make sure that you're dry enough that that your press isn't gonna because what'll happen is if you if you try to press this wet or if it has moisture in it a lot of moisture yo your oils will come out real funky they'll come out looking either they'll come out mixed with water in it went with the rosin or you'll have a lot of steam and stuff coming off your off your press plates and just a lot of not nothing Goods gonna come from it so like I said people break down their hash they grind it down they put it into a granular that's not necessary you can leave it in a patty you just got to press it out guys that's what the that's where they give you these when you buy your rosin bags you can press out your hash and like I said I've used this thing for years and years and years and years I've actually replaced it this is his party like the third one but you can see all the the hash that gets left behind after pressing it even right now it's pretty sticky as you can see it's a it's gonna stay pretty sticking you can make this into full melt if you really wanted to you can you can press it back down uses some heat and a bottle and you can you can make it even better but that's just the one way of doing it guys and it's not the best way it's not the worst way it just works that's all that matters as long as you're getting what you're what you're looking for in the end see that's what will happen once you press out all the water the hash will start sticking to everything and I mean everything and then that's why I got all this extra [ __ ] on the bag so I usually make sure I pushed a lot of pressure on there and get out as much oil and what will happen is eventually normal water is gonna come out and it's just gonna start sticking to everything and getting rolled like putty like I say and then you'll end up fighting to get it off of the mat so you don't want to be pressing it too too much on this map because you'll have issues later on down the line with trying to get it off the mat like I say and you can use alcohol to clean this if you want to afterwards I just buy a new one but you can do it however you want you can clean it with alcohol when you're done and reuse it again I don't do that I just keep using it and using it too I figure I need a new one and that's it guys that's probably about I don't know five six grams of hash maybe a little more but it still looks a little moisture in there so we'll let it dry out and then we'll go through it away it's May I have two little work guys so have a good one be safe", "NRUOpqCaPKU": "yes yes people justin back in the house how you doing there as promised as promised we have the bubble hash tutorial um this is my front living room um like i said i've had to wait because i'm about to pick up the material which has just come out the freezer so i'm going to use this now just so you get a close-up it's just trim it's literally a bag of trim i don't know if you can see that very well there but bits of trim basically so that's going to go in i'll show you visually um apparently this is trim off eight plants it's a mixture so basically what we're gonna do is first of all we've got our backs okay so we've got our bags all right they're laying for 25 45 73 90 and 120 okay so that's our filtration bags okay this 220 back here this is our work bag we're going to work this bag okay so i'm going to do a couple of these tutorials i haven't done this for a long time so i'm going to be very i'm not going to be great at it it's really important to break the ice out just but obviously i always tend to put a little bit of ice in the bottom everyone's got a different method to doing this i've seen loads of different programs but basically i tend to sort of sandwich it between the ice get some trim in there nice trip lots of leaf in there doesn't look like there's a lot of blood or anything so it's just trim but oh well actually there's a couple of little popcorn nuggets in there all right then so the trims looking good actually it's all organic material um i think you said it was a mixture of white widow um cheese and something else basically but thank you very much that man doesn't want to be named all right so we've got some ice in there now sandwiched a bit of this i will be nipping in and out of the camera because obviously i've got to get to the other room as well right so i think that's enough there i don't know enough more a bit more just [Music] this is only going to produce a very very small amount of hash i know there's probably guys out there now we're popular laughing at this it's just to show you what can be done yeah frozen water try and get your uh water that's yeah [Music] [Applause] okay it is important to get the water quite cold hence why i've um i've frozen it there get some more in there now have a bomb with you in a minute guys by all means trial and error sometimes i have to take a bit of ice out and sometimes i don't don't use all that let's get a bit more and see how it goes okay most people do two or three runs of this i'm sure you may have seen tutorials before i learned off the one and only so cool man i watched a tutorial of this he basically did this with these safe bags as well in his kitchen sink so that's looking nice just put a little bit more ice there okay the ice is there just to keep the temperature cool yeah it's not doing any other job but to keep the temperature low yeah so the trikes when you're when you're you're basically you're turning it basically try it's just basically coming off so i'm gonna just let that set for a minute okay that's gonna mate i would say just so let's get a bit more material in there okay i've never used all of that i have got another little bag which i'm gonna use and she's got slightly better quality trimming it it's got a lot more popcorn notes in it so i will do that one i just want to do this one first that's a bit of a lot i've not done it for a while so i don't want to mess up a really really good trend because i'm going to try and get some full melt out of that but we'll say don't have one smear just one more one more so i would cook it on the ice obviously i'd say it's there for a reason all right give me two steps i want to pop this back in the freezer really really important to keep your trim nice and fresh yeah just get it straight back in the freezer you'll ruin it otherwise yeah so just run that's all you need like that [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay [Music] all right so yeah it's important just to let it set just for a second just let everything get to temperature [Music] because you're going to think that you're going to be doing a couple of runs of this so you need you need it to be right so just to show you if you can see that i don't know if you can see it oh yeah just don't [ __ ] spill it anywhere but basically it's all in there there you go you can't see it very well i'll try and i am trying i will bring the camera closer while i'm scraping okay all right that's looking good um don't say i don't these these bags were nearly redundant i used to use them a little while ago i really stopped using them because i got some newer bags um which were used in the machine which just take it took off all the stirring um it takes off a lot of the effort but i did notice that the bigger bags we're not producing um is good at quality it was produced some really really nice sandy bubble hash but it wasn't producing the full mouth which is really what i was looking for um but yeah it was still incredibly good i thought we'll go back to these bags since i haven't got that much trim and i just want to i just want to see if i can produce a little bit of just a little bit of hash ring to smoke and just to show you guys like that that if you are out there you are growing and you've got trim and you're just chucking it away this is goals this has gone don't chuck it away i'm going to show you that i'm going to show you now stick it in the freezer and wait for a rainy day when you've got left in i'll tell you what you're lasting good [Music] so just going to try and get a slightly better lighter and turn the light on hopefully it doesn't flicker but um so that's been in there for about oh i don't know what ten minutes down here five minutes seven minutes coming up two today too simple just for everything just to set at the right temperature [Music] i'm doing it like the music's all right people i'm trying i am trying nine minutes in already jess you've not even stopped popping stirring yet sorry [ __ ] right you've got to set everything up right person there so you've got everything right so this is going to be about 10 minutes 10 10 to 15 minutes i would say 12 minutes somewhere like that it just depends try not to overfill it but it's still going to go [ __ ] everywhere headphone normally i would do this in the kitchen around the sink area however i can't do that when i film them so if there's two of you it's brilliant because you can do five minutes stir in each all right [Applause] it's got the old bottoms on because again it's going to go [ __ ] everywhere people [Applause] basically what we do we've got material in here as you can see just working out trying to break those tripods off basically that's what we're trying to do break the tracks off [Applause] i'm going to do this a couple of times so basically once we've done this we remove the bag we pour the water into the buckets the filters and then we take each one out individually we scrape them we scrape prefer [Laughter] [Applause] i think it works best when you start getting a little bit of froth on top of the mixture here when it starts fluffing up you know that you're doing the drop one didn't use particularly a lot of material there just want to show you just like just add a couple of plants don't trap your material away as goals [Laughter] you can get these to fix on buckets better this works for me so i ain't probably doing it different towards there yes yes before so what are you doing today i'm making bubble hash yeah baby [Applause] [Laughter] so [Laughter] [Applause] yeah baby so yeah you guys you gotta stir it stir it like poop get it all [ __ ] profit break those [ __ ] triphones off and then we're going to pour it 12 15 minutes so time some people are stirring tag it depends on the quality of what you're looking for and as you learn as you learn more and more on how to do it and the different ways you you get to know the way that is best for you and the quality of passions that you're trying to produce and this is mixed strains this is just what i can get hold of on sunday but obviously if you add your own then you can separate it to sativa uh indicators so you can have a nice bubble house and say in the daytime you can have a better one for the evening more potent just depends on what you're trying to make [Music] hence why i bought the machine this leads in and it's naughty but it does [ __ ] work attempt to get all from the second round first leg and the first one oh man my [ __ ] arms things you gotta do though like you say if don't say you want to make a good quality bet you know i mean so you're going to be a little bit literally you're going to be [ __ ] out just about what you've got could be such a small amount but it's enough for yourself yeah it's enough it's tough to meditate yourself it's better than chopping it in the trash once you've invested in these bags that's it then to prepare you might say i've had these years you can tell they all might say really they weren't going to get used again but just for the purposes to show you what you can do with just a tiny tiny little bit of chair [ __ ] it outdoors skills things like that you know the problem really you want to see the whole process [Applause] so in a nice color now it's got a really really really nice color i'll just show you because the lights on there you'll probably have to sing so open up don't spill it again just but yeah it is just going a really really nice color um water's really turning green it's starting to have a really nice um like cannabis smell to the water the bouquet is almost coming through [Applause] so [Applause] yeah mao sorry [ __ ] scrappy obviously for safety reasons i won't be posting these videos um up straight away like we normally do because of the material i'm working with do i wish not to incriminate my and myself in any way shape or form get out of it and go this is scrapping she's on heat she's not feeling very well that's good what are you ready now you're famous your fingers now that's all we're doing this about eight minutes we'll keep going i could tell i started to tire go watch me back to the [ __ ] back doing this as well but it's always worth it like so you could do this two three four times depending on how much material you've got um generally i think after two two pulls that's it really you'll get a little bit more on the third but it ain't worth that yeah so just generally just try and get it out in the first and second run but each everyone does this differently and so i've seen people run this only once they do one run on it i've seen people run it four or five times so i guess it's just depending on what material you're using if it's probably just leafs and stuff like that and just creating real basic trim and you might want you want to run it a couple of times but if you're running buds you're doing you know you're looking to do fresh frozen roasting and you know you might want to ready a little bit more [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] yes yes people some positive fights only positive votes going out there to you as food that does zero gma [Laughter] so there's a couple other bits and pieces you need as well for the next part so just grab that quickly [Music] okay so a couple of other pitch you'll need um water bottle preferably relatively frozen not so you can't squirt it so it needs to be [ __ ] cold and a frozen spoon all right i will explain in a second that's with a straight pen like where are you let's just check the time on that guys people what are we looking at then um yeah fake 10 minutes so i'll just give it another little turbo a little turbo i feel [ __ ] i've got to be honest in here but it is getting you fit at the same time people [Applause] if you're not able to do this then i'll say the little washing machines you can buy off amazon for about 60 credits they're not expensive quite with those and um yeah you can basically get a pyramid bag just like a tea bag basically that you put the trim in and you stick that inside the machine and it basically with the ice and it does all the work for you you drain it and you do this part the same shattered mate shattered i've got to be honest with you been a long time long time cool [Applause] it does make bad quality though i don't care what anyone says because [Applause] lovely color nice and properly just now i want to see it [Applause] break all those trichomes off man because we want all those all right it's the next bit we simply drain it cover that water guys [Music] that's where all our loving triphens are in there guys that's what we want that's what we want we want that i have a lot darker color than that but it's like saying it's not my material i know it's clean but it's not what i say [Music] it's a different grade of material we're just going to squeeze it all out but obviously we're going to use this again so this just gets set aside for a second [Music] okay we just set that aside just for two sets and simply we get our bucket we get our water and we just quite simply we pour it in all we're doing is we're filtering we are filtering the tripods we're filtering the tripods off each individual filter okay that's what we're doing right so get yourself a fresh team towel get yourself a screen this one's quite dirty but that's fine whatever and you get yourself a spoon which is being in the freezer and nice and cold and then individually just put that away there [Music] you take each layer [Music] and you scrape basically [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so normally this backs just view don't normally worry about this bag but there is still bits in it there's a lot of plant material in this so there is ash in there but that's your lower blades very very very very low grades [Music] well there is fashion now there is let's say there's trips in there there is little bits of hash so normally i'll go and rinse these backs out one at a time as you go to each bag they'll get harder and harder to pull and the quality will get well like i said i i personally like the seven i like this back here and i like the 73 the best the yellow bag i like i think the black bag this one here the 19 is a relatively new bag as you can see we're just draining it into the next okay these bags are really old so they all they do look dirty but they're not that clean trust me they've just been used lovely amount of hash in there you can see it there let's clear it all right okay so straight away we can see that we've got a little bit of hashish in there well the hardest thing personae is getting it [ __ ] out so as you can see there small bit froth but yes we have we have the ashish baby we have the hashish we have a nike all right small mate smaller mate first round first round first row right again use your water cold water to get the trikes all into one position basically so it's easier to get hold of it and scrape it that's why i'm using the water all right takes a bit of skill doing this bear it like say a few it'll be a bit cat-handed to start with but then you'll just find it you'll get it [Music] it's like a small small small amounts you have to appreciate i need to keep myself safe here so i can't be working with lots and lots of material i need to only just have a little bit you know i mean a few people have offered me more material to work with but at the end of the minute i'll just do it with this right okay so basically what i'll do now is i'll turn the bags inside and not the first one but i'll just give a little stick because this this hassle here it can be collected and we can go into the next bag or i can't quite get it so i'll just give it a little wash in the water yeah that hashes down into whatever was on there is in there brilliant always important to keep these clean these will have to be cleaned straight after each bag will take more and more time to drain normally if there's two of you one of them one of you could be cleaning the bags ready for the next run and one of you could be doing this part it take forever forever to drain and the last one just takes [ __ ] time you shake it like that you can get it to come out a little bit quicker but what you don't want to be doing is shaping it through the filter so grab the bike and just give it a little bit of a like that and it will release the water a little bit quicker again remember you've got your trikes in there so don't be too vigorous with it yeah so far we've got about a bombswear all right nothing much to write home about but if you're checking this stuff away you're [ __ ] mad because your bubbles in amsterdam is like 50 60 euros isn't it for the decent stuff so the legs but okay [Music] he's trying to squirt around there so i'm trying to get the hash basis somewhere in the middle so it's just easier for me to pick it up because it's almost like it is like a liquid so you've got to kind of coat it into one area so it's easier for you to obviously pick it up [Music] lovely that's really good that time like i say the hardest thing i think is the backs is it's holding the bags and getting it [Music] right okay so this is the 73 73 yeah so this this is a very very good quality bubble this is like again a few points there right so already probably got about a day's worth of smoke there in there i have a lit a few leaves that somebody would have just chucked away and just just probably discarded and not thought anything about i'd say these bags do look really monkey but they're clean they've just got a lot of resin on them from a lot of use basically so that's all i'm saying oh let's just try and scrape it up just again [Music] [Music] um to use okay so already we've got a couple of grades there again we're going to turn the back the other way all the waste any of that resin i couldn't get to and we're going to put it in there again we're just going to wash it so that little bit there goes into the other box this is basic basic bubble hashtags again just give it a little little bit of a shake like that people you know what i'm saying do you know what i'm saying but yeah i won't release this straight away um i will wait obviously a few days [Music] but obviously i'll do some but i will review this i will review it these two will take ages like say it is a long video [Music] like so you don't have to watch the whole video you can watch just up to the process and then turn it off if you wanted to but really if you want to watch the whole process watch the whole video this does need to be done a couple of times and it is tedious it's [ __ ] tedious yeah well i'd say if there's two of you it makes the job a lot easier for the drainage the draining is draining it is draining [Music] so yeah peace one love bubble hash tutorial by justin from justin's world 101 i'm sure a lot of you have done this [Music] i will show you with the machine the next time but i just wanted it just it's important to show people that you know it can be done on a real [ __ ] budget and you don't need anything but a set of bags which will cost you next to nothing off amazon you go on all of them these ones weren't particularly expensive and i've got them i don't think they're much more now [Music] yeah because they're older bags as well they don't drain very well but they do produce some [ __ ] fantastic bubble hash you need to dry obviously the hash will need to dry um a few things you can do with it you can keep it in its individual piles and smoke it as a 90 or 73 or a 45 or what you can do is you combine it all together um most people will microplane that which is basically um they'll just basically um just put it into small little bits by cleaning it off basically i don't i leave it in a little pack and smoke it like that personally but say you want to [Music] i'm hoping there's some [ __ ] gold in this one [Music] obviously if the camera does cut off it's just because the video's gone as long as it can go but hopefully you do get an idea if it does cut off i'm hoping it doesn't i have cleared it the best i can i just didn't expect these bags to be taken so long to flip and drain it's important to do this as quick as possible because you don't want the water to get cold [Music] come on [Music] yeah we chill we chill we're making hash this is what we're doing today it's just a chill out nothing serious a little bit different than what normally do i just want to show you that i have more skills to be just smoking the stuff i can actually generally produce really really good hashish i can cook with it quite well i'm not just a smoker not just a pretty face [Music] okay so that's quite a good way to force down [Music] it's got a nice green color to it really green color this is why again i think the most of my was in the 73 bag so far by the look of it's it clearing now so we're just getting to see what it is yeah these bags aren't healthy because they're so old obviously if you've got newer ones they would probably train a lot quicker okay that's looking good just trying to coax that water right there so i can pick it up a little bit easier like i said it's very very tedious when i show you the machine way of doing it you'll be like oh my god i need to get machines but different quality different quality people that looks quite nicer [Music] so [Music] so it's a beautiful beautiful beautiful bernard alright so there's our little bit there as you can see there's a bit of moisture in it because we put it on the screen okay not the easiest i've got to be honest being bags of [ __ ] but they are producing some really really good quality yeah make it make yourself get i'd say probably get the i don't know the bigger bags with machines but if you're on a real budget and you just haven't got a lot of money and you just want to just produce just a little bit of hash and not chuck stuff away this is the way to do it but set yourself a day for it you're not just going to be able to just do it in an hour you need to um do not say it okay so right i'll turn it right that way bags are disgusting i'm going away i'm sorry don't say they're [ __ ] old that's gone that way right peach so we've got a little bit of everything is our last bag this is the [ __ ] i say i'll do the second one and keep it running as long as i can these will have to be washy you will have to bear with me [Music] people scrappy [Applause] so yeah a long long time draining but so far we've got a little bit of hash you know we've got another half day smoking just there nice little evening smoke now i guess just sat there just from a little bit of trim and i said people throw this away it's pretty easy i'm just trying to break the water a little bit as you can see that's the level that's coming out and i've got a bat this bag is full so it might take a while [Music] so the other bags i've got they do drain in about half of the time so a lot easier don't worry what you're doing it [ __ ] takes time [Music] well peace one love the general message goes out there a lot of bonus view i'm [ __ ] dying for a pipeline [Music] scrapping you're not famous [Music] oh man [Music] you'll see how much easier it is when i do the other video but it's still important to show you guys strapping shut up i'm famous about you she's gonna get it does she know everyone's [ __ ] out she pushing away [Music] crappy i'm gonna bring you in a minute a lot of their tripods would be kind of really sort of broken off and broken in half they reckon that this is the one for the cooking i don't know i've always liked smoking it personally they say a lot of people just use this particular bag for cooking but in each of the room that is just not draining just so i like this piece i wish i could set it in such a way it would [ __ ] drain [Music] it no he can't can he do it yes he can yes you can you can do it yeah i come on dress you're a [ __ ] stroke of course you can do it how are you gonna [ __ ] like it if you went either you did seriously see what i'm dealing i'm fighting with myself here i thought it's going to be clever there i don't like the bomb with one hand and smoke it at the same time i'm sure it can be done [Music] come on [Music] well there you go people you've seen me make your bubble ash you know we have got some so just to show you there all right [Music] really pleased because that's just the first run and this is why it's so tedious because again if you think you'll get double that then yeah you've got like probably a couple of days worth of smoke but nice quality smoke as well stop smoking flour for a day or two chew them in and have a bit of bubble ash try and force the water out a little bit but do it gently i don't want anything coming over the top i want all of it to stay in the bag the problem with this taking long as everything is getting warm and that's not good the quicker you can do the process the better this one is taking forever i think when i do the other one i'll put this back in but i'll probably cut it while i go to do this bag because i don't want to show you me doing this back twice but i'll show you what i can produce we need to go again yeah we need to go again so i'd say sit back relax like i said at the beginning of this it's going to be a long video so it's fifth time long time chill out [Music] time [Music] come on you little bugger thanks for having me yeah this bag's definitely [ __ ] at it but i guarantee you it will still produce there will still be hash in this bag there will still be gold at the bottom of this bag 100 [Music] so [Music] just waiting for [ __ ] paints joy here okay look at that oh guys satay yes [Music] an hour later we're still [ __ ] draining [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] peace [Music] [Applause] [ __ ] [Music] we're getting out of people what's going on [Music] [Applause] oh yes oh yes come on come on squeeze a bit more [Music] [Applause] don't you start that there's no quick and easy way of doing this video it really isn't not when you've got a box [Music] right come on [Music] right now this last bit breaks it out again rates it down today [Music] [Applause] what the [ __ ] are you singing [Applause] [Music] [Applause] there might be a wee bit of gold in here that's the latest [ __ ] better be after this coat i'll tell you what [Music] oh my squeeze it again just [Music] so [Music] [ __ ] it out people i'm definitely not going to show you this bag again i will pull it but i'm not gonna i'm not gonna put it on camera again is do we want to play it yet to stop [ __ ] my music happy [ __ ] i know i've taken [ __ ] things [Music] well that's it let's have some fancy music to go there i'm bouncing back to convention it's fun it's fun making hash in your phone living room with your cats your cats your cats making hats [Music] hashtag oh yeah [Music] so [Music] so yes people [Music] just known as [ __ ] bubble bags player wants to send me a new set of bubble bags by all means [Music] come on just the last bit just get the last bit out man [Music] [ __ ] where it is [Music] [Music] [Music] okay okay we have actually got somewhere the hardest thing again is it's just dealing with these bags because they're not the easiest bags to deal with [Music] very very very very watery look at this you might just have to add a little bit more than three just to get it into position [Music] so [Music] so [Music] do [Music] then a little bit more through that one but we'll press it out [Music] we've literally got a little bit of everything there okay so first runner there we've got uh a little bit there next bet we got the 73 which was there uh 45 i think it was and then the 25 which i've just pressed there as you can see so why isn't it it's not bad it's not bad is it people but that's one run now basically what you have to do then is you have to repeat the process again so you have to get your ice batch your ice your material um that gets chucked away so believe it or not some people drink it i wouldn't but on the other farm i'm not going to do the rest of it because this doesn't our day but i think you can see quite clearly i'm going to obviously repeat the process and i'm going to roughly get double at just that little bit of trim it needs to dry but that is fantastic bubble hash none of it is full out i wanted to get a better form out of it there's no fallout in there um it might just be the quality of those backstages they're so [ __ ] holes which is why that last one um it just took so long to drain because it's just like it's all blocked up basically um i wasn't going to use them again but i've still produced that out of old old crappy bags which weren't going to get used again so um bags are expensive they're about 20 bucks um they're not a lot of money at all so you get you know get yourself some bags for about 20 bucks a bag of ice or some ice cube trays and you're away and that's what you did cut the buckets a spoon and just a bit of [ __ ] will and a little bit of will which i'm saying uh you have to have a little bit of patience a little bit of time um don't expect to produce bars of actually not gonna you're gonna you're gonna produce a couple of nice pictures quotes yourself if you've got a little bit shrimp if you've got a bit more australia then you can produce a lot but you need a lot of trim to produce a big block of bastion so there is probably when it's dry that's probably about a gram i would say um probably no more than a gram maybe maybe maybe a gram and a half um when i do the other i'll get another gram out of that so there'll be a couple of grams there there's nothing to write about but it's quality cheers people [Music] nice you know what i will continue video you gonna watch these bear with me people they're women might as well leave it running people don't want to watch it they can turn it off yes yes peeps show the princess [Music] hey [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so get a draw as a toy for christmas [Music] channel all right we're left so i've been washing so we've got we've got obviously that there oh there we go just right we need to get a little bit more ice and trim we'll not trim i might put a hammer actually just a good feature i [Music] just put the rest of that trim in there because it wasn't enough to do a run i shouldn't just put it all in together but nevermind but it was only a little bit so we're setting up again so here we go again so more ice you don't have to add you're not meant to add fresh trim to it it's just because i have just literally a bit there which is just not even worth doing a run with so i might as well just stick it into the end of this and see if we can get something out of there uh this all these need to go back in the fridge or should have gone back in the fridge that's what you need to feed for [Music] all right so yeah like i said it was gonna be a long one the video will probably cut off so if it does um that's the reason why it's just not as far as it can go did you get this frozen water in [Music] as here as possible thank you very much let's say some people do this three times but you can see from the material i'm getting here i'm not getting a huge amount from there two rows on this [Laughter] [Music] yeah well big tight giant chunks basically but yeah a little bit more in there are we still recording oh [ __ ] me we are as well one hour nine minutes [Music] oh we need a [ __ ] smoke that's what we need so as i said you you need a day for this i think some of you will probably laugh there and you're probably going to do it after time but when you're using this equipment [Music] it takes a little bit more time machine weight um i would say the reason why i'm not putting full mount out there if the the quality of the material and the quality of the bags again we just let that all get to the nice temperature lovely and then we're going to repeat the process basically but before we do that i'm gonna have a [ __ ] break and i'm gonna have a [ __ ] point with that by all means like i said this video will probably stop at some point because just [Music] the ones on my camera don't tend to last any more than about an hour and we put into that already so but [ __ ] it i'll show you as long as it's rolling like i said loads of you will be doing there so you'll know your own methods you'll know that methods you'll be telling me this is the better way of doing it that's a better way of doing it it's just like it's a personal thing really what i would say is um i haven't done this for a long time it's like riding a bike you'd never you never forget but it's like anything i'm a little bit resting i'm a little bit rescued on learning on how to go up and down the views of a minute but like so you know you never forget most of it is learning how to handle the bags and the spoons to be able to scrape the resin out but from one run i wouldn't really say that's bad about the little bit of material i was using there yeah so if you on a budget and sat there with no [ __ ] smoke yeah you've got the money yeah produce your own morning just put just just keep your trim and produce your own like so you're only going to get a smaller weight there there but it's nice quality and it'll be nice and clean and that's bubble hash basically 101 that is your bubble hush cheers people [Music] that one up yeah load up for when you want you want it in a minute just that's when he was gonna roll a second ago i will not put people through that again that's [ __ ] that kill me painful cheers there so we will continue i'm just going to set this aside a little bit because i don't want to get any water on that again we carry on with my um stir in 10 minutes to give it 10 12 minutes 13 to 23 23. like i said if there's two of you doing this it's [ __ ] easy so me and ninjas made this in the past and with the tour but that's what i'm saying one of us is cleaning the bags ready one of the straight thing and then you you reverse rolls there and then somebody else does for bet somebody else cleans the back [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] we really look forward to smoking this and i'm looking forward and i'll review it as well i'll review it i'll probably put it all together as this all up there i'll probably just put smash it all together i will say we'll say we might just peel it off one by one and just [ __ ] smoke it oh excuse me [Music] long and tedious job it's worth it and when you can see that you could just produce a little bit of really good quality i mean when i say you you can get a coffee shop in amsterdam on the menu bubble lashes anywhere from like 40 40 50 almost um it's not cheap because of the effort it takes to obviously produce it so it's really really good quality it's very very strong it's a lot stronger than power obviously as you'd expect um it's not your typical you know like your poles and stuff like that it's really about six to seven percent or whatever they are not a lot this this is going to be quite high i think it's probably probably up to 60 percent maybe i don't know i don't know it'll be high anyway it will be high somebody out there will probably be able to tell me exactly but obviously the trade depends on the trend like i said it's tracking three different plans now this tutorial then i'll do it with the big machine let's say i'll do that so i'm saying your [ __ ] arms lovely color though lovely lovely lovely color [Laughter] i always recommend i'll be a regular it's a little bit [ __ ] chilled you need to be tailgate this one certainly going to need a [ __ ] uh a few smokes after this oh man yes the arm's [ __ ] don't stick it's not true i'm saying it's not to the end now [Music] [Music] he's struggling man he's struggling i thought you're [ __ ] kissing yourself [Applause] [Laughter] [Laughter] [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] i know you laughed [Laughter] good [Laughter] [Applause] ah have a great have a [ __ ] kitkat well there's a little point in there [Laughter] [Applause] [ __ ] [Laughter] so [Music] [Music] [Music] needles against that [ __ ] stage definitely easier than when there's two of you got to say it is a one-man job but it is a tough one man job like say the two of you then it just makes it [ __ ] a lot easier because it's just a few fiddling bits like like cleaning the bags and stuff like that they do need to be cleaned because the resin will just stick to it which is quite basic why a lot of them don't feel today because they've just been used so much [Applause] looking at a very very nice green color again it's got that really nice color like i want it to [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] yeah let's have a look what are we looking at time [ __ ] 23 so that's exactly 10 minutes from what i said but i did have a bomb so let's just do it for another minute yeah don't even know what this song is i mean what it reminds you of enchanted forester london [Laughter] [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] yes one last little spin with the left hand jab just with the left hand just to ease the right actually you can do this a bit longer like 10-12 minutes i'm going for some people do it for about 15 it just depends i think that's too long for a snake [Applause] so so [Music] okay right so set that aside again you can do it third time i ain't gonna oh oh you do it that's it there because i'm [ __ ] um pull that in there again all right again you have that do that third time if you want if you want and all we're going to do is repeat the process we get another spoon which has been in the freezer they just tend to work the best so frozen spoon i know it doesn't stay frozen for very long but every little alps as hasta says yeah so let's get our stuff back over here so just wipe that little bit of ice off that because we don't want that we just want the spoon to be cold basically it's all over just okay so all right so we've got our code spoon [Music] so [Music] [Music] jess [Music] lost it all [Music] well anyway [Music] so smaller length hardly anything there [Music] as always [Music] doesn't look like there's much in this second run compared to the first so probably because of the grade of the material it was just sort of a little bit least just a like really really really like small small place but like nothing's right over bait so i think i probably got most of that this tends to produce the best this bag here [Music] but you can certainly see that it's not worth doing a third one [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] ah [Music] oh [Music] [Music] success again nothing compared to the other back um [Music] nothing compared to the other bag but it's still worth running a second time just making a mess name just let's just turn that and get any other one [Music] yeah i think definitely the first one was really good um second one not too good but if you use better material you'll get usually i get a better relative seconds but that's normally where the bear grades a lot of sort of popcorn flowers and stuff like that not just not just um not just leaves really which that was very leafy all that trim was very leafy it was um it was just basic trim but it's fine thank you for that i do appreciate that so i do appreciate that little bit of trip it's obviously allowed me to make a little bit of hash [Music] foreign [Music] so i hope you enjoyed this um this little video um i've not made it all up for a while so but it just shows you it's not hard it's not a hard thing to do but it's time consuming yeah it's time-consuming so you've got to make sure that you're in number one you're in a chill right now because if you're in a bad [ __ ] mood you ain't going to be wanting to do this you've got to be in a good chill-late place you know i mean yourself nice cup of tea cup of coffee coke whatever and just settle down for today and just relax with it and enjoy the process of what you're actually doing you know you're washing tricones off plant material producing very very very very good quality oh is [Music] this is lovelier mate now that is worth getting up to the camera to show you everything else hasn't so out of the 45 bag [Applause] um we've still produced a nice little ball of bubble hash again cut the spokes there two or three spokes out of that so try to keep the qualities together but it's all gonna get mixed up and smoke anyways [Music] [Music] um and then generally scrape it off and let it dry and we can let it dry on there and scrape off whatever really best we do is take it off i think uh but i just i have left on there i just [ __ ] picked from there basically but depends on what you've got again i'm not going to get that [Music] [Music] all right so basically washed all of that in there another last pack man are you going to stay with me for the last bag this is going to take a [ __ ] while boy [Music] [ __ ] it you're with me aren't you [Music] maybe there is chest maybe if you just get rid of that little bit of water i haven't actually made that much mess like so i would recommend to take it to the seat yeah do it do it every single [Music] let's try and squeeze out let's just try to try and squeeze out the last one [Music] try and get a little bit more i mean [Music] like so my new one will just clear like whoosh um but this is how i started this is how i learned was this with this method here and this is the method i thought was important to show i don't think there's that much i like to say i think something's that bubble man's world is bad i've not seen many people do bubble hash videos so um thank that chess as well quite a bit she does a tip on the bubble um mendo don't always have watched britain's frenchy kenobi again i've watched all them all their hash videos um so yeah uk wise i don't think there's many people in the uk doing bubble hash videos tutorials so i wanted to be one of you know i wanted to add that to my collection of uh reviews and things with bits and pieces i think it's really really important really really important that you know you show all the parts as a plant and the waste parts of the plant as well could be used to produce you know a couple of days worth of [ __ ] fantastic quality smoker you know for me it's a couple days for some of you that might last you like a couple of weeks depending on how much you smoke um you know you're gonna not gonna need much of that in a joint to be there certainly if you smoke it lightly on the pipe um you you're gonna feel it straight away it's very strong it's very strong it's nice again if you make it with like sativa again just like the flower it'll be more uplifting but stronger uplifting it's a lot lot stronger than flour like we say is different strength everyone loves a bit of bubble hash everyone loves a bit of bubble rash just people don't like making it i've got my maker there i've just like said i've got to be in the right frame of mind i can't be anxious if my anxiety is there or anything then it's going to be no good i need to pick a day where i can just do it properly really oh this bag is just a nightmare i said i was going to do this but [ __ ] it i'm going to do the whole process if you just i just didn't realize it would gonna turn into a two-hour video so apologies to everyone out there but i did say at the very very start of the video this wasn't gonna be a quick [Music] one so that seems to be forced out a little bit more but not a lot it is a slow process but as these bags get warmer it's less easier to work with which is why it was all coming out like liquid last time and i just just i've got it but i didn't get a very good blob of it like i did the others [Music] if anyone knows of any other uses to do with the water um once once you i mean i check it away i've seen people drink it um i've seen a couple in america they always drink a cup of it um it's bizarre because it just yeah it's not not for me really not for me it's a very strong taste i have tasted it but no i don't know if maybe too much of that would make your stomach bad i don't know really or is it good tell me that do you drink your bubble gum last juice when are you finished with it what do you do with that i said i just chuck it away [Music] [Music] is [Music] it does go quicker as a bank set like obviously you want to keep the trichomes in the same sort of place so you don't want to bounce it up all the sides of the back wonder if it's going to produce anything like the other one probably not but we've done the full tutorial people you've seen what i've done with a literally a bag of leaves yeah a bag of leaves people it was not you know there was nothing great in there there was no certainly no big pothole but it was just really really basic trends [Music] so [Music] we're getting there it's still slow it is still like [ __ ] painful yeah i'm really pleased i really think um i'll say i would do more if i can get older anymore i'm not talking about [Music] trim uh will be weighed as it is basically so i'm safety point of view i don't want stuff like that hanging around so it's good just to get here and make the video with it today we picked it up last night like four it was and um yeah so and now we've made this i can see the light at the end of the channel [Music] again because this has got warm it's sticking to the the film a little bit it's the last bag again plays a big part in it it's not that warm in here but it is warm because i've got the lights on and stuff like that [Music] so did not expect it to be a two-hour video i've seen people do bubble hashing like jab jars and stuff though so there is other methods of extraction it just looks like liquid isn't it come on [Music] [Music] so wow there's a wee bit of ghost in that people [Music] [Music] again very watery like the other bit [Music] but that will press that will press and it'll be fine [Music] so [Music] so [Music] not the easiest [Music] yeah so basically i would say that's pretty much it one last straight get on the spoon [Music] so it's got a little bit on the spoon there again wait stop what not that is the bubble hash tuition over so we've got a couple of really really nice [ __ ] spoons there towards the uh scrape off and we've got all of this all of this really nice material i'm not gonna pick it up because you've seen it uh but it's a good amount in fact let's pick it up just put out there put that spoon into there let's show you so [Music] so lots and lots of different grades of bubble hash as you can see all right so we've got like say the lighter colored ones come around that way you can see the lighter color ones there but yeah i mean it looks a mess but trust me all of that is [ __ ] goodness all right you could do it a lot prettier a lot nicer normally i'd be a lot neater that looks really good that one there um yeah you can do it a lot neater [Music] but that's like say the more you do it the better you get at it and um i haven't done it for a long time so i'd say this is almost like a kind of a practice run from a couple years ago really um but yeah peace one love i [ __ ] really hope you enjoyed that because i'm gonna be honest with you that was quite an effort to do that on camera on my own without any help so i'm pretty proud that i've managed to do that and actually produce some fantastic bubble hash these spoons gonna be fantastic um yeah normally i'd stick them in a cup of tea very very boiling hot water i'll make pepsi out of them yeah i'm pleased with that it's very very good i'd say it's um best part of two grand there i would say maybe two maybe three grand nothing to whatever bank certainly nothing to get in trouble mates all right so i'm happy with that i'm happy with that small amount and i'm certainly going to enjoy smoking it with you guys and sharing the experience of what i actually taste like that cheers people by all means join me for this last one cheers people so peaceful now i'll come to you now peaceful love thank you for watching and uh like i said i hope you really got something from that if not i've got a laugh all right so peaceful love see you in a bit have a good day y'all cheers", "tCPUiFAy6XU": "[Music] sarah what are you going to talk about today [Music] oh hi welcome back listen today i had to actually change into my boots to do this show because what we're doing is a little bit messy we're going to make some bubble hash and i'm sure you all have heard of it it's called bubble hash because of the way that it's made and that's the name that he gave the bags anyhow there are a series of bags with real sturdy fabric on the outside and and the bottom there's a micron screen and they go this the gauge of the micron screen goes from very coarse to very very fine and what you do is you put the buckets i mean the bags into the buckets um to the smallest size first and smooth them out as well as possible so that they're all fitting in with a snug fit now uh we have to fill it and fill in water up past the seam of the bucket there's a large seam at the bottom of the bags where the fabric connects to the micron material so you have to put your water fill the water in up above that seam if you don't the plant matter will get stuck in among it and cause a problem the bubble hash is very interesting the the principle on which it works is that you freeze the organic material meaning the the the um leaf and trim that's been really finely ground up and when you freeze it your trichromes get real stiff and hard and brittle and then you put it in this bucket with the ice like we're going to show you in just a second here but you you put in the water first and then you measure out the um the amount of pots that you use you know the it can vary you don't want to use so much that it's so crowded the trichromes are unable to move around and get bumped off and then we take the little ice tray and we dump most of this ice is going to go in this bucket this is so now we put in all of our ice and then on top of that we added more water so it's kind of like a big slurry remember we're going to have the ice cubes beading around against the uh the plant particles and knocking those trichomes off but just use a regular drill put the paint attachment on it and then you're going to mix it up for like 15 minutes but anyhow you don't want to beat it too hard because if you do it breaks down the plant matter and you get too much plant material in your hash you want to kind of just keep it keep those cubes just beating around off of the hitting on the trichomes and bouncing off and knocking those little pipelines off because that's essentially what we're doing is collecting the cry chromes knocking them off and then they're going to be floating around in this ice water ice water bath and until we start pulling the screens and then we'll pull them out and they're different varying sizes depending upon the kind of pot it is the indicas trichrones have those little fat heads that kind of look like little martians maybe and the sativas are much have much skinnier heads okay now we have to let it sit for i know 20 to 30 minutes we're back it's been 30 minutes so we're going to pull start pulling the baths and this first bag remember i said was the coarsest micron material and so what's going to stay in here is just the plant material you know the all the leaf and everything that you've extracted you usually you'll dump the plant material into something else and immediately you want to wash out your bags because you don't want anything to get into the seams or anything so wash them out right away and then you can come back and you pull out your second bag the second bag isn't going to be too much of anything so anyhow when you get it to form uh into a ball like that you just reach in and and scrape out the little ball and like i said the second bag of hash is probably going to not be too much either you know it'll be mostly like hair or dirt or something but go ahead and just take it out and set it aside and in the third bag and this is your called 120 bag and this is where you're going to first see your indica the indica trichromes have those fat heads on them and they'll get caught up right away this one is a much much better quality than the the first bag that we pulled out you can see and it looks a little bit green now but as it dries it'll lose a lot of that green color and you just keep bouncing it around picking it up and twirling it and what you're trying to do is get the the hash to come i together it's about the same size as the one before it they're can you see these little um knobs here okay one more down and two more to go these are the finest ones and like i said the slowest one so i usually just gather them up at the top and and kind of give them a good little shake this looks like it's smaller which probably makes sense it's a bit smaller than the other two because it's like i said we're getting more into the sativas that do it a couple times tiny tiny little sativa trichrome see there's hardly anything there at all yes and not much achiever in this boat i'd say and then before you know it you'll be able to smoke it kiss your plants talk is mine bye thanks for watching we'll see you next time", "7G0UwpLWF8g": "welcome back everybody another beautiful day here with the dr. calico structure is in the house welcome back to my channel you guys so today I wanted to do an unboxing video of this we've got our hash bags came in the mail today we order them from melon farms everyone that's where we got them from so I wanted to just do a quick review on what I think about the quality and what they're really about and see what they're gonna do for us cuz I of course you guys you know I enjoy my hash and my flour those are my two main things that I enjoy out of growing every single season that I look forward towards my my trimmings and my all the good stuff we have left over from our cannabis that we invest since I am an outdoor drawer there's much appreciation and dedication put into this process but we'll see you let's get down to business you guys and go through it all right Wow you guys the material seems really really really good I would definitely have to say that this material really really thick sturdy these ain't gonna rip easily I guarantee that so I'm saying these bags right here I have to raid them 10 out of 10 the guys even our screens down here really really thick it's not low quality material and for the price of these bags right here I would definitely definitely have to say that they're well worth it these are by mellon farms you guys that's where the what company makes this these bags and definitely I'm gonna have to say these bags right here totally worth it these are five gallon bags here and it looks like they're gonna really do the job excellent I've been meaning to get me some good bags haven't had a hash bags in years you guys but wow this this material right here you guys good quality material for sure it's gonna get the job done let's see what else comes in this packet here see okay we got instruction today's okay the original bubble bag system that's what they're calling this our four shoe eight layers of industrial grade filtration which will allow you to extract the essential oils from almost any plant Wow let's see let's go down to instructions they don't seem too complicated this is for my viewers this purposes because obviously I've been making hash for a couple of years now but let's give you the rundown line the bucket where your bubble back starting with the 25 micron bag and ending with the 220 my Chrome bag step1 you guys step to fill the bucket with enough cold water to cover the the bottom of the bubble bags about halfway full okay number three as you're dry or frozen plant trimmings alright step four add enough ice to almost fill your bucket to the top step five stir your mix for fifteen to twenty minutes adding ice if necessary to keep the water cold at a 50/50 mix of ice and water is ideal step 6 pull out your bubble bags one by one draining them into the bucket step 7 as you pull each bubble bag turn the inside out after it has finished draining to collect your herbal extract damn we're really gonna extract like this huh Hey okay step eight you guys gently press the excess moisture out of the herbal extract using your pressing screen and a dish towel and they have a low link here where you can go to their website and probably see some physical videos I am gonna be doing a physical video of this once we get along to that process right now we are in the vegetable state of these outdoor plants here and I definitely have to say there's nothing like growing your own your own cannabis and your own plants your own food for for your home and your own medicine so that that's what my channel is all about you guys me growing me showing you tips I'm gonna be taking you along my the process that I go through I'm not a professional but I do have a couple years on me that I have achieved some of my goals throughout a compliment accomplishments and failures but there's nothing like keep on growing you guys and that's what my channel is all about making organic manner materials that you can use for your plants herb recites for the mosquitos and for a whole bunch of type of different varieties that I'ma be incorporating into this channel you guys there's just my basic group procedures that I go through and I'm gonna show you guys a little bit here of what I do here at the dr. Cali Kush gardens remember top shelf fire organics organic fire that's what the links and put it in the description for you guys to see this is just a little plant here that we left out of the net and the mosquitoes did get to it besides mosquitoes I know mosquitoes don't really affect it but we have a whole bunch of other bugs coming along here and through the process trying to eat it up and it just causes bacteria so this one I left it out here as an example of one of my harbors sites that I create here and dr. Cali Kush garden to show our buddy but we're gonna show you a little bit healthier products over here okay you guys some of the pride and Joy's here of the dr.

gave him the vape pen about a second ago so today we are here to talk about how to make bubble hash as you can tell we are in the lab which is a lot of fun so we're gonna we're gonna get right into it but I have the wrong thing up it's okay but we are here to every week we take different cannabis cannabis topics and we here to learn and educate ourselves so we can have a well-balanced understanding about cannabis and chemist products exactly so we take a new topic every week we talk about a little bit of history business science some have you can see we get into some duel yourself stuff which is - today did you say yesterday I think you say history is a big thing about it and we could I mean so naturally this is a political movement exactly so we get into a pinch of politics we want to be pinching but it isn't and like Jen said earlier we do have a lot to get into but please follow us like us share us subscribe to us subscribe to us on Facebook and Instagram we rg3 cannabis therapy network.org same name for the Facebook and Instagram and also honey honey exactly just one word bunny wunny g3 cannabis therapy Network okay so let's get right into it let's go into the nug news that is brought to us by tickety-tack tickety-tack which is going to be the first therapeutic journal app where you can actually journal how cannabis and cannabis products yep affection exactly by tracking an information you can better make you can make better recommendations and also better selections next time you go into a dispensary or if it's homeboy from from v flow you say hey man I want stuff you guys may may be a little sleepy you have something that's more uplifting exactly what you can journal it so that's the tickety app.com tickety up calm and it should be dropping on 4/20 yes yes and you can get the insight if you go there to the website yep right now and actually putting your email address you'd be one of the first people to actually get to try out that exactly so that'd be cool it'll look cool I got a cool story and Cristina's gonna post these into the comments for us cuz she's awesome but it's you you should really read this it's from Forbes it's the nine women shaping the cannabis industry oh yeah so it talks about nine women we're really involved in the cannabis industry and I just thought it was really cool because it is kind of like a more male dominated I think about article explains that only like thirty six percent of the people in the industry are actually female so it's talking about nine of them Wow that's what's up yeah I think I mean women had a very huge impact and even getting the movement going right and then to see that the industry is now becoming more mature and see that women or blacks or bringing poor people no one should be excluded exactly that's what's up that's gonna come forth off your Forks yeah I'll get four magazine you know me I have about thirty articles we're about to I was very proud though I'm very proud he has a lot less than normal my goal is to spend like 30 seconds on article some of them I may get some actually I've already wasted 30 seconds all right so I mean he writes it in Michigan we start in Michigan first groups with more pot arrests may get edge in Michigan legalization industry okay which means so the state of Michigan is actually having work groups for people to actually come and give their input on how they believe the new legal market the adult use market it should actually look okay so we have a chance to actually raise our voice to say that well it shouldn't look just like a white market or a white male market it should be very diverse as the plans that verse there should be women there should be men there should be black brown paint purple everybody should be included right it should be no barriers that excludes people so that's pretty cool but we'll see no snow state programs actually has a successful social equity program yet right which I believe the solution is going to be more towards the people not necessarily looking for legislation but it is important to see where we connect have a seat at the table so that was 30 seconds Michigan watches hip pilot program in time for 2019 growing season this is breaking news that is uh Terry sure we talked about this before yes yeah so we were wondering if we're gonna be able to plant it this year to be able to supply the industry for next year in Michigan right so they're gonna have temporary licenses oh cool yeah so it's gonna be actually read the article on in life there's gonna be some training work group classes okay Lansing or they actually explain the application process oh that's nice which they if you do apply for him license whether you're growing and processing or healing him it's only gonna be like 200 bucks oh that's like way better than for that yeah yeah way better yeah yeah so but the actual license itself I believe is looking like 1,400 like 13 yeah but your application I believe is only like hundred to two hundred that's nice so that's cool so check out that article for more information the congressional Democrats hold first-ever marijuana reform panel at the policy retreat so pretty much at this retreat I wanted this is important because they're discussing how to implement not if there's going to be bad decisions so I like that language the language is now shift to where it's pretty much inevitable mm-hmm that the marijuana is going to be legalized well and we all kind of like felt it though yeah so it's like now the Democrats Republicans in the House and the Senate it's now getting to them that's nice and now they're trying to discuss strategies on how to best implement it hopefully they come on those shady strategies okay we don't need no shady [ __ ] yeah she says come on watch myself Tamra told me to watch my mouth out with soap last time I said they're worried so much I don't know I was in the zone sorry alright next what state financial regulators press Congress to allow marijuana banking access or as following us right now that's got two sets here it's kind of disturbs me a little bit that the first legislative bill that may actually get to the President's desk has to do with banking of course it does I mean I get you know but it's like how about the lives that have been all it's about so it's I mean okay it's moving forward you know people don't want to just deal with cash and dispensaries not address but that's like no that's a side dish the first dish is actually that's reconstruct allies have been [ __ ] up for the past couple years by this live on the war on drugs exactly so I just went from saying [ __ ] to word [ __ ] that's just I was trying to be okay Fox could start pot expungements in a month so pretty much this is Attorney General in Chicago okay okay this is your hometown voice in the noise supremist a County that Chicago is in they're trying to work with the company called cacao was it a Cook County cook come here you guys go to Hobbs go to second I grew up in Cook County did you so cook company they're trying to head working with code of America which they can do algorithms to figure out who is eligible to get expunged well that's cool and it's gonna automatically happen that's good that's what we need yeah there's no like you guys don't have to do anything no you're good County coming in every station follows everything and all the other county shut yes so Cook County is very large and Illinois it encompasses Chicago and a lot of the suburbs so that's nice to see that's what's up Alabama police ruined a couple's lives over $50 a weed now the charges against them have been dropped so pretty much I like to give so many than articles here and there just because we need to understand what this movement is truly about okay this is the silliness that's happening yeah you know in people's lives okay it's 50 bucks they get raided at their house they find 50 bucks and we it found one sleeping pill that was actually a sign to that person and it was just outside the bottle and they but because of asset forfeiture laws they seized their car seize their assets and they're not living in a shed oh my god living in a shed in charge and the Chargers have been drunk and they get none of that bag and this is why we're trying to so this is foremost not about big business small who's making money banking it's all the lives like this that are being ruined because of a lie that marijuana's will make you crazy I ain't crazy I'll just hit the pin before we got it going on okay last cup with a hundred to read the titles and we're gonna be good Massachusetts marijuana industry mostly corporate of white inside Boston battle to change that another thing about social equity also talks about women is a really good article Massachusetts is leading the charge for social equity right don't forget about Massachusetts Medical easy I'm trying to rush don't forget us nasa's massachusetts medical marijuana patients a so pretty much winners recreational programs a lot of people who are looking for medical reason look don't just go straight only records owned and on record you know let's also talk about some medical because there's different swinging wait yeah just like there's different I mean there's over-the-counter medicine and there's medicine you can buy off-the-shelf one drusen one here's an average price for cannabis and each of the Canadian premises just so you know the prices did not fall out though what works you come out six dollars but it's all good alright last thing I'm almost had a record time on my news I was sabotaged by Natalie right now by saying that I was going to finish this okay here's how much marijuana business our pain in taxes there's billions of dollars in taxes being paid by businesses which that money could be used in some a couple different ways but you read the article follow that and that's pretty much that's the nut news know that's kind of like no okay so we're gonna go right into our main topic of how to make bubble hash yes we're gonna get into how to make bubble hash which is getting into our concentrate series here yeah but also in our do-it-yourself series so concentrate use the Apple I think I think you're good for analogy this time you wanna use apple the Apple one yeah so it's basically when you take the Apple and you juice it out the juice of it the concentrate yes and what that means I'm like a technical form a form of a substance which has had the majority of his base components removed right so the juice is has been removed from the base component of the core and the skin and all that stuff that's what's up and then we talked about the history of concentrates um it's been around for years yeah that case over 10,000 years is not nothing new right it wasn't until the 1900 when they started to be marijuana prohibition that some of these forms of medicine or therapy became to be a little bit hard to find mm-hmm you had the 1914 Harrison Act which made drug use a crime we had to 1937 marijuana Tax Act would ban the use of sales of cannabis and hemp and then in 1970 it was scheduled as a Schedule one drug so for 1970 and then it count mm 2018 right then it starts to be medical legalization and adult use legalization which then opened up conversations mm-hm and opened up more access even though it's still limited now conversations are kind of coming back full circle okay about concentrates right and then cool and that what's leads me to now like why would people use bubble hash mm-hmm and kind of the whole purpose of this show we're talking about using canvas in a therapeutic point of view so if you are looking to sleep if you're looking to get relief yep what about moods with the different types of canvas yeah so if you're looking up maybe you have anxiety or I'm just real at or calm down or I made me feel sad you kind of feel uplifted right um so there's different kinds of cannabis that can help you in a therapeutic way achieve a certain mood and a certain effect mm-hmm for those who are suffering from different conditions or just have conditions or systems whatever it right so that's where bubble hash and that's where cannabis kind of comes into play cool cool all right now we're going to talk about actually how or what is bubble has so now when you're trying to bubble hash for campus therapy I was because canvas I mean once you do decide say okay I'm can't sleep right right and I want to take pills you want to drink alcohol or maybe you don't want to take some kind of pharmaceutical narcotic or right opioid looking for more of a natural solution so then you start going but it's just like met cannabis can get kind of complex it can they're in there so many different times like how do I consume it what kind should I consume what's best for me what works for me yeah this is like once you get through the types and then it's like okay so many different ways if we're like different products so we're trying to help you have a proper understanding about boba has or take a one product one form and we're gonna talk about how to consume that product so we can have a well-balanced understanding about bubble hash so what is bubble bubble hash is a concentrate made by getting dried and cured bud very cold yes it is and passing plant material through progressively smaller screens yes it is until all that's left are the trichomes so in other words a way that I would explain that would be we're knocking off the dam trichomes with some Kodak's ice yeah then we're gonna take that and put it to a screen and we're gonna scrape that and that was since your bubble bubble has and we talk like that you talk about there's three different trichrome mhm but you're getting all those trichomes and that's what we're gonna try to collect today so right now we want to get into how to actually make you whoohoo you're ready to make it yep ready for this I'm ready alright so I know this nice girl loves me so he brought me a chair so we talked about taking product okay it does get a little sticky cannabis resin it's okay I dunno well as she figures out the gloves we're gonna edit that out because we're gonna be able to repost this it's all good so this is actually I took about a half pound of material and I put it inside this bag so if you don't have a bag like this you can put this instead of a t-shirt and pretty much you're gonna submerge this product inside of cold water and I have a machine here that helped me do that otherwise you could actually put this same material in a bucket and you're just going to be agitating it for 15-20 minutes to keep moving and moving on it and what you're doing is with the ice and the water you're just freezing those trichomes and they're gonna knock off the plant they're gonna knock off the leaf right and then once that happens we want to scrape that up and that's how we're gonna get our bubble hat so I already pre ran this machine from 15 minutes before we started because otherwise you know it's really loud yeah so we're going to start with the pouring process and actually recovery process so what I'm going to do is try save my iPad and then so what he has here are the different bags and he has the smallest filter the bag at the bottom and then he layers him up and we'll be pulling those out yes thank you for bringing that up so I have five different bags needs a call bubble bags this is from bubble bag dude that's a co bubble bag but you can find these bags on Amazon to call bubble bags they usually comes in fives but you wanna put the smallest and come in numbers like this one says to 21 says 175 one says 73 one centi five you won't go with the smallest one first and then the biggest one on top yep and you're gonna see why cuz as we're gonna kind of take these off so happens so I'm going to take my water and I'm gonna trade it uh uh uh I was really so he said he was gonna do this earlier and he's like oh I'll just do it over here and I thought he was honestly gonna like pour that and I didn't know what was gonna happen if this is like a baby Packer so if you can see just how dark that is do you think that's in a camera shop yeah yeah so this is Clearwater and all its kind of fun muddy brown those are all those trichomes we're trying to recover all in that water and it'll get caught in the screen all right sorry about that all right cool all right so all right so the first one here thank you save iPad we're gonna take the first one and see it's kind of caught in that screen right and we're gonna take it and we're gonna put it over the bucket perfect spread kind of get a little visual here so as you can see it kind of caught someone materia mm-hmm now the first bag is usually the bag that will we scrape up will be used for like edibles okay I'm gonna do one and then after this we can kind of taxi yeah we're gonna feel them Donna so then while it was a spoon to kind of scrape it up and another trick would be say there's a lot on the edges here I could take a cup of water and I can kind of Oh what you get it all into the middle yeah yeah so this is actually the first one caught a lot of leaf matter it's all good cuz this is what we use and as we keep going down the line it's gonna get better and better so this is the first one we and I usually would do about two runs two or three runs okay I'd like the same again same process so I'm gonna take that bucket you can you can put it in there and then I'll pull it over and see if I can do it anyone can do it [Applause] I'll make bubble hash here and again we is what we have different screens is that the fire the screen the fire no quality of the material is so you'll see this one is a little thinner than the blue and so you don't see as much of that plant material in it so now what you're gonna do is take a spoon and you're just gonna scrape that up I know you gave me the good what we're putting this on to is I have this a cheesecloth and it's laying on top of parchment paper I just do that cuz the parchment paper is nonstick and the cheesecloth because this is still wet it's gonna allow it to actually dry out a little bit before we actually get to Instagram is a trouper they're the best that's like our most loyal fan base and this is the first run usually again when you do about two runs on this so even if you don't get everything out of that screen actually give you he gave me this to start with and then when I used it as the first one [Applause] [Applause] [Music] now usually I mean I'm using more than one bucket because I was trying to help speed it up well usually I can use the same bucket or just one bucket but this one right here is the most finest all right look like I'm struggling doing this no I'm struggling you're all makes it look really easy it's not the easiest but I would say it's really not that hard it is just getting that bucket there we go look at that now this is going to be the most famous one now you see what this one is Stillwater oh that's because it's taking a very long time for this to drain because it's so fine this is really really really top fine quality smoke once you're finished so cool I'm gonna let that one go and then as that goes it's like he's making cereal in here all right cool good boom I try to keep it in order so I'm good so what we have right now for our bubble hash is that what I would not make take right here is our scoop this onto the parchment paper and then I'm gonna break it up okay I'm gonna break it up because it helps you dry mmm that makes sense and this right here is actually nine pound hammer is the true material that we use to make this bubble hash so after that what I will do is let this dry in the cool dark place okay for about 24 hours and then after that I will actually jar it up and then I will burp it what a cop Curie okay cure for another week where everyday for about a half hour I open that jar okay I'm in let it dry out so for 24 hours you have first let it dry out in a dark spot and then you put that into like a mason jar and then you open that mason jar about once a day for about okay a half hour and that's gonna just slowly release by the moisture I would still retain a lot of the terpenes flavor noise and cannabinoids cool and that's bubble hash that's bubble hash that's pretty simple that is pretty easy I know you probably that wasn't the worst but I have to say like so we made dry sift on last week's episode and I don't know if you guys could tell but I was like I was crying and then I took that home and I couldn't even finish making it because I was sneezing so much you know from everything in the air but like I haven't sneezed and I actually feel good but this OH so I think I would prefer making this even though it's a little more of a struggle and you need a little bit more you know materials for it um I'm like alive and I'm not dying and what we use so this is called we check out the other episode which was concentrates one on one yeah episode 17 yeah but we actually wanted two different types of concentrates checked it out but this is what it's called a non solvent concentrate meaning we're not using gases not using butane in o2 co2 pill propane nothing like that or get any kind of gags just use water right use ice and water and what we did was just freeze the trichomes knock them off and then strain that water through a filter which was the different bubble bags and we have three different kinds great above hatch so I mean these are going to come out really really nice this stuff right here I just used for edibles but anyhow yeah I wouldn't do there you go Instagram yeah so this was the largest filter down to the smallest yeah you see it's a lot of plant material either got it so I would actually throw this back into the bucket okay and just redo it cuz that plant material got through that definite gonna be good cool that's bubble so we're gonna talk about some different ways to consume it yeah yeah so once this dries up how does typically would be it would dry up in a way like this so it's nice and chunky and hard you see some light pieces see some dark pieces because of different grades mm-hmm what I'll do is that dismission I was gonna ask you just mix them all up some people just mix them together and make it like a brick okay you got this bubble hash puck but I like to keep it a small piece it's a little bit more easier to kind of deal with right yeah so like when you're ready to consume you don't have to like break it up yeah so uh I mean one you can put stuff like this in edibles mm-hmm so you making brownies or so do you have to like activate it like you do normal and you have to be carpet good question if you're going to actually use it for edibles need to D carb okay which is setting the oven at 240 degrees and putting it in the oven for 30 minutes yep and then what that does it turns it from THC aim to TAC so it actually activates right - yep so your body can actually consume it and in this way it's actually good for dosing too because you can measure you know gram of bubble hash is a little bit more easier to dial in if I had you know I ounce of true cuz you only know how potent that trim is right that tremor you don't know how many trichomes are on there it's just hours of trim is not always equal yes to our potencies all ounces are not the same right so let's buh-buh-buh hash you can actually sell come two days a gram so any kind of concentrate is easier to dial and yeah and actually dose with it yeah so cool another way would be smoking smoking the joint or a bong or glass peas that's how we're doing it today how cute these are did we have a look guys please right here you're going to show you how to do the glass piece so one reason why they call it bubble hash is one one of the reasons is when you put the flame over the bubble hash and actually bubbles oh that's cool the other reason is cuz it's made with bubble bags but another way we picked up one like this big now if you're gonna consume bubble has just in a pipe right what you want to do is only put the flame just above it oh so you don't want to put it actually on it and I notice you're not like hitting it like you normally would uh-huh that it actually bubble I wish you can kind of see its bubbles like you got to look at it in this a little bit yes sorry camera can't see it too much what it bubbles so dad look at that it's really smooth and clean it's really smooth and clean drive to relight it yeah you just inhale right it put it over here you can see a little bubbles it actually tastes really good it tastes like um almost like cotton candy yeah it's like there's no flavors it's just a whole plant right it's just a plant nothing else been added to it so yeah it's one of the oldest forms I'm smoking and really for the bang for your buck I mean this is this is usually potency between 40 to 50 percent okay THC so a little bit really goes a long way right and I took one hit I'm good I'm good like I wouldn't have to keep hitting it and I said we still got a whole bunch the left so this could last a whole day a whole football game or whatever it is so so that's cool now if you do use a pipe though I would recommend so some of the pipes have holes at the bottom and on the side right you want to have a hole on the side of that pipe so it doesn't fall yeah so it doesn't actually fall through the middle now this one has a hole also in the middle straight down okay yeah some of them the holes are actually on the side so the concentrate doesn't fall into the pipe you know suck out the concentrate or you can use the screen yes you can use the screen everything I just said yes use the screen okay my screens on Amazon for like a hundred of them for like 30 cents that's what's up I'm stuck and I like the idea too about the I never tried I did so I will make a caviar plant and I had the bubble hash in between but kind of like how you mentioned you did Keith mm-hmm which is folky she's very quick she's very good I love my Keith blinds the other thing would be press into a heart puck and you can yeah I don't know I mean you press it to a hook I don't what are you gonna do with it you want you could do you carve a big chunk I guess maybe you'd like hold it in a puffy like light in just no pieces yeah she's at her therapeutic sweet spot right now I know I sat down I was sort of standing all right so questions and answers I don't know even have any questions it's the ground maybe there we go we check a histogram question and we're making bubble hash here come on question is okay so at the end of the day we know what making dry seft and bubble hash the the process of making it is different but at the end of the day are they're basically the same yes it's just it looks kind of different but essentially they are like if you took them to a lab and got tested when they'd be able to tell like that's bubble hash that's dry sift I think you could I think you could okay the outcome the texture above a house right is different it's way different that's it now you can take sip and put it into a puck you could take bubble hash and put into a puck and you will be able to identify which one because it's gonna say like this is like you could tell the difference in colors and I followed with the Dreyse if once you mix it all together it was one color yeah and like you could still see the differences yeah I think with cuz once this dries out I mean we broke this up but with the with the keys ordered rice F is loose right with this if we did not break that up it was just gonna try up as a hard ball okay so it's more solid okay so it's more naturally as a solid substance a solid concentrate so but as far as purity lies both of them are not insolvent ways making a concentrate meaning you don't really need any kind of gases which I like I feel like it's more natural yeah it is clean mm-hmm it's very clean and it's I mean you who needs $100,000 a fancy machine if you're trying to achieve to get some sleep or you looking to dose for being calm or you find that one kind that you do like and they maybe have trim up right x4 that trim is a lot cheaper and you could take that and make it concentrate out of it and you can make a key fun of it you can make a bubble Hedgehog right and then it's some of them best smoke you're ever gonna have I really like it cool that was good talking take aways token take aways yeah my job token is that Earl loves me enough to bring me a chair yes so thank you the team at g3 for allowing me to sit today am i talking take away is that I just had to talk for the take away I'm just one second so I just took a tuck for a takeaway that's all I wanted to do that's my talk like that but I yeah it's just so cleanest move so this knife on hammer man I'm gonna bring this for the next episode somehow it dries up yeah and next week we'll be here again probably more live we're gonna try to you know it's our hot spot thing we're gonna see if it's a won't forget to pick it up if you got really have to call Comcast and he has a monopoly on down Internet yeah and see what happens don't sue me some kids some things say some thanks and also please check out our resources

just a whole bunch of seeds it's just a whole bunch of seeds and they grow those so still grow to a tree or a hope of a leaf over gold that's achieved just a whole bunch of seeds it's just a whole bunch of seeds give him water and care the sanatory got me walking on there performing actions with intent but an honesty do not really care I'm just a product of an infant it's fair it's getting twisted in here it's getting vivid how the image appears there I hope you're having a wonderful day I hope you got something to smoke along with edibles how do you like to enjoy this plan it's all wonderful my name's Terrence McKenna I'm here with highly active farms and today we have got ourselves packed here a beautiful bowl of some cold water hash or some ice hash as somebody we call it in this video today we're actually gonna be teaching you how to make this exact ice hash that we're smoking here we've gone ahead and filmed the process and made a little tutorial out of it so you can learn how you can make your own cold water hash at home using either sugar trim or buds themselves in this video as you'll see we went ahead and used some sugar trim along with some popcorn ducks but you could use any combination of the two or either or good nugs or whatever you'd like to use and also in this video for this exact - we've gone ahead and used some homegrown organic products it's some Sun ground trainer that we went ahead and use for this so without further ado we're gonna go ahead and a try out this hash here for the first time and then show you how we made it so you can do it yourself at home anyways go ahead and grab your bones you blend your bowls whatever you got your dad rigs because we're gonna go ahead and get medicated right now so uh cheers everybody before I start this video I'm gonna smoke this whole bowl finish it later what is up everyone we are now in the hash making station just made it up off the top my head anyway here's all the materials that you're gonna need for making your own water hash or ice hash you're gonna need the bubble bags I've got a good number of them here I think I've got a 73 micron 25 micron 160 micron 120 micron and a 220 on the top but you could use you don't need to have that many bags just a few bags you need a top bag you can get at least probably three bags to make it work and you want to put basically gonna do is you're gonna put the smallest micron bag on the very bottom the the biggest micron bag in the very top and everything matching in between aside from the bags and the bucket 5 gallon bags 5 gallon bucket you're gonna need about 10 pounds of ice so we try to get 10 pounds of ice here this is the material we're gonna be using this is a mixture of some bud and some trim you could use either bud trim or be sure both make sure it's got a lot of trichomes on it the trichomes we're gonna be breaking up this is what we be using to drag if it be this dry station here this is a 25 micron screen that we use to dry a driveway after and then finishes on the carpet I think you could use parchment paper as well here's the water I'm about the water in a bowl that we're gonna put the bubble bags into I'll show you that later and something to agitate or mix the ice with the campus so either a wooden spoon works about an eggbeater or both people give this is just a simple way doing it anyone can do this [Music] yeah now that we got the materials down like I say they don't need the bags the bucket the product the ice the water the screens to dry the cardboard the parchment paper to dry on and something to mix it with all right so now we are gonna officially go ahead and get started with this also one last thing that I used to be bad ahead and uh you've gotten beat this ice with a hammer basically to make the ice cube smaller this longer that is keeps the better just a little a tip for me anyway so we're gonna go ahead and do now is a we're gonna do layers so it would be layers of ice or ice plant matter I explained it I explained all the reason I'm actually gonna go ahead and put a layer of cannabis first and then ice and ice and then I'll show you what to do from there so this is the productivity this is roughly three ounces have a shame and but yeah so go ahead and start putting a layer down here [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the plant matter we're using is a some homegrown Sun grown under percent organic living soil cannabis against the button mature yet some some outdoor homegrown pretty tasty stuff we're told it was a train wreck not too sure about the strain but it's delicious it's Turkey it's good now that we've got the ice in there the next step we're gonna go ahead and do is we're gonna add water on top of this and it's for the water we're not gonna add as much one more ice than water basically so we're gonna add a good amount of water make sure that everything's the plant matters covered but we want more ice and water so you're not gonna fill it up all the way use cold water the reason we use ice and the cold water is to break off the trichomes from the plant matter they're not water soluble but when you freeze them they become brittle and you can break them off trichomes or something like seventy three microns big they're very small that's why we use the bags that are around that size seventy three microns 260 m excellent yeah by freezing them you're able to break them off click the resin heads and those will fall through the screen without the rest of the Titan matter falling through so that's kind of the science - anyway here we go 3 right inside the water and then get to mixing or agitating [Music] mixing this up but first we aren't gonna go ahead and take a hit of that schmuck over there so go ahead and grab your pieces if you got one we dad brings your songs your join six months whatever you got so first I'm gonna go ahead and use the wooden spoon and then I'll come back harder with this eggbeater set to low because you want to agitate it a good amount but you don't want to get break it up too much to start getting plant matter in your butter so we're gonna have to eat it a good amount but again we're trying to pick up the resin heads not really your plan batter through there anyway you go ahead and start with the wooden spoon you want to beat it for about roughly ten minutes maybe preference but five to 15 I think would be a good rule of thumb so what time is it now it's about at 4:30 where we are right now so we're gonna be pissed until that see it'll be until about 4:45 and also the ice will melt obviously over time anyway it's corrected everything all right and then to this on the lowest setting to make sure that we don't uh I can't get too much time at her on her final product anyway here's another zoo if you got your pieces whatever you're using to smoke you're killing to your problems whatever you got go ahead and no shoe booboo with me cuz I'm gonna get boom so without any further ado that's kazoo I guess at this point we're getting more as you did alright now that we've been and got ourselves a little bit more zu do a little bit more medicated we're gonna do again this is responsible we're going to take the eggbeater now to the ice water and plant matter actually we've got next up here a little bit more with the spoon and because I'm using this water over here for a Schmidt anyway and again this is pure water if you want to as best you can use pure water because you don't want all the chlorine or wherever the particulates that are in tap water to get into your final product so you think you a lot is a good idea this is just RO water reverse osmosis whatever you can do to get your water as pure as possible anyway we got this ready now we're going to put this on the lowest setting and start agitating this a little bit more I'm gonna move it a little closer to the outfit and let's go ahead and get started [Music] so let's see it's been in here a little more roughly 18 minutes now which is a good amount of time for the amputation process all right now I'm gonna go ahead and begin the next part of the process so we've got ahead mix everything together so I'll agitated the track thumb should be broken off we're going to go ahead and take out this first bag good shade and let it drain part of it basically you want to let that whole mixture that you just made fall right on through there this first bag is 220 microns it'll just collect a really big once this is done all right so we have gone ahead and hung that first bag that contains all the plant matter and everything that we mixed we've taken that out we've let it drain as much as we can over the rest of the bags it takes a while to do that you just kind of have patience and just let it drift as long as you can it'll slowly keep dripping because there's ice but once it's once it's really just slowly dripping go ahead and put it over and this is a great idea that the camera lady just had but we went ahead and hung it over hey sorry about that we ran out of space on the camera but yeah you're gonna go ahead and hang the first bag over the same water that you were using to pour into the hash bags and then after that go ahead and grab yourself a spoon and get ready to make some beautiful hash alright back to the video sorry the granite is facing the camera there we went ahead and made more so yeah you're gonna go ahead and just take the spoon and scrape it off into this 25 micron drying screen fold it over give it a nice little pitcher so again this is the most green product the lowest grade you could say even put it on the air you know this one doesn't have ice and stuff even though she's not a dripping wet this is the 120 micron bag you can see right there these guys are from the bubble bag bag I put it here again on the giant screen so we've gone ahead and uh taking our next grade of hash this is the 120 mi kry - Dan folded it over I give you a little quick dry before we scrape that up like a cardboard so it's easy to kick we're going to go ahead and put this here so this is a different grade of hashim divide and separate it if you want to if you really like to uh keep him separate some people like to thank all the hash in the end and put it together here's somebody who would rather keep it separate all so he could come back at the spoon off my bad if you're somebody who likes to separate your grades of hash go ahead and write the microns here this is the 160 micron and this is the 120 those two are pretty similar so usually you'll have wine or not the other I could maybe even take out the 160 anyway we're to go ahead and move on to the next grade of hash now make sure [Music] [Music] there's not usually something now when you go ahead and go to a next grade of hash this is my personal favorite creative hash actually this one here as you can see is these 73 microns so if I'm not mistaken this one is kind of the one that's supposed to catch a lot of the resonance and it looks like you've got a lot in here to you maybe I just prepare the others you can see you down there you could see it we already see with lighting right now but I'm going to slowly bring her up so this is the 73 micron bag it'll catch anything bigger than 73 microns but because you've got the 120 this attaches between 120 73 microns anything's falling 70 microns later through the next bag but as you can see there's a good amount here and this is a better coloring from the other stuff very good looking all that you might think scrape this just like we did the rest and you're good do the same thing I'm gonna take this again look at the color on that it's nicely color - put it on to the put it onto the 25 micron screen and we're gonna fold it over give it a quick track quick tiny little bit of a price as well usually especially with moisture the cardboard really helps collect the moisture is that why we put it on there too I'm just fine fine - smells wonderful - so as you can see here this is our 73 micron ash this is the 120 this is the 160 so it has 73 micron not only is it the highest quality but it tends to have the highest yield to really go ahead and collect the smallest one this one is the 25 micron screen same size as the screen opening I'm a little shaky on the exact science of this but it's my understanding that 25 microns in some places could even be too small for the air some of the trichome heads so I don't know if this will be the highest grade or up to 73 microns real but uh as this is starting to the finish filtering it looks like it's got a good amount in here and it doesn't look bad the quality does not look bad here but again I'm not sure if this is actually higher quality than the 70 micron but I'm happy to see that there's a good amount in here if you can get that in the light Wow look at that a good amount of hash and it's powered up nicely it should be easy to scoop so I'm a little fuzzy as to whether this is actually better quality but the the cover looks nice it's definitely better quality than 120 micron then there's 60 micron and this is collecting between 25 and 73 microns so it should be pretty good quality this might be the highest quality it looks to be later loud-ass be being done with a hater now it's time for me I'm coming better know we're just down to the street with this part in the whip laying down that B then we started the spin and it sounded me we was all getting late getting lost in the are on their feet never turns out that's me coming up with the Crouch does slow slow growth to a tree over hope the belief over gold that's achieved as the whole but you see it's just a hole that you see it's just a hole but you see just see", "TvS87ksFl3A": "okay today I'm gonna be making bubble hash alright I'm a grower so I do have a lot of leaves that are extra lot of throwaway stuff from criming and and that sort of thing so I have and I keep that in the bag in the let me just finish where I was gonna say I keep that at refrigerator to fruity and that in the freezer I mean to freeze the trichomes and that's what you want to do is you want to a trikona to get frozen so they followed right off when you're when you're doing it you could either do it by putting it directly into into the bag itself okay I've got my I've get my bags here okay if you can see that they're all there in order I got the 160 here and not in the very bottom one is a 25 micron and the other ones are the other microns in between it goes from low first one goes in there at the lowest hop micron size the last one in there is is the is the highest micron size this one right here is 160 I don't use a 1 2 20 for a work bag because I've already got a work bag in this work bag right here is gonna go into the into the washing machine I had a little miniature washing machine I'll tell you I did this one time without the washing machine and it's if you're pretty strong and stuff you know then you don't have a problem just really mixing it right in the bag but it yeah I don't want to go through that again it was too it was just too too much yeah I think it could do a better job with the with them with the the washer right here does that agitate it alright so the next thing you want to do what you might do is you want to open up the work bag we're gonna do it as though work we're using this and we are gonna be using this I'll put some links down this I don't remember what I pay for this I may be about 75 or something well worth it if you're gonna be doing it I do it every drop so it's worth it to me okay so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pull put the take the marijuana out of the leaves out of the freezer and I also adding about an ounce of some Girl Scout crack okay that's the name of this this week so dad so I'm I'm gonna put an ounce of bud a while with it yeah but the leaves itself so let's get these beef bags got a cool actually I just found underneath a really cool to watch okay so let's see okay so I'm gonna go ahead and put this in take okay so I put first put some weed in okay now we're gonna do is put some ice in on top of that I want to mix it thoroughly the ice I got two five pound bag so it's I got I have ten pounds of right which is good you want to have a lot of ice now this computers in reference this is from six plants okay it's when I'm putting in here so last time I did it it's just a creme bromide actually but from less it was from three class so but I didn't collect as much if I wanted to collect I wasn't really very happy with this hat so that's why I'm at adding the ounce some of the hash what I'm going to use the for is I'm gonna make blossom after that that's right throw it out it supports I'll be using some of it for rosin consumer for hash I'll say save attached okay so this in here let's get you know I'm starting to wonder if I did that would really ruin things if I didn't hammered on okay well no III do have a nothing to play you Wi-Fi so okay so where is the ounce okay roughly here but you want to be able to turn around - you want to have a room okay so I'm go ahead and put this in here now on this this is this up this is a bowl bag dude okay the work bag it's an excellent bag you want to make sure that you tie this off though because you don't want that zipper opening up on you then you're gonna get rid of all your greenery you're gonna get out and all that sort of thing okay so that's in there now now what I'm going to do is going to put it right here now let's get the water in there yeah I'm gonna show you a little bit inside here just give you a view [Applause] okay looking good so far what I'm gonna do though is I'm gonna do it for 30 minutes instead of 15 I want to see it that's it I almost wonder if if it's possible that maybe some of her a little impatient I've never seen but hey dude the machine one for 30 minutes I've only seen him do it for 15 so I'd like to see what happens at the 30 minutes of it my other concern too is that I might have too much in the bag I might have overstuffed the bag a little bit I just lift it back [Applause] I'm on the East Coast so water to come from the pipes when you forget the water it's like wicked wicked okay okay now what's happening is the is that the I'm I by letting the try cones all fall to the bottom on this let me show you this has been sitting here for about five minutes now so we got quite a bit of substance in there it looks like we're gonna get a decent I have this feeling we had a decent return this time I don't know why okay so I want to let it all drop [Applause] [Applause] all right yeah okay so I'm gonna let that sit for a little more a few more minutes I just wanted to let some of that settle to the bottom so it'll drain out I have to drink oh [ __ ] that was not supposed to happen okay well sorry there wasn't much in there anyway okay so that's it's gonna drain out with this and I'll pour it into the bag share but I just want to let it settle for a little bit so let's uh I'll be back in a minute okay now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna drain this I let this settle for about 15 minutes so I'm gonna rep this drain now right here nice and dark color there you see that you can't now nice tonight well there's a lot of green in there but it's kind of dark - so it's looking good oh that that is cool that cool my hand is like wicked cool I'm holding this alright shake it off there okay so now got the UH the next bag it is 73 they only use the three bags no no I'm sorry I use it some 120 I use four bags okay this is the 120 and this I will keep most likely okay bottom you've got a lot of plant matter here too but I'm still gonna save it I wanna see what we got here now the other thing I'm gonna tell you to keep a keep a yeah a cold spoon right in there and I'm gonna put it over here and Mike this is the 120 okay alright so here so with the now this is the 73 bag okay okay so I'll go ahead and say what came over here what this did what's happening I'm noticing is the water coming out unevenly on this bag that what this screen right here and what that is is because I didn't clean the I didn't clean it properly like when I used it last time so a way to clean that is to fill a bottle of water with I mean a mixture 1/4 to 3 parts 91% alcohol and just spray it spray the banks and clean it that way I'll be doing that next time around oral but I will clean it I'm thinking about getting a new bag though because new bags because these I'm not I haven't been real happy with them not really okay okay I'm so sure why this is coming out ringing this time the 73% next which is the last one all right this one Heys I let this drain we'll come back when it comes to the end okay now i've collected most of it than this but i put it back in i'm gonna scrape some more i got a fairly decent one but this is where i'm talking about with the bag i can't really do this very well as far as bringing it oh okay I think I got it cleaned off enough and so what we have here is I got my basically I got my 25 by 73 in my 120 right here and there we go now I may or may not do a second run I'm not sure if I will okay I have now dried the rest of the the hash okay and this is only part of it right here because I I'm making this video quite several days after I I knew after I did DJ the video yesterday no I'm not yes you a couple days ago okay so we got there the hash ball and I watched you know I watched several different videos to see you know how to smoke hash with a hookah and I finally kind of had to put no one was really ever you know they didn't really show anything about it but I did find one video where the guy actually you know was doing it and I pried it and you want to mix it in with it this stuff called shoot shift 'no i think it's called shift no it's not narcotic I mean it's not a young I it's not nicotine it's not tobacco it's just some kind of this is called double double Apple I think Deborah's just double sour apple and and it works it's nice white the reason I couldn't be out why do you have to put something in it can't you just put that in well I think what this is this you want to put it in lightly okay you know you fill the bowl kind of lightly you don't want to pack it or anything okay and what this does I believe this is like the carrier okay uh that carries in the hash okay smoke hash poke you know to put just to put the hash alone in there it's not really gonna burn right and then you had the charcoal - I'm just dropping this in - by the way you had the charcoal he put in on top of on top of the tinfoil no I'm not gonna that's all I'm gonna put in it actually I learned I didn't wanted okay and these are kind of nice to have on hand because this stuff is messy real messy um my yield that I got I wasn't it was it was not too bad actually it was definitely a lot more I definitely recommend doing it for 30 minutes like I said it made a big difference I know I did not do a second second run I didn't feel like I needed to it made sense on how much I got it was what I expected that I was gonna get so alright that's all done okay now a little bit yeah that's nothing messy it's it's called hydro double apple it's uh it's it takes pretty good actually uh like I said this is what delivers this the cache okay and and when I get it it's like it's such a nice smoke till um yeah very nice smoke now I'm gonna break off some pieces off here and you want to kind of crumble it crumble it in you know it kind of mix it in there will be this probably should use gloves okay um I didn't tell you how I how I dried this out what I did was I froze it once I collected it I froze it in the freezer for the overnight and it became very hard and what I did was I put it in like a cheese waiter type thing a grater and it just made it very very fine okay and then I just left it like that okay it was very fine headed dry pretty fast so that worked out pretty well I've done that's the way I usually do it [Music] all right okay all right so you get that in there kind of mix it up a little bit okay now what a bad darn it okay so next what did I do it okay yeah I think that's plenty that's in there back in here this is just like a little silicon copper silicon container okay so now you had the tinfoil all right that you needed if you get it I I wish I would've got another brand of tinfoil this is it's kind of a cheap brand and it rips very easily so you gotta you gotta just be you want to make this tight I spent a lot of time on the first time I did this trying to make this like a drum tight as a drum and alls I did was go through six pieces of hemp oil that because they kept whipping so the last piece I put on there it wasn't as tight as a drum there was a little bit of give to it and it's did fine so I'm not saying you know I strive for its tired of it tight of a drum but even with that out not being completely tight as a drum it still came out fine so that worked out well now we're gonna put some holes in it okay let's see good nice I would have had that already I had my full maker and I'm not finding it now okay so I'm gonna make holes in this some might say this is too big a hole and that's what I was thinking because all right when I started doing it it was they were much bigger than when I saw other people's holes that they did and I said do it anyway cuz that was like I said I went through six pieces of this stuff I was tired of it I said do it anyway and it came out perfect it was it really did they couldn't have it couldn't have come out any any better it just good enough you know okay this is the charcoal here so you none of this stuff made sense to me the charcoal that which is like kind of like tobacco the light it's like a but it's not tobacco and I'm not getting the name right either but it doing it then it made sense okay why you need these certain things okay so you got your tongs okay course that's to hold the charcoal and this is the Oh what's the name of this charcoal is a certain kind I'll put it in the video I'll write it down for it in the video I don't remember where it is but it's the kind that's faster it it the bridge you don't have to put them all on something it's fast it lights up fast so very very fast see they're very quick okay okay so that's don't ask me where I got this no idea but I found it works okay we're pretty good I don't have a regular lighter with me I don't smoke so okay let's see so we have that bat bat but you okay yeah it takes a few minutes to get started did you get a nice cloud on that and it's a real nice day still you've got that kind of sour apple taste and when it starts hitting you it's nice it's a slow kind of onset yeah it's the same kind of onset that you would normally get from smoking hash anyway this is kind of different though because it really I could have got more smoke on that this who could that I got I don't like to do this but I'm gonna do it just because I don't want that cool falling off I think I spent about seventeen dollars work uh from Amazon it would normally just be thirteen but I went ahead and paid the seventeen to get the case the carrying case that it comes in which yeah I definitely recommend that and this is you know this is for for seventeen bucks um it's really not bad at all it really is it I mean it's not there's definitely much better who goes out there but this you really get I this is right this is it's not bad at all for the price it really isn't I gotta kind of get it started up though it's very difficult I'm starting up I'll put the link below where you can get this hookah yeah it's definitely before this is definitely a better Goodman to start out with okay the way I'm looking at it is so far I like it I've only you know this is only my second time using it but I like it a lot very easy to do - there's depending upon where you see this video cuz I'm probably gonna put about my youtube channel also but if you're just seeing it on the reviews go on YouTube and search Dukas it'll tell you this you know give you it more you know a little more information than what I gave you so it might go into more depth but I didn't see very many that talked about mixing the shish nut with the hash it looked to me like people were just smoking this it's not only I don't know but this has the hash it's nice much nicer I think nice very nice I highly recommend this I forgot to tell you another feature on this hookah too is down here there's that like a little carb some type of carb hole of some sort right here okay and it's like will ball bearing in it'll be careful when you open it if you if you do open it be careful cuz that ball bearing will fall out I have mine did and I had to replace it with another one so don't let it fall off because you need that in there what it does is it when the smoke gets all stale and it's in the hose or in this chamber here know if you if it's if it gets stale on the hose by blowing out see it gets there so you can blow it out and you don't have to keep your finger on its width because the ball bearing Keith makes it so that it's not a carpool meaning you know you're it's clogged okay which is what you want you don't want another hole in there so and that's a pretty awesome little feature I like that a lot okay that's all", "ULPSuoU0p5I": "you're live um blowing out all right so when i'm doing um dry ice what i gotta get together is i got about 15 i'm gonna guess about 18 pounds of dry ice the 5 gallon bucket um and a bubble bag so the bubble bag i like this one is a work bag um i would guess this one is like a 220 micron so it's pretty breezy so i use um whatever bubble bag is your work bag that's pretty much where i base my stuff out at and then you go about grades about how long you shake it at that point instead of trying to go through micron bags the super easiest way um so i already got a couple of things in there so what i'll do is i will fill all of the flour in there this one is fresh cut so i'll just take it and with my index finger and my thumb just pull it and then just pull it all clean and not have to trim it in there this is a super easy way when you have to do a lot of material you can just get it done quickly and then it really just doesn't put a lot of resin on your hands still because all that resin's pretty much on the top of the leaf so we're going underneath all that you can imagine if you got a lot of outdoor this would be like so quick and fast and then when you see the process you'll understand how you can get a lot of material done especially let's say if you put it in like a five gallon bucket of water and kind of let it sit there for a while while you're doing the rest of the plants but this is a way that if you have all that larf if you have any extra bud that's just small or some plants just didn't turn out really good all the way this is a way to just get a whole bunch of all the trichomes off of that thing in a matter of a couple of minutes and then be able to smoke it right down so you're not wasting anything i already trimmed off pretty much all the leaves that weren't sugar leaves and then i'm pretty much left with just the material you can do this dry um i've done it dry a lot i take off everything that isn't sugar leaves if it's dry and then what i'll do um is put a hundred grams into this five gallon bucket with about 10 pounds of ice is is a great ratio i like wet or fresh because um you get a lot a lot less organics in there and all you get are the trichomes because you're not breaking up the leaf and then the leaf is falling through along with your trichrones because they're getting busted up and becoming smaller all you got is trichomes because your organics are still wet and the fiber's still there to keep everything together so that's why i like doing it that way what i'm left with is how i don't know maybe like one fifth of this bucket full of fresh the fresh is starting off looking like that not superpower but enough to where when i'm done i'm going to be super glad i went through this process i spent 22 dollars on my dry ice and then um after that's done then you add the dry ice be uber careful you can think i've been burned on this a couple of times and i'll show you where i get burned but this stuff will burn you but i try to get it down to about um half the size of an ice cube and then some ice cube sizes you know some bigger so i will add everything on the top oh yeah this piece is wanting this big chunk together that tells me that i got some pretty good dry ice really fresh stuff if i didn't get fresh stuff i would be looking at um and i'm closing my eyes while i do this if i didn't get flat stuff they would come apart a lot easier oh man if your chunks are too big they'll just pulverize it and they won't really get everything critically cold you don't want all big chunks you want even some fine powder in there that fine powder gets everywhere and it will seriously get this stuff to core temperature really fast i am going to have to use a different tool this is providing a little bit of a problem come in with a hammer thank you beautiful assistant all right [Applause] a little bit to mix everything around and then this is the point where you want to leave it sit a sec now that that's going down i'll take my bag and i'll pop that bad boy over the top this goes all the way down until i have mine goes around the side and comes down my work bag so i get to actually have a lot of area but you want all screen on the edge of this bag and then i take this zip that pretty tight this will help for when we're popping it upside down because all this bag is going to want to do is slip and then from there you want to let it set for about five minutes so it can get super duper cold this is the part where i usually smoke a bowl because this next part sucks balls and once you start you basically can't stop the next part's gonna take about 30 minutes there's two eight to ten minute sections where i'm gonna take this bucket turn it upside down if i turned it upside down then i'm going to be shaking it over the the paraffin which is going to catch all the key and then later i'm going to be able to scrape that up and do a second one and then a third one my first run my first eight ten minutes will dump me a nice amount of keith that's gonna be top shelf keith great smoke your first um even couple of minutes will be blonde so if you even wanted to separate that out you could separate your blonde out and then keep going and then your second 8 to 10 minute shake will be a really good smoke but it starts to get a little bit of organics in there your third shake and you can do that until the end of time and that will provide you with all your cooking material you can put that in olive oil you can put that in anything and it's seamless you can't even taste it um usually i use that for oils and alcohol expression you'll also notice when your bucket's getting good because the sides will start getting frosty and this is telling me that the bucket's getting to temperature i don't really want to shake it until it gets to super temperature if you shake it too early before then what you're going to find is it takes a while for the keith to actually go through and then at some point there's this flood that starts happening and that's when it's at core temperature so you want to do that right away and not rough up as much organics as possible and that's what's happening by your second and third one it is pulveric by the time i take this off and show you the material it will basically be down to ground dust so that's why you keep degrading as time goes on but i definitely like this better than water because you don't have to dry it you don't have to filter it through that 20 micron bag that takes like an hour to eight hours to overnight to even drain out and then you're smoking it right away and i've had blonde hash out of here as blonde as almost the card that i scrape it with white so i mean you can get really good quality and the amount you get out of this is way more than you're gonna get out of water and um man almost as much as you're gonna even get out of bho you can take the keith and do just about anything with it i smoke it with bud but um you can smoke it straight which i will do right away my favorite part of this whole process the fresh keef basically tastes just like scissor hat it's something that people don't usually experience this is really super [ __ ] cold on my leg now i'm going to turn this over and right when i turn it over it's basically up now i'm gonna have to at some point turn this back over and take a rest because i'm not he-man or superman or even a muscular individual really so i have to take breaks with this 10 15 pound weight but um when i do that sometimes ice gets caught in these crevices and then when i flip it back over and put my pinky on it like this what i'm actually doing is contacting the ice that's how i freezer burn my finger a big hunk of skin fell off it kind of sucked so i'm really conscious of that part that's at this point probably the only way you're gonna get burned [Applause] all right here we go i like an up and down motion [Applause] that'll give me a good indication of how good okay that's the first minute out of our let's say eight or ten our first run so this would be like our blonde hash let's see where we're at also we don't want any wind current in here this stuff will drift like everywhere and my wife will kill me so let's see where we're at i mean i wouldn't say that it's blonde like white but i would definitely say if i slap that on the table i don't think anyone's gonna be like oh dude i don't smoke this has a ton of terpenes in it now that it's fresh this has like a ton of terpenes versus dry the only thing that i have to be concentrating on with using fresh versus the dry is i really need to dry this out this needs to set out and not in a plastic bag or anything i usually just fold over one of these paraffins for about 48 hours um it takes a while to get this all dry there's the ama card that's one minute it's probably enough to fit in the palm of my hand that's pretty awesome sample one plop that so let's go down the rabbit hole see what seven minutes with us because i'm guaranteeing now we're at core those are temperature favorite part i bet this is my family's favorite part too in the living room i still only got one viewer sometimes i gotta scrape the ends too because it gets a little stuck on there [Applause] so dude i gotta get lacking too i seriously gotta get a credit this is like that sawyer like this is actually a lot of fun like i gotta really say i'm having a blast doing this are you sure you don't want me to operate the camera you get it behind here and shake a couple 20 minutes up so i can on i don't have to scrape it off of both just have to scrape it off oh man this stuff's so wet and gooey i don't have that option sick so that is probably like another five minutes you can see the color difference right off the longer i go the more i start popping in some more organics which if you flushed everything and have everything right it's actually not that bad but if you didn't flush everything or you had a mistake that you had to harvest early because something happened and you didn't get to flush it in time um that first batch last really still tastes good once you start integrating that non-flushed organic now you're asking for it mine happened to be i would say pretty flushed so i should be straight but still i know if the second batch could actually be not the best badge or it could be all right which the way this is shaking i think i hope it's all right no questions yet because i'm so [ __ ] thorough with this goddamn tutorial sweet i like that [ __ ] cobra cat even though that's wet you can get the and i'll still pop that in the bong and it'll go down to white ash that wetness will go away real quick [Applause] oh yes drop [Applause] absolutely yeah okay so one it started slowing down and two if we start looking at the color now we got green that's telling me this is the very the very cutoff of smoke ability once it starts going green i have a lot of trichromes in there i have a lot of really good active organics in there but what it's probably going to be is a little too harsh to really be called good keith so if i keep going i'm going to be going into baking territory which honestly i could eat an honest amount i could eat a yard amount of edibles and not get high so i don't really want to go into cooking territory so i will stop here so let's see we got cause i'm betting the shit's fire what did that take like 10 15 minutes if this was dry i definitely would have gotten more out of this but since i did it wet it's actually going to be a little bit more quality but a lot less quantity usually what i get back is about anywhere from 20 to 33 percent 25 return on dry totally easy so this will get a 25 return on your dry if your dry is any squat of good even doesn't even have to be super fire oh i thought that was gonna be a lot more [ __ ] rounds dude it was a little disappointing this not like my material was super fire to begin with and had a ton of trichomes to begin with so honestly this kind of makes sense you know usually i would be expecting at least probably double this to three times more so this is cool but how much dry ice did you use there was 15 18 pounds in this one that's pretty good exactly like it smells um super smooth i cannot hardly even feel the smoke it is wet so you would think this is pretty much the harshest doesn't necessarily have to be that way when it dries out it can get maybe a little harsher when it dries out it could actually smooth out so that's why you want to let this dry out usually what i would do is just fold it over tear this section off leave it overnight and then flip it like a pancake every 12 hours or something and then make sure the other side dries out and yadda yadda because this as you can see it it wants to stay it has the consistency of um that play sand that you can form that's exactly how this feels so it wants to keep that form and that's that's why it's hard you got to get all the way in there to get all of that moisture out and yes i'm going to smoke this whole thing so i'm grabbing it with my goddamn fingers if you are wondering so uh that is the whole process for making ice hatch so if you have a whole bunch of larp at the end whole bunch of plants that don't make it good at the end um no one's gonna [ __ ] do [ __ ] with them you want to even cook with them turn them into keef this keef is going to go into butter easy oil easy you're not going to have to do this double boiler you're not going to have to do a straining process you leave that keith in you don't even have to straighten it out so you put it in oil heat the oil up boom you're done and it won't even taste like there's cannon in there so you can put it in stuff like candy and everything that would be frankly kind of weird it tasted like that cherry canna does not taste good pineapple can it does not taste good either i found so i kind of use like this stuff and then you could even use this stuff for cooking but um usually what i'll do is dry all this out put it in a bag after it's all dry and dusty and then i will put like an ounce into that bag here and then shake it up and then you have keith covered um buds are called out here they're called moon rocks basically so yeah that's what you do with all the stuff that you usually put in the garbage or not know what to do with bam i got mine at safeway um i think it's like 210 a pound that's basically it y'all i've had a [ __ ] of a day you guys got any more questions see what the difference is i wish i had actually had a torch for this it is pretty flat that great's not that bad either i could almost mix those together but i don't want to do that i think i want to separate those yeah they're still a little wet but it was it's not that bad at all i definitely know that green's probably something i don't want to [ __ ] with but those two first grades are actually pretty good i would say i got probably close to 27 grams between those two grades i would bet somewhere pretty close to there maybe 20. let's be safe at 20 and 21. but um pretty good amount for just putting some stuff in that was mid light that was mids for sure and then that came out really good now now it's something i can actually be enjoying the smoke i'm gonna wake up and then just be like oh hell yeah let's pack a bullet you know i wouldn't be waking up and just being like oh yeah let's wake up and fill a whole blunt full of mids yeah [ __ ] that but now it's actually something that's desirable um and that i can use so i will see you guys later", "sZmL9nmBD6c": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay that's a point eight eight twenty eight is what actually the poem is gonna leave [Music] I get to these point 9 yeah that's chatter like he says I experience that every time it's to melt even do anything yep okay we got three point nine yeah do you want to get a full with point one are just a full one to do the like will so that's actually also a thing if you want to put it all together or you know and then just press okay everybody go out that's your caller yeah I think does that makes the most

even race well with the bag I'm such small out because so much gets trapped in their horror scenes and [ __ ] there's got in there mmm both often hey thanks for joining us is a live Robin to us today with star shining a total ban against which I agree yeah a presence in high grade this is brought a resin ranch GMO so right now he's preparing the bag yeah [Music] ten little rap on it screw this heavy really productive oh this is abstaining thinking to the truth [Music] just test the speed nicely the press is still have enough in the speed of the plate clothing there we go this is dupe I'm just gonna blow out if I'm not careful he's gonna put on a wrap and a small small amount when you get in there and see this [Music] back it off a little bit there's friends gonna blow very clear [Music] oh wow yes I see I haven't went over 20 because say good job so the guys that resin ran holy God looks like water [Music] look like the light is colored like some added some lemon [Music] [Music] Wow it's done here alright gotta pull it to dance while going up so much slower right now [Music] literally smells like our friend Dimitri wait oh yeah oh whoa that's a crazy thing to transform the center that's it oh it's some lamb lamb wiggity wow you guys really you can't really even see it on the paper there are spots in the tape help me see the light are you falling on Tosh late look go eliminate some time for Hannah oh well yeah yeah totally now you can see those little squares here I figured it was worth its buy the expensive what can i yeah bamm-bamm spaghetti land no it's all right cooled off a bit now collect it up no but you just do right off the bat just take that one gram you're talking about mm-hmm put it right over yeah off these rips that's a purest of the pure 100 scale you do what I say I have to do a second pressing not focusing on very well it tried to focus on it for a second yeah it goes in and out I got to figure out what it's focused thing is the giving it doesn't have it one that you can choose but I found it and that's perfect well it's so good that you're and yeah it's just serious oh yeah that's a good view of it you sure you just saying have smellivision order oh man oh wow the odor of this Rand Paul mouth dude whoo oh no oh my baby sure of it just like that that stage Nicholas pull that off a bit a little bit simply a 50% yield I'm sorry to say oh oh there's still more yeah boom there you go that's like a dream well I'm curious because if but like it should be one third of the ratio just cuz this is gonna end up being like super small amount of diamonds who want to get a fatty amount or like an even ratio or some Island right now what bank with some some good amount so it's like a pretty deep sea some diamonds and then like even it might be less than I have a grandma last time today know why empresa nice oh there you go oh well then gold out then some ranch farmers and definitely farming that resident whether that's fire two grams that's pretty good there was what was it on the way through 70 yeah that's two point seven half that's like stir-crazy out Jesus 77% whopping their services in Wildman oh so yeah I don't know what the ratio I guess would be one still do this one again of a higher temp oh yeah turn it up right now yeah so yeah we got Graham to make the goods out of those may not be the better yet okay yeah guys so you're getting exactly you know one young put these into this much it's really easy Matt yeah it'll be all right calculated okay so I'm really anxious to fight at this stuff yeah [Music] oh gosh here's a little trick associated to one if you lock your fingers you just take the glove off your finger [Music] yeah pretty honking way back [Music] hit honestly though we don't look that much better than his hash I mean I said there's more definition Oh Barry speaking yeah now watch week watching the watch walking with the [ __ ] oh okay there was very much done with him really [ __ ] activated now the bird about ten minutes oh really right there I thought yeah yeah that's literally the most gorgeous [ __ ] time the second squish real quick here 180 degrees now Wolverton 160 oh nice all that in just one blow real oh I figured this would have to go hi yeah but maybe we should have no such is who fear why rural Oh so he said why do you whip it for consistency people are commenting hell yeah well size micron byesies I believe we're using 25 right well I'm not sure what size micron bags of the hash to use there but 25 microns 92 149 there you go I know that and then yeah my silkscreen here's 25 micron which is a little lower than you really need to go for doing hash rosin 37 is my usual but this stuff is really I just makes it really clean and then it's also double usable uh EE used as the thing that we wrap the rosin back into to make the HCA extract out of it the [ __ ] daddy so thanks and then yeah Emily and a weapon it does it just kind of kicks in the nucleation process which helps to cause it to butter or change consistencies which you need it to be in that kind of tacky ER consistency or less less messy before you can actually make it into the THC a effectively otherwise most of it was booze out of the bag this one was on with right this is what the first grand that we didn't live yet this is the second ground that you whipped on camera and writing it so you can see the difference between the two clearly this one was just whipped for it you know a little while that one it was not whipped at all looks beautiful says hell yeah focus three people in the house now yeah those look [ __ ] beautiful thank you sir sup neighbors so these guys following Instagram resin ranch extraction yeah they know what they're doing yeah this is hella dense split in the house starting yeah gotta know they're easier than love well my limiting factors are out of my hands you know if people are knowing the product and they're isolating it clean methods then most pretty much just skate by on this end serious you know thank you John 4411 thank you very much this is donated lemon start out Thank You Man that's [ __ ] awesome when life gives you lemons you squish them muhfuckas into some dank but yet so one form this is kind of a nice little squarish shape book yeah and get it butter in the form that we want to wrap it in the final bag well that's the wait until the father to do that but you can get that shape oh dude Thank You lab max flashier than that [ __ ] yeah bro just enabling this little infants of it yeah well we gonna have some lemonade oh that is that fresh hmm gonna get myself a second time remember it's still beautiful color oh wow yeah it's still clear yeah how are you playing oh my god yeah I get the time yeah yeah whoo garlic comes out in 2021 I guess forget that so what'd you guys think can unicorn swim - or just fly the thoughts was a rosin master as the rosin teenage ones are the thoughts that keep you up at night yeah I mean obviously they can breathe in outer space but so that yeah of course they can swim in cool BAM there's the second press meat usually makes it a darker color but it's still yeah it's totally fun that's the same way oh my god we ready to go try to have with that yeah as I was thinking yeah [ __ ] yeah I know if we can just shut this down now it's like make that into some tea later or something no she should be there awesome dude yo thank you a third squish light but I mean that's fearful if you want to or anything but yo thank you for this [ __ ] thing we'll do whatever so parts you come on soon cool fine y'all have a good night bhai de Cerio thank you guys for tuning it well yeah [Music]", "ly2D39G4GDQ": "[Music] what's this you ask this is a place where you can get

that will keep you warm we got stuff for the women we got that hot [ __ ] for my [ __ ] man make sure you check me out man all you gotta do is click the link in the description down below and go [ __ ] with you man and get some of this merch man [Music] welcome back to the channel this your boy mr good buzz and we back with the good buzz wellness extractions boy yeah we're gonna be turning some trim and we're gonna use it to make some good ass bubble hash so make sure y'all stay tuned man we're going to be doing a lot of extractions so make sure you follow the patreon in that channel boy all right so we're going to be doing a lot of extractions in the in the wellness center we're going gonna be making our own concentrates and uh making edibles and all kind of uh all kind of good treats so why not let's get started earlier on learning how to make great extractions and we're gonna start off with some bubble hash so you see we got the bubble bags everything all set up here i wasn't in the kitchen so i had a spray bottle we got the spoon and i'm only using the five bag variant so five bubble bags for this run so we're gonna go ahead get them set up so first bag is gonna be that beautiful bag this is the bag that's gonna have the gold on it the best of the best the 25 micron so the purple bag is a 25 micron basically micron mean the size of the holes in the bottom of the bag now i got the type of bubble bags that the holes are only at the bottom instead of all around because i think it will work a little bit easier [Music] but 25 is the smallest holes so that the purists because the trichomes are basically extremely small so you need a very small host and they can't pass through so you want the really good stuff to get caught and that's that last bag the bag before that we have the 75 micron bag not or that 73 my bad but uh so 73 and next we got the the 120. so 73 and 120 those have decent amounts of uh decent qualities of hash that i collect on there now this bag here this is the 160 i believe the 160 now we won't keep anything on the 160. um that's basically all plant material and then the last is the 220 micron bag and this is the bed this is the bag with the biggest hose and we're going to be using that that's going to work all the material it's going to have all the material and all the ice and the water well not really the water but you get it and they stack inside the bucket now one thing that i could have did that i did not do is that you could uh do your agitation in a separate bucket and then pour like the all the material into this like after you do your agitation but i decided to do that to do the agitation inside the bubble bath [Music] no special reason um i probably actually would have did it the other way because i said because it would probably be a better agitation but it worked out fine either way we got our ice and then we're going to be using the trim from auto booth and photo booth season one so that's that critical mass o.g critical mass 2 um amnesia [Music] and what else was in season one oh and the cheese yeah that cheese so you don't want to have too much ice in material you want to have just the right amount so you can still create a decent current inside your bucket because that's what's going to knock off the trichomes now i did pre-chill my trim my material in the freezer for 24 hours prior and that's going to help to keep those uh those trichome heads uh brittle [Music] and no i cannot i cannot break that [ __ ] that's probably not a great idea to be throwing the ice against your bubble bath but you know i said i had to break that [ __ ] that was a big ass chunk [Music] all right and then after i put the ice in i'm gonna go ahead and put my material in and now this ain't a lot of material at all [Music] i did not weigh it beforehand but i would have to say it was no more than out maybe an hour and a half [Music] maybe it might have been about two ounces just the way i saw that fall in there like that that was at least i don't and then probably like an ounce off the uh off the second one but it was my oldest and smallest bag of trim so let's keep that in mind [Music] all right so next you're going to add the water now make sure you got enough water so that it covers the top at least the top layer of everything that way you get that current like the the entire bottom line of this is to create a decent current inside your bucket and that's how you're going to get those trichomes off boiling bubble toil in trouble [ __ ] add a little bit more water fill that [ __ ] up [Music] now i know that i had some weird ice i had ice with the hoes in the middle of it the eyes didn't work that well uh because the wig kept getting inside the middle of the ice and she was irritating uh eventually i stopped trying to remove this [ __ ] and just said [ __ ] it because the [ __ ] was cold as [ __ ] so try to get the ice without the hoes like without the tunnels going through them and i did about 20 minutes and 20 minutes agitation uh both rounds first and second round i mean you you can never do too much you feel me and i feel like 20 minutes and i like to go one direction and i stop and go back the other direction and now it is ideal to have something to do the agitation for you like a drill connected to like a spawn or something um but i ain't have none of that [ __ ] and i'll let my mans brought my drill i ain't got that [ __ ] back yet uh you know what i'm saying so so i did that [ __ ] manually but don't y'all want to know how good you how good of a you you get married yes i said did that [ __ ] with 20 minutes manual [ __ ] my arms were tighter than that [ __ ] and i had thought about something man i had a whole bunch of shake a whole bunch uh not shake but keith and i felt like [ __ ] i might as well clean the keep this is a great way to clean keys you know i'm saying if you want to turn your keep into hash it's the same [ __ ] keith's just got uh plant material and [ __ ] [Music] now i did make a hash video a a year or so ago using my uh my trim bin yeah that is mostly that is mostly keith but the trim bin i forgot what the microns on it was i believe that it was pretty small so you get a decent a better keith you know i'm saying closer to a hash you know saying it's a better key less plant material because it definitely wasn't a 160 micron or not like that and so now what you want to do is slowly pull each bag out we're going to start off with the 220 with all our material in it make sure we drain it i kind of bounce it up and down and then we gonna say all the material to the side for a second run you definitely want to do a second run [Music] and if you're not doing this manual you may even do a third run i'm doing this [ __ ] manually and my my my forearm muscles was was tight boy i'm like two rounds was good for me all right so next we're gonna slowly work out that 160 [Music] and uh we're not gonna keep nothing on the 160. [Music] all the 160 is mostly all hairs uh pistol hairs um small bits of leaf and things like that and now i do use the spray bottle to kind of pull all of it towards the middle of the bag so it make it easier to collect off of the off of the screens now of course this would be way more ideal to be doing in the kitchen or outside with the garden hose or something but you know what i'm saying [Music] i guess i was just trying to get a dog ass workout because that [ __ ] spray bottle was [ __ ] my [ __ ] up too but no i said y'all [ __ ] know i'm staying ahead i wasn't trying to record my [ __ ] kitchen i got seven kids man [ __ ] that i just spent all day trying are you listening been my dream to open up my very own dispensary and good buzz wellness center is on the way detroit is giving opportunities for long-time residents like me to be a part of the beautiful marijuana industry and believe me i'm doing everything i need to do to get it done we just got one small obstacle the building detroit has hundreds of abandoned buildings just ready to be fixed up and i work with whatever god blesses me with but them boys is like a hundred thousand dollars and that's a little out of my price range that's when y'all come in help us get the job done with a donation as small as five dollars or start in january 2021 you become an investor for as low as 50 by helping obtain the wellness center you will be helping bring jobs to detroit we'll be fixing roads and even provide our public schools where brand new learning materials and of course help a young black man fulfill his dreams we only got one year man hit the link in the description and help with a small donation only five dollars man appreciate y'all get the [ __ ] to clean it [Music] and then i use this little all right i ain't gonna lie which uh you know saying it's not a bow it's uh it's a light fixture uh glass off the ceiling like i can't find nothing else to work great to work better [ __ ] y'all [ __ ] i'm doing this and they are improvising don't y'all want to know how to do [ __ ] with little to nothing that's what i'm here for to show y'all how to do [ __ ] with nothing [ __ ] [Music] and so that's gonna make it easy to collect you just kind of flip it inside out on the back i mean on the uh on your bow or you could use a small bucket or something else and you can see that [ __ ] just look icky as hell they all look like nothing that it look all grainy looking is here you know saying hey you definitely know you do you know we discard this all right so next up is the uh who's this the 120 bag and so we're keeping everything else and as the as the hose gets smaller it will be harder to drain uh the water out now i wasn't working with much material so i don't have much hash so it didn't drain as bad for me make sure you hit that [ __ ] good and that's that too that's that 120. and so we going to keep this and i try to get all of it hey matt said that you should make sure your spoon was cold um i wasn't doing it in the kitchen so i couldn't and then i'm gonna lay this stuff down to dry on a 25 micron screen on top of a piece of cardboard that's gonna absorb that moisture and then i'm gonna take my spray bottle and i'm gonna spray the screen off over the next bag that way we don't miss nothing [Music] and after you're done with each bag you want to go and clean it so i actually went and cleaned each one afterwards rinse them off real good with warm water uh because you don't want to let it sit you don't want that you don't want those trichomes you don't want that uh thc and that [ __ ] to dry inside those holes it'll render your extraction in your yield in the end and plus i spray that bit so clean before i rinse it [ __ ] that [ __ ] is a1 all right next up 75 and this is even cleaner huh [Music] as you can see even when it's collected it just start to look different you start to see a lighter color [Music] and pretty guy you don't drop now i need all of it every drop boy [Music] it's honestly a very decent use for that little amount of trim i was surprised of each bag how much we actually collected [Music] and this is why canuck said you should have a spoon cold does it get hard to get this [ __ ] off the spoon all right last but not least the bag of golden the purple bag the 25 micron bag [Music] and this one takes the longest to drain by far and this is going to be the best haz this is going to be the cleanest curious trikon heads [Music] this is your job right in the uh writing the dab right in the rig and it it hit you feel me oh my oh my god and my damn ass gonna spill some of the best you know i'm saying i was i was hurt as [ __ ] about that i'm getting that [ __ ] though you feel me [Music] hard as hell though that [ __ ] stinky [ __ ] [Music] oh sick as hell you see i left the camera on that's it and so next we just gonna reset everything back up for another run [Music] add a little bit more water or ice if you need and i didn't and this is what we on the right side is what we got from the second year still real decent that last one looked like diarrhea though and so i'm just gonna set this all over my jumanji board in front of a dehumidifier and then i'm gonna set something on top of it so we don't get no contaminants fall into it and luckily in real life i just finished the auto grow so i had the uh the auto booth was empty uh a tent i had the fan on inside inside of a tent is a great place for you to dry your hash and 24 hours later [Music] as you can see i actually left i tried to leave that little gap but i ended up having to make the gap a lot bigger and so yeah i mixed it all together i only separated just so you all can see the differences in the colors all that was going to go to the blunt for me i don't got no prayers i would love to press off some hash rising but i ain't got no press and so and the stuff smells really really good like i can i can smell the amnesia a lot that's crazy and so let's see what we yielded off about two ounces of trim give or take [Music] i say it was more close to like a house and a half a trillion [ __ ] i should have measured i should have weighed that [ __ ] [ __ ] it let's see what we get from this hash though this [ __ ] smells good though [Music] oh we attempt off six grams boy so we got six grams that's some fire ass hash from our first growth which was our worst growth well actually it wasn't the actual first girl when we used that first grow trimming we made uh dry sip hash with it we appreciate y'all for joining me once again i'm gonna go ahead and break some of this [ __ ] down i'm gonna sprinkle some of it into a blend and see what this [ __ ] do though you feel me make sure you follow me on the ground you subscribe to the channel and holla at that patreon y'all remember man y'all can get a year patreon membership two months free all proceeds go to the good buzz welding center this has been a good buzz wellness extraction [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you", "XmDpub5wBAU": "everybody welcome to clip one to making a bunch of bubble hash I probably got about realistically one and a half two pounds in here of smalls my ice is going I've been letting it sit and chill I'm double beating in this one because it's just so big I didn't have a bucket that quite fits my twenty gallons here so I'm gonna say [ __ ] it and I clipped it to a thing that it kind of fits in and I'm just gonna get right in here and really blend the [ __ ] out of it once we get her going to a good point school starts Rock propped it up and [ __ ] in there this takes a bit of time to activate that remember the premise of what we're doing here is we're using agitation combined with cold temperatures which makes the starch of the trichrome brittle and then they fall up probably gonna have to double run this bag just because a lot of its just straight small buds but I'm gonna give it a good long beat time though a lot of people are like well you don't want to have too long for B times that will bring down the quality of your stuff this was all quite fresh when I packaged it so it will be less prone to breaking down as well as I'm not making this hash predominantly to smoke I make my smalls into this hash in order to press it into rosin so really I'm gonna spend the next 45 minutes to an hour doing this and will tune in once we get our frost up for you alright see you in a bit we're still going we've been going now for about roughly give or take 40 45 minutes I'm gonna better set for that in just a moment we're going to go get more ice so we're going to keep rounding things still debating on whether double tap this or what I might do is not double tap it and then I'm going to take all of the plant material out squish the water out of it and dump a bunch of alcohol on it and then make it into some RSO the one thing to remember when you're doing that is to take a wet plant material make an RSO you can totally do that that'll be fine it's just gonna be a little bit slower on the cook down on it because it's going to be a greater amount of water content so the alcohol is easy to evaporate out when they can some nice hash oil but the water will take a little bit more time and patience to cook up but then that way we're maximizing everything we can get out of our wheat it is and we're not wasting nothing if you know what I'm saying it's all about keep the thick to keep it real everybody and just remember to the online store is coming to you very soon my friends and we're going to be bringing you some sexy pot squash here we're going to be bringing into clothes the rolling papers eventually form stab Briggs scales grinders Pat's sunglasses and we're also going to be eventually launching our own grow light brand and all of these will eventually be available to for purchase both on our internet store or online store but we're also going to be available in the number of stores around Canada I've been working on that as well so my friends here is click to make a bubble hash I'm probably going to shut this off in a couple of minutes and then run down the store one cuz I'm out of liquor too I need more ice but I'll see you soon and we'll show you the end result of this first run on this sector giant 20 gallon bag running with a couple pounds in it making a sexy baby look at that beautiful bra if you were here you can smell just how wonderful all of this smells all the terpenes and coils of this plant material are activating and making themselves sexy gonna be really good excited to get this [ __ ] done dry out and then make some [ __ ] rosin and that's gonna be a rosin press video quality so we'll see in a bit all right still recording oh crap so as you can see now this has been sitting and resting and every 10 minutes I really let it sit for about 3035 minutes stirring in their bow and fruitiness though about to pull this first bag then we're gonna pull the red bag and then we're just gonna pull the final bag I'm not using all the bags the rest of them over there the reason for that is I'm not trying to make like crazy so the purest hash I can I'm trying to make what I'm trying to make here is I'm trying to make a good hash that I can impress but anyway let's pull these bags and we'll tune in to you once we get some pulled bags out you see everybody this is from the first press bag there this is not where we're gonna get a majority of our stuff from majority of our stuff is gonna come from that final bag that we're doing but that is for a for a bag one which I normally consider a filter bag that is not bad in terms of one the color we're seeing there it's got nice and sticky resin glands to it that actually probably is gonna turn out to be some nice smoke weight to the next bag though you go see some crazy [ __ ] here we go everybody and here's that final press back there let's try to get the out of focus as you can see though it's looking very nice very nice indeed that huh cuz then that's done just making sure but look at that nice a bubble hashish nice big thick piece of beautiful bubble hash and I'll see if I can get this focus to work smells amazing super fruity delicious but as you can tell once that dries up it's gonna be quite nice we'll get you a wait maybe once it dries up but it's gonna have to dry for a couple days now so I'm gonna go put that up at a place to dry it and it's gonna be nice but thanks for tuning in to making some more bubble hands we'll pass watch", "kfmzOQLahqg": "[Music] and watch it [Music] what's up DD see Scott it real and gum a friend Levi from low temp plates on the line what's up brother man I'm doing good but you know me man first off Levi always supports a DGC was that the 7-10 concentration celebration appreciate your brother yeah absolutely thanks so much for having us out we we really love being there yeah yeah okay so Levi is gonna be my source I've talked it to naazy I've talked to a few people and you're gonna be my source for a freeze dryer or at least you're gonna be my information source right now because I'm a little bit confused what I'm thinking about is I got this greenhouse coming down count aloud 1015 pounds whatever the hell we get from it different strains and I want to make some something good out of them something a little bit better than just shatter I was thinking about the laws man I can't have 15 pounds right but I can take 15 pounds and wash it down to I don't know a few ounces or a half a pound or something like that that would be legally okay no yeah yeah correct yeah I mean as long as you're lifting your your your legal jurisdictions whatever local jurisdictions that you have yeah that can definitely help cut down your total weight now if I'm thinking about it because I am a little bit of a public figure if the cops were watching me and listening to what I said if I was blasting this all with butane is that technically illegal or am I able to do that yeah yeah by far technically illegal yeah okay okay so that's where the rosin press comes in so if I wanted to play by the rules I could press you press this match pressing twelve or fifteen pounds of flour seems a little ridiculous and I'm kind of setting you up for the softball because we don't press flour correct well so you can for a simplicity sake right it's you know for commercial operations is a very easy skewer to throw on on the shelves for home users who just shop at dispensaries it's really nice just because you can go grab some flour I'm from a hair straightener stepping on a hair straightener all the way up mm presses so oh yeah you can but it is quite a bit of work if you're talking 15 pounds or whatever it is then yes yeah yeah you would much prefer pressing the hash equivalent of that it's not alive too big big key to sink your pressing flour you're pressing dried cured flour not like fresh frozen flour so that's what I wanted to get into so the difference remaking shatter and making live or live rosin is that everything has to stay cold right everything has to be frozen so we're gonna harvest it wet we're gonna instantly freeze it and then we're going to wash it in and then once we freeze it we can take our time take out some you know half pound at a time wash it in bubble bags or a bubble machine and that's where I'm a little bit confused so I've got my sifted water hash that comes out of the bubble machine how do I keep that life yeah so the best thing that you can do is as soon as you've washed it is to you've got two options the old-school way would be to freeze it and then microplane it and what you're trying to achieve there is a long-term slow dry so that can range from four to about seven days within a humidity and temperature control room okay so you've got a microplane what you explained micro planning yeah so micro micro planning it would just be freezing the bubble hash that you take out of your bags right and then at when it's frozen you're taking essentially like a grater a sifter and you're sifting it up on to a lot of people use cardboard but what you're doing is that you're trying to break it up into small pieces so it can air dry over a slow period of time on within this time you know you do experience a little bit of oxidization right they start to see things get a little bit darker versus using a free char and that gets me into the second option which would be just slapping it in a freeze dryer and that process pretty much she you pull a deep freeze on the product ranging from you can adjust your times anywhere from about seven to ten hours and that matters seven to ten hours I mean I can't freeze it for a month so you you can't actually freeze it for however long you really wish okay but the the freezer ours they are a little and they're a little bit on the pricier side yeah so it's not something that I would want to run over a long term unless you have to you know so a more conventional freezer would be a little bit more suited if you want to freeze for freeze that hash specifically for you know 24 hours or a week or whatever it is before you can actually do your full freeze drying process all right then yeah that makes sense all right so we got to the where I've got the bubble and I'm putting it in the freeze dryer now so now I just I leave it for what a day a week yeah so you've got essentially two times that on the freeze dryer that are important to you there's there's a free cycle and a dry cycle so the first part of the freeze dryer is to deep freeze the entire product right so seven hours for most product is is plenty depending on what you want to do guy so let's say seven hours there and then there is a dry cycle at the end which there is a vacuum pump and it pulls vacuum on the chamber and then there are trays within the freeze dryer that warm up slightly to allow for the tip furnace for the moisture to evaporate out of the product out of your wet hash and then it pulls a vacuum and it cycles through that so and we're not talking about we're not talking about evaporation here this is sublimation we're going directly from liquid solid to a gas and going away and what evaporation is solid to the liquid gonna do it yes mmm-hmm interesting and it'll take chemistry yeah then so you're just opening up that drain valve and whatever moisture you collected that has been sucked into the they'll just drains out so that is the water from your from your hash all right so then the last step after and how long how long does it take to do that how long do I collect into the drive yeah the dry cycle is usually around 10 to 12 hours okay longer if you've got a large freeze dryer and you're burning it up with a ton of hash if you've got full trains yeah you can easily turn that into 24 hours or so okay okay so then I want to get to the last step because you've given me the whole process I really appreciate you taking the time to do this but the last step is we gotta press it in a rosin press and this is to make you know super high-quality live or awesome am I wrong is that the last step and we just immediately take it out of the freeze dryer and do that or how's that work correct so you know depending on what kind of micron bags you're using ranging from 70 to 90 maybe up to a hundred micron okay first it could actually be full milk so if that's what you prefer you can pull those those microns out for full no and those will typically it's only your first wash that they'll be that they'll be full milk but everything else it can be squished into inter hash frozen just like you mentioned and how many washes do you do out of a bubble teas and bubble bags and the bubble later mmm machine yeah it depends on how much agitation you're getting with with washing machines are getting quite a bit more agitation right 10 or 15 minutes and you can run up to about five washes if you want but at the end at those fourth and fifth maybe even six washes if you're just trying to get everything out they're gonna be the lower quality more contaminated product and you're gonna receive less yield per wash what I'm what type of yield like on a total throughout the six washes you do on like a half pound what type of yields would be looking at so pretty much what most people like to refer to is just to rosin percentage yield so let's say and this is all fresh frozen so good yields would be considered like three to five percent range to rosin off with fresh frozen weight so you just have to run the numbers off that so if it's no 1/2 sorry what was the numbers again just let's do two pounds max is that's 900 grams what can what do we get off that yeah so you do have to remember that's not that's fresh frozen right that's only obvious that's what all the water weight still in the cannabis cheese that's not it dried at all yet so we're gonna have to give all that away and because we'd be correct so yeah if you have two pounds of fresh frozen that would be 900 grams right and let's say you got back a really good yield it's the genetics are good certain really grown you did a good extraction on it let's say to rosin you get three percent yield on that okay so that would be 90 grams yeah it would actually be 27 see why I don't do math with mana right that's why you hold on to the money all right sure all right so 27 grams out of out of okay that's not a 2 pounds of fresh frozen I mean but 2 pounds of fresh frozen Jesus that's gotta be like a half pound to a third of a pound of dried flower yeah yeah approximately they say if I'm not mistaken it's somewhere around you lose about 80% of the weight if I didn't say it I was gonna yes somewhere around eighty percent of the total way around all right all right so I'm thinking this alright so here the reason we were bullshitting is because I'm like alright so if I do this what's my investment you know what's the ROI I just went and bought a gram at the dispensary for $55 for a gram of live resin or like yeah is even live resin not life awesome I do find the rosin have a little bit more flavor I dig them a little bit more I like the consistency too it's easier to dab but um so I'm just thinking if I'm buying $50.00 grams a gram really doesn't last all that long might be cool to have a year's worth of worth of a live rosin hey you got a separate fridge I did some quick math of that 80% water weight chair go away when you dry it right if you if you dried it to that dry weight that's 15 percent of the driveway well which is 15 percent return to live hash rosin that doesn't make sense 15 percent active ingredient on some really Bank bud and and the 85 percent is no material plant material yeah definitely makes sense yeah and I mean you'd be lucky to on a large scale to get that kind of return off of dry pressing flowers and it's not going to be nearly the same quality bubble hash rosin as a rule of thumb is significantly better and quality than flower roses agree with you more Sarah tried both and there's a huge difference yeah yeah exactly all right so come on help me out what's my investment here so I need a freeze dryer first off bubble bags and the bubble later you guys sell them so we actually just started carrying bulk bags okay yeah so we really like those just for the the Frenchy full mil full mesh bags okay I really like those and they've got washing machines as well yeah so what do I got a couple hundred maybe three hundred bucks and a washing machine or some bubble bags yeah yeah you could always depending on the size so you can get down to five gallon right right to about 42 gallon bags [ __ ] as bit larger it's more material so it gets quite a bit more expensive but all in all on bags you don't even need a machine if you don't want to right let me just go with a bucket I with a spoon man my buddy used to make the a locking gank with a wooden spoon brother yeah yeah so you can you can really kick it very primitively and it doesn't take a lot of money to get started it just as you start to scale and trying to do larger and larger amounts to become more efficient that's when it starts costing a little bit extra money sure so we got so we could just end it right there if you want to buy a bubble later bubble machine and some bags or even just some bags and use a five-gallon bucket and some ice you can make really good water hash that way I will tell you the more you beat it the lesser quality is so if you're really gentle with it you can make some dank dabba bull I don't know if it's full milk but it's close whatever is not full melt you can just throw in a hair straightener thrown or press right over you impress that so you could press press that now what if we just want to go there and say hey I'm going to invest a little bit of money for quality and buy a good rosin press help me out I see him for 400 bucks tell me what the difference is between that I don't you see you don't sell no $400 presses do um so so actually how we started our business was that that smaller range I go for three to five hundred dollars just with the cage kids the plate kids at the time everybody was stepping on hair straighteners and everybody was trying to figure out how to scale so they were using the t-shirt presses in there right and then you know just growing up in Kansas and and seeing a lot of these shop presses around I figured why not adapt one of these to a rosin press so that's essentially how we started and the more recently Lucius made the more commercial setups and and higher processing and higher quality systems which are which are the V twos as of currently and so yeah you've got pressure gauges external palms you can operate them through electric means air hand you know they're open source so you choose exactly how you want to apply your force nice yep all right so so if we got a rising press what's it gonna cost us man for a good one yeah for for kind of a beginners home user setup that you wanna you know something that's portable all american-made lifetime warranty I mean the thing is bulletproof it's you know it's gonna last you a lifetime sure how many times is that so up to 20 tons which is 40,000 pounds of force so more force than you ever need but it's nice to have in your back pocket if you ever you know stacking multiple chips and doing a final extraction right what do we press that what's what's the force we press it yeah for the the force for flowers you're looking anywhere from about 1,500 to 2,500 plate and PS I got and platon psi is something that that it takes a small equation to get there but the formulas on our website if you just want to check that out but yeah that's how it breaks down and then for hash awesome you're looking anywhere from 800 to up to 2500 plate psi again got it so it's overkill what you what you're giving them yeah for sure alright and so what's that running come on what's that run my friend prices yeah brother come on DBC price yeah so if you're just if you want to start off with our intro systems those start at 397 that just sticks on any press in your choice this is a really good home user setup but for the more you say press you can go to harbor you're saying like a harbor freight pump or whatever I don't understand what do you mean yes yes that's the actual Harbor Freight brain okay guys so the downside of those is that they're a little bit larger so you may want to set it up and in the garage if you set it up in your living room if you have a girlfriend or wife they're not gonna like it good all right next the exercise bike man you'll be fine I'm sad that's all right so all right so right wow so this is pretty cool so I got a few hundred bucks in the bowl bags for 400 bucks I can get a press so so you telling me a home press yep yep and then if you want to go with something that's a lot more portable you're about ten inches tall you can just throw a bottle jack in those and they're really portable so if you're if you're hopping around from buddies houses to sessions or whatever on it you know you can tote that around with you those start around $1,000 that's shipping and taxes include all right so I'm thinking abut for under a G if I wanted to be a starter for under a G I could start making my own rosin correct yeah yeah you can even make bubble hash rosin for the air thousand bucks yeah and then so here's the big jump man you know me man I always want to go high-end I said I don't always want to go high-end but in my cannabis I do so if I want to go live with then I've got to go with a freeze dryer right mm-hmm yeah yeah so the main advantages of the freeze dryer is to quickly dry your material right so it doesn't leave loose terpenes is that when you lose the terpenes absolutely so if you're just air drying within a room you're also beating the heads up whenever you're doing that aggressive sifting you know that the micro cleaning that I mentioned earlier right so yeah it's a it's just a much better process you're keeping it cold so hence the live rosin aspect your because all you're doing is freezing it and then and then just getting that moisture out pulling a vacuum so while it's cold never really exposed to heat and it's much quicker as well yeah all right but that's a big [ __ ] step up man we're talking another couple grand if I want to get in get into the live business right yeah I'm minimum minimum so the only company that that makes free strives for our industry is gonna be harvest right and they make products ranging from 2,000 up to about 8,000 to like that still is very very very cheap compared to all other freeze drivers on the market because they're like full-on lab great equipment is that what the deal is medical grade stuff it's yeah it's pharmaceutical grade stuffs at it you know most of those machines will start around $30,000 so harvest rights really fulfilled a nice niche in the market for people like us oh very cool very cool although starting a - jeez man damn yeah I get that I get that yeah by the way so what you we were talking about if you don't if you're just drying bubble hash or freeze drying bubble hash guru doesn't let me say drying he gets my own estate but if you just freeze trying to bubble hash you don't need a huge freeze dryer right Yeah right right and so pretty much you've got you've got three different sizes you've got the small the medium and a large been on for most people for most small grows you get away with a smaller a medium I how small is it small so the small is the actual sizes on this guy so it's around a hundred and ten pounds and you can fit approximately two to three wet pounds of bubble hash inside of it no sweat that's a [ __ ] shitload man yeah yeah I mean that dries down to two to a portion of that sure but still yeah I mean that'll fit quite a bit you know that's full trays right yeah you can never make it work all right that soon what seems legit man it seems like okay I'm gonna figure for a solution for a home solution two grand three grants I've got about 3,500 bucks if I want to be in the live business no correct yeah I mean of course you can always hair dry right but yeah you're going to lose the live aspect of the of the rosin but don't make me get my calculator out but if fifty dollars a gram a bit guru could do this one is hit but at fifty dollars a gram how long has it taken it what do you got sixty sixty grams in order to recover that ROI if you're paying fifty dollars a gram at a dispensary you make 60 grams of live live rosin a it's great it be I've got five or six different strains in there and and B I cover my three grant you know I guess a three grand investment you could cover with three grand you don't have to spend in the dispensary anymore what sort of bet you I would spend it you know a couple hundred bucks go to that dispenser every couple weeks man yeah yeah yeah and it makes sense for for home growers for quite a few home growers if you are a heavy smoker or if you're supplying your friends and family that kind of definitely helps yeah definitely if you steal your buddies live rosin and tell them that you'll pay him back yeah yeah I guess still gurus live rosin for the air you know it becomes a prop at that point I love it I love it it cool man all right so I figured some [ __ ] out I appreciate it yeah I just wanted to share with the DG see you and I were texting back and forth yesterday and I was like man let's just do this for the DGC there's some really good information there you pumped it out by the way I really appreciate it Levi right on yeah absolutely and and you know as always we're just trying to put out a lot of information just to help everybody out because I understand it is really overwhelming at first trying to get into solve those expressions so you know we're putting out educational videos on on YouTube and are on our website so you guys are always welcome to try those out they're all free right and your so shout outs oh man where's everybody find it with your YouTube but your website come on yeah so our Instagram is just low temp period plates if you just youtube us it's it's low temp industries or low template so you can find a set either and the websites just low temp - plates com nice nice I appreciate you taking the time brother yeah absolutely thanks so much for having me I really like go chat with you guys all right you're right down in Denver you might see me soon he goes out just lonely at a freeze dryer in the lobby and and you might see me soon brother yeah yeah hope to see you sure well man take it easy brother yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] we're the pill to do [Music] true medicine [Music] Oh he hates the day [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "trTtUPA4UmU": "yo what up YouTube it's going green everyday here with another update I'm sorry I've been slacking on my weekly Guardian updates I've just been busy trimming my memo was done I probably got about 2 ounces left my last plant and I just also feel like it's a little bit unnecessary to have a update every week in your grow room there's not much to talk about I still have the same 3 plants in there as I did three weeks ago my flower tent I am about to transition a couple more plants from veg to flower probably tomorrow or something so you'll be able to see that the next week's update anyways today I decided to try and make some bubble hash that was my first attempt and yeah these are my results so this right here so I ran I had six different runs I did three runs of two different batches so you'll kind of see here there's a left and the right on each pad kind of thing on the left one I was the first plant right one it's a second plant so anyways this one I just kind of combine them both because I don't even know if you're supposed to smoke this this right here is the stuff like I had my two 20 micron bag these right here but from my 190 micron bag this one's for my 160 this one was from 120 just a lot as long as my 45 micron and this one was from my 25 so I'm just kind of breaking it up just making sure it dries well oh yeah that's it for this week I'll see you guys again next Thursday in the garden have a good one", "UYg_nvovxDE": "[Music]", "62vndMFEjBA": "[Applause] [Music] welcome to functional art where we look at glass and hash have a closer look today I'm with Zach from resin heads how you doing buddy great how's it going it's going and then today you brought us a uh who makes this piece right craft right crafted glass he's based out of Medford Orion where'd you find this piece act I got it directly from him no ice had a show or no I went to his house and got to choose from his current stock at the time it's pretty awesome well can't wait to hit it you also a hash maker right yes sir resin hits resin heads resin hits we make ice water hash and rosin this is summing of rosin yes sir that one's GMO garlic cookies it's not funky offensive smell to it beautiful resin we heard you recently took second place at the ego clash for cold water extraction yes sir what was the strings it was a mix of papaya and banana OG 90 micron mix that sounds very nice do you happen to have any with you yes yes would you pop it open whoo and take them that's not rosin that is not roses bubble a creative bubble hash straight heads 90 micron that is gorgeous and so you say this is a full metal cold water extraction yes just ice and water no solvents no solvents and it will melt like an oil yes it'll melt like water how would you describe that flavor almost like a fermenting bananas I don't really know how else to describe it has almost got a almost a rotting fruit smell to it and then the banana just comes through with like a creamy sweetness almost and what got you into making bubble hash opposed to solvent was how I solve them hash I had a bunch of roommates that lived in a min to see no County growing up and their family grew weed and every harvest time a little bit after four actually around now Christmas time right this is hash season they'd always come home and bring some hat and it was my favorite thing to throw on bowls and smoke I just really enjoyed it and so did you watch a lot of trim when you started there buds yes started out with trim basically I'm a grower get our stuff trimmed freeze it we used to make BHO didn't really like the way that was going the taste or just the potential hazards that involve are involved with me canned vho so I personally just really wanted to get into bubble hash and to clean our product yeah clean product just ice water agitation no solvents no chemicals that tastes exceptionally good you get that real banana OG on the front end and a lot of the papaya coming on the back yeah there's like a tropical smoothie got lucky with that mix I will say that and so that's a the second best hash in California right now guys and you got a trophy for that right yes sir yes I did I'll show that to you in a sec you can heat me up um that yeah and who made the trophy JD maple s'en I hope I'm saying that correct he's been making trophy all he's been doing glass for quite some time he has made trophies for the Emerald cup I believe he did the trophies last year for the ego clash he's definitely a pretty coveted artist when it comes to the scene and it's got a three-hole Bowl yeah the old style of threw bubble hash you need a three whole bowl ball it up stick it in there and you use a glass rod with the rounded kind of marble end you heat that up and you just kind of like hold it over press it in and kind of dab away if you guys with good bubble hash it's essentially oil and we tried to hit it with a pipe it'll just turn to oil and yep thin membrane and just kind of melts away to almost nothing and ru hand stirring or using machines or a paint stirrer I use machines and bubble machines I don't really have time to hand stir it takes takes some time and obviously you get a great product with using machines yeah you know I mean I think you get just as good as a product as you do with the hand stirring it just maybe takes a little bit more time to clean up here and there but it allows you time while the machines are spinning to do the other things you need well like cleaning sanitizing prep work for pulling the bags and getting everything ready so that's kind of my reasoning behind it I can't just justify standing there for hours using an oar and hand stirring hand can't time is money exactly especially when you grow your own material you really got all the time in the world and you got to spend a lot of it processing and cleaning I'm just gonna the term glorified janitor has been tossed around yes 100% I have to try some of this GMO because it smells I don't know how you describe that smell but it's very unique it's very offensive off-putting almost that's funky real interesting flavor on this one I don't even know how to describe it it's just like a garlic and burnt rubber maybe it's kind of offensive but it reminds me of like the old school cat piss almost there you know something where you smell you like oh that smells disgusting but I need to smoke it yeah that's that's the weird thing about weed definitely some offensive flavors that you smell and you're something you I want to smoke that interesting this second place trophy is that's a beautiful piece of work with the trichomes all up at all yeah that's a nice marble you've worked a few more twig wags fumed marble right there on the front a really great job like I did a really great job on those trophies I love it man I grew up in Sonoma County we have a lot of glass artists here a lot of smoke shops growing up I've always loved going in and just looking at the glass even when I didn't smoke even before when I was a kid and younger you know before it was a lot that you had to be 18 to go in you could just kind of walk in and look at the stuff and it's kind of hypnotizing all the girls love them I'm always loved it just the craftsmanship that is put into it the pride they put it into it the hours they put into hours they've learned how exact mold their craft and to make these beautiful pieces I mean it takes definitely a lot of time and dedication so it's cool to like smoke your art out of someone else's art kinda because it takes almost as much time to really mess the glass community and the hash community a very close-knit because they're both forms of art and they're always pushing each other they push each other and they work with each other yeah because they rely on each other exactly yes they do well thank you for coming by and showing us these amazing glass pieces and this award-winning hash oh yeah thank you so much for having me hopefully I get to a smoke some more of your product here in the near future white pasty I'm sure you and you know congratulations on the second place and the ego clash that's a big one thank you so much and next you'll take it for the first I'm sure shooting I'm gonna find some new flavors possibly make some new flavors and really kind of just push it well buddy thank you so much Cheers [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "AjVMyfrqXfA": "yes yes how we doing people back in the house one love what am i looking at here is this maltesers right if you'd seen my um bubble hash machine i did make some i didn't do the whole process but this is basically what i produced i've just rolled them up into little balls so i think that was the 70 is it the 73 the yellow bag i think that came out of the 45 i think it is and i think that came out of one of the higher bags and then i have this as well which is a mixture of everything so really really nice as you can see planked it all off look at that [Music] lots and lots of hashish ready to go so that's basically just a combination of everything i took off the screen i know you're probably about to take all the stuff off the screen but i'll just let it dry on the screen um don't like to fiddle around with it too much when it's all gakium i just like it to dry it's probably not the best way of doing it but hey it works and i have produced fantastic results out of just a little bit of trim to be fair and they these are good i've just rolled them slightly i haven't done a lot of work with them yet i can obviously roll them a bit more but that is lashes you know real nice color that would be the better quality one i think always managed to get a cat out on it that's the other one focus just a bit darker that one beautiful beautiful bit of hash [Music] and then that was the uh come on i think it was a come out of like the nighty bag or something that one it looks quite oily again really really nice just rolled them up into balls really really cool obviously you can run them a little bit more and just work it work the hash now work the hash work the hash he's lovely [Music] absolute bundle of joy you know what i mean do you know what i mean yeah hey up chop don't lose that [ __ ] so there we go [Music] let's have a little zoom in should we a little zoom in there first if we can get it oh [Music] check that out so obviously we're going to do the smoking review on this uh very shortly i just wanted to show you before i get into the review what i got out of just a little tiny bit of trim which just shows you not to chuck your trim away lovely that's the one take the air off it just take the air off that feel it there but it's [ __ ] massive on there [Music] that's the one i'm telling you that is the one there but yeah we will do the smoking review on these i'll have a bit i'll have a bit of these i'll review probably each one on separate reviews i probably won't review the little one i'll probably do these two as reviews and then i'll review this as well as a mixture [ __ ] it out look at that that is something to get excited about yes yes anyone knows the bubble ash they'll know it's [ __ ] strong um anywhere between 40 and i think about 60 as i remember because i asked dank don't told me that yes yes dang one love to you my brother right now guys so i'm gonna get this up i will speak to you guys really really soon hope you enjoy this little video give it a like give it a subscribe and like share just don't chuck your trim away don't chuck each other away peace out people one love", "4Jwgy80QvrE": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "RQppj42jV7M": "what is up it's your boy chronic i don't know how much of this you guys are going to be able to see in my face i'm going to try to angle it just right um it's your boy chronic we're back with another how-to so this time we are doing dry ice hash so as you can see i have dry ice in here um i've got my trim this is just just all the excess trim that was uh from hera so this is jack herrera trim we're going to be using one of the this is the 220 micron bag i have a set of bubble bags that i use and basically what i do is i go ahead and make sure all of this is in here and it doesn't slide out i make sure that i've got it all in this container sitting on this dry ice make sure it's uh really getting cold and then from here i go ahead and i give this a nice tie and now there are easier setups this is just my setup this is what works for me um you know this is just how i do it it's easiest for me you guys will see here in a second now another important thing i'm going to bring you guys over here hopefully you guys see this is this collection tray you definitely want a collection tray of some sort that's like a stainless steel or medical grade stainless steel or something uh you can collect with and uh the last thing you'll need is hey would you be able to grab me one of my business cards can you have a second okay last thing you'll need is a card to collect with i use a business card uh they're clean it's easy so let's uh start the process so basically i'm gonna scoot over towards you guys bring you guys a little bit closer and angle this down hopefully that stays there basically you just uh flip this over as you can see i mean all of that already and you wow and you basically just shake it up you just give it some tumbles thank you sweetheart business card keep it close to the tray uh basically guys you're gonna do this dry ice hash sifting for about 30 to 45 seconds maybe a minute until the color starts to change once the color starts to change that's when you're going to go ahead and collect you know do your first collection move it off and then do your second collection um basically as uh wow there's so much here as there as a it collects and breaks down with this dry ice more plant matter is going to come out so it's going to be more uncured so i usually do about 30 seconds um to 45 seconds minute tops for my first run because this is all trim and i know a lot of this is actually pretty quality i'm gonna go ahead and just do a minute so we're going to keep shaking just for a little bit longer i'm going to do my first collection and show you guys what we got so i generally also go based on the color tone so i am not only watching uh or counting in my head just like you know how i i am at i'm watching the color of the hash that's actually coming out so we're gonna go ahead and stop so i generally set this off to the side just like that take our collection card and we start collecting and we just have mounds and mounds and bounds of hash so this is uh the way to collect dry dry ice hatch guys so you're gonna watch me a few more times basically uh do this and i'm gonna do the rest with uh the rest of hera and i'll come back after i uh you know you guys will see the time lapse and everything of that but this is basically the general concept um 30 to 45 second intervals one minute max you really want to watch your color color is everything your nice golden tones are where you want to be sitting for your first run your your mid golden tones with a little green is where you want to be sitting your second run more green towards your third and fourth runs fairly green on your fifth and sixth run uh the seventh run i usually just don't even do i put the the material uh to use by doing edibles or putting it in my magic butter machine so that's how i make use of the last little bit of material that has trichomes on it so there's that so that is what we just collected um we're going to go ahead and do a second run don't do that guys do not do that barely got any out so we're going to scoot this over generally i don't like mixing these so i do actually press these separately these are my different press runs they all taste different they all have different quality for sure i press at about 190 degrees to 200 degrees for about 100 seconds and uh right now i'm using 90 micron i usually do 35 micron for hash but i have to use what i have to use uh so yeah that's what i'm using you guys will see that in the next video this one's just going to be uh the dry ice hash extraction so we're going to go for round two and it's looking mighty golden and nice still so that's a good sign lots and lots and lots and lots of heat so guys another key thing um you want to freeze your product before you actually use it this trim has been sitting in the freezer since i actually trimmed her um it was dried and cured everything was dried in here not cured sorry everything was dry so it was all dry product proper humidity um i didn't trap any moisture any unwanted anything unwanted but i definitely uh i definitely froze on my product the next bit of run we're going to be using is actually sitting in the freezer now i always suggest freezing it um you know the colder the bud the easier the trichomes are going to fall off you don't want to make it too too cold um you know you don't want to keep in the freezer for prolonged periods of time you can damage the trichomes you know a lot of people think crypto freezing is actually like really good to store your butt there's actually studies that show it it reduces the potency over time so you know there's generally if i'm gonna process um right away you know within that first three to five days i will go ahead and put my stuff straight to the freezer from um you know trimming however if i'm not going to process i go ahead and cure my bud or cure whatever i want to cure and um once it's you know cured i'm ready the day before i'll throw it in the freezer you know that way it has 24 hours to sit so we're gonna go ahead and stop this is gonna be our second collection i'm gonna kind of scoot it away from this edge here so i can set this down man just loads and loads and loads of thc guys just insane set that down right there you know what i actually have a tool for this let me grab it i don't even know why i'm not using it alrighty so now that i got my actual scraper that uh is designated for this because i'm a dingus i forgot i had it um oh my god look how easy that is the card was i was struggling with the card all right guys so there's our second run looking nice and uh pretty still gold still fairly golden brown golden still fairly tan like a sandy color with a little bit of green that's what i want so we're gonna go for our third one here in a second and i'll show you guys what it looks like and then i'm gonna get to doing uh more more dry sift hash here's the third one we're gonna same thing 30 to 45 seconds maybe a minute max looks like at this point it actually is coming to a halt on how much is in there so yep this will be the last run that i do for the trim and i'm going to trim with the used rest all righty she's getting pretty green so it's a good sign that more material is coming out than actual trichomes so we're going to go ahead and call that the last run for the trim and i'll go get actual hair bugs next which you guys will see some time lapse footage of so what the hell little fuzzies came falling down alrighty so then from here i take this out there's going to be dry ice in here and i'm going to want to as quick as possible get this stuff out guys don't touch dry ice with your bare hands it's bad it can hurt you but uh basically i take all the dry ice out because it's not done it's definitely still good all right guys we're back all right so i got my little collections and i need a sharpie alrighty so here's what i do here's third run of anything so all my third ones are going to go into this one this is how i stay organized keep myself clean and not contaminate my product it's important guys if you're going to do your own stuff at home damn it shut some of these lids don't shut whatever that's good enough um okay we're gonna be pressing today i don't give a [ __ ] about these lids so there's three there's two [Music] uh all right then let's take our product so we take the excess stuff that we did we're going to be using for the edibles go ahead and dump it all perfect so here it was seeded out so i'm just going through here and picking out any uh last seeds i see and we'll find they're healthy because you know here s ones are always awesome alrighty let me show you the last little bit of this before i go uh ocd picking through here with seeds which i'll be doing before i uh probably sift it before i put it in the stuff that's amazing so i'll show you how to prep this if when it's not already prepped and then that'll be the video guys so uh with product you definitely want to take it all off the stem so make sure that you take all the stems out um break your product up that works as well as just like you know chunking it off it is going to get broken up but i prefer to not have stem in my uh dry sift just makes it easier that again guys over top shake shake shake and you know what's up i want to say thanks for tuning in uh be sure to like comment

totally different uh all right let's get uh let's get this [ __ ] going um let's check on the amount of ice that we've got in the reservoir we'll see if we need to top it off i'm pretty sure we're going to go ahead and top it off with some more ice probably two more 20 gallon reservoirs full of ice which is i don't know i haven't waited i'm guessing when i fill up that trash can it's approximately 60 to 80 pounds of ice based on like when i have 20 pound bags of ice i'm just guessing you know probably about 60 to 80 pounds so i'm gonna add another 150 or so pounds of ice and then yeah we'll go ahead and get the bud and the bags and finish prepping the rest of that [ __ ] san bueno [Music] what's up cv [Music] [Music] ready to wake yeah [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] i fill this thing up almost all the way right and i do this i put about four to five of these in there just when i start the water then it gets to where you see it right now where a lot of the ice is melted the water is really cold but it's not full and i add a couple more and we're cranking the ac at 62. ugh [Music] [Music] [Music] looking at the movies [Music] [Music] we pray to god [Applause] got that all the way open we got the booster pump on i think yeah the booster pump is plugged in out there [Music] we don't have any other pumps or anything on so that should fill up the rest of the way pretty quick and be nice and frosty [Music] [Applause] do i have enough to start a wash sure i'm sure [Music] now you're gonna have to excuse my mess i've been trimming in here so i don't want to hear no [ __ ] but you know me i'm transferring i show it make sure this valve is closed back here we're gonna go ahead and fire up the freeze dryer and pull the trays we're gonna clean the trays and then um [Music] me [Music] alcohol [Music] and then i'm gonna go ahead and [Music] hit my seal with a little bit of iso sometimes when you collect the uh the higher micron stuff that's fluffier and you go up the uh the freeze dryer you'll get a little bit of um almost like backdraft sort of it's basically just a lighter fluffier ash and it wants to go towards the uh the vacuum the vacuum cloth and so it'll cause a little bit of the hash to stir up and so every once in a while if that happens you gotta wipe out the hatch from wherever it flies onto most of the time it just goes to the seal so you just wipe it off the inner part of the seal a little bit of alcohol every once in a while you'll get some that builds up in the shelves you can take the whole seal off the door wipe it down you can pull the shelving unit out of the whole pretty much freeze dryer chamber if you want and you can vacuum it out you can wipe it out [Music] i'll be doing a uh a little bit of a maintenance video on the freeze dryer um here in about a month [Music] during that time i'll show you guys how to disassemble the freeze dryer and inspect it in certain areas for certain things and then how to clean it and put it back together [Music] so i'm just hitting my seal that the door forms a really good seal and you make sure that you get into one vacuum [Music] and there we go [Music] take my cover off we'll put the cover back on a little bit [Music] come on [ __ ] get on there right thank you okay [Music] lagging huh [Music] close out some of this [ __ ] i got open on my phone holy moly i had a lot of [ __ ] open [Music] better all right so now i'm gonna just flip the freeze dryer on it turns on and it says updating log files and blah blah during that time if you have a thumb stick in the um side of the freeze dryer or whatever it will go ahead and update the log files that you have on the thumbstick [Music] sit sit we're going to have that [ __ ] unplugged i'm going to put it back in real quick [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] i just noticed there is no slaps unacceptable i'm tired of seeing everybody else's slapped up [ __ ] freeze dryers sorry my man puffin i

[Music] is i if it dies we're coming back", "hW5TgxTmkrE": "what's up YouTube it's your boy central kelly green with another video in this video we show you guys how i make my hash so i I make bubble hash guys I make dry sift hash guys I make all kinds of different type of hash this one is gonna be my bubble hash so I have bubble bags this is the generic version guys this one is VEVO Sun as you guys can see these are VEVO Sun one gallon uh bulb X I got a a four bag set up here so we have a 45 micron a 73 micron a 160 micron and our 220 I think it micron we have leaves in here and ice and we have our water we pretty much have a broomstick right guys put that broomstick down real quick and come on over here alright so we got our material on him here we pretty much have our ice and our Leafs and stem so you can use buds you he use fan leaves he's whatever you want either way you're gonna get trichomes some people don't like to use fan leaves and their leaves because they think it's a waste time but I don't like to waste any material so I'll make some hash and then after I do this this will turn into compost alright so uh yeah I go over here with my uh my broomstick you go on in there and you're gonna is gonna shake it on up and pretty much what's happening here guys is the ice is mixing with the water and getting all the trichome heads and and knocking all the trichome heads off of your leaf and your earbud weight whatever wouldn't you're using and then they're gonna fall into them each one of these screens after you mix it up guys quick tip let your water sit for like about a minute or two this is gonna let your trichome heads fall on down through the bags and then you'll be able to not worry about water that's trichrome heads that are still floating in the water cause you want the trichrome heads to settle on down and give it about maybe about a five minute turn because the more that you turn it the more of a risk that you could get chlorophyll from the green leaves or your green bud you get your risk getting chlorophyll into your water and bleaching into your water and bleaching into your hash and it just gives it a different taste that you don't want and that might ruin your hash so yeah give that a good turn and then gonna come on over to here we got ourselves a dry station this is our hash that we just made today get it on over here remember guys this is all from Leafs so it's not gonna be as good as if you make it from bud you can see the greener color from here that's from the leaves this is the gonna be the yellow bag and then this one is gonna be the purple bag guys kind of looks like dirt but as it dries it's gonna like gray up on me as you guys can see from over here you just actually see the more of the color on the paper get it to focus there you guys go as you guys to see that this is what gives you more of a better realistic view of what it is from the color that's the resin trying to dry up you can put a dry it up on a different type of material compared to a napkin it's just what I have guys and I'm using it on four leaves so it's not like a high priority really yep this one's just gonna be another quick lunch from central kelly green on how i make bubble hash and you can actually get this guys and make hash i mean make wax out of it sorry about that you can actually get these guys and make wax out of it with rosin or which your uh concentrates like butane or propane or co2 so real quick one guys get your bow bags get your material get your ice get your water stir it up give it about five minutes or less let it sit for a minute start taking each bag out one by one get a spoon spoon out the bottom of the mesh screen put your material over here let it dry for about a day or two and smoke on guys send another one from such a category pace", "JYLgNByhkRw": "what's up guys it's bud and I'm J geeks calm and today we are gonna do an old-school review like we used to do I figure since hemp is now federally legal and there's no reason that I shouldn't be able to post a review of federally legal hemp so let's give it a try hopefully you won't get a strike but we'll see alright so this is some CB flower I just recently got from Wisconsin flower dot-com it was sent to me as a sample just to try and I got four different products this is a sour tsunami and this is the first time I've ever tried this strain it's really good and this one is canna tonic and yeah also really good these two are actually I'm trying to think I think they're related sour tsunami and canna tonic somehow and ac/dc and all the strains like that but it's really cool to be able to try a couple of these old-school high CBD low THC strains really really cool so they're yeah so I just tried them they're very kind of floral sweet piney they're very similar and taste I think the only difference was the Kanna tonic I liked the flavor a little bit better and it was but it did have a little bit more of a bitter aftertaste but very good though very high-quality these are very dense nice-looking dogs and let's see they've got this which is really cool it's bubble hash not exactly sure what the bubble part means that I think the way this is John is uh basically it's filtered well basically the plant matters mixed in ice water and then you filter the water and the resin and all that stuff here separates so I've never done it but I've seen videos of it done you can look it up on YouTube but this is really good I drew I tried it as best I could I stuck a a chunk of it in my in my vaporizer and very sweet very floral a nice taste and it's also kind of cool because you can kind of squeeze it and mold it but product that was just the coolest thing probably that I've ever ever tried is this one and and I've actually tried it before but this is rosin and the way this is made is it's basically stick a bud into a press that's eated and then you squeeze it and it basically squishes out all of the resin and cannabinoids in and terpenes and all and this is it and using this [Music] it's a vaporizer but it's specifically for extracts so pretty cool and yeah it just tastes amazing this this is probably the best taste of any kind of cannabis product that you can have just amazing amazing taste super sweet I mean it just it's it's a mixture of like candy and flowers and just like and super super good anyway a huge thank you to Luke for sending this and you guys should definitely go check out his website I'll put a link in the description so you can check it out and yeah that's it for now keep an eye out for a video that's this is kind of I know I haven't done reviews like this for a little while but there's a little more coming really soon probably either maybe tonight but ponds tomorrow so stay tuned and I'll talk to you guys soon have a great night have a great day and alright peace talk to you later bye", "X6HZaQwKV2w": "all right let's see if we can get this okay so this is what my bubble hash used to look like this is a year ago and then just pull it out for drain us out and this one is not hard to deal with so I'll break that open like what's the warrant a little bit too and temperature so this is a almost year-old and maybe because I didn't separate it quickly I don't know what it was this is just it crumples up get you out hey does all that but it was just not what I was looking for still good the older it gets the better it's gonna get so back into you know cut him open once they warm up a little bit now this is just pressed five grams by hand I'll crack it open but I want to show you guys this is so [ __ ] so this was attempt five days ago hand press put in jar container and then put in the refrigerator properly I'm not even touching it that is so beautifully that it's not even touching it about a quarter of inch look at it just bubbling away the head is so beautiful whoa the flame didn't even touch it man that is amazing been smoking on it but wow you're that guys so this is just the one I pressed by hand the rest of the stuff is drying out and that one I'm going to press with pressure in that'll be glass bottle with hot water warm water with this is only a few days old one eat it some amazing if I leave it out it'll actually start melting down and this is our 15:1 the one I had against the plant I'm gonna go against the wall in the backyard my own homegrown I'm like I said this is just a hand pressed one it's not the whole thing I've been smoking on it so this one I think I'm gonna have to pull off tonight yeah I want to stab myself this is a little more harder and I'm assuming because I beat up the material it gives me just a little bit everything I mean it's not look at that year-old no save this bubble no cooing just wanted to catch on fire but question about a year old hash bet that's gonna smoke good I just put some hair on that look at that got it dirty so imagine what this is gonna be after a year mm-hmm so I'm like I got it dirty again I don't have any Sylvain so what I'm looking into our jars glass containers I can't store these in I wonder if ceramic might be an option with hash in this shape or this state or this form or whatever man I bet I'm telling you this dilemma is a different and that's why the pros have tweezers and it it is so on mine the 25 just shows exactly what I did pulled it early that's exactly what I did and that's what it showed so I would ended up with a lot more 25 smaller heads the one we just pulled from the local gardener that dude is on the mark all right everybody happy Friday I'm still washing so I'll give a total as soon as I get something love this new phone I can record longer all right everybody peace", "eFiel9veTzY": "[Music] welcome to true buds TV it's your buddy Jack here with Chris making some bubble hash today yep how you doing guys we're gonna take some of our trim from the garden we had leftover this year and turn it into something good we've got everything frozen and the freezer here we've got our little portable washing machine our bubble man bubble bags here cold water pressing screens we've got our micro plan for our last step here and we're just gonna get started here so first step this we're gonna put some ice in our little portable washing machine here we're gonna fill our our zipper bubble bag here with some trim let it freeze in here get super cold and then we're gonna fill it up with this bucket of ice cold water we got here turn this sucker on for about 15 minutes let it go then we're gonna strain it through these bubble bags jack has here that's gonna separate all our different grades of hash we're gonna have we're gonna spoon it out put it on our pressing screens here and then begin the drying process so this is some of the finished product or almost finished product from our bubble hash here these are your different layers of bags this is the 160 micron which is like the biggest holes in the bag so you can see it has a little bit of debris in there it's not like the quality you're looking for it's basically like filtering out what you don't want in there then this one is our 120 here it's getting a little bit better still a little bit of debris in that then this is the 73 this one looks the best to me here it's got like minimal to no debris or little diff like blacks or green spots in there so this is the best one this smoke for me from the 25 right here it looks actually pretty good right here it's not gonna be as good as your 73 it's gonna have some finer particles your bigger trichrome heads are all gonna be in this 73 micron one here wouldn't it guess that yeah that's weird and then so like the next step is to let these dry out we can let them dry at room temperature put them in the freezer to help them dry out then we've got like a microplane which is like basically like an extremely fine cheese grater and we're gonna take them and grade them up and do a powder which is easy to just sprinkle on a join or smoke or we can just press these and some rosin but you've got options what you want to do from this point we just got to dry it out and then we're good to friggin smoke this stuff now we're in the game yeah yeah this is true bust em Harry J nah we ain't doing this for my stoners and from my cannabis Susy is talking edibles and bringing comedy let's get it time to pass it to the left and we can have a smoke session hey can't a true love for my troopers light it up and I'm on it this might take me way back sweet man I got five on it and their cutter sativa anything that you need break it down like the weed this is trooper Stevie troopers I'm a STONER I'm a smoker it's a hobby it's a lifestyle and a culture yeah yeah troopers

two containers of fresh frozen grade-a bud bunch of the tops from mostly one with some of a second blue dream this is a bubble bag dude bubble hash machine I think originally it was for clothes probably got a 15 minute timer on it very basic there's the timer for the soap is done so the material that's in there isn't a work bag with two bags of ice layered like a cake with demineralized water it just soaked for 15 minutes and now I'm gonna do my first wash first wash I'm gonna do is five minutes you don't want to do the first wash for very long because that's where your primo stuff is first and second wash mostly so I got to put my bubble bags in the bucket here so I can drain what comes out of that washing machine into or through the bubble bags so I'm gonna start this anyways and then I have to properly layer the bubble bags you want to start with the best smallest micron which in my case is 25 and put that in the bucket first then 73 then I think it's 120 or 160 and etc

finally decided on a name for myself so that's what we're gonna call me it's the basement botanist you can follow me on instagram i'm gonna start posting up some pictures and stuff there pretty soon so you guys check it out i just wanted to show you what i got going on here getting ready to do a bubble run not gonna do it tonight i'm gonna do it in the morning i know it's kind of overkill having three buckets but this is just the way i do it works out well for me so what we have here is our work bag our 220 i went ahead and cleaned all these out thoroughly it's been a while since I've done any runs so you want to make sure that your bags are all very clean you want to get in what I do is I take rubbing alcohol fill it into one of these buckets not any of these but a different bucket and then the screens are in the bottom here so you'll want to take just make sure that these are all cleaned out really well so I just put rubbing alcohol in the bottom and then wash the bags out with it make sure everything is cleaned out make sure all the screens are clean so what we have here is the 220 work bag and then the 160 so this is my work bucket none of this will be kept this is all day long end up being anything in the 160 you're not going to keep it's just garbage it's just a filter bag essentially to filter out anything that's coming through the work bag essentially you'll have a lot of kind of chunks of green plant material a lot of that stuff down there in the 160 bags so take it out take it from here pull these bags up take this bucket pour it into here which is our ones this is the 120 bag and underneath that we have the 73 I went ahead on this round I'm gonna go ahead and skip the 90 on this run and we're just gonna do anything that would catch in the 90 we're just going to catch it in the 73 bag and then here we have our 45 bag this is the one that tends to catch the most it's not the best quality the best quality is going to be in your 73 but most the time actually I even a lot of times I've actually thrown out the 120 stuff so it just depends on the strain and everything so we'll see but everything in that 73 bag is definitely going to be a keeper that'll be your that'll be your full melt anything in the 45 it's going to be probably the most you're gonna have probably twice as much in the 45 bags you're gonna have in the 73 bag but it won't be full melt it's really good hash but it won't be you know won't melt completely like like in the 73 bag then we have the 25 bag which kind of catches all your like food grade type I mean I don't know it's not the greatest stuff it's more like just pieces of trichomes and stems definitely works does the trick for you I got a buddy who really likes the stuff out of the 25 he doesn't mind taking that so he just throws it on top of bowls smokes it up and he seems to like it just adds a little bit to his flour he likes doing that I just wanted to show you this little tip that I did here so once you go from here into here you're gonna start rinsing so you'll start rinsing out your hash just spraying water on top of it to wash all the green material out make it nice and golden but when you do that in these buckets just depending on how much you have to rinse they could tend to get really full not usually in this one but if you were to not you know if you were just leave it in this eventually you're gonna get up really high and it's really hard to get the bags to drain that's 25 bag takes a really long time to drain out once it has [ __ ] all collected in the screen so what I've done here just taking a whole stop cut a hole in the bottom of this bucket so it just drains right out into the sink when you're done so less mess less stress it's a lot easier that way definitely recommend it so I'm gonna do a run in the morning I just got all these set up I got them all cleaned they're all ready to go so I just have to essentially just put my ice in my material into the work bag I stir for anywhere from 5 to 7 minutes no longer than that it's kind of a waste of time and then I start filtering my bags out once a pour it in here just drains out the bottom and you know out your sink and you know have to worry about it again and then you go ahead and do your second run when I hand stir everything so I don't have a bubble machine so it's easier for me to work that way excuse me so yeah that's what I do just wanted to show you guys give you a little tip on on you know the bubble bag situation and how I do things so we will go ahead and like I said run this in the morning so I do a 5 5 to 7 Minister filter everything through pull my work bag out with the ice and the material in it put that back into the freezer once I have everything drained out cleaned out then I'll go ahead and do a second run with it same material stir it again and you'll get you know maybe a third of what you got before but it's definitely not a waste of your time I don't I mean if I had a bubble machine you do three or four you can even do five six runs with it but to me it seems kind of a waste of time so that's what I do so five to seven minutes to filter it out first run goes in all the water goes out refill your bucket with ice and water you'll be they'll be quite a bit ice in there but you want to refresh everything let it sit for a few minutes let everything make sure everything's ice-cold again stir again for five to seven minutes run it through again and that's what I do so you guys have any questions or comments please let me know and I'm going to be running some older material some fresh frozen for my last harvest which was quite quite a while ago so we'll see how it turns out it's probably not gonna be the best but you know that's just how it goes but I'm not gonna waste all the trim that I have sorry I haven't had any grow videos I'm not growing currently but I will get back to it soon I'm trying to figure out what I'm gonna do eventually I'd like to move out to the west coast so I can you know do this and not have to worry about anything so guys again if you have any questions or comments let me know this is the bait basement botanist coming to you live from token reef Laura de and I'm out", "apauT0_ovWA": "yo what's up YouTube alright guys today we're gonna present some rosin I already started this is a second run a bubble how should I made it was a little darker so it came out a little bit darker it smells [ __ ] fire though I'm using the Dooley Tech [ __ ] bags I just left over from when I purchased them to be honest Dooley Tech [ __ ] sucks they're at least their bags do I don't know how the rest of the products do but they're [ __ ] bags they suck [ __ ] ass I had a blowout on that one there and I was the 3 grams or 2 grams two and a half grams of bubble hash I was running at a high temp so I dropped the temperature down this is what I'm gonna run at seven grams of some full melt bubble hash this [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire guys it's sticky sticky one it's really really really sticky really fire you could just see how sticky that [ __ ] is it smells [ __ ] amazing this is all of my strings together so it's pretty much a hybrids indica it's actually Kryptonite gelato and gorilla glue you can just look at the quality of this [ __ ] hash it's [ __ ] fire but yeah we're gonna go ahead and pack this up in the bad guys and give me one second so I can get this set up so you guys can get a little bit of a better look get some parchment paper cut out [Music] so what are you guys up to today you guys having any time for Tuesday I don't go into work until tonight so I'm pretty much free all day long until the evening falling so by MIDI mid mid day and then I go to work but until then I meet this hash yesterday oh it came out pretty good I ended up getting about oh I want to say I want to say I got about 10 grams I guess of bubble hash and that was - how many how many ran it watched it twice I didn't do it any more than that the second wash I did I was doing a little bit aggressive and came out a little darker it was an amber like this first one here it was still sticky it just came out a little bit darker actually came out a lot doctor that's the bow hash like that's the rosin I just showed you guys in the and the other one I went ahead and flipped the bag inside out there's and that's the actual hash but yeah I went ahead and flipped the bag inside out and I'm gonna go ahead and load it up in the bag now what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna slide it in there as best as I can without hopefully it doesn't stick too much to the bag all right it went right in so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna fold it over on itself guys got a nice little puck in there I'm not gonna cut this bag I cut the last one little Desai's just uh hope you nothing bad would happen but I don't know I might even double bag this guy's cuz I had a blowout on the last one I don't want to have a blowout on this one but maybe I just want press as hard maybe I'll just go a little softer you know I think that's probably what he's gonna do so let's go ahead and head over to the press guys this is my press face it's a 12-ton press and I'm running got pressed as far as the heat plates I did drop the temp a little bit but I think I'm gonna drop that even more guys and I'm gonna do a real real slow press on this so I'm gonna go ahead and set these temps a little lower I'll go to 175 I was running at 200 earlier and I dropped it down to 180 but it wasn't all the way down to 180 when I pressed it was like at 190 I want to say so I'm gonna run that in a lower temp 175 I'm gonna bet that go ahead and drop for a minute until then I'm just gonna go ahead and get set up here I'm running 3x3 dad pressed plates these [ __ ] plates are [ __ ] pretty good guys I haven't had any issues with this press or this plate these plates for since I bought it actually is still pretty new I've only used though I've used the hell out of it I've pressed a lot of [ __ ] flowers as you can see I pressed there's some rosin chips right here this when people refer to rosin chips this is what they're talking about guys this is the leftovers of your actual presses and they're still resin in those guys you can save those and you can use them for butter I'll go ahead and show you exactly what I'm talking about guys let's up here see that stuff right there that's coconut oil it's a little mouthy because I have it on the top cabinet and I have the heat on now but usually it's pretty solid it's just like a butter it's coconut oil pretty much you just boil it in coconut oil and sift it all out and there's your edibles and you can make whatever you want I actually made some cookies the other day and some brownies and they came out [ __ ] amazing guys matter of fact I still got some right here I used about half - half ratio we took my cookie between the butter and the coconut oil but I like my [ __ ] strong guys and I put actually about a half a pound over those rods and chips I want to say not a half pound maybe about 7 ounces 6 ounces of these rosin chips into about 3 cups of that coconut oil and that [ __ ] came hush 204 guys literally came out strong with some good [ __ ] but yeah the temps are starting to drop two hours you could see the right side drop in faster than the left side is that's just the top and bottom plates but it'll match up real soon here guys but yeah at least this [ __ ] rosin press is [ __ ] kicking ass guys I really like pressing but I used to do a lot of BA chose but be honest that's just it costed me a lot of money than butane and my time and it was dangerous [ __ ] this is way more easier it's safer and not to mention your terpenes man this [ __ ] [ __ ] you preserve all your terpenes on all your flavor of all you of all your Rosen's you put your Preston guys she just comes out [ __ ] fire but yeah man I ever since I've gotten my press and and started running it I actually love it it's it doesn't get any better than this I should say because like I said it's just the terpene profile itself if you're doing a really low dab really low press as far as the heat you [ __ ] flavor profile of the buds it's [ __ ] amazing especially if they're fresh buds and there they were within three or four weeks of being picked or harvested man you're gonna have amazing amazing [ __ ] rosin I've actually had a almost clear rosin come out I bet you that's what this is gonna end up doing it's gonna come out really really amber really clear it's not gonna be dark at all especially if you're running on a low temp you're gonna get some [ __ ] amazing I used to press this windows breath and I'm not even lying dude it was stink my whole house up it's not like like fruity pebbles it was amazing I I was amazed the first time I pressed that stuff I was like [ __ ] and just the way it smelled my pressed is the way it tasted and it was amazing it was good stuff just the act rosin is the way to go especially if you're doing it yourself and you got that you can do it with your own product it's just so much fresher taste so much better you'll never want to go back to being chose again be a chose or thing of the past as far as I I think I'm gonna have a pretty good little run off with this at this amount of hash but I'm not sure we'll see it's only about it's actually not even a full quarter it's about six six point four six point five and then there's my six and a half grams but it's still a pretty good amount of rosin so I mean of hash so we're gonna go ahead and press it out and see what we get I'm not really worried about my turn I'm more worried about the bag blowing out his [ __ ] bags and I'm not easily tech bags they suck man I haven't had one good experience and and I've tried different microphones actually when I purchased these I bought them for zoo they were cheaper and I figured well [ __ ] maybe it's just uh it's I mean it's got to be the same micron regardless so I figured I don't know there's ditch quality or whatever but these bags I've had blowout so I'm pretty much every single bag that I ran even in flowers flowers a little bit easier to contain and then the oils as far as hatched when you're when you're pressing so I'm gonna take it real slow on this one I'm not gonna force it I'm just gonna let it melt its way down through the people bed I'm gonna take it slow and easy on this one I'm not gonna force it I got it right on the edge because uh it's not gonna be pushing anything out it's not gonna be expanding too much so we're just gonna go ahead and paint it down so about right there I'm not pushing it too much we're just gonna let it start melting and you can see immediately it starts it starts shooting out rosin so I'm just gonna let it go ahead and mount melt it through the bag and let it do it low and slow those times I might even drop the temp a little bit more to 165 which I think I'm gonna do right now so that way by the end of my press it should be cooler than it was when it started over water 167 that should be good yeah they do that gold and honey okay I'm just painting it down as on just taking it very easy I don't want to blow through this bag and [ __ ] this batch of hat or bras it up even if I have to press it halfway through and then take it out and redo it again I will I don't wanna blow through this bag and you can just look at that color guys and you know what I'm gonna give me one second alright guys sorry about that [ __ ] bag blew through if I have to go clean it up repack it [ __ ] put another bed over it Pam [ __ ] ass I wasn't even putting that much pressure on it these [ __ ] bags guys if you ever buying Dooley Tech to be honest they're [ __ ] shits garbage stay away from it from what I can tell they're a [ __ ] rosin presses are half decent I wouldn't say they're the best but they'll get the job done like I say get what you pay for pretty much so I'm gonna go ahead and pause this video guys I'm gonna keep a good eye on this that way I don't [ __ ] it up and I'll start the video up as soon as the rosin starts coming out alright guys we're getting some rosin off the side I'm trying not to push it too hard I don't wanna blow through the bag and [ __ ] up my [ __ ] so I'm just taking it really really slow that's why sorry I bought the video being so long guys looks like it's starting to come out on this side as well I would when it came off on the last batch I cleaned out around where blew out on this corner you could tell the change in the color looked like the raw slick the rosin like the hash I'm sorry so I went ahead and just cleaned up what was cleaning on the other I tell it from the other parchment paper in the kitchen guys but yeah I got it on a really low temp it's I 165 166 it's jumping up and down between the 67 or 66 we'll see how the the end product looks I'm just applying light pressure I don't know why these Dooley tech bags do that [ __ ] man they're [ __ ] garbage every [ __ ] one I've used even for flowers it's just garbage I guess if you're on a budget but even if you're in a budget it's not worth it because you're gonna [ __ ] get you're gonna get plant matter in your in your rosin or you're gonna get hashing your rods depending on how you're pressing just almost better just to press the but by itself and use their [ __ ] so I got my hand on the handle as I'm just pulling it down slightly as I as I see the rosin coming out and it's coming out of all sides days looking pretty good so it's Laos [ __ ] amazing just to know what I can smell it looks nice color nice and amber and I know this videos longer I started about the length of it I should have maybe I'll edit it and I really don't have a lot of pressure on it now guys I'm barely putting pressure on it I don't have a gauge on this to tell me how many tons I'm putting on it but from [ __ ] that I pressed in the past I'm not putting very much weight on it at all just with the way to my hand on here I can pull the lever down that's how much that's I mean that just goes to show you how hard I'm pushing on it I'm not really pulling on here at all wait until it all melts goes through the screen and then I'm gonna try to press out at the end maybe I'll hold off and just let it let the pressure push out what's there and then I'll clean it off and then I'll press it again afterwards but I'm gonna go ahead and cut this video guys it's really heading on 20 minutes 17 minutes I don't want to make it too long he does have a good day be careful darkness", "zw5P6DHiQYM": "yo what up YouTube alright guys I got my temp set to 175 we're just reaching temp now I just dropped it in I put in a half ounce a little more than a half ounce a bubble hash and just Keef and a bunch of hash little I say about just over a half rounds I'm barely putting any any pressure on this cuz I double begged it let the dirty your microphone screen I just don't wanna have a blowout so I'm taking my time with this low and slow letting it get to temp and then I'll let it heat up for about so you could see the rosin is already trying to melt out but I'm gonna go ahead and let it heat up make sure this the core is nice and gooey before I start to press I don't wanna have a blower like I said I I read this is a totally different way of me pressing guys I made a little like a little pocket and I uh all the rosin is gonna come out through the front every last bit of it like I said I'm not sure exactly what I should yield shouldn't be at least a quarter ounce little more than a quarter ounce maybe 10 grams of rosin and I'm done I'm hoping but we'll see but it should be a decent yield it shouldn't be anything small that's why I went ahead and I put the channels on the side of my parchment paper so that way when it starts to run down it'll actually stop at the edge here and we'll see how much comes out guys like I say I'm not putting any pressure on this the plates aren't even touching it and it's already starting to ooze out like I said it's all about the preheat on the on the on the material you don't wanna you don't want to put it in there and automatically put all kinds of pressure on it cuz you'll blow through your bags unless you're just pressing flour you can do that if you're just pressing a gram or two but if you're using bags it's the best take your time and then lower the tempt better but the product will be as far as you on the product really to be honest some plants will put out more or some pencil to put out less oil or something cloths that be some will come up or shatter like around for a little bit some other to use some of its a little a little bit older but it's still all fire it smells amazing like I said most of this should come out the front like I said I made the little pocket envelope so that way doesn't go all up the sides it pushes the drink out the front starts to cool down immediately it smells amazing really fruity I dropped in about poly four or five different grades of hash from the 80 to the 30 and everything in between she's definitely flowing and like I said I still don't have a lot of pressure on him easing her in the more that I put the faster it coming out whether I'm like I said take your time I'm only running at 175 degrees which is really really low I could have bought even went a little lower this hash was so was so good that it actually started to melt altogether just from touching it so that's how you know it's good quality hash it'll melt in your hand just from the heat of your body so far so good she's running she's looking good that's pretty good amount of well looks a little darker than than what I usually do but it's alright she smells amazing I was planning on making some edibles with this I'll use some of it to dab with as well now I'm putting all the pressure on guys it was not just I can put on I guess as a 12-time prayer so you can see all the different colors and grades of hash inside of this oil it's actually not too bad I bet you thought I'd put it out and find out Little Dipper right it smells amazing it's a big ol blood to lava I think I like this little pocket method that I did I think I'll do this again next time and Ike I say you get it pushes everything out the front I think I'll go out the sides as you can see and it's double triple layered as far as parchment paper goes so I like it I mean I've never done it before so really really good I got a nice little run and didn't quite meet the end of it but that's quite a bit of rosin guys these are my little magnets you can just see how my phone's about to die guys but hopefully you guys liked this video I'll leave it in the comments how much I pulled out in the in the final wait if you guys want to check that out but um yeah have a good one guys stay safe and stay medicated", "Ht6X9fAG9zQ": "while the color of bubble hash can be indicative of a variety of factors including indoor versus outdoor material cured versus fresh frozen material and freshly made versus age / melt civility is not one of them without doing the fire test you never know what you're dealing with I recently dabbed ninety micron bubble hash its color was a mild beige that would have tricked the eyes of the unexperienced but it did not perform micron isolation does not ensure melts ability either you will learn all of this information and more at my upcoming class in Oakland California on February 23rd kinds of this hands-on training to elevate your knowledge

I had like 26 point look 27 grams of weed and I washed it probably ten times I watched it - I couldn't get nothing else looks pretty [ __ ] good and of course it'll get darker when it dries but it don't look bad now phrase the rest of the [ __ ] and I just gotta rinse this thing out scraped everything out and [ __ ] put it in a cup and phrase it and then down the line I'll save another batch and I'll do what I did before with the other [ __ ] and see what we get out of it this way it won't be moldy is that other [ __ ] is just garbage that I made it's got a notch I'd lighten it up it doesn't even hardly light up and it tastes like like old water you know what I mean like that's taste but anyway I haven't waited up I'm gonna let it dry and press it all and then I'll wet and see what I get it looks like probably about 3 grams probably maybe it was three and a half maybe a little more I figure I gotta get out 2.6 would be 10% so it's more than that and it looks like pretty good quality that lighter [ __ ] right here that piece this piece right here this lighter face that's 90 I think 90 was the magic number with this [ __ ] now of course this is the [Music] a higher numbers but everything's basically about the same it's a little darker one piece right here that's not even half yeah babies it's like six hours of the work", "TjA1NEGXif0": "hey it's mad at Rafal stereos and welcome to a special three-part episode of canna basics first we're going to make dry ice cave then we're going to press it into rosin and then we want to convert that to e juice this episode is brought to you by dayz screens glass screens quality reusable glass screens and cleaning supplies are available at parley car Matic calm and we'll talk more about them later now in this first episode we're going to be making our own dry ice Keefe and of course we're gonna start with cannabis flowers to do that so the amount that you use is up to you but we're using about 10 grams and if you're using less than an ounce you'll want a one gallon bucket more than an ounce at a time you'll want 5 gallon buckets and then micron screens I'll put links to where you can find these micron screens on Amazon but they're bubble bags bubble hash bags there's what they're generally called and you'll need at least one about 120 or 93 microns around there and then probably a larger one like 220 you'll also want to make sure that you have some good protective gloves for your hands when dealing with frozen co2 because it's very very cold colder than regular ice and also you'll need about 10 pounds or less you usually have to buy it at 10 pounds at a time and that should be enough to do a couple ounces ok the first thing we're going to do is to load our bucket for this demonstration just to make it easy math we're using 10 grams of cannabis flowers we're going to put that directly into the bucket and then on top of that we're going to add our dry ice the dry ice I broke it into little smaller chunks with the hammer a minute ago and I'm using about pound and a half or so with this 10 grams [Music] and once it in there you want to cover it with your bag and for demonstration I'm using this - 20 microns green bag but you'd want to start with your smallest micron screen probably around 93 or I'm using a 120 micron but then once you have it in there you can just toss it around for 30 seconds to a minute just to make sure that everything is nice and cold before you start actually doing the shaking process okay so now we're going to go with our first run and this one I'm using the 120 micron which are smaller screen so once you have everything cold and children ready you're going to turn it upside down so that the cannabis and the dry ice falls on top of the screen and then you start shaking it gently up and down like a pepper shaker and make sure you have a nice clean surface I have a stainless steel table that's very clean but you could also use parchment paper [Music] and then after you've sifted and you start not getting much the sift coming out when you shake the bag it's time to start collecting it you can use a credit card or just a business card or some sort of flat edged material and then just grape it up and then you can put that on a parchment or into a bag or whatever you wanted to use to store it in we weighed this and we had just about a grand about three-quarters of a gram there so now we're going to switch and we're going to do a second run and then just kind of show you a demonstration of what the difference green sizes will do now we've got a two 20 micron which is almost double not quite double the size holes and you're gonna see now when we're starting the same plant material that we use before we're gonna get a lot more through of course we're getting through a lot now of plant material but this is a good way to make sure you're getting all of it out of your out of your cannabis all your THC [Music] and you'll see on the second run we've got a lot more than we did the first time like about five times more yield but the potency of this is going to be a lot less because you're getting a lot more plant material so for our purposes moving forward we're going to use this for cooking and different things like that and then the first batch that we use before is what we'll be using to press for our EGS in the end we're just showing you what we were able to achieve there we had 3.2 grams there just over three-quarters of a grand there so we had just over four grams of Keef in general which was about a 40% yield [Music] before we move on I would like to talk a little bit more about Daisy screens and thank them for sponsoring this video but Daisy screens are like your classic glass screens I remember these from back in the day and the 90s we used to use these kind of glass screens quite a bit but one thing that's really cool about them is other than they keep your bong a lot cleaner and you know a better way to smoke by using a screen is that they're reusable unlike the mesh screens that just burn through and wear out over time these glass screens as long as you keep up with them you can always bring them back to new put them back into your poll and so you're good so one pack of these our last year a lifetime so again visit polychromatic comm to learn more about their products and cleaning supplies make sure you stay tuned to roughhouse studios because our next video or our next canopy 6 video is going to be pressing this into rosin and then we're going to convert that into EGS so be sure to visit ruffhouse studios.com for hundreds of cannabis culture videos made just for you this is matt from FL studios thank you for watching [Music] you", "HoKMbJw3b1g": "welcome to the shed this I start images and we're going to do another kind of a product review so I might not might dude to come through to bring me some weed I've already done a review on that strain so it's not detrimental to do a video on it but other than they have something good to smoke on why do a video um this one is gonna show you [ __ ] yeah tiny little baby pile of weed so I did a video a while ago about half-baked Medi menu so I did a review on this company as a whole and then some of the products that I got so now I'm gonna go back into this is called the hash-slinging slasher little flash your dude it's 120 120 micron bag from some bubble hash so we're actually gonna drop the camera for a second and we top of this so most people are gonna be like yeah that's just [ __ ] Keith but you know if you go watch a video on bubble hash you'll you'll see this isn't the best purity that you can get from making bubble hash I would imagine that would be the 75 micron I think it's a lower I think it's like a 90 or something so I'm sure like that um but then it's an even lighter color than this from the videos I watched and the one time I watched my buddy do it but he only had three bags this company uses seven bags so we're gonna drop a bunch of this into this pile we're gonna roll it all up and we're just gonna talk and smoke it and that'd be my [ __ ] well if I get smoked video for the day as you can see the [ __ ] is empty little tub that I can clean that out and use for to go rain scoffs your little snack cups or something from a kid and something after it's completely cleaned and sterilized and whatever the [ __ ] else that needs to happen to make sure that it no residue of particles are left that could possibly get my son high I'm not saying that's what I'm going to do I'm just saying that is something that could be done or a use that could be could just be reusable fill up your Keef catcher in your triple stage or your Keef box I'll scrape it out save batches of just [ __ ] keep in here until you're ready to press it or whatever but most people got glass jars and [ __ ] for that just saying if you got a bunch of these laying around you know there's other uses you can make of it this is just me making the paper a little smaller because I don't have as much weed how you guys all doing the day doing pretty fine lazy day so I'm out with my son all day a couple think it's like roughly a month worth the time and I'll be going back to work for the summer it cannot wait you know I've been bored [ __ ] like you having gaming smoking doing whatever so it's not like I've been completely bored but for the most part when you sit around for [ __ ] 3-4 months or whatever the [ __ ] it is you know it gets boring get thrown you know you're used to leaving every day going to work doing the job doing whatever to basically just sitting at home not all the time but most of the time all right I tried the bubble hash before by by itself in a bong and he told me hi wasn't the best tasting stuff I've ever had you know it wasn't bad per se stupid low battery it'll be a baby pinched all the [ __ ] hands too tight whatever we're gonna light that end and tack someone items so the name the comedian the comedy Canadian or something I think it was thank you for your comments man I really appreciate it glad you're enjoying some of my content you know I enjoy reading you know positivity things like that from from you guys shows me that I got a pretty decent following of people so far if I can get the ones that keep leaving - just stay but you know you got weed out some of the some of the ones that don't quite enjoy your stuff so that you can get to the people that do actually enjoy your stuff same thing in life sometimes you got a lot of people go so that you can get on to the good otherwise you're stuck in the bed because they're dragged you know that person might be the one that's dragging you down let me grab this lighter real quick see what this is all about I can say shitty roll pinch the end too tight lots of paper definitely got a weird up taste to it as I said it's not bad I tried it the one time just to a straight bomb and it does Java got me high but did have a odd taste to it I probably wouldn't buy it again nothing against the company personally but I probably won't be buying a ton of hash and let somebody in like a hash bar like when I was back in England my cousin gave me something [ __ ] I need to solid aka draw I'm pretty sure it's just [ __ ] hash take a lighter do it it loosens it up crumble it off the end sprinkle it in then they would sprinkle the tobacco in it so when my cousin gave me a quarter of this [ __ ] so it's you know big chunk so I'm getting ready to leave England and it was gonna sound crazy but this this truly did happen so I was wearing a t-shirt like this but I had the pocket that I was wearing a big-ass baggy hoodie so I put the thing in the pocket and I went through customs you know through the airport whatever this is 2003 pre 9/11 and all that [ __ ] so they weren't checking things nearly as hardcore well the guy in front of me gets a full pat down my heart [ __ ] drops I mean full pat-down like there's no way that they're not gonna feel that so I almost did a [ __ ] full mistake and walk they're like come on and I'm gonna step forward and just went so I didn't do that they let me through so instantly I went to the bathroom with my [ __ ] it was cold so I happen to have on two pairs of socks so I put the saran-wrapped hash or whatever in between the two pairs of socks in between my toes sucked walking I probably looked like I had a [ __ ] you know that it was semi crippled like I had a limp you know so I've set or I'll did the way to grew but I'll get all paranoid looking around waiting for security and all I said to come get me I shouldn't been nearly as paranoid but I was so I go to get on the plane and there's a check station right there they make the guy in front of me to take off his [ __ ] shoes so now I'm like holy [ __ ] so second heart attack within two three hours so then I get on the [ __ ] plane I'm sitting there everything's good we take off and we go I get back same thing the guy in front of me has six [ __ ] shoes off luckily they didn't make me do it I don't know why I don't know god almighty or whoever it was just looking out for me you know cuz smuggling drugs across international borders is hugely frowned upon so then I'm sitting down my dad's like hey I gotta go use the bathroom real quick he goes wait right here oh I said okay no problem so wait right there and this lady comes over and sits close not like right by me but close to say hey uh did you just get off the Amsterdam flight so no I just I just got in from England she's like oh okay yep no Amsterdam oh okay I was just wondering I don't know I'm already in paranoid mode from the past three four you know first three hours then the plane flight I was okay with it and now I'm going through all this [ __ ] and you know it takes me an hour I'm gonna have top to get through there I'm stressing that entire time only time I relax is when I get into my dad's car and we are away from the airport I was like [ __ ] yeah Oh dad yeah it's nice to be home love ya hi I get home and get my car you know probably like an hour after getting home I got the the hash or whatever and I go straight to my friend's house and I asked my cousin I said what if you smoked this by itself he said oh you don't want to do that he goes trust me you don't want to do that smoke it this way so I ended up what was it I ended up just smoked it by self put it in a bong sprinkle the day and smoke one of the best times I've had in my life I didn't have the munchies I wasn't tired it was just all around good I enjoyed it and everyone wanted to nickname it doodoo brown and all that you know because of the color it was looked like it's just he's turd basically it wasn't and it wasn't in the shape of a turd but still had the color so that's what my friend started nickname in it and I went to another friend's house smoked it with them and everyone agreed that it was [ __ ] amazing great hi and I wish when I was in England and I was smoking it by itself the entire time not mixing it with cigarettes and [ __ ] I don't smoke cigarettes so that [ __ ] was gross to me I had to let a bunch of them know that it like I smoked weed weed like this is always you know I don't I don't mix it I don't do a split I don't mix it with tobacco that's all they do so so I wish I'd get my hands on that again this [ __ ] isn't even close to that but it's not bad it's good I feel hi that's pretty much the end of that little story guys won't mind liking stop being available in comment I appreciate it

in the amazon little washer things like five gallon six gallon or something uh ice which is right here four pound bag so i have extra for i'm gonna do three or four five runs i don't know we'll see that's everything that's a fresh frozen um as well as a trim but just enough water in there to keep it from just grinding the material down basically as per frenchy cannolis suggestions and we'll go and crank this thing on all right here we go we're all set up level's about where we want it i want to fill that thing up too much because that drain spout you don't want that coming out the end but let's crank it on let's see what we got beautiful i'll run it for like 15 minutes and we'll come back and check the drain uh let's go through my bags real quick all right for my bag set up i'm gonna use 220 as my uh my waist just my work bag i guess i got a 190 underneath that i'll keep basically for edibles and then i'm running a 160 and then a 40 uh what is it 40 45 something like that yeah 45 so um i'll keep those two dry that and then squish that for my hash raj and but yeah i'll uh update you when this thing's done and we uh start dumping [Applause] okay so now we're done 15 minutes is over nice little slush going gonna now drain it so i picked it up just to have some leverage to it and now we'll drain it into the five gallons um this top five i have holes in the bottom of it so basically after i drain it all i can uh lift up the top five and get rid of most of the water and then kind of work the hash out from that point like i said it's going into 221st then through 190 then uh 160 and then 45. make sure i got it all here there we go tilt that over a little bit and that's what's left so i'll put some more water in there replenish some ice looks like the ice is still pretty good but we'll do this a couple more times but let me run through this here and i'll show you what we got okay so first run let's see what we got definitely smaller trichome heads this is the uh 160 micron bag and this is the 45 so that uh tangy definitely has smaller micron heads we're getting a lot more from there but uh we'll keep going that's first wash a little bit of 190 like i said i'll use that for some edibles or something like that but yeah that's first one let's do it again and i just loaded up for a second wash make sure there's enough water in there so it's not like that's not the ice isn't just grinding the material but it's nice and cold um yeah let's see how that one turned out just on the second round right there it's the 160 micron and that's 45 micron working on the third right now okay so just got done with the fourth wash you see i'm not really keeping too much of the 160 right now anyway i'm uh running just back into the 45 since that's where they're all collecting anyway but first first second third and then there's the fourth one there um it's still looking pretty good i'm not seeing a whole bunch of green or anything yet so um i think we still got a little bit left let's take a look here's what's left in the uh the washing machine so i'll do another wash see what it looks like um see if we're finishing up or whatever i just want to see when we're done but i'll fill this up with water looks like i got plenty of ice still maybe throw a little bit more ice in there i don't know i'll start with the water first but yeah i'll do another wash or two and then uh we'll check back", "wqdyULUfHXo": "hi I'm Andrew with virtual Sun hydroponics today I'm going to introduce you to our line of virtual Sun herbal extraction bags all virtual Sun

herbal extraction bag kits have already been created for you and each bag is available separately all virtual Sun herbal extraction bag kits include a bonus sturdy drawstring storage bag and 25 micron press screen and no extra cost virtual Sun herbal extraction bags produce the finest herbal extract so let's get started you will need a wooden mixing spoon or electric mixer to stir the product today we are going to use a combination of a power drill with a mixing blade and a wooden spoon a thin flat plastic blade to remove the finished product from the bags we will be using a four-inch plastic putty knife your plant matter we will be using lavender buds today to make lavender essence a multi-purpose bucket or trash can the same size as your herbal extraction bags we will be using a five-gallon multi-purpose bucket a large bag of ice and your herbal extraction bags today we have our virtual Sun five gallon five bag herbal extraction bag kit step one stack your bags always put the smallest micron bag in first this will usually be the 25 micron bag each of the additional bags will be stacked on top of each other from smallest micron the largest our five bags set today stacks 2573 120 160 to 20 micron the 220 micron strainer bag will end up on top every time all the bags can be used at once or each bag can be used separately step 2 add ice fill the bucket one third full of ice step three add the plant matter start adding the plant material today we are using lavender buds to produce lavender essence spread the materials slowly over the ice continue until the bucket is about half full step four add water add cold water until the bucket is about three-quarters full make sure to use cold water room temperature or warm water will not work properly step 5 mix mix everything together consistently until it turns frothy like foamy green tea after you mix all of your ingredients let it sit for about 10 minutes for proper extraction step 6 strain stir repeat pull the largest micron bag out and slowly strain the liquid into the second bag dispose of the remaining product in the bag or set it aside to reprocess later plant matter can be reprocessed two to three times for maximum yield pull each of the remaining bags and slowly strain the liquid through the bottom into the next bag step 7 finished product all of the bags except the 220 micron strainer bag will have usable product in the motor remove from the bucket the finished product we have is lavender essence once it's been dried it can be used for potpourri candles perfume cooking or cleaning there are many uses for herbal extracts and powders thanks for watching we hope this video has been informative step-by-step PDF instructions are available to help you or watch it again you", "4vXe8jGdozc": "[Music] it goes it is the bubble machine I'm gonna give this run see how it does [Music] it's five-gallon and we'll see if it does good and we'll probably try the 20 gallon this one is the machine bag kit so it's got the five bags with the screen now my whole orders not here yet I have I ordered an extra screen that goes inside and a couple other things we'll see how this goes no more users from the cement mixer we'll try this out I got quite a bit in the freezer so more to come with that bubble machines in the house or just to work hi what's going on won't you do another bubble round so all my trim is completely frozen I put it in zip locks put it in the freezer straight from harvest so you can keep as many terpenes as possible you do lose them when your product dries out so we're doing bubble or whatever it's best to get it frozen as soon as possible also helps for doing trouble now you need to dry it out for doing dried ice hash before school just cause the dry ice to stick to it but for bubble it's the best of both worlds you you want it cold so this also helps so lemon does I'm putting the the popcorn buds and the trim and then I'm gonna break it up add a little bit of ice I prefer to do the ice on the top not the bottom to each his own just my preference got all the trim inside the bag now I'm just gonna break it up even though it's frozen it's it's not rock solid leaf matter doesn't get rock solids unless you add water it's not enough moisture content to to really do that so there it is there got it all broken up [Music] there's no science on how much ice you want to add so I don't put a whole lot because the bag it gets hard to close the lid of the bubble machine so and I'm gonna put some ice in the machine to that's about all I'm gonna do in there which is about the bag three-quarters full now when you put this zipper there's a Velcro do not forget to put that on there or I can spin around and you'll be screwed so let me move the camera up here now we're at the bubble machine which is basically a little washer machine that's all it is this bad boy up I haven't faced like this for a reason Tony to drain hose on this side so just put the bag in as you can see what I mean do it three-quarters full it's barely covering or missing this lip okay I put a little bit more and total I probably use about 3/4 of a light a little more than that that's good when I take filtered water make sure it's filtered thing is you want your product to be as clean as possible using faucet water with this introduce calcium copper everything that's in your faucet water so I just went to the store and bought a few gallons did I use these in my my room but I use my RO system when I don't have these all right so about it's about it right there so but did it right I did which takes three of these which are not quite a gallon close to it and about 3/4 bag of ice put it in there and set the timer actually we plug it in first my help it's all gone so now we'll take the hose let it drain right into the bucket [Music] like that and I'm gonna let it sit for probably another 15 minutes or so I'm also gonna take the bag out of the machine and press it please it all out on this machine there's uh there's a high and a low level it's kind of hard to see them side of it I'm just gonna talk about it but I like to always put on the low especially when you're using ice as it goes through the cycle the ice is course is gonna melt and it ends up going from low to high the time it gets done so you have to watch not to over fail because it'll come out of the holes at the top this one was borderline it was just foaming out of the top that white foam you see just coming right out it's really not much to it I usually take about quarter gallon and I pour it in there to wash it the remaining now there's not gonna be hardly any in there but I just like to use about a quarter gallon uh wash the machine so I'm about to take the bag out [Music] the bag with the material just like normal you want to take it and just press press all the liquid you can get out of it [Music] this screen here and this screen here the blue are identical they're both 220 so just I don't use nothing out of this screen the blue the 220 it's just to catch any leaf matter if he makes it through but the screen really does a good job I haven't had any problems at all with this I rarely get anything in this 220 I like to have the backup for sure [Music] all I'm gonna do there [Music] screen off to the side and I'm going to take my I said my quarter gallon filtered water just do a little rinse I'm not done yet I got enough one more run to do so I'm not gonna do a full clean on the machine I'm just gonna unload the bag clean it and then I'm gonna reload some more in I'm gonna need three more gallons but the next step here like I said I let this sit for about 15 minutes then we got our parchment paper right there I will take the screens out show that process as well uses another bucket so I'll come back soon as I get done with the waiting game okay so I've sat long enough we take up first bags which is just for bleep matter I'll do nothing with this - 20 let's take it right outside and clean it you see there is a bunch of stuff in here guess if you wanted to smoke it I would anyways still be sure drains get out of the way the next ones which the 168 I really don't care about either shouldn't be much it here anyway but I'm gonna I'm gonna screen it got another load going [Music] in the background look inside this one and there's some in there [Music] actually I'm I'm not gonna bother screen in the 160 they care about that yeah we'll do it for video so you can see the color tone the whole idea is I put a bag on the bucket and turn it inside out [Music] try to deal without hitting the screen it's probably the biggest challenge you see on this one [Music] that it's got a lot of fleet matter or it's just not here but that's the screen call before you so now I just take a card I've already done the alcohol from the card I just Sheila's take it [Music] thus you can clump it together [Music] he said this one really don't care about either [Music] Hey so now we got it on paper right there put this in my file [Music] clean out next one this one I really don't care too much about as well [Music] just give it a little bit of vibration post the letter get through the screen and you can also do the dip to try to get the trichomes more into the into a smaller section the center won't get same process put it on the bucket an attempt to turn your bags inside out [Music] he's got that green gutter to limit lighter but not by much [Music] what I do is I put my foot against the pocket on the actual bag so I could pull it tight to your foot to kind of crimp it down I'm putting this screen in the last screen together because like I said I don't really care about these too much dirty strike ugly to me their bottom too much not even trying to get them off that well just do it for videos sake [Music] now we're getting to the two that I really care about or cared more about this is a 73 which is D soup the one I really liked the most this course is the 25 [Music] as I'm working it so it gets more in the center than that just keep at the top of the the water just and you slow dips and slowly shake it so it drains out this is going to start getting into the nice material which will be this one will be more of a brown tan darker tan the next one should be a really bright tan which what I'm looking this was about a decent amount [Music] still got a mild mild green tint to it I start to get into the tan which is due to the screen level not letting the leaf batter through [Music] big snot glob there take that off just a little glob there [Music] so a little bit more time turning at the trichomes together [Music] [Music] it's really now on so then the twenty fives only one I really care much about here for the green stuff getting the last one [Music] as you can see I can lift it up and all the water stays in it that's because the screen so what I do is they just take it like this set it bouncing the whole thing all you got to do is agitated and that will help the water through the screen you can sit there and bounce the whole thing if you want and get it work out but just shaking the sides a lot less work and it does exact same thing thanks to me a little bit works a little better a lot less effort [Music] the water gets down gonna see it here to the screen I don't agitate you this bad cuz I don't want to bounce the trichomes up onto the bag I want them to stay more on the screen so I'll do a light agitation when I'm straining fairly well [Music] [Music] this one takes a while almost there [Music] so we got a decent amount here which I would only bet I should because I don't trim a lot of though we don't trim the popcorn I just throw it in the bags and the freezers quite a bit of trichomes it's not really the sugar Leafs that helped me out on my product and it's mostly the actual bugs that they didn't want it trim [Music] full of trichomes because it rained really slow you don't want to rush this point because I'm gonna try to get as much water out as possible so you don't have to either let it take longer to either dry out or you have to press it out a little patient as you can see there's definitely playing a try comes in there [Music] [Music] okay put this one on the bucket look see this screen should be nice and bubbly it's the bubble hash [Music] [Music] [Music] there [Music] right back in the booking [Music] [Music] [Music] already is it now for me will let it dry I probably won't be messing with any of that it's still got a very light light green I like mine tan so is what it is my last two are very one of them was almost a white it was a beer [Music] the stuff will be just for guests over a mess of trichomes that's it [Music] there's some sample of some already dried here darkened up as it dries a nice tan you can see it go for more of a green to nice brownish tan color and it looks like a big shard [ __ ] stain let's see it it's the bubble process this machine takes a lot of the work out I noticed I got a lot less leaf matter than the old-fashioned way which was taking one of these onto your drill and agitating it in your bags that's the old-fashioned way I was doing it still made good bubble hash but to me the quality was it as good I think it's the harsh agitation that it was this thing is just like a what's a portable washing machine really does the water jetting softer just produces a lot takes a lot of the work out you just put it on the side do the fifteen minute cycle walk away is that simple so there's the bubble machine works outstanding I definitely recommend it I got the machine with the five bag you can get just the machine or you can get the five bag or I think it's the a bag and get either one it's real it's affordable it's definitely worth every penny I'm very happy with it so far I've done four runs so it's been pretty flawless for me haven't had any issues it's very simplified I wish I would have came up with this simple idea that's all I got appreciate y'all stopping by bubble hash complete I'll take care real quick one add second run or it's a different run with 32 that's the non green matter I was talking about either nice and that's more of a dark tan that's a real light tan bubbly hence bubble hash there's you're more of a brown so that's what I'm looking for with the bubble hash the last run was a little green matter so wasn't as good this one right here is a keeper I just want to show that real quick I'm going", "9YJQLjO4dXM": "hi there welcome to my youtube channel my name is ben aka notions i'm just going to show you how crumbly this stuff is that i got off braided raidedgreen.com it's called premium bubble hash and if i take a little bit just crumble it into a tiny single skin joint as you can see it crumbles pretty easily with just the heat from my fingers so i put a tiny bit of what fell off it in and now i'm gonna roll it up and maybe add a bit of blood first so yeah this is 20 premium bubble hash which is cbd of course 20 cbd uh percent wise and it i look forward to experience the taste of it and in fact so thanks for watching bye for now", "wDnsYmDCbRo": "[Applause] welcome back to another edition of Canada Canada so yeah we're here now we really need a bubble bag they I've done my this is the 8th baguette big shout out to city Northwest garden supply thank you guys they got you know you guys rock down there and they shout out to g-man thank you and of course refined nutrients as always with sponsors probably bring us stuff like this so we can actually continue to go on now this is going to be the Jason Wilcox rookie demonstration because literally we're back on my channel I think 2000 2008 2007 2008 when we first started in a three bag extraction kit bubble bags and they turned out ok it was the only time we were experimenting with it so watch couple videos on YouTube have an idea of what I'm doing so we're just gonna kind of go through it and there wasn't one a lot of me go ahead tell them good but hopefully some of the questions come out of it and and again it's what we come down and people talk about instructions one thing we're going to be basing the exterior court is their stuff like this gonna last my my camera lady to zoom in on on this you can actually see it here it's like the honey you kind of cherry oil I will just go out like this now this is what they call it using a solvent you know and then purging it so even though it's just done with isopropyl II it's still not you know it's the medical grade product as we would with a bubble extraction water sharks like we be doing so it's one of the things I just kind of wanted to show at the same time there are things out there there's there's no playing with it this is something used to refill my torch but people use it for five times filter butane and there's other ones that go right up like 34 times I think it's more marketing but anyway the cleaner the better some keep in mind if you're going to be messing around this is what I like is that going into court they're looking at what's safe extractions so I say make it home butter making water extraction making dry sip that's 100 percent safe and I think that's what we need to educate and make sure that we allow people to know that those who understand what I'm saying magic eight I'm not stuttering its medicating in educating you just combined by a good friend of mine and I'm proud to share that with you so yeah so we just solve it that's what we have to do it so in this case we're now I'm going to go to to kind of how how about the workers with the bubble bags and another counter so I have an idea what you normally need one of these they're mark from John isn't laughing at me and believe are yes okay so yeah I know it's not going to be the 25 that's for sure so it must be the blue one is going to be the door Craig as they call it I guess which would be the main cut by they got to 20 yeah I'm sure they're all in sequential order to 2190 so basically if we're going to go with the largest size first and just kind of go ahead and put that in there your standard black gone by the bucket easy to medium-sized and by no means am I gonna try and pretend we're doing this process and I'm going 100 times ultimately what you're doing is you're pleased with ice already in the freezer right now my cannabis is frozen dry clones which are on there we're trying to knock off we're trying to get Minnie to Grange their heads but what's important is to understand that each talks like a mushroom you're gonna collect a lot of stuff that's gonna be like your buffer for your hash not quite as strong then you're gonna have your straight heads which is something like oh man it's done such a great job over the years educating line and how to get full melt and no those guys are survivors and that's on the circle maybe one year they are like in the water I'll just ask my camera lady to grab me my medicine a freezer and then of course our water has always took that putana freezer made sure that was gold and brought down as low as possible and yeah again it's a rookie demonstration so once you're done from here I'm not going to draw you through all the slow parts that's gonna ask my camera lady to zoom in on the two different things we are using you see on this one here the the trichomes are just frozen literally to the bag and you can see on the material so I mean this is just really good extraction material it's not a lot that's fine a small run through and and with this one here we got more length on popcorn but on a smaller kind of a smalls off the bottom that you would normally get rid of Jimmy it's just to see what we can do so it's gonna be a combination of the two strains and see how it works out so yeah that's kind of that's kind of where we're at also frozen on top of the ice [Music] so boys so probably that good but again I'm not sure what the bubble is that was there you see my camera lady can look at that you can just see the trikes just loaded so we're hoping this will be a good return on this for sure [Music] [Music] cold and they can talk a little bit about what and why it's so nice to get a little bit more ice [Music] [Music] electricity then we've got our cold water and of course it's distilled water is important here is reverse osmosis apparently that's important if you're in it not sure how much water so that's so again there's from my understanding anyway basically what's going on right now is with the trichomes freezing up in there and it's getting really cold you want them frozen what happens is with friction these little mushroom instead basically you're seeing people show you the look 30 times microscope you look at that then try come to music tell them it's harvested or are you looking at it imagine to be the year and then they're frozen and through the friction you're actually smashed from the heads off and you're smashing the stalks up you know and ultimately that's what's filtering down through the different microns this is the first value the calculators everything through but as goes down through these different sizes sub what we stocked it gets caught up some will be you know some will be heads and of course that's we gonna hear finer melts and everything I can't give the full science behind it that sort of thing someone that's more marks Department but really that's what we're doing is we're allowing at the freeze right now I'm gonna go ahead and go away so apparently did by need I was Joyce Siobhan's and he one of the oldest measures that I had with a crow Bible so I just can go ahead and no worried I seen one video where they just push it up and house maybe the viewers can give you some hints online for next time and say maybe it's better not to but for this time around we're going to go ahead and exist so I [Music] okay so there should be see here lots of bubbles which is something was told to watch for that was about ten minutes I guess we allowed it to go ahead and go through it some spinning cycle and now basically everything that would have been frozen there's still tons of ice cubes a product book too many ice cubes but what's happening now is is we're just going to allow it just you know a few kicks to decide I'm not is allow the heads and the stocks that have broken off to actually falling down through the first main cap screen which is not a big deal from there will then transfer it into that bucket and put the bags in the place here I'll show you all the other at that routine I'm not here to teach other how to mingle clash more to be the foolish Jason Wilcox makes first video so yeah anyway I let this rest now there let it settle down a little bit lots of ice cubes still in there and then once we get the water transfer we'll come back to where we run it through and start sure we what we actually captured a sergeant see you or I was kind of sprucing up with philosophy again in the first catch bag this has one slice new stuff so I'm actually going to put in the sink and probably burn through you mean so on that note we'll see once we get the other guys for the nearest buncha loader talk a little bit about that and see what we get on the return but there's water in there as well as we see an expert all right so here we are back now we know mark that was a lot of time then nobody I forgot it that's a lot of work but just those bags in there probably shoot than that in advance the only was all the way down east you see you got your purple down to the bottom 25 and then of course you'll wait another important one at 45 then your 120 and of course we start off with the 190 so I'm not going to take everybody through the whole you know trial process but there's a holy cow sweat from that some people call their mash [Music] we'll see you guys back when I can actually start to I let's just sit for a while let's gonna actually go down and once again I was those heads that we're talking about will fall down to the appropriate micron size and solder sauce and the other the other black bodies etc will be washed right now which is why the water hash of course one of the purest and I'll say this ways to use Gannicus both at of all events so because human the next part because I'm horrible but let me just actually there can you zoom in on that that's what we're getting out of the 73 micron bag from fresh veggies and down there to find it or Pacific Northwest garden supply this dammit all these guys tips on how to clean them faster awesome guys you can see the change in color it's amazing this one to me the lighter [Music] all right so you can see we go back with the rest of them and then we're gonna show you all the different micron sizes and we don't bore you too much once you know there's a 45 micron white bag 45 my ground just blonde blonde blonde and here you can see the 20 line that we got the 20 micron or 25 micron valued now which is the last one once again about a 1/2 gram or so but I don't know which ones which or which one's going to smoke which way but that was the first attempt at uh using the 8 bag set and we'll show you a little more in a minute here but yeah there's the purple bag before I some additional stuff so that being said on the on the 160 micron you can see that quite a bit it's texture it's funny how the texture changes from each one but this one here we got more out but of course that's the first screen or the second one at 1:20 is this one here and we notice to be good I believe that's one where it started going yeah a little more beige and then the texture started to change at the 90 micron work so here we started seeing a lot of texture change that you can see with the spoon it's just a different texture and then even more so when we get down to like the 45 which is uh yeah my my camera lady's got these all messed up because 45 and 25 this is 25 that must be 45 that must be 90 it's this texture here this texture here you just see it's it's like a play-doh almost and you started like I'm trying to bring it apart and I can't really break it apart it's kind of like yeah so yeah there's just different textures there it's gonna be interesting when these I'm going to put them on to a towel underneath it so it helps to to dry it out with a little family let it go for the night and yeah that's it so for me that was you know how it's making 101 big morning and welcome back all right it's been the night time now of course you want to let the stuff sit out and cure as I understand it again this has been a rookie experiment and really I'm happy with the results and yourself and more interested in the texture so my last one can't believe you come in here you see here like at the 160 micron it's kind of like a dusty almost break apart in your fingers still stick together though and that's at the 160s that's a very big size now we get down to say the 120 here still got that golden pink and this here can press a little better stick to the finger a completely different texture then as we go along you can see these here though these get really hard and it all can be pressed I mean if I take these two pieces here and I just want to press them together it's just incredibly sticky and if I handle it for too long it melts into my fingers and again that's only at the UH that's only at the 112 120 or 90 um then down here at like the 75 not a lot there where you can just see it's nice it's kind like a little cake that stuff as well can easily be melted and pressed together just something that looks like that ain't going to work so very interesting stuff and then what's interesting is it changes color when you get down into like the the nineteen to 4525 so 90 45 25 some reason the 45 picked up the most but in the 90 here we can see that this here is just concentrated and it's sticky and it's hard as a rock right now but it can be pressed together you can see how sticky it is and this stuff like truly bubbles and truly melts and then testing it all morning so I don't quite medicated and then of course you get down here to your last two bags which are your big ones this one we collected a lot in the 45 this stuff's just completely melts in strong's help and again you standard stickiest so but I see now why they have all the different vials and i truly after testing these i can see why you know quite frankly there's a lot of clubs out there written people off you know there's there's a first wash at 160 microns first bag anyway and you can get a lot of stuff out like this but the quality of the cannabis is just low likely because there's a lot more stock in there than there is heads but when you get down to this lower so fear it's just phenomenal and and just seeing the different texture as you break through each tip of my concise is important so on that no one is going to show you the dry and there's some more wet stuff that needs to dry you can see the difference once it dries out it becomes like a powdery whole thing in clay our unmolding that you can you can mold together if you wish but all said that's it you got one two three four five six seven bags they're much so having a bag great oh a number eight deep blue bag carry bag so yeah there's your seven bags of extraction and your seven different colors and that is rookie making bubble hash 101 this is Jason Wilcox and we'll see you next video hydroponic shop in BC sales have been smoking hot ever since two US states legalized marijuana the company called Green Planet carries everything anyone would need to grow plants any kind of plants indoors in Colorado it is now illegal to have six marijuana plants in a secure area", "19geXCreAqw": "hey everybody gets me for girly here and today we are back with day six or twelve days a wake and bake we are now I guess officially halfway through it I appreciate you guys join me in on this miniseries let me know in the comments below what you think about it thus far I probably have filmed all of them by the time you're seeing this so you know suggestions maybe for upcoming ones probably not that good of idea are you that useful of an idea but maybe ideas for other series things of that nature things you'd like to see on my channel let me know in the comments below today we're going to be getting right into it with the combination of the email is back and some Michigan main melts I was fortunate enough to pick up some what is this Florida og first wash 120 micron five point five star freeze-dried water hash how about that quite the lengthy title but there's a lot that goes into this stuff and it's important so I'm going to actually bring the lighting up so you can see this a little bit better but I try not to wash it out either there you go that's basically what it looks like little bricks of I guess what would kind of look like dry sift I know on Instagram i saw a cuban grower describe this exact stuff as or you know said it looks like some really clean dry sift but it's actually it's actually fresh frozen bubble hash that they run and just get everything back and focus here so they run the run bubble and I've never ever run any kind of water hash I'm not that familiar with the whole process or anything I know I've watched several videos and all that but you know doing it yourself is a whole other level they take bubble hash they do I think three runs of it separate it all in the different patties and then run it through the freeze dryer and that takes all the moisture out of it and then they break it into little bricks they don't do any kind of a seating or what's the micro planing i think is what those things are cold they don't do anything like that they don't air dry or anything like that they freeze dry it and they have the easily the best hash i've ever had so props to them um we're going to go ahead and take a day or two of this I have already tried it it is delicious and it's just sooo so so super clean it really is it's it's they really have a focus on bringing those flavors through and you know while it's important to deftly get those medicinal effects that's kind of where you know the strains come in so growing for flavors that's one concept I guess growing for flavorful medicine you know is that ideally where I want to be at and now that's where I've been honing in my garden so I'm excited for them to wash some of my material I would love to get some silver kush wash I don't have nearly the production of it that I need to probably have a full run of it but maybe I'll have to start saving up or something because kind of stuff is great anyways here's to uh I guess the the clothes were not quite there I know tomorrow's New Year's Eve but you know here's 2 2015 I hope it was good for everybody and yeah thank you guys over at me she can make melts you oh so tasty I always have a hard time describing some of their flavors but they've got this banana o.g I know this is kind of off topic cuz it's a different shoe but they have this banana o.g that's it straight banana I mean it's like not like banana bread it's almost like God oh I don't know how to describe maybe it's more like a banana bread gonna say that more like banana candy or smoothie it's not like sweet or anything but it's super super bad tasting so I with this stuff especially because this ranges from anywhere from like 60 may well probably met lowest cost 60 more like 80 to 100 $10 gram and dispensaries around here I know su nan Arbor and ann arbor michigan this stuff is going for a hundred ten dollars and some collectives so it's I mean it's awesome awesome stuff but I it I suppose you could do a whole lot with it but I'm not gonna like if we lost my train of thought right there what we're gonna do now I wanted to grab some paper towel so I can clean off the two laughter I do a little scraping because you do get residue in there and I'll let me show you that you definitely this like kind of charred red through because it saw it hasn't been broken down by like pho or anything like that you're definitely gonna get a little bit more of that by organic material on there there you go maybe I can't keep this thing in focus yeah that's uh it's good to scrape the o gently scrape between each dad because you don't really want to taste that but so I want to go ahead and grab some paper towel to clean that off and I'll give you a melt shot because uh I don't know I know bubbleman does a lot of mel shots and people always complain about I'm not carving it or carb capping it and everything but i'll give you guys a quick one just then tacked on the end of this video so you can see what it looks like but uh thanks again to michigan made mounts check them out on instagram Michigan underscore made underscore melts see you right there definitely check out michigan email and yeah i mean if you guys if you guys do freeze-dried bubble hash I want to see it I want to see what other people are doing out there I'm not really into the the concentrate game like that so to speak but let me know comment below who else is doing stuff like this because it is amazing and we're out here in Michigan which is still kind of the semi wild West's of the cannabis world I mean we're not quite up to par with like you know Washington and Colorado but we're not you know we're also not quite where some other places are like down south so we'll go ahead and get a mouth shot in and until tomorrow until New Year's Eve guys day 7 good luck and grow big you", "kbAFHgdAwpg": "yes yes before justin yeah we're in my kitchen he gets a mess a girl like that and yeah what's he doing on there with that washing machine well i did say i had another method of making uh ice hash bottle hash water extraction hash whatever you want to call it [Applause] so basically in a nutshell this is the machine doing the work now so obviously i've got a bag in there as you can see [Music] it's like a pyramid basically so it's a pyramid pack you put it with ice in it you put your trim in it i just want to use the rest of this up so i don't want it here so just get rid of this trim now we're just finished this i just wanted to just give you a quick glimpse when i show you the quality i get coming out of that unfortunately because of the amount of ice this i've uses the amount of price i needed so i'm only gonna be able to do one run so i'm gonna run it for about 20 [Music] minutes [Applause] [Applause] we are collecting trikes baby we are flexing trikes [Applause] yeah so i hope you're all well sending all my best wishes to you people like that one love to you and look out for the smoke and review on this fantastic bubble wash it's going to be going really really soon just check that out check out the coloring which is changing just from filming it just from filming it it's changed already it's just like so you can smell the weed now the weeds just a few bits of leaves i'm impressed really really impressed i'm using the purple background pyramid back basically that's what you can see there really good guys really really good the camera that looks just that way one text yeah peaceful love guys and i'll see you really really soon for another video yes yes double hash coming up wonderful", "GYbQtkxx6RI": "Oh [Music] [Music] water hash hacks so our first tank today is going to be how to create a shield this is a picture of a shield just cut the bottom off a bucket then use the shield on the inside of your work bag as seen here this helps keep your bag from drifting to the middle and will help protect it from your drill or your paddle or whatever you're using the mixer batch our next hack for today is going to be using a siphon we have just pulled out our work bag and here we see our hash water in the bucket one of the easiest ways the siphon this water out is to use a 25 micron screen like this it's easier to push the bag down into the water than it is to dump the whole bucket through the bag get a pan or a small bucket to place the hose in you just need something to stop the screen from getting sucked into the hose another way to do this is to let your hash water settle for about 20 minutes and very gently place your pan on the bottom of your hash water bucket then siphon out of your pan to a bucket with your 25 micron screen bag catching all the water if you do that just in case anything good does sneak out on [Music] now that took me about five minutes and you can see all the hash is left in just a small amount of water that's a lot less to deal with and it saves your back and your time another little trick is when you're dealing with multiple runs is you can just mix them together you can do this easily if you're using the siphon method I'll mix my first runs together and my second runs together that's what you see here the mixing of two different runs now let them settle and pour it off later which brings us to our last hack of the day rinsing your hash this trick works especially well when dealing with low quality trim so now just fill the buckets with fresh water and let them sell for 20 minutes before pouring them off if you're in a hurry you can use the bag and the siphon and then you won't have to wait for them to settle [Music] [Music] now I've let those buckets settle for 20 minutes and I'm going to just pour them off slowly you can see this stuff's pretty clean already you'll still see some small debris that gets out once in a while there's still a little bits of stuff in there now with the clearness of the water you can start to see the hash down there at the bottom and now you can see a little hash trail trying to make its way to the rim so we'll stop it about there and now that's all of our hash and just that little bit of water I'm pouring these into a 25 micron Bay to catch anything good that gets out if it looks good enough I will add to my second runs or I will just use it for cooking I like to repeat this process until I can see the hash sitting on the bottom of a bucket full of clear water [Music] I have been dumping buckets in that bag all day most of the time it'll pull straight out with a little or no resistance so it is holding a little more water than usual but still easy to pull and it's draining pretty quick [Music] when i zoom in here you can see there is some stuff stuck to that bag it is a little dirty well happy hashing age [Music] [Music]", "qaJ-Adk_Yqc": "I guess this is the tail end of the video this is this one here is from the 25 micron bag this one is here is from the 73 micron bag so news from the hundred and twenty micron bag and this one here is from the hundred and sixty micron pack which was yeah didn't I didn't bother collected after the after the first wash because that's what come off the first wash and but the other three there that was the 120 and 73 and 25 oh yeah alright I'm not sure how much I got that I got a dry it out completely and then I mean weigh it and swore a cop but yeah that's it it'll dry on the in this 25 micron screen no and then yeah see what happens there anyway thanks for watching guys and like I saved my first time and yeah alright I think just just just good and it was yeah we're quite fine I said there was a bull and not sure how many grams there were but it wasn't much it wasn't much over I hadn't really gone think that's wrong yeah thanks for watching guys bye", "LDjBIEdGjIo": "oh what's good youtube welcome back to another live sesh today's daily dab we're taking some dabs checking some ph runoff adjusting ph and most importantly pressing hash got some master kush trim hash that we were watched uh late last week that's been sitting in the freeze dryer waiting waiting patiently for the press trust me this is super fast so we're gonna get into this i'm gonna get into it real good but first but first the routine can't [ __ ] with the routine so let me get the chat pulled up apparently i need to get some music going so i can stop making my own let's go with no copyright strikes today we're going to play some uh hmm let's go with the coffee shop what's up grower bobby fpv ocean dad lisa good morning good morning everybody there it is yes there we go i guess clear those turret caves [Music] super super clean rig just cleaned it last night i took two dabs out of it gotta keep that [ __ ] fresh son fresh to death [Music] oh yeah looks clean smells clean it tastes clean l runs mendo roaning let's get some more of this wet ass mendo probably gonna finish this up in the next day or two i better conserve i can't really tell how good that light is either maybe i should be more like [Music] voila little piggy piggy pinecrank i'm gonna eat it i hope you guys have a productive day positive nothing but positive vibes you guys cheers [Music] [Music] so almost got me drooling already i haven't even really gotten the hit hit i got the terpigs [Music] wow never fails oh yeah fire [Music] oh cheers everybody [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] wow [Music] [Music] yes oh bad let's go do our little walk around check on [ __ ] you guys already know [Music] first things first this room has been staying pretty cold i haven't been keeping it at 58 but i've been keeping it at 64. which is allowing me to keep the inside of this tint area at 76 and 49 which is definitely not high enough humidity and the temperatures are a little low so they're a little stressed out looking right now as you can tell but as soon as i uh harvest this hash out of here today i'll go ahead and adjust the temperature back and we'll be good to go but uh these are all doing good i mean they got nice little thick stems on them nice nice branching i'll be able to go ahead and pluck uh all my clones that i need off of here pretty soon decent roots for not even being on a drip system right now just being hand fed still we still got the uh chopped cream doing the uh three leaves the polyploidism real nice yeah it's just it's looking good they're all doing good remember these are all already uh females confirmed so we don't worry about it go ahead and put this door back up keep it warmer in there [Music] now in here let me grab my coffee what the [ __ ] first of all let me pull up stream on my phone that way i can take the chat with me and uh we're gonna do a couple things real quick before we even go in that [Music] room we're going to go ahead and pull up our aqua x for our history there it is all right so last night i collected more runoff that the uh the ph was still pretty high in the medium coming out at 6.6 ish so i went ahead and adjusted the inbound ph to 5.02 5.3 and started pushing those nutrients through and you can see here on the mendo you can see that calcium magnesium deficiency here and it's on every plant you know um some more than others but on alien og you can see these leaves are just barely starting to show signs of it otherwise they're pretty happy so definitely need to increase the ec overall right both both strains are showing you know similar issues um that means it's time to bump up the feed so what i did is i increased the ec from 2.5 to 3.5 a whole ec bump um i'm pretty comfortable with that you can see the type of stacking we're getting here [Music] [Music] so what i'll do is i'll continue to catch my runoff using my clone tray trick cut a clone tray in half wedge it so it slants use a root riser or an extra riser if you need to so it doesn't sit in water and then you can run off at the end of every day and see how much your one-on-one volume was as well as your ph and your ec and uh my ec is usually within one ec or two ec of whatever i'm putting in and the old theory that it should only be within a point or two of you know what you're putting in that's not true because we do what's called ec stacking where we're getting the ec and the cube up to four or five even six you know overnight in the morning when they start getting watered again they're gonna be getting flushed out from that you see build-up and it's gonna you know make it look like it's a higher ec on the runoff when in reality it's not really any anything to be concerned about you know if you're monitoring your medium you see which i am removing some of these affected leaves and also making sure that everything stays nice and open so that these side branches continue to develop the way that they have been the plan here is you can kind of see hopefully you can kind of see i've got three nice rows going here really good even canopy the way it's lined up with you know top top top and then the whole line straight down pretty much in one row of squares same thing here what i'm going to do is i'm going to not top these i'm going to super crop these right so you can see how this auxiliary branch this one they're all almost caught up to the net right this one here so if i were to take this top now maybe like right here at the net and super crop it i'm not going to do it right now because it's not time backwards and down and put it underneath this net now it's at the same level as everything else on the plant but this will be the main polar spill and i'm going to get a nice sexy row of main colas with a bunch of very nice even supporting colas throughout the canopy so that's the plan i've got the same you know set up on both sides as far as three and three so you can kind of see the same thing here go down this aisle here [Music] and i've got another one catching a runoff here if i measure two places move this one over here to this side and again these are going to get the same exact treatment i'm just coming in making sure that all the uh affected leaves come off so i can see the new growth coming in nice and healthy and making sure that we leave the canopy open for all the lateral branching that's going on you can see some plants were affected more than others with uh the higher ph and the lack of available nutrients so i flushed this one this one plant and uh this one plant was about 2 000 ml each last night by hand and that seemed to have put them back on the correct path sooner than uh just letting them go with the irrigation so today will be the first full day with them getting 3.5 ec that 5.2 the reason for that is because we're still getting a slightly high ph runoff and we want to make sure that we fully correct that in all cubes before we move on so right now we're sitting at 69 percent in the cube and uh 5.38 for water ec it is um [Music] 9 21 right now so they're about to get irrigated uh here in a minute now the reason that this particular cube is at such a high um saturation point already is because i watered it like i said first thing last night i went through and i hit a couple by hand and i wanted to flush out the one that had my moisture sensors in it get it up to full saturation so i knew what my full saturation percentage is right now it's about 65 on troll master i'll show you over here [Music] or on here it's about 75 percent i was able to determine that last night and now that's going to help me dial in my over my drybacks as far as when my last watering of the day is and when my first watering of the day is so that i can achieve the correct percentage or drive back that i want to steer growth appropriately whether vegetably or generatively so there's so much that goes into that though that you need to be able to a measure your runoff your daily runoff percentage you need to be able to measure your pore water ec and your water content your volumetric water content percentage and you need to be able to do all of those simultaneously in order to create the graphs and the longitudinal the longitudinal um you know historical data that you're looking for goons what's up brother appreciate you man thank you for the support terpene junkie what's up bro show a close-up of the leaves affected hopefully you saw it i don't know if you did if not i will definitely go back and show that so calmac deficiencies really in my experience in hydroponics like rock wool and deep water culture everything except for like cocoa basically calmac deficiencies show up slightly different and in cocoa i noticed in soil and cocoa they the the calm deficiencies kind of expressed themselves a little bit differently in my experience i'm not a soil grower i've done one soil grow i've done zero cocoa growth but i've consulted on a lot of everything and um yeah so in my experience of like rock wool and deep water culture things like that um calmac deficiencies usually express themselves as a splotching on the leaves all right um it looks like a dark brown splotching almost like somebody were to take a cigarette and put it on your leaf but instead of burning black it burns brown and it burns from the inside out and it spreads and you'll start getting more and more splotches the worse it gets and then once you reach a certain level of splotching it'll just look like intervenal chlorosis to the maximum which is when the individual pieces on the leaves start to brown out and then once you get past the necrosis stage then you really start having issues because now not are you only just super deficient on calmadd but now you're gonna start becoming locked out on a lot of other things because your calmac's missing if your calmag is missing you guys know mulders chart and you guys know liebig's barrel or leibig's law right your yield is limited to the least available nutrient right such that once you increase that nutrient to sufficient levels your yield is then limited by the next most deficient nutrient so if calmag is deficient it's going to start [ __ ] up everything else you know um and then you start seeing the chlorosis of the upper leaves and a bunch of other stuff um cocoa is buffered cocoa is 100 buffered that's why i said you see it differently right hydroponics is not buffered so let me go show you real quick typically um the first the first signs in my opinion that you're gonna start seeing calmac deficiencies on is going to be the newer grow all right because uh calmac believe it or not is not super duper mobile it's a little bit mobile a little bit but not a lot so if the plant needs it and the newer growth where it's growing it may send some from the older growth right so you may start to see the deficiency first on older growth a little bit but you're also going to see it at the top row yeah i wasn't covering the mic good so if we just look at these first few plants here and i know the white balance and [ __ ] is all rough but look check this out so here's a good plant to look at here is the telltale signs right there this is an advanced stage of calcium magnesium deficiency this is not the beginning stages if you were to see one or two little spots not even looking let me see if i could find a top leaf a top leaf is not going to have it as bad see that's a top leaf having that issue but not as bad you could see the small necrosis spots right here on the on the leaf edge right um let's see let's just fan dammit this one doesn't have it much yet these are small plants but not a lot of demand but yeah that's that's like the best example right there like legit that's a really good example that's what it looks like when it first starts out this is what it looks like when it progresses okay that's straight up cal mag but it could also mean that the plants just need an overall higher ec also um calmag does weird [ __ ] to growth because calcium calcium is used as one of the major building blocks of the cell walls um it creates a lot of the plant tissue itself and if you have a lack of calcium what tends to happen is you'll get twisted growth along with those splotches and the necrosis which is the telltale sign on top of everything else if you see that twisted growth calmac deficiency i'm almost 100 sure if you have those other signs perfect example look at this lower growth right remember i told you see how it's starting to contort a little bit right that was because when this plant started it had cow mag deficiencies this was at one time a new leaf it doesn't turn into this if it comes out a straight leaf it pretty much stays straight unless it gets really [ __ ] up and dry right like this leaf it came out pretty healthy it's going to stay straight even if it goes deficient but new growth like this [ __ ] up here you can see it was kind of starting to twist a little bit and then let me take you to where i i know it's the worst i think it was like the worst back here i might have seen one or two plants starting to do it which is how i knew it was starting to get bad let me see if i could find it [Music] so here's some more new growth with that issue cow mag easy to see [Music] i might have already pulled the leaf off i can't find it now but basically the leaves will be contorted the new growth the leaves will be just weird twisted and funky and they'll be looking they'll be looking like this coming out of the new growth but maybe even worse that's a really good way to tell if you have all those other signs as well that it's a calmag issue another leaf i could spot that's doing it i'll just pull it off and show it to you look see the twist in the leaf weird [ __ ] right so that's why i went ahead and bumped up the ec yesterday from 2.5 to 3.5 i'll give them one full day on 3.5 irrigation at a 5.2 ph to bring down the ph into my comfort zone of 5.4 to 5.7 once i've achieved a runoff value getting into the 4ec range and that ph range i just mentioned and i'm hitting a poor water ec value of you know six to seven then i think i'll be happy right now i haven't seen anything over you know five five point seven on my poor water ec which i could be going as high as seven without issues right now so like right now we're at 69 and 5.4 that's going to go down more over the course of the day but overnight when we do this drive back tonight that's gonna go back up so that's what's going on but um i mean that sides obviously the taller bigger clones that i put over there this one has some smaller ones like this front light the rest are all about the same size as those now they caught up and i'm gonna go ahead and give these about one week basically they're gonna finish this reservoir all right once they finish this reservoir i'm expecting to have everything 100 dialed in i'm going to strip them to the top three nodes on every main branch that i plan on keeping i'm gonna super crop the main stem the primary branch i'll super crop i'm gonna drop the net down on top of them and then go ahead and give it like two days and then i'm gonna flip so it's going to be a crazy week coming up i'm going to start hitting them with some power si athena ag stack which is the kelp and uh some ipm and uh they're gonna get hit a couple times a week probably two times a week for the next week or two and then once we have bud sites we're gonna stop and i'll start upping my ec in the reservoir so probably around you know getting close to four 4.5 um me personally i this is just a really really really hungry [ __ ] cultivar the fact that i'm pushing you know 2.5 ec and i'm hitting five 5.5 ec in the medium during dry back and they're still going deficient that [ __ ] goes to show you that they want more ec they want it they [ __ ] want it and i don't give a [ __ ] what anybody says if i have to push this crop to 8ec again on the inbound nutrient solution i i will will trust me i will hopefully i can avoid doing that but um the first week that i think that these are like 100 healthy or as close as i can get it i'm sending in lab samples sending in inbound nutrient solution runoff nutrient solution i tested the medium yeah i'm gonna cut a chunk of rock wool off and um leaf tissue sample and i'm gonna do that for two plants i'm gonna do it for amino breath and i'm gonna choose one of the alien ogs what that's gonna do is it's going to enable me to get feedback from jr peters who was then going to tell me okay on your inbound nutrient solution here's your actual ppm levels of every single nutrient an element in micronutrient right on your runoff here's the same exact thing right so now we can tell what the plant is taking up and then they're going to look at the leaf tissue and really confirm what it's taking up right and all of those things are basically going to enable me to make very good decisions about do i need to simply increase the ece more do i need to increase a specific nutrient more do i need to decrease any am i wasting a bunch which means i can decrease the amount that i'm feeding or just increase the uptake uptake is one of the most overlooked things there is right it doesn't matter how much you're feeding your plants or how little you're feeding your plants what matters is how you're driving their metabolism and through that and the dry backs you can control the medium you ec and really spike it and make them have everything they need available if you drive their uptake correctly but some plants are just going to want that higher ec right so it's about finding the balance and that's what that's what all these data points are for that's what we talk about every day on the show so those of you that are new here today i don't know if there is anybody welcome to the channel 24-hour light during veg versus 18-6 i think that you should look up dli and you should look up the circadian rhythm and you should think about how it would affect your body if you had the lights on all the time and when you tried to sleep if the lights were blazing and if how that would affect your sleep and there for the rest of your day and your processes what's up j-rock check my email real fast sorry there's a chilly one in here i don't feel like doing that right now sorry paul it's not gonna happen you're gonna have to wait buddy all right and my meetings are [Music] mother [ __ ] empty let's go monday you're treating me right no monday meeting no monday meetings confirmed sweet well with that said i wanted to take some readings in there while i finished drinking my coffee do you guys want to go with me all right we're going to take a bunch of readings after i change my battery i gotta um start using this [ __ ] log that i created because what the [ __ ] did i make it for if i'm not gonna use it wham bam thank you ma'am all right and i made it into a pdf but you know what i'm actually gonna do i'm gonna turn it into an excel spreadsheet and then based on that excel spreadsheet you're going to be able to [Music] automatically have it graph things for you so you can see your trends and your [ __ ] like that so as long as you're going in there and doing your daily checks it'll it'll log the information for you and kind of create a nice little data analysis trend let's hit this runs baby oh my god the sweet runs some gmo rosin gross gross garlic butter shrimp farts how hard would it be to switch from 24 hours to 18-6 without messing up plant sex what why would what i'm not even gonna answer that somebody else handle that [ __ ] please thank you cheers oh i see a little fuzzy i need to make an emoji on my [ __ ] youtube that's the what emotion but what sometimes people ask me questions you guys think toy story 4 when the dinosaur is like hey woody i've got a question actually woody i've got all the questions buddy i have all of the questions when people ask me questions that confuse me that's what i feel like saying like what i've got questions about your questions like i've got all the questions about your question [ __ ] excuse me though i don't know how you guys like that gmo oh my goodness i can't do it i just can't cheers [Music] uh huh [Music] oh yeah y'all know what time it is it's time for that adult swim um that's right big i smoke fresh breast usually when i press it all of a separate like a little jar full it depends on if i have other [ __ ] to smoke on at the time but usually i like to give it a couple days because i like to to get the consistency where i want it it's more so about consistency than anything because once it comes out of the freeze dryer it's usually all the way dried already so i don't have to worry about moisture or anything like that it's more so just a preference laughs squiggly oh right single source what's up homie number one fan that's dope dog i appreciate you homie yeah just off the press yeah i smoke it absolutely yeah fresh press it really depends like like hemp said there can be some moisture in it if like it just depends right it depends on how much hash you're running through how it how the cycle went sometimes there can be still a slight amount of moisture in there that is good to let kind of go before you smoke it but you'll hear it when you dab it when it's fresh pressed if you go to dab it and you hear the crackling and popping then you know there's moisture in it and you need to go ahead and let that shake cure before you start dishing it out otherwise people are going to have cracking bangers and going to be like what the [ __ ] why is your [ __ ] popping so to really master like freshly pressed hash to be able to go straight from the plates to smoking it it has to be just completely dried you know it can't have all the excess moisture so people that try to decrease their dry times in the freeze dryer and speed up the process or they're just trying to quote unquote preserve terps and not dry them off too much you're not gonna over dry your terps on a standard 9 9 through 12 12. you could do up to a 12 12 um which is a 12 hour freeze 12 hour drive and you're not going to [ __ ] hurt your terps you know um it's the temperatures that you gotta worry about you know at 55 fahrenheit shelf temp you're not gonna hurt anything when you're at [ __ ] it you know when your [ __ ] resets and you're at 120 degrees because you didn't check your settings first you know always check your settings before you start every batch on the freeze dryer every time it doesn't matter if you unplugged it even if you didn't turn it off check the settings before you hit start every [ __ ] time i'm gonna say it one more time for the people in the back check your settings every single time before you hit start on your freeze drive every [ __ ] time not once not twice every time one more time every [ __ ] time why did i just say that 20 [ __ ] times because i guarantee you the fact that i just repeated it 20 times is gonna save one of you guys thousands of dollars in hash i [ __ ] guarantee it because there's been at least three to four times where i've went to go start the freeze dryer and i was like i got a feeling and i checked the settings and the settings were off why because it's a harvest wrong there doesn't have to be a reason it just happens all right if your [ __ ] shows up it works you should be lucky you know what i'm saying so look i know that was a little annoying but i guarantee you me saying that that many times just saved at least one of you guys thousands of dollars cash because i've had numerous people in my dms hey bro i keep getting no yield when i go to press my hash what's going on i'm getting no yield what's happening what's going on and the reason that they're getting no [ __ ] yield is because they're cooking the hash in the freeze dryer do you want to know what these home units reset to by default usually if their motherboard goes wonky they reset to 120 degrees on the shelf temperature do you know what a 120 degrees in a vacuum is going to do to your ash for 10 to 12 hours oh limonene mercy gone all of them just start naming turps start waving them off like a [ __ ] parade get your princess wave on bye-bye it happens at least once a week that i have to [ __ ] very very sadly informed somebody that they need to start checking their [ __ ] settings because they just cooked their hash and if they would have put a plate on top of it they made it they could have probably made rosin honestly at that temperature a little bit of pressure 12 hours you could have some rosin in there baby so it's like it see it happened to you no oil is left at all see and it's not the hash the hash was probably bomb as [ __ ] the hash was probably i saw your hash actually your hash i was surprised that your hash you were getting the yields that you were getting because i didn't think that you even washed that much and you were pulling a pretty big spoonful out of there and it looked really good but yeah so that hash that you were scooping out you put it in the freeze dryer and now it cooked and lost all your oils and then you probably want to press it and you probably only got like if you're lucky 20 of what you should have yielded it's so unfortunate so unfortunate oh my tits are [ __ ] freezing son cold in here oh rolling lamp oh man anyways let's go uh change his battery out i think you're about to die eight percent yeah yo like i'm not gonna say i was ranting i was monologuing yo i'm a [ __ ] pretend i'm a villain and i was just monologuing i almost let the battery die though i can't do that fantastic oh it's [ __ ] cold all right i got a couple things we got to do let's go take some measurements get in the warm room and then uh we'll come back and we'll uh press some hash and the press is up to temperature already so all i gotta do is [ __ ] uh sift it load it in the bags make the parchment you guys know it's going to be a little bit of a process but what the [ __ ] are you here for if not for the process all right you guys already saw the log i [Music] think [Music] special um [Music] all right so first things up is uh environment we're gonna go ahead and check the ambient temp relative humidity leaf surface temperature vapor pressure deficit and co2 and then we're gonna take some notes i am going to check multiple sources or check this one here we're going to check troll master of course and i calibrate as often as i need to when i find a discrepancy between the two of them when they're placed in the same spot right now you can see where my troll master is placed i'll keep it here kind of close to the planet too close but uh land bam thank you ma'am put it there kind of want it to be in your canopy you don't really care what it's like up here you want to know what it's like where the plants are at right [Music] all right now because we have that over there we're going to take this over there we're going gonna check the same thing make sure that's calibrated first and foremost then we're gonna go ahead and check around the room see if we have any major fluctuations and uh let's check what troll master says right now trollmaster is saying 82.3 at 58.3 and 14.69 82 is 58. [Music] so we're at 81.9 and 57. that's pretty [ __ ] close good enough for me so now we're gonna go around and verify what's going on in your neck of the woods tony 81.7 and 55. humidity's higher over here i need to put another humidifier in here it's not much higher 82 and 57 looking good come over [ __ ] here stuller hold you strong oh yeah oh yeah we're sitting pretty in here when everything is nice and even like that within a couple degrees oh [ __ ] yeah okay that's that we know our numbers are looking good there so um yeah let's start recording some of this [ __ ] i gotta write it down i need a pen i don't i don't think i have one out here hold on [Music] oh that garbage can stinks [Music] [Music] lapiz i don't want to [ __ ] use a marker i'll be back you [ __ ] you sit here and you look at my ugly garage that's what you do you know what here look at this gentry rig isn't that exciting this is for you guys right here this gentry rig is for you guys look gentry gentry glass it's for you guys no [ __ ] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] okay man i love my kids so much every time i go in the house i just i get caught up i want to just stay in there and play with them like [ __ ] you guys look at this pop let me finish this coffee i don't want to waste my coffee today i always waste it because i'm sitting here [ __ ] around talking to you guys and it gets cold and it's gross oh i'm sorry deep in bothering there you go no more beeping no more beeping no it makes me to me i'm a [ __ ] stoner bro i don't hear the beeping what turn this [ __ ] off what the [ __ ] man why is it on but if i hear the deep thing i'm like hmm there's hash in there let's go so when i pull the hash out i turn it off usually not before then all right oh it's more than a gentry giveaway it's a big giveaway all right let's go we're gonna get this [ __ ] done [Music] so um all right so we got a what's today today is monday september 14th all right so we're going to go ambient temp in here right now let's cool 83 to 84. right now on this i'm not just recording the actual value i'm recording what my set points are too right so i don't know if you can see it but there's a set value an actual value and that just allows me to see if my du and my ac and my humidifier are keeping up with what i'm telling them to do or if i need to um factor in some type of offset right so set actually so right now my set point is at 79 for my ac my actual value is 83 to 84. and then my next value is my rh my relative humidity right now my set value for that is at 55 and i'm at 54 so it's holding good there my leaf surface temperature i'm going to go ahead and collect that right now 80 81 82 79 81 81 81 81 81 81 81 81 a1 212 [Music] so we're looking good but i do want to lower my temperature just probably one degree because i would like my leaf surface temperature to be more about 78 79 instead of 80 81 so i'm probably gonna go ahead and make that adjustment but i'm gonna record it as is right now so leaf surface temp we are at uh 81 okay and then co2 well we'll measure vpd based off of those calculations and then we'll put co2 for co2 right now we're at uh we were at 14.50 when i walked in now we're at 15 12 but i've been breathing and [ __ ] but our set value i believe is that 1400 right now uh no 1450 actually so we're holding good right there so our co2 is staying good and um let's see so now we're going to go ahead and calculate dpd and i'll go ahead and show you guys more [Music] now if we were to drop our leap surface temperature down a little bit that's pretty good [Music] now if we were holding at 55 that's where we would be at right temperature down a little bit i'm going to aim for like 82 air temperature which should give us about about 78 79 leave surface temperature and then we'll keep the humidity at 55 and that'll keep us at 1.3 kpa which is pretty good not too high not too low okay now some people say you know they like to run higher humidity like 60. that's cool but you're only at a 1.1 kpa right there you're not putting a very high demand on the plant for uptake and so if you're starting to see deficiencies sometimes you might need to put a little bit more demand on the plant for uptake which is [ __ ] with the kpa right not necessarily the light intensity you're not trying to make it drink more you're just trying to make it be able to utilize what's there right so anyways that's the that's that but right now based off of the numbers that we had we were at 83. [Music] we're about 80 and 55 so we're at a 1.38 kpa so okay that's that and then um the next thing that we're going to monitor is the irrigation we're going to check the troll master which is our reservoir and our water content sensor we're going to check the tarots and we're going to check our runoff and see how the runoff is looking today since normally this would be like a weekly check but i'm actually trying to correct the ph right now and i'm chasing down this nutrient deficiency so i need to be monitoring the runoff almost daily right now so let's go through this ec ph water content and temperature easy peasy baby reservoir [ __ ] 3.5 and 5.3 okay so i need to get this printed out on excel sheets and i'll just do this all on my phone from now on but uh you see we are at uh 3.5 and that's on both blue lab and on troll master so we're good there okay so um 3.5 we're at 5.2 on the ph i can even add like a blue lab section in here because troll master is at 5.3 blue labs at 5.2 okay uh water content and temp so we're at 69 70 water content we're at 62 percent on troll master we'll get to the taros right now and run off blue lab doesn't have water content we're going to check this cube we're at 66 and 5.5 76. and ph tarot doesn't do and then we'll go ahead and we'll grab the runoff and runoff doesn't have a water content percentage um the next thing also is going to be the start time for the irrigation shot size and duration frequency and last feed so right now my start time is at 730 the shot size 45 seconds um roughly 60 milliliters frequency it's um 7 30 8 8 30 and then from there i believe we're doing every hour and a half two hours every two hours so then every two hours the last feed is at 8 30 p.m two hours before lights off [Music] and then we'll go check some runoff so here's an easy way for you guys to collect runoff take a cup preferably one that doesn't have a bunch of [ __ ] in it come down to the plant that you want to collect runoff from which is going to be this one going up only one the other one hasn't hit run off yet because we're not pushing that much volume anymore and i wanted to make sure that basically i'm not getting too much runoff every day so i lowered my feed volume but this one i i flushed last night so it was at full saturation so it's giving me runoff already like it should the rest of them i'm going to manually get up to full saturation so that everything here is fully saturated and starts off the same with the dry backs tomorrow but i gotta figure out what's going on first if my flush through worked on this one last night so we're gonna see what the runoff is so i'm not really sure maybe right there in a good place so the easiest way to do this the reason i cut the chrome tray in half is because no matter how big your plant gets you can just slide the [ __ ] clone tray right off the ladder without really having to do too much right so i just move this slide this tray out from underneath it [Music] cut this down now i've got all my [ __ ] runoff right here boom if this starts to get a bunch of salt build up clean it off because it'll affect your reading [Music] slides right back [Music] so the other one let's go see what's going on where we have here no but i can tell we're almost at saturation that's good [Music] all right so we're going to go ahead and take this now [Music] we're going to pull out here and these are all going to go in there [Music] sorry i'm doing this one-handed so bear with me [Music] well we're getting a good ph 6.1 i still would like to see that come down a little bit saying 4.6 6.1 [Music] i'm not sure why this errored out look at this one in there by itself [Music] here we go so five is saying we're just over five i almost filled that it's saying we're just over five but i'm going to use the troll master one because the troll master one goes over five and i have my blue lap pulse that goes to 15. sorry runoff is somewhere between 4.7 and 5. [Music] you may need to clean these i'm not liking that there's a discrepancy in the reading but it is what it is if i put them both in there together i mean this one doesn't read over five so either way we're [ __ ] on that one but ph wise they're both coming out at 6.1 so that tells me that flush through that i did last night money baby so i'm gonna go ahead and [Music] manually flush every single one of these with at least a thousand to 2000 mls correct that ph because these are growing like crazy already so that same trick i just used where i gathered the runoff if you start with an empty measuring cup and and your dripper lines at the beginning of the day and an empty runoff collection tray at the end of your day or before the irrigation starts the next morning which would even be more accurate you can collect what's in here see what the total volume is collect what's in your runoff from a plant then you know all right this plant got this much total fed throughout the day and then boom that's how much the runoff was and the runoff values were this boom [Music] so our runoff ec was about five 5ec the uh ph was 6.1 and the temp was like 70 something i forgot 70 something lol all right so i mean that's that's pretty good what we're putting in and then the runoff and remember the runoff is not like really really high that means there's not a lot of salt buildup going on there's just a little bit of salt buildup the intentional salt build-up that would you can see our poor water ec here is still pretty good it's at 5.5 and so that means we're maintaining a pretty good balance right now um i'll go ahead and measure the total volume um tomorrow or later you know because this is going still and uh i'll see what the volume um and then the last thing that's going to be is the plant health toxicities deficiencies cranes demonstrate so for those toxicities deficiencies alien og is looking good um deficiency appearing on newer growth the mendos they're having the same exact issue but it's just a little bit more exacerbated overall the growth is still really vigorous right now and is improving um don't pinch test this feels pretty solid i don't feel any pith autolysis at all [Music] yeah no hollow stems they feel nice and good thick the smell is already pretty [ __ ] ridiculous just on touching the stems wow no hollow stems here either new growth coming out good slightly uh slightly lacking the chlorophyll on the leaf tips just like you would expect that's not a deficiency or anything that's typically leaves come out and before they're able to start producing you know a lot of chlorophyll that the t the tips are bleached a little bit you'll see that on almost all new growth there's some more of that calmag deficiency over here [Music] so overall the plant's health is improving over previous days the deficiencies seem to be getting corrected by bringing the ph down however they still do seem to want more and i'm going to gladly give it to them and what i'm trying to determine now is if they want an overall ec boost or just a calcium magnesium supplement and i talked with athena ag yesterday and they agreed with me that i should just go ahead and bump up the ec so that's why we went from 2.5 to 3.5 we'll give them a day at that then we'll see what happens root health and tell me got roots busting out this [ __ ] air pruned you're not gonna see long ass roots in my craze [Music] can't wait to get my zeratol in [Music] and these are the small plants too [Music] good [Music] and i've been running hydrogen medical grade hydrogen peroxide at 5 ml per gallon and i'm still getting that algae so you guys can't tell me [ __ ] about hydrogen peroxide and how [ __ ] good it works i'm so tired of hearing about people hitting me up very tall it's just hydrogen peroxide no [ __ ] no it's not god damn it hydrogen peroxide does not work the same i've gone through three different [ __ ] bottles of brand new medical grade hydrogen peroxide for different things and it cut cut that [ __ ] out so they're tall from now on so let me record this [ __ ] um overall i'm not seeing any toxicities um deficiencies cow mag issue getting better with fixed ph [Music] seven or an eight out of ten you know looking around definitely seemed better i'll give him a 7. and uh stem strength we're getting a four out of five on stems purple getting better nothing hollow and um root health [ __ ] 100 all right i think that's all the information i need right now i'll make some informed decisions based on this and um i think it's time to request a sample i'll give those to seed right now i think it's time to request a sample from j.r peters um i guess we could watch the [ __ ] pc and [ __ ] chain on the moisture console so this says 66.5 and 5.6 this is about 61 so let's see where it goes after the feed this changes in real time so pretty good jump short little feed we're up 70 that means we should be hitting uh runoff on that one which i believe we are [Music] i don't think we're gonna be hitting run off i'm curious to uh go and measure that other one where the runoff's at but we'll see we'll let it we'll let this [ __ ] ride out all right we got our information let's go and [Music] we're gonna drop that temperature you do a couple things today now that we're done with that we got to knock out some other [ __ ] got me in i mean grow mode right now i really want to go in there and do some more [ __ ] no the battery's fine it's just the connection and the uh the garage so okay so yeah i'm really happy that we just got all that recorded now you guys see what i go through just if you could spend the time to do that you know um and and to be honest we skipped over a whole [ __ ] section we didn't we didn't gather any of the lighting information um but we'll go back in there and get that in a minute i'm pretty sure i know what that information is already i haven't changed it um but i know not everybody has all those tools just do the best you can with what you have if i could recommend a couple of tools that are not that expensive i would recommend the az7755 it's a it's a decent um measurement tool for your temperature humidity and co2 it's mobile walk around check different parts of your canopy and it may not log the information for you but you can at least stabilize some [ __ ] you want to see the light numbers i need to get some light numbers for quantum right now anyways let me um take care of a few things oh [ __ ] roddy it's time to take a dab and then we'll go in there and get some light measurements okay all right so i believe that homie quantum wanted to see 100 all the way with 70 on the intensity at 29 inches away denny what did you want to see 90 and 100 on all spectrums how far away now you guys can go ahead and get the cheaper version of this sensor i'm about to send you it may be the same exact thing just rebranded i personally don't know but i made sure that i got the one that said on it not the knockoffs that just said temp co2 humidity on it so this one cost a little bit more than the other ones the other ones you can get for like 150-ish this one's like 280. i don't know i was like 130 dollars more for the peace of mind knowing it's one that i know works from the legit company worth it cool no problem so so there's that one i highly recommend that um if you can get a tarot 12 with a pro check i i recommend it i will most likely be making them available um to people but we will see all right let's get this dabaroni in i knew quantum was about to ask for the link that lazy [ __ ] that's why i already had that [ __ ] copied ready to go here you go lazy [ __ ] lazy [ __ ] so 9 inches 90 intensity 100 oh cheers ah me dirty but this is more than a co2 meter it has temperature humidity and co2 and it's all in a mobile hand unit that's been calibrated and certified if you got a really small grow i'm with you 100 or do we know that [ __ ] the whole thing temperature humidity co2 everything everything however it's not really a good long-term solution for most people especially because the sensors that most people pair with arduinos are not really meant for a grow room environment especially with the higher humidities so it's just uh personally i i stayed away from the arduino just because i'm not in a you know a cabinet though or a tent grow and not knocking the smaller grows it's just it's a lot easier to implement a diy system on a smaller scale setting up ro water what do you mean setting up ro water use buy a filter hook it up to a you know a hose bib and run the line where you want it to go with the float valve and then turn on your filter voila all right i don't think content is in the house he might not be able to talk if he is all right hold on i gotta get my boy quantum in here real quick my boy quantum is in the hizzy and he needs to be able to talk all right my boy my boy talk to get the me chat going yes i already know bam done done all right should be able to talk now still all right let me go get these measurements almost ready for you so my lights are a 100 minus the intensity hold on wow i went on a hunt for my tape measure and it's [ __ ] right here behind the camera plants specifically this one is three feet away okay so i'll just leave the tape measure there i'll put the lights on whatever intensity you want me to put them on and then i'll just measure at whatever distance so let me go back to the chat real quick and see what's what's up first actually [Music] all right um what do you want me to do brother what are the what are the tests first what are we doing here nine nine inches 90 intensity 100 oh it reconnected good okay so here's the deal i can't do it i gotta go grab my tablet if i start [ __ ] with the the lights from my phone it disconnects the gopro because the phone has to use bluetooth to connect to the lights so it disconnects from the gopro which disconnects the wi-fi so that's why it almost lost connection right now let me go grab my um my tablet i [ __ ] i think it's inside it's not charged yet but i should be able to get it charged and in the meantime we'll [ __ ] with the hash sound good good well you know what hold on before all that let me tell you let me tell you what we're at real quick i can at least tell you right now that we're at 65 percent with 100 on all spectrums so let me give you those readings at least so at 65 percent and three feet away i'm at 400 cars that's right here on the edge of the tables right if i go more direct underneath the middle of that everything we're looking at a 425 430 now if i go up to two feet right in the middle of the light two feet i'm at 600 par 600 dpfd okay if i go out to the edge of the light at two feet i'm at a four seventy four eighty okay now if i go up to one foot away right in the middle of the light sitting at 650. now remember i'm at 65 intensity 65 okay so let's i'll do 18 inches away um 18 inches away we're hitting about 660 right here 640 660. um up here one foot away kind of further back not dead center but over here 550 this is right underneath this black spot right now if we start here's the weird thing about these 120 degree optics i don't know how far up you could see but the weird thing about them is when you get further up into that sweet spot like right here at about eight inches away i'm hitting about a thousand ppfd and i'm only at 65 percent so imagine if you were to boost these at nine inches away you're [ __ ] blasting those games baby and if they could take it then [ __ ] yeah make sure you up your ec make sure your dpv in check and [ __ ] blast off bro hopefully that helps right here two feet away you can see we're hovering like i said around 580 580 to 600 at two feet away it's just all about the overlap that you have in your garden though or your tent those things are gonna highly affect your ppfd as you move around sorry i couldn't give you more solid info on that right now so i can't [ __ ] with the intensity right now i can't because if i'm on my phone and i'd switch to messing with the lights then it disconnects the gopro so i'm at 65 right now and i just measured at three feet two feet and one foot so you know you're looking at about 400 you know to about 600 650 once i get off the live stream i'll take those more detailed measurements for you and give you kind of like a good good little par map to go off of um let me go grab some [ __ ] i'll be back so so i had to sneak my tablet out of the house so my kids didn't see it because they'll want that [ __ ] so quick all right cool we'll give this a little bit to charge i haven't used it i don't know how long and um first and foremost you know i really just gotta prep so i'm gonna set up the camera in an area where it's easy for you guys to see and i'm going to knock out some prep work so hmm that work let's see that might work two [Music] [Music] two so [Music] so [Music] so cheese [Music] so [Music] [Music] thinking maybe up there isn't the best spot for you guys i'm thinking maybe you guys should just get up here does this work for you guys up here [Music] i don't know except

sublimate properly [Music] it's rare occasion that that happens to me i usually don't even [ __ ] with it i just need it if it didn't process right it didn't process right you don't want to force it into the this you know look at the quality of this [Music] don't [ __ ] around and put that in there some people will save that some people give it to homies some people will smoke it [Music] i trash it call me crazy i trash all right [Music] ain't got time to [ __ ] around with that time is money [Music] thick there was some thick ass patties of ash in there [Music] involved [Music] [Music] so [Music] so master kush coming to a banger near you [Music] [Music] so do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] so

probably just chilling at home huh all this [ __ ] going on [Music] so [Music] foreign [Music] rdwc airstones [Music] if i were to ever go to rdwc again i think i would use [Music] an electrolysis machine [Music] ah video sucks alone you're at work [ __ ] it but you've got it is my channel safe for work or is it not safe for work i don't know i've never thought about that [Music] okay [Music] okay make sure you pack those bags good because when you go to stuff it into the second bag i mean it's like pushing rope you guys it's like trying to put a condom on a half chub you know it works better if you got the full thing [Music] so [Music] hey i mean some of you guys will get that some of you will [Music] my channel would probably be safe for work if it wasn't for all my crew jokes

hello and welcome back to the cannabis Somali eh I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis reviews today because of legalization 2.0 the new product categories I'm finally able to bring you a legally distributed extract now it's not the extract or the quality that you may have seen on the channel two years ago or any of the hash rosen's that I've had recently gifted to me by friends but at least it is an extract in the legal market it's something that I can purchase to really ramp things up and it's starting to feel more like the legacy market of purchasing cannabis in the dispensary now that we have these products so what did I get today we have BC Keef and this BC Keith is coming to us from can of farms I didn't look where canif arms is but I have a feeling it's not in BC but it might be that was a good ramble needless to say I don't know but it's called BC Keith and you can see it there maybe if it'll focus no I got another video there we go BC Keith can of farms you can read everything going on there see our duty steel still on perfect I picked this up yesterday for the low low price of twenty seven dollars for one gram of Keith CR twenty seven dollars maybe twenty seven bucks the green easy there are four hundred twenty one forty two point one milligrams of THC and total THC is three hundred thirty two milligrams so that'll be interesting to just see how much contaminant is in here with that note ice with an extra six hundred milligrams of something in there that's not THC and no CBD we can only assume that it is a plant matter but who knows this is the equivalent of it says content equivalent of four grams of carrying cannabis so that's interesting our Keef packaged on 2019 11:27 today is March the fourth start a cool cool dry place camp section and what's our warning adolescents are at a greater risk neo daily used for long period of time can harm brain development well I'm doing pretty good but if you're under the age of 18 click out of this video now cuz you're not even supposed to be here so there we go there is our beautiful product we have our seal Duty seal here and let's just crack right in shall we try on the new two camera so that we get a little bit closer of a view when we open up these products and now you can see our nicely set jar if I can get it out with a false bottom in the package let's check that out so just to have some more shelf space or something I don't actually know why you would need to do that but that's okay we'll see things in the future changing so here is our package and you know I wouldn't have been upset actually just getting this with all the information off the shelf but there's no branding on it and there's an apparent smell of cannabis coming off of it so there we go the nice blue glass oh yeah the blue glass yuan jar so that's a that's a nice perk for sure here we go and do we have a different warning frequent to prolong cannabis containing tea if she can contribute to mental health problems over time BC chief I don't know what where DC or why they call it BC chief but it's obviously not strand-specific and again packed Sean 11:27 pretty cool let's open it up shall we our first legal extract and our first legal extract has a nice jar with a child seal on it so of course there we go and that is the first look of our BC Keef there it is you can see I've got the nice close-up video now though recommended by a YouTube follower thank you so much for your recommendation so it is a little green it's uh it's looking like a pre you know it's um it's a it's a pretty rough tumble without a doubt I don't think it's um just take through it a little bit here okay so it's clumped up it does still have a little bit of moisture going on in it let's see how it smells it smells a little green to be very honest with you it's a little over tumbled I didn't expect like the most amazing Keefe hash whatever for those of you that don't know the word Keith Keefe is usually the sifted hash the that forms in the bottom of your grinder has been the slang term that I've always used for Keef but it's just a jet\u00e9 today anibus usually found in the bottom chamber of your grinder I'm wondering if there's even in this one just to show a contrast of what grinder Keith yes there is so that's my grinder Keith just a little bit this is probably really old and then that's the color of this so it is pretty close without a doubt I can't say anything about that so it smells a little green has like some really big woodsy aromas that I would relate to lemongrass sandalwood maybe a little bit of pine some fresh downed trees I'm gonna put a little bit of my fingers actually and squish it and just see if we can get anything going here that's what it looks like all my fingers and let's see if I can just smell it better mmm smells like very handsome Cologne sandalwood musk earthy musky a little bit of a citrus definitely is gonna taste good like as I smell it and I smell a cannabis aromas smells good my fingers are a little bit sticky after rubbing it but nothing crazy so I figured out you would use two ways to kind of evaluate this sample just because it is straight Keith I didn't know exactly what I should do I've always used my vaporizer it's not a dabble product by any means there is contaminant and particulate in it so I'm thinking that I will do a puff of the volcano vaporizer and then I have this bong that I got in grade 11 that I cleaned up and I thought I'd have a puff out of that too for you since uh since we're playing that game so let's just have a load up on our volcano here I have a new camera facing down so that I can show you all of the unboxings a little bit closer as opposed to holding it up so that is what I'm doing down there Sears our volcano bowl and I'm going to put a good load of the Keef in there we go spread it out so it's nice and flat I'm not in these balls so that we don't get any of that nonsense there we go maybe a little more for just for good luck we are doing a a review so there we go and I didn't wait this one either mainly because I just don't know how we're going to weigh it it was a pretty full jar of light Akif so I'm hoping that they didn't rip me off but what have we found with our legal cannabis reviews in the past that well 70% of them have been short so you know I could see that happening with my Keef but I'm writing tickets about so let's load this up air and while that happens there I'm gonna load my bowl up still have a messy but that's okay well two things at once two things at once there we go all right smells good in the air smells very cannabis e very woodsy I didn't get much but what I did get really tastes like how it smells musky lemony very much like Cologne that would have been worn in the 1990s I'm gonna let it sit on there for a sec just a little that Keefe warm up and I'm going to go back to back in this bowl of Keefe up because we're gonna take one one big friggin rip a dip of this I believe here we go that's that and now my ball should be warmed up [Music] do you like Keith I always love it as a supercharger it's really nice when you open up the bottom of your grinder and you find those dunes again I'm happy that these products are on market and for $27 I can say I'm oh you know I'm not upset right now with my purchase this time I let the hash warm up in the bowl sitting on top of the heating unit and it is quite tasty it all tastes the same every time I do musky sandalwood II delicious so it's yeah pretty good well let's have our bong rip and then give you our final notes and my final goodbye I've got this big-ass bowl of hash Keef pack BC Keith from kin of farms let's roll back little it's definitely fair to say I've had a bong rip in a long time okay it was good it definitely didn't suck so here we go let's do the rundown on appearance it's definitely not the best key hash anything that I have ever seen by any means but it looks nice it looks like blond hash from high school so there's that as far as appearance goes I'm going to give it a the jar they put it in is really nice and they'll end up and the childproof lid was slick so let's give it and this is for what is being Keefe I'm gonna give it 17 points 17 points for the appearance on the nose it wasn't jumping out but it definitely still smells like what it tasted like the nose knows that my nose said you should definitely smoke this for the nose I'd like to give it 32 points it could be bigger it could be better but it's definitely not lacking or upsetting me it's not jumping out but it does have these nice woodsy musky somewhat citrusy aroma for the taste I thought the taste match the palate really well again it wasn't huge it wasn't explosive in my mouth it wasn't like oh my god this is the best hash Keef whatever I've ever tried didn't taste bad in the bong definitely tasted better in the vaporizer so for taste let's give it a solid you know this is falling with the nose too right if the nose was bigger than the taste would have been bigger I'm gonna want to call it 15 points for the taste not bad not amazing that's 75% and then my overall impression based on my experience with cannabis based on my experience with the legal market all of these things coming into play you know what I don't mind this product it's definitely an addition to a joint or something that you'd like to buy to add into your basket to really ramp everything up so as far as that goes I'm gonna give it 17 points and there you go that's the score on our can of farms BC Keef pretty good for especially for $27 so well let's add up the points right here duh how many points is that 27 bucks a gram Keith definitely not the worst thing to purchase in the recreational market as these things become available this is the very first extract I've seen that's why I purchased it I guess I guess I'm pleasantly surprised it's probably it's it's in the 80s for sure it might be high 70s but it's in the 80s so it's it's it's not bad I'm not completely upset there you go thank you so much for watching if you tried any extracts let me know down in the comments I'm really looking forward to having more extracts come on to market but it's exciting to see this happening please make sure to LIKE comment share and subscribe and I'll see you soon Cheers what's my name what's my name the cannabis Somali yang", "_MT8-bY7TrE": "body to hash church 3.0 episode 17. we're still going we just can't be stopped it's uh these people just have nothing else to do they just need hash church we all need that church and so here we are on a sunday morning bright and early no we're not on clubhouse right now we are on hash church so welcome to everyone welcome to johnny b and etienne and hemp guy and everyone else that's going to show up here in the near future how how the hell are you guys going good rock and roll i'm loading up a bowl and doing the first thing we need to do this is my first rip of the day oh super bowl is it super bowl sunday johnny in this bowl it is i got some first bounce cleaned up nicely and hitting it on the old school so it's kind of like old man lightning with the lighter old-school style i remember doing that i need matches thanks for the the tip there it's going now you uh the matches are the best way of actually smoking it i used to use the hemp line all the time but i kept going out i kept tasting the hemp wick and i was like you gotta be careful with the hemp line when you use the lighter you gotta use it and then you pull it away and you can keep it lit or you taste that butane and it really really is kind of like i know um and i'm using weeble today see ramo there's the ames institute that's going to be dr allison in the house balancing out all this male with some energy female energy good morning this temple flow rosin bubble is a killer good morning allison how are you doing i am recovering from a long day of psychedelics i could hear it in your voice you had a really good day yesterday didn't you no no i'm at a ladies retreat what are you talking about johnny b oh no it wasn't that good what no spiritual enlightenment was found what everybody stayed grounded what no no so we started the day with i i'm i led um a uh a ketamine assisted a spiritual journey for everybody but myself so i was the sitter and then i don't even think we ate breakfast and went straight into mdma and lsd and enjoyed the snow um and that i i think i think carried on until really way into the night um i think we ate a meal yesterday maybe like ac braddock may she did we did eat ac braddock made this amazing african uh peanut soup with prawns in it um we did eat so that was our meal for the day but it was a it was an interesting day you know you get a group of ladies it had peanuts in it yes interesting have you ever heard of uh staying away from peanuts before an ayahuasca trip i have not well i've heard of going vegan uh before an ayahuasca trip but not peanuts yeah my friend sean my friend sean got pretty into it and he was really focused on the diet and he started cul you know creating a list of foods that should absolutely be avoided that through his own bio essay and man he said that the the eating of peanuts was probably one of the biggest mistakes he ever did before before an ayahuasca trip and i guess it just you know for whatever reason those particular peanuts interacted in a bad way and just caused him just an excessive amount of purging probably the worst thing to eat before ayahuasca is the musical fruit ah the musical fruit yeah oh yeah that makes sense well isn't ayahuasca kind of like ketamine in the sense that you usually get nauseous i know when i was given ketamine i was moving so fast in my brain that i got nauseous um ketamine academy there's a difference and and i think everyone yesterday who took all the other drugs as well was like ketamine is very different than any drug including ayahuasca ayahuasca can tend to cause um an evacuation either the front the back and so having a diet that has like no dairy and no and no meats can help minimize that evacuation process if it will but if you're still holding on to a lot of emotional and psychic material you're going to purge or get nauseous either way and i find that with ketamine especially with my chronic pain patients who've been holding on to um pain and emotional trauma on a cellular level they tend to get nauseous and throw up as well a lot there's a lot of purging but yesterday thankfully nobody got nauseous nobody threw up and it was a really positive um beginning to the start of the women's retreat that's awesome that's what we like to hear that's amazing and i'm just so glad you could pop in for a few minutes yeah yeah well i'd hope that like some of these other ladies would um but like i said um i left them at like two in the morning um because i tapped out well doing that many different drugs i think they might be sleeping right now considering you start off with the ketamine and mdma then yeah that's a that's a robust day of psychonauting it really and it was snowing so like there was also like some snow trail walking and some hot tubbing and some art making and um it was we've here we set pure intentions for the weekend you know we started out where we talked about like what we wanted to achieve and we're achieving it good morning mark do you can say do you consider uh ketamine a true psychedelic or is it just a very strong depersonalization drug well that's a really good question sam um for in the intent purposes of our clinic you know um i would say that uh it causes an ego death and that there in law is the a property of psychedelics that we can use therapeutically um i i um yeah so i think that it depends on who you talk to like a veterinarian probably wouldn't say that oh yeah academy and psychedelic but at the ames institute we consider it psychedelic yeah i remember going to a psychedelic conference in whistler that had everyone it was the it was the whole gamut and i think it might have been in like the early 2000s or the very late 90s and i met a guy there who is a very small community in the 90s in the early 2000s the psychedelic community was just this fraction of the cannabis community that would kind of travel around and you could meet these key people and very easy to meet almost the entire community at a single one or two events and i met a guy a real tripper and he he told me like by far his favorite psychedelic experience with inter-muscular injections of ketamine and he was literally like i leave my body i fly through the universe i can go and and and visit planets i can i can go around stars and i was just like i was like holy [ __ ] dude like i thought i was hardcore with five grams of mushrooms this motherfucker's inter-muscular injecting ketamine ketamine really gives levels a separation of like especially i mean some of the ladies yesterday did have out of body experiences um some of them you know who are more psychonauts tend to will probably want to move forward with an intramuscular just to experience that real true out of body experience um i can't say that any of i've done a lot of psychedelics and ketamine is just very different and yet and yet i would consider it psychedelic any uh any assistance she would suggest for the come out the one thing i didn't like i only did it once and it was intermuscular uh dr lily's assistant gave it to me uh i hated the come out it took so long because i guess it's the dosage we're given one tenth of what they give a child for uh surgery i guess was what was administered is there any suggestion for the come out of that because it took so long it just was very uncomfortable um yeah um did you take any zofran or any type of anti-nausea with it no no no no no we all got nauseous during it and as about oh yeah no no no you i always keep um so i always keep some zofran on me um uh just a dissolvable you know tablet of it um in our office we give dissolvable tablets and we also do inject especially if someone's on their journey and they and they're starting to get really nauseous we'll give them an injection and it helps dramatically i i found that what ketamine reminded me the most of was a pcp really in what way depersonalization it's a lot like the chemical structures pcp that's for sure i didn't even know that mark so i find that quite interesting also reminds me a little bit of musk muskanol and uh maybe a little bit of uh uh uh there was another one i was thinking of but i forgot it now i've i've taken way way too much of all of these things i've uh i've had the similar experiences the first time i ever took ketamine was um was with my cousin who was like a club promoter at the tunnel in new york and it was just the right i gotta remember the tunnel yeah yeah and limelight and all that stuff so yeah yeah so i had the wrong dose but then when i actually got the right dose it was much um i understood it everyone was like you gotta try it you know it's exactly like this that and the other and well i suppose it can be at times but it's very much you know on its own at times i think in terms of a chemical but i agree you know my my first time taking it i concur with uh with sam it was it was pretty heavy you know it was like it was just too heavy but the the in the next few times was was much more manageable because of the you know it was just a lower dose it was more accurate it was it wasn't here try this you know like it wasn't because it was too strong that was not uh i mean i've taken stp for god's sakes and uh but but the the it's just a really different high than what i consider psychedelics you know like i agree lsd dmt uh you know uh all of these type of drugs mescaline psilocybin they're they're absolutely true psychedelics without anybody's doubt whereas uh i i have my doubts about uh ketamine i do you think that people are actually experiencing what they think they're experiencing or do you think it's all just an illusion as a result of their ego death do you have an opinion i do have an opinion i think that they really are experiencing what they're experiencing in their mind and i think that it takes them into the other reality the other realm wherever that might be and there's enough people and studies that show that um with that ego death that um they're they're inside their unconscious mind and but i hear what you're saying sam i i hear what you're saying um if we were able in our office to use true psychedelic you know plant medicine um we would be using it and we're trying but we have to start somewhere and because ketamine does have psychedelic properties and it does show the healing properties of for people with trauma and mental illness who are seeking relief we have to start somewhere so that's that's kind of our gateway into to psychedelic assisted therapy i always called ketamine the cadillac of pcps well you know it's interesting i hear what you guys were saying like i remember in my 20s taking it at a club in miami and people were like don't don't take too much because you don't want to end up in a k hole and i remember it was really heavy like i felt like you know like i was my legs were disconnected from the floor and um but now you know as i'm older and i take it for like a therapeutic purpose uh i'm actually wanting to be in that k hole and i i want to go and delve into to my mind angel angel dust right fence cyclidine was always like sprinkled on bowls or there was always the rumor about you know weed that was laced with encyclodeen and you like to get wet the late 80s yeah i i just always i just always fretted that if you look at if you look at the compound itself or just the structure of the compound that it's not going to be it's not going to be um it's not going to be thermally stable and it's going to degrade right versus vaporizing so the cannabinoids when you heat them up they vaporize but these things contain nitrogens and when you heat up compounds that contain nitrogens they often degrade that's why all all the psychedelics normally like the phenethylamines are are are just water soluble and they're they're you know ingested and you don't necessarily need to smoke stuff and i just remember people like getting all spaced out because they were sprinkling white powder on their bowls and i'm like oh no don't do that you know just didn't seem right right yeah but you don't have to do it that way you can turn pcp into a base and use a ethanol to soak it into any herb yeah like like the sophisticated deadheads you used to drop so i remember uh ketamine on grateful dead tour in the early 90s and i remember specifically people who enjoyed taking it during in the second set of the dead show there was always something called drums in space and it got really spacey like they went into their percussion solos and there were just lights it was just really it was like the most psychedelically intense part of the show and that's when people busted out the k and usually it was a um like an afrin spray bottle like a a nasal spray and they take it and you see people like like they'd be like this and then they'd be like that and then you know what they were doing and then like mark can you actually smoke or vaporize ketamine i i don't know the answer to that yeah i i don't know sam you know i just when i look at the the chem so the chemical structure of those are related so phencyclidine and ketamine are are not phenethylamines but they're um so they're not like l-dopa and they're not like amphetamines they're they're actually uh benzoyl amines and they're they're different in that they have just a different set of chemistry they hit i think allison don't they hit the ndma receptor and methyl the aspartic acid receptor which has peripheral impact on the whole central nervous system which is why they use these things as as animal tranquilizers i just wanted to say that i was young and stupid and i'm not recommending anybody smoke angel dust pcb uh i don't believe there's any redeeming factor in it whatsoever well i think it's just too much of a disassociative it's uh it's yeah so i i saw this news blurb where that guy marcus rogan up in bc his little r d is going to start looking at um uh vape smart like he he's he's got like some kind of gc set up that they're gonna actually pull air through vapes to actually quantitate different types of impurities and whatnot you think they'd want to try to try that like put little bit of pcp like on some herb burn it or something and see like really what comes off because i always thought just looking at the structure i'm like man those things are going to degrade as soon as they heat up so all those people who are smoking pcp laced weed again i think it has a lot to do with the same thing that people who smoke that synthetic spice if you look at that compound that compound unlike cannabinoids is got a nitrogen in it and when those nitrogen compounds heat up they thermally eliminate through something called a cope i'm sorry let's see what is the name of that degradation it's called a hofmann degradation hofmann degradations happen with nitrogen containing compounds when you heat them up can't keep it from happening you heat up nitrogen compounds in the presence of air they degrade to these really toxic compounds called nitroso and nitrosamine compounds some of the most toxic [ __ ] we know in mankind so i mean like that that's what those people were all freaked out seeing jesus on back in the day when they were sprinkling that [ __ ] on their bulls it's funny because again i think they thought that this wow that's really potent it's like dude you're probably smoking all kinds of degradation toxic degradation products and not even knowing what you're getting you know i i don't think you can smoke it to answer your question no clinical trials were ever done on any of the huffman compounds he invented i don't know maybe a hundred of them and uh yeah that that's right but you bring up a good point sam so like i think most of these because they're water soluble um you can make just a uh like a uh spray an inner nasal spray you know just take a couple hits and you're good you know man mark when you start with these like science you know experiments so early in the morning i'm like wow hey it's six hours to be thinking about [ __ ] man go ahead collin um you know since we're talking about compounds and uh as a young buck when i was really into artist huxley and and reading more about what they were up to and his whole crew i read about amt right and i i took it and i read when i read about it he described it as the rolls-royce of lsd and i wanted to just ask the question you know allison what what's your take on that and sam and everyone in the room as a chemical what what's going on there um and and can anyone shed any light on that if it really is the rolls royce i didn't hear i didn't hear what compound you were talking about sorry amt amt not dmt no amt i'm not familiar with amt i'm not familiar with it and i thought i had taken everything well maybe i'm the only one um it's extremely long you got the you got the initials wrong or something what does it stand for amt hold on let's uh let's let's take it look it up um google yeah we're gonna do something um it was described by aldous huxley as the rolls-royce of lsd and at a time in my life i was very much learning about myself okay so in what you're saying is instead of dimethyltryptamine dnt it's alpha methyltryptamine right i've never heard of it i've had some of the other tryptamines in other words like d-e-t yeah i've never seen a a neither have i but now i want to try it it was very very intense and long and i i've taken it a few more than a few times and i just you know i've had a couple times with a close friend of mine in it you know we we'd make music on this stuff and and i just remember him looking at me being like is this forever you know at one point because it was so long abnormally long when you smoke it does it smell and taste better than dmt which smells like burning plastic or burning metal so what the way that we did it you know this was not control it was not controlled at the time when we were getting this stuff so we would make it we would you know really study the dosage and we would get it and make pills out of it and take it that way and the onset was a much cleaner version of coming on a cleaner onset than i'd ever seen from any other substance like this and it was a very clear almost unbelievably psychedelic experience but you're very cognitive and and you're writing that line of like surrealism and you say it lasted a long time because dmt or if you smoke it it doesn't last 15 minutes i mean it's really fast right this is like huge peaks and valleys and and very expansive um yeah i started to understand what autist huxley was talking about when me immediately in the middle of it i was like wow this guy's really knows what's up well at the time you know it was it was really incredible but um i haven't heard much about it since i don't really hear people talk about it i went through a phase of my life where i was really into these compounds and started there was a time when you could disorder this stuff i mean there was a time when you could order amt i mean dmt and and fi myo and all these other other compounds and um it was a very interesting point in my life but i think it's it was just curious you know i was just very curious you know i don't really hear much about it but it was um it truly was like you know sitting in that rolls royce if you will i started to understand it so if dmt is the working man psychedelic what would you call this one call it the serious overtime it's just like two well it's like my buddy dan said it was like this seems abnormally long um you know so uh that's that's all i remember it was so long ago guys was like 20 almost you know 15. were you able to actually access time to know if it was an hour two hours five hours that's the thing you would be so out of time out of sync with time and then you'd be you know you come in and out of these peaks and valleys if you will um whatever analogy we're gonna use and and you would just be like wow it's like what time is it like um so that's that's what i do remember of it but it's been quite some time since i've revisited this part of my journey um but yeah that's i just you know i read about it huxley was a someone i was reading a lot about at the time and um him and his whole crew just talked about it like hey this is the rolls-royce of lsd and i i just that all that that that analogy always stuck with me and you know so that's why i asked thanks for sharing i'd never heard about that yeah cool sweet that's pretty cool yeah it's in it's in t kyle and he he's got a a prep for it so those uh chemists who want to be out there and be cowboys you could actually make it if you want from tryptamine so it has that alpha methyl group which is similar to to ndma right which has got an alpha methyl group too as well so well it reminded me of ant i mean it reminded me of of mdma when we when you're the onset is very much like that but there's all it's like it reminds me of it was like this hybrid of all these things and i started to understand why they were talking about it in that light because you're like wow the onset is amazing wow this is amazing like it just like all the blocks fit it wasn't like um you know like when you eat mushrooms your body's like what are you doing to yourself you know there's this this moment of this push and pull um and that you just i never experienced that with with this so well i always like dmt because when you take a big inhalation of it before you let it out you're already on the top of the rocket going a million miles an hour well well that's my question for the for the chemical question for the day i i did try ketamine because when i was told it was a horse tranquilizer and it might help with with pain and then when allison was talking about how it felt disconnected i felt like i was on the floor and i couldn't move and i was moving at like a turtle speed minus like i couldn't even do anything so i thought like how can i function using this in life so hence hash is the go-to for me but uh well but i would tell you use smaller amounts johnny b yeah i'm just curious because everybody's been talking even about what with psychedelics we utilize we do utilize ketamine for chronic pain in our clinic um and we use what's called like trochees or lozenges and i usually work with them i mean of course it's dr agarwal who's the one that prescribes it and tells them what to take um but i work with them on a weekly basis to make sure that like you're on the right track and we usually start with a quarter of a churchy so that would be like maybe 25 milligrams i'm curious now because between i've always taken lots of mushrooms and then like a reset but i've never done micros and i've always done excessive amounts of different drugs to try and see if it would help me but i've never done small amounts where i can't feel it so now i'm kind of reassessing things by listening to people on clubhouse and talking here i'm kind of in this whole new okay i take 250 milligram caps like three times a day and and my my my my points are getting that i'm taking too much so i'm trying to like i take in like resets on days where i don't like do dabs or smoke weed for the whole day now i'll be doing this every month and stuff like that trying to find things that are going to work more so i'm kind of curious about this next step of being able to deal with with chronic pain so um this is great um i'm gonna say can you hear me i'm gonna say that if you're using plant medicine and plant medicine you're able to get it to work for you i would use plant medicine until you max out on plant medicine yes then like let's talk about adding ketamine if um plant medicine no longer works for you but you have options now even with um psilocybin you can also help with pain yeah i was actually how's it going i was going to welcome josh into the room i saw him just kind of sneak in there how's it going buddy very good happy valentine's day to everyone and my lovely valentine will probably be down here in a little bit and um wonderful conversation this morning so good morning happy valentine's day everybody i will be taking my wife for a romantic walk in the forest later tonight up and through the trees and the snow that's my valentine's day plan i'm not buying cards and flowers and candies and chocolate teddy bears and all that sort of you know pardon my french [ __ ] but i am going to spend time with her and appreciate her and appreciate our vibes and do it in nature my wife and i are going to out to a fancy restaurant at the drive through it in and out tonight so you know in in service dining that i can accompany me during this kobe's yeah buddy awesome that is awesome you know my partner he gave me um the freedom to be with my ladies for this weekend as my valentine's day and he's out with his men friends all camping and yeah we just try to express love every day rather than one day of the year you know one day we're going to have to have our wives do an episode of hash church and not any of us and just have our wives on here yeah i think that would be absolutely spectacular just telling stories talking [ __ ] about us kelly could moderate it because she's always here and the women that are on house church do they bring their husbands i mean why not it'd be pretty uh i think it would just be a fun fun thing one day like i know i mean has anyone ever seen my wife at chan's wife dr mark's wife like collins why like you know no sam i bet you uh i bet your lady would like to come on church and bust out a few old sam stories she'd be talking about herbalism the whole time and how i'd you know pack too many balls you've been with your wife since high school having you like when you guys like first dated and you guys have been together ever since you guys have quite a love story actually you should tell me dude i i think sam is in the same boat i mean uh i've seen his pictures of him and his wife they they were they were kids 53 years that's awesome congratulations for for her being able to put up with you that long seriously one or three years it will be 53 years it's 52 right now that's beautiful how about wayne monica she's the skunk well here's the you you guys and adam 31 here yeah i'm wow 1989 i guess i'm 32. yeah wow that's awesome you guys have had long-term relationships i don't know long-term guys if you can if you can't tell allison most of the guys on this panel are extremely committed regardless of what they are committed to they're just committed we should all be committed in fact whether it's hash or or marriages or relationships i love it or strangers my wife nine years before we tied the old knotter and uh we've been together for a really long time like almost two decades you have to know when you're content right isn't that like one of the secrets of life like really separating happiness from being content like everything in life is just a matter of choices and so yeah and balance you have the choice of being lately you have the choice of being right or being happy choose appropriately right you have to make compromises and you if you're smart you have some idea of what life is going to be with that person in 5 or 10 years i mean at least otherwise yeah in america marriage is just another throwaway consumer item unfortunately more than half the people marry get divorced did you know people who got married were one required one of the partners consumed and the other one did not and and those marriages never lasted right right i mean so really you want to make a bet well well so with that that i'm i'm asking that i guess i'm just about to say that my wife does not puff if she wants to puff she would puff cbd to go to sleep she does not smoke that's like my wife just at this age she's not into delta nine or del you know thca my ex let me rephrase that so like the marriages where one was pro and the other was not again or or totally against so those marriages never lie i know several marriages were weed consumption was basically the reason why the marriage ended uh my my original marriage uh which i got married at the cannabis cup in amsterdam uh dude we were both we were both proponents of cannabis but after we were married a few years she stopped and we grew apart and uh yeah it was uh it was a problem for us and uh it it didn't get any better until we finally divorced and all would be number one and that i don't think we should be talking about cannabis we should talk about how alcohol ruins relationships but uh i think cannabis saves relationships in my opinion i agree i agree but you know what i don't think i could be with anyone who didn't use cannabis i've tried and it just doesn't work it doesn't work well you know what's neat about that is that people use cannabis differently now so you can use cannabis by eating essential amino acid rich seed oil you can wear hemp clothing you can take cbd you don't have to be getting high to be using cannabis so there's uh you know like my wife does all three of those things that i just mentioned but she has no interest in smoking cannabis to uh alter her consciousness with thc she's not she's a little sensitive to the thc but she enjoys all of the other things so i guess in that sense that's great still enjoy someone that supports you marcus um but when um you know like i call them like a square when like you need a square and they find out you you use between two and five grams a day to them that is like whoa whoa you've got a problem oh you smoked too much or you know and that doesn't work absolutely you know i was talking about this recently with my wife in regards to how you know we celebrate our celebrations and our successes but we don't really celebrate the hard road and the things that define us to becoming who we are you know because my successes do not define me it's my failures it's my difficult road that i took it's all the bad pictures i took that create the good ones that i take and so that is a mentality i wish human beings had a little bit more like you know like we love to promote the podium and the pedestal but we don't really promote a whole difficult hard gnarly road that it takes to get there and i think sometimes you know manifesting you know that experience where you're like a user and the other person is not a user is all part of that defining you know who you are i think it's interesting that a lot of us have been in long-term relationships and and even like our son skye and then sierra they've been together for almost 10 years now and they're 24 years old and uh you know i just think it it it is a good quality that we have how long have wade um how long have you been together with monica we're coming on uh 20 years now um yeah i had a previous marriage with the mother of my children um and she and i have managed to maintain being good friends but we came to understand we just couldn't live with each other and that was the mother of my children um and yeah since you called me out i wanted to jump in here and say all this conversation about psychedelics and all of the alphabet soup of various compounds that enhan induced this psychedelic experience um i i personally uh not that it really matters but i personally only have experienced with lsd and uh mushrooms and cactus and uh yeah they were all quite different but the central point that we keep making reference to has to do with ego death and uh i would just look at each of us in turn who have experienced uh these psychedelics and i don't think any of us have a shortage of ego our egos are still present it's just that we've come to realize that all of this three-dimensional reality that we live in is just a construct uh and i i really haven't imbibed in uh psychedelics in oh probably as long as i've known monica uh we actually uh recently sourced some uh high quality lsd that we're considering uh sharing that experience together but for years i i have tried to remember what the psychedelic experience taught me and build that experience in my head through i suppose you could call it meditation or just really what i do is spend a lot of time looking at nature and things that are happening in the garden and around us on the farm and trying to see where i fit into that and where humans fit into it and how we can work together with what we have to make this world a little sweeter place and so i i really want to encourage and and recommend to people who have not tried the psychedelic experience to do that to because it is it's a it's a it's a dramatically quick way to understand the illusion that makes our world seem so real um and uh and to recognize the true essence of who you are as a human being and what the opportunity for that life is um it just seems important to recognize that all of these all of these drugs including psychedelics really only help us glimpse the truth they don't help us live it and and you have to do that work of living what's real for yourself uh drugs can help us see that and that's true about cannabis as well i mean you know i'm i'm a missionary about cannabis and it's potential benefits for humans but what's true is it's it's an aid just like in healing one of my one of my favorite analogies about healing is that just like healing can happen in a hospital or as a result of taking some prescription drug what's really true about healing is it comes from within ourselves our bodies heal themselves and in that same way spirit spirit can happen in a church or a temple or a mosque but it really comes from within us it's our experience of spirit that is real it's not the church itself so uh sorry to heavy up on you on a sunday morning but there's amen no amen wade i love you you can talk all day long from church it's beautiful thank you i appreciate that we consider it an essential thing on our property did you want to say something else just that i feel such a deep respect for this group of people and the platform that marcus has created and the way that each of us is willing to be who you are and feel welcomed while doing so thank you thank you totally well put someone in the chat just said wade's voice just lifts away all anxiety i would suspect that allison if you're using ketamine currently to walk people through their journeys you might want to look into using wade's voice for some of the integration because man that is it's all just rings true and it's all love and kind someone said it the other day wade comes out and opens his mouth and just showers everyone with love and gold nuggets and i just i just you know what that's really funny as i'm sitting here i'm waiting for my coffee or whatever i shared with one of the ladies that like you know about about wade and how beautiful his words come out and and how it's easy to be drawn because it's it's just um everything is with love and positivity he has he'll import for his spot soothing sorry go ahead he has a warmth about him when he speaks but it also it comes from a well of knowledge it isn't just spouting anything if you can hear the wealth the wealth of knowledge and the depth of the person within it is uh yeah i would recommend having him narrate anything you need to do to tell you the truth i patented all of that knowledge so i actually own it and if anybody wants to use wade's knowledge they have to pay me royalties thank you sam that's the only way do you take royalties in hash i'll take good karma all right let's see i just had someone ask that i would go on my podcast mike so hopefully that sounds a little better i've turned off the air pods and i've turned on the raspberry mic you don't sound like you're in a tin can excellent well i should have known that earlier thanks for mentioning that uh bdnf guy i'm on my good mic now looks like dutch blue market is what are you smoking on right now man hey guys how are you guys doing dude you're rolling it up yeah man i'm uh loving the conversation you guys are getting more into the psychedelics like every every week it's it's awesome man i have a little i i take uh i take uh micro dosing almost three four five times a week of psilocybin and i've had a few journeys but uh i don't go too much past that acid a few times but the micro dose with the psilocybin really is something that's proven really beneficial to me to um you know like usually i use it when i'm really tired and and i don't have as much patience within myself to be kind um and i take the psilocybin and it just gives me that empathy and that understanding of kind of where i am in the scene and so it seems to be that empathy does not lie in the ego yeah josh hey etienne i have a message for you ac says to tell you hi i love him she said to tell you she loves you much love and great respect much love and great respects he said i don't get any hellos from ac oh and now marcus is upset ac because she died she said she loves you too [Music] from the dragonfly uh dragonfly josh from dragon fire guess what um i'm gonna i mean you guys are in my in my ear so she can't actually hear you she hears me talking to you but she can't actually hear you so hold on i'm going to take my earbud out and let her oh there you go um good morning good morning good morning good morning everybody good morning great ac good to hear from you how was your uh how was your psychedelic trips yesterday oh it was fantastic it was fantastic and you know then there's tonight now rinse lather repeat huh yeah well i had never done a ketamine session like that before and it was really different and it was very very interesting and we had one gal who never quite made the connection between psychedelics and uh medicine and healing and she made that connection yesterday so that was awesome if thanks that's a beautiful thing and that's that's all part of the connection that we need in this time in this difficult time that often wants to connect us from the sacred and disconnect us from our self-empowered place and i think that's right breaks that chain right just like the mycelium just like the roots just like fungi as a whole breaks rules there's no rules in fungi and also psychedelics follow that line so i think it's part of that just breaking the programming we're in like an everyday programming of news and food and medicine and all this stuff and i think it takes the power of something like psychedelics and all the different forms to truly break that chain and and show us what's important which a lot of times resides in the heart and yeah absolutely my intention going in was something a little different but where it took me was all about connection everything you're just saying we have lost our connection to so many things and each other and this is a good way to get it back if only everyone would do it it's we need that bands it's it's funny like bands like the grateful dead and fish and some other bands have kind of figured this out that you know there's a there's different ways to get connections and plant medicines are definitely on the list you know the experiences i had particularly at fish shows certainly weren't alcohol influence they seemed to be psychedelic influence like lots of people just not only looking to connect through the the set and setting which is the show but also that parking lot vibe and just you know like people just looking for that so desperately i mean people followed that band around for 30 plus years for for a reason you know like not just because because there was a hole there was something missing and when you go on tour i felt it myself i felt like that hole got filled i was like oh my god these are my people like there's so many like-minded people i can have so many amazing conversations and experiences and i can do it while fish is melting my brain with a beautiful split open and melt jam and there's all the kindness that surrounds it the kindness the the creativity and uh just openness to to actually meet other people and make those kinds of connections and for us who didn't have access to the drugs or the scenes i mean we heard about the scene and that's what drove me to shake down street was dude they've got every drug available there's people walk around with mushrooms and i'll be damned if some guy isn't walking around with a 25 gram amanita going mushrooms mushrooms with armpit hairs in them oh yeah guatemalan shorts and your tie-dye t-shirts and your your jewelry and yeah just any anything that you need to look like a hippie it was great i started at the age of 14 seeing those guys and it was just yeah i was like whoa you know and living in northern new jersey it was easy growing up in the late 70s early 80s to go see the grateful dead by just traveling like a two-hour circle and around new york city you could literally see hundreds of shows and not have to travel too far but there was like a spirit of adventure because you didn't always have tickets right and you're like driving and it was before cell phones so you're unable to hook up with people until you got there and unlike today it wasn't broadcasted to the world so to be there to witness the magic you had to be in the building you needed a piece of a little ticket that got you into the building and if you're lucky like with dad and mark will remember with fish you're actually got a tape of the show like the next day and you're listening to the show that you just saw that just blew your mind and now you have it on tape for the rest of your life it was it was just such an incredible adventure to to live and and uh fish had this incredible uh crescendo after garcia died in 95 i think they were certainly the heirs apparent for like the next traveling circus the next large traveling circus they already had an incredible body of music and they were being incredibly creative at the time and just like the dead they weren't the commercial success but they let people tour and they let people tape and that whole shakedown street like when the fish show rolled into town it was just like the dead they needed to give them their own parking lot there were campers there were teepees there were just all kinds of just this traveling circus that would travel around and that was part of the culture of the music and you hit it on the head marcus it was really unique because if you went to like i don't know like an almond brother show or neil young there is never a traveling circus associated with any other band i mean i guess on the jam band maybe at a much lower level some of the bands had it but you know fish had this sort of crescendo all the way up to the millennium and when they played their show at big cypress in the everglades it was the largest gathering on the planet for the millennium the largest gathering was the fish show that i was at along with my lovely wife a bunch of my friends and it was just it was incredible because they played from midnight all throughout the night seven and a half hours yeah and how many people i think um was like 85 000 people marcus i i can't remember it was a big one i i wasn't at seminole but i had bubble bags there and i had friends there and marcel brought the fish 2000 bubbler there which was like at the time a ten thousand dollar pipe that he like literally said he lit and he passed and then he didn't see it for hours and he would just catch glimpses of it moving around the place and then at the end of the day at night it kind of came back to him but that cross-eyed and painless that they did oh my god man that cross-eyed and painless from seminal indian reservation big cypress was uh pretty much my favorite version of that song the sun the sun coming up that day marcus was just incredible it was like velvet sea was right at sunrise and you know you're just there and you you're spent but you're you're in this new you know millennium and remember everyone thought like computers were going to take over the world or computers were going to crash or something but um there's actually a famous youtube clip up on youtube that shows peter jennings who was uh i guess hosting abc's uh rock in the millennium new year's and they actually cut to fish and they do heavy things and um yeah it just it was really it's surreal to be there but the reason why i was mentioning that is it seemed like that was kind of like a crescendo that was hit and then after that it was just like ah like what do we do like what can we do that would possibly top that like thank you like davis after he wrote sketches of spain you know like musically it was like the pinnacle for him like he just where are you going next he was like where do i go from here you know what i mean but then he came back and ripped [ __ ] brew at 42 years old and changed again chang's music changed the world in which we perceive you know imagine being the grateful dead and and and employing a hundred thousand person event in 1973 at watkins glen in new jersey like after 1973 you'd think oh [ __ ] how are we going to go bigger than that next thing you know you make the wallace sound which is 89 000 watt uh you know system with every single string on its own channel and owlsley just coming out of jail to create the largest sound system that's ever been known to mankind so i'm pretty sure humans are uh you know capable of creating the new best thing and uh you know i'm just thankful for that creativity i would also add to the psychedelic lore that barter fares were really important back in the day i think to that year 1974 which i call buttery buttery soft grateful dead is like 74 to 76 it was so good it was they sounded so great they were so on their game really you think we could create that again now i mean even when you listen to all of the music back then steely dan all the motown all the r b stuff that was happening in the 70s dude the 70s we'll never be able to i don't think music will ever be like that again ever again it'll be different george clinton in the 70s it seemed to just get distorted to the point where now somebody you know doesn't do a studio release or a record they do some recording on tick tock and next thing you know they're the next you know international sensation i mean i think what we witnessed in like the 70s and the 80s i mean that groovy music when you go back and listen to that i mean all that great good steely dan and all that great stuff even like through the 80s with like bands like los lobos i mean we'll never see that level of creativity and really goodness and music again that's what they said about sabbath and zeppelin and the beatles and the stones and all these incredible bands but the bottom line is is we will it's a guarantee if you want to be like musically blown away like truly like not not so much the music but lyrics like i've been tripping on this guy harry mack lately i can't even say enough about him this guy does live freestyles he writes entire songs from the top of his head in an instant with three words that given to get get given to him and he's doing it on youtube he's doing it on omegle it's very very different from what you're talking about but it goes to show that there are things that have never existed that are just starting to exist and if that can exist then something else can exist you know in the future and i i'm i have faith that human beings are only going to get tastier and better and i mean when i saw this young rock band that came out i'm probably going to forget their name but they sounded so much like zeppelin and rush have you heard these these young kids there's like three of them and then also like uh kevin parker from uh tame impala that kid's a killer songwriter i mean you know it's newer but i mean he's got a lot of creativity with his guitar pedals and he's a baller i mean he he knows what he's doing and you know i agree i think music in different ways is going to reshape the future and look that you know we were talking about the wall of sound i mean think about it i don't know if many people realize this like the reason we have noise cancelling microphones is literally because of the wall of sound like we like in terms of live music the wall of sound was the beginning of where we're at like that was live they the they were the first band to really think about the live experience in terms of why don't what do i experience in the studio is not being experienced to the crowd and how do we translate that and the wall sound really took those ideologies and they they use their brains and their their passion to get get us where we're at today with festivals i mean before we had any of this stuff we had just terrible sound and i don't i don't you know we don't realize that but pollen that was due to ously i know but it but again but it was working with the band you know what i mean like and then working with um macintosh in upstate new york to to actually design the drivers to to amplify everything correctly i mean it's incredible the entire creation of selling the whole entire population lsd on top of it all really helps seriously fine the steal your face logo as well as the buckles because the first thing he tried to do is sell me a buckle when i met him he's like hey you want a buckle of course but you know there's still musical geniuses out there i mean go check out this piano player uh hiromi i mean she is absolutely amazing as you know there's prodigies and those amazing you know jazz players that are still rising with each generation so you know it's also about staying plugged in and looking and listening because i think what is it the average person stops listening to new music at the age of so you know you have to always be you know reaching out i know it sounds weird but that's a if you go look at psychology a lot of people cut off their music around 32 33 and everything below that for their generations they listen to so it's just you know it's also about plugging in and checking in because there's still amazing musicianship out there that will raise the level we're starting to see rock music just starting to make it back so step by step dude those kids ripped i mean and while we're on the topic of jazz we lost an absolute visionary uh this past week um chick korea um i mean you want to talk about an innovator this guy was the first person to take an electric piano with herbie hancock and really incorporate that into jazz i mean that's that's a sounds like a small feat but that's literally like dylan plugging his guitar in for the first time you know hiromi aromi did a jam with actual chick-fil-a that's awesome man yeah chick is a major inspiration to me and um we lost a legend i mean what will be like that again you know like that that's what i'm kind of like if you look at the change in popular music that happened in the three decades between the 1930s and the 1960s and then you look at like the three decades like that have unfolded since today there's hardly any change right and and i'll agree with what atn said is that there are incredibly talented musicians out there one of my current favorites right now is none other than william apostle aka billy strings billy strings is just you know doc watson reincarnated doc watson and clarence white reincarnated and if you don't know who those people are look them up again he is a true bluegrass player through and through but can shred anything and he's just an incredible talent but it's bill monroe bluegrass which you know was invented back in the you know 30s and 40s so i'm just wondering like what's next what's the next big thing that's gonna arrive well they're talking about zappa in the chat room you know there's zappa's long gone yet i seen dweezil zappa play zappa zappa plays zappa a few years ago and that [ __ ] tore my head off i sat in the front row absolutely flabbergasted at the quality of his ability to play the guitar but also the ability to pull people from frank's groups into his group and and just everything was so so on point that uh i have an appreciation for that as well frank zappa movie that's out there right now marcus which one uh the the zappa movie that's out there there's a documentary on frank zappa i'm not sure i've seen a few but is it like a new one i think it's uh netflix is it on netflix did you see it sam yes i've seen it yeah i've seen that too mark it's a really good one um i also rupert neve um passed away i mean rupert neve is responsible for pretty much every record in existence that's been recorded if they were in any major studio his you know the the neve console was a mixing board that had very specific components that allowed a very dynamic richness to be captured from through microphones and um you know that was he was a major contributor behind the curtain to a lot of our our favorite records that we all listened to yeah the first wall of sound was actually put together in studios by phil spector oh no way that's interesting i didn't realize oh phil spector who just recently died that's right in prison in prison and all his cousins oh he sort of went looney tunes at the end yeah i think you mean right before he murdered his wife his wife or how many people did he actually murder though because he only got caught for one how about a shout out to stevie ray vaughan if we're going to talk about genius musicians has touched him i got the ketchup i saw him i saw him brother jammed together on the riverboat president on the same guitar that was a one was a short neck the other was a long neck and they ripped that [ __ ] apart man the whole place was just jaw dropped everywhere he's gonna say a lot a lot of it is access and and access to to media and access to create media it's totally changed from from the era of the 70s and the 80s and even the 90s where every iphone and an ipad you get has a sound engineer system in it you know garageband we could all create [ __ ] epic music right now right there and then we can also put it out really easy with a couple clicks i could put it on itunes and it's available and and that has like spread out the interest and who's listening to what and so i think a lot more people are listening to a lot more diverse music and there's a lot of people kicking ass right now and it's really interesting and there's a lot of influences that are being melded and man i just you know that's just kind of what i was thinking when i was here and all that and like because i listened to all the great stuff too in high school i was listening to the 70s bands and [ __ ] rocking out and thinking man there's that that was the era of music you know people were really meld and sound and the guitars were ripping and and that's what we kind of modeled our music after but then it changed you know because we had influence from the stuff of our time you know and well music has changed yeah the stuff that's coming out right now i kind of think is mimicking the 80s the synth 80s stuff and i kind of love it you know but it's muddled with hip-hop and and beats that are different than we had in the 80s you know that's really cool you got people being exposed to music that weren't being exposed to music so youtube has this entire culture of reaction videos where you have people who have never heard of these bands getting suggestions through their youtube comments to go on and you know oh you got to hear texas flood by stevie ray vaughan if you've never heard and seen that you just won't believe it and i've been watching all sorts of these reaction videos because it's just like really unique people from where they could be from like the inner city of chicago or baltimore and they're just like hey what's up i'm a i'm a youtube reaction guy um stevie knight is one of the guys i watch that i really like he's a big kind of muscle dude and he's always going to watch jamal mark is kelly talking i wanted to make sure i wasn't talking yeah jamal i watched jamal jamal is amazing he's funny he's from central l.a really quick um i got to see frank zappa and chicago in 1988 and um we were out it was it was like a in the middle of summer time so it was a bears show and i had traded a bag of weed to this guy he said hey i'm you a ticket you got to go see this show it's after hours it doesn't start till midnight and uh you know the guy's name is frank zappa i was like i don't even know who that is i really didn't even know who frank zappa was in 1988 you know i didn't know who he was so i went into this little underground bar and they were handing everybody fans at the at the door so like some of them were really beautiful fans some of them were paper fans and they were handing out fans and then when we went in frank zappa came out onto the stage and he said all my fans i love all my fans look at all my beautiful fans and then he continued to rock the house down for a 50-person show i think that's unbelievable i really think that fish needs to have a permanent picture of frank zappa on their stage on every single show that they play because without frank zappa you know fish is unique but wow they always prop out frank i mean peaches on regalia that's their ode to frank and they crush i i suspect if frank ever saw them play that he would be like he'd be impressed wow weren't you weren't you frank's neighbor at one point sam yeah for several years in laurel canyon and i i dated uh dweasel's uh babysitter christina from hot rats in the swimming pool frank was the only one allowed to even jam with like pink floyd they wouldn't jam with anybody but they would let frank come up and jam with him well i've also heard uh frank play cover songs of like jimi hendrix or or eric clapton and frank can just run circles around i mean frank was a genius guitar player without a doubt i've been to about maybe 50 of frank's concerts and about uh maybe a similar number of uh him just practicing he was a true composer he was a true composer's composer he was a musical genius you know what it's hard to mention frank without mentioning son raw who was another musical composer and if if you don't know who sun ra is i really you know space is the place is his autobiography which is absolutely spectacular and he has quite a few stories about frank in that book um yeah sun raw space is the place so is that sort of psychedelic punk oh yeah it's important big big steve parrish big steve parrish who for many years was jerry garcia's roadie has got a show on xm called big steve hour and just last week he was recalling a caller called in and asked why the dead never played with zappa and and big steve basically said the reason why uh zappa didn't like the grateful dead is because zappa hated cannabis yeah he hated dr a lot of drugs cannabis having to deal with music and rock and roll and the fact that all rock and roll musicians were kind of categorized as stoners he said the reason why he didn't come around us any because he couldn't deal with the level of cannabis use and when they did come together he was a total not a social you know kind of [ __ ] well he did like two drugs he liked nicotine and caffeine yeah but and sex yeah yeah but he hated cannabis and his cannabis uses wealth or his hatred for cannabis use is well documented it's it talked about in in space is the place as well they talk about it in the autobiography that uh because people who played with son raw also played with um frank and they had strict rules to not hang out with not just the grateful dead but a huge amount of people and groups and musicians that were doing all sorts of drugs because yeah frank it it altered his you know he he was an ocd genius that wanted everyone to be doing kind of you know composing what they wanted if they were tripping balls on acid it wasn't uh it wasn't coming together for him i guess zapping reminds me of like a more accessible john mclaughlin um i always kind of associated their work very similar but he was just more accessible and was more together in terms of the way he put him up i was just going to add the only thing about the movie that i found a little disappointing was you know there were so many players in and out of the mothers especially in the earlier years that were [ __ ] incredible lowell george got kicked out of the mothers because of his drug use i mean he went on and made little feet uh you know there's just the the list is endless of musicians that were around frank zappa that recognizes jimmy carl black he's the indian of the group and how about a shout out for bill laswell for bill as well he's got uh i mean he's been involved in thousands of recordings when you mentioned john mclaughlin i immediately clicked to bill laswell and he's got bill john zorn a lot of those guys oh zorn yeah the downtown you know the sword not mentioned the stone in new york i mean um yeah you know there's a huge you know i was involved in the downtown scene a bit um and i i r you know this guy like i think bill lives in san francisco now and he's still doing shows um much smaller settings but yeah an incredible player and someone that's inspired myself and i know that he's really moved music forward in terms of what you're saying mark through the 90s i think he held the torch in terms of experimental stuff yeah who takes a miles davis album i know i'm like and or who takes a bob marley album it's like i'm just gonna [ __ ] with this and see what i can pull off of that and that that i can't remember the titles of both anthology incredible albums and really deep you know you it's like very psychedelic in a lot of a lot of senses i'd highly recommend pamphlet dreams of freedom ambient translations of bob marley and dub robbie shangkar yeah i was saying ravi shane carr he he was one that was not okay with cannabis smoking he wasn't okay with surprise and was influencing the culture but he decided that he was going to just open himself up to it because there was a dream and also he had a healer who he had been working with his whole life ever since he was a child and the healer had told him you know i do think that you need to open up your music you know forum and and open up your arms to this and i think that because he did that it really made his music so much better so much more rich well and and he gave he gave us he gave music an incredible gift right norah jones is his daughter and she's incredible i don't know if you've ever seen yeah she is just she's unbelievable how about we shout out ustad hussein if we're going to shout out ravi shankar and his son zakir hussain who is probably one of the greatest players of the tabla to ever walk the face of the earth that man brought me to tears at several concerts that i've recorded of uh i saw him with the grateful dead back in the day yeah their music really changed for the better i i believe it became so much more worldly and so much more palatable when cannabis became sort of part of you know the tuning of it and and he even talks about it sort of intimately in an interview of how against drugs he is and how he does feel like playing with other people under the influence did help his music did help him actually he says reach shiva in a different way so that's pretty interesting i think it was open like that i would just add the an opposite end of the spectrum and just give a lot of love to george clinton and the p-funk all-stars and funkadelic and their whole influence on the culture and spoken word bootsy came from that traditional james brown style and then just blew the top off with george clinton so like by the time we thought george clinton in the mid night and early 90s i mean that was five to six hours straight no breaks total church you know just rhythm down to the core and if it weren't for lsd it would be really hard to go to one of those shows i remember seeing him come out on stage with a cape that just said inhale on it just like arms wide open it was so rad hey welcome debbie how's it going it's going good i saw you on clubhouse the other day i was like debbie's on clubhouse hey colin i like clubhouse it's fun i was on there this morning talking about uh uh-ho heavy topic should uh white women be considered equity under these cannabis regulations and uh you know i don't think so equality we we're working for equality but equity is a different thing so oh man that's a fun way to wake up your sunday i saw you in that room and i was like damn that's uh that's gonna be some heavy conversation going on in there it was it was fun it was fun though yeah awesome well welcome we've been talking about music all day we've talked about yeah we started out talking about ketamine and psychedelics as we have the ames institute dr allison and ac braddock and some other women did some journeys there yesterday and i guess they're going to go again today so they started us out talking about every drug but cannabis and then that kind of led us into all of these amazing sort of musicians and we've it's been an interesting like i'll say like once again you know even when we're just shooting the [ __ ] like if you want to learn about some great musicians and bands the last 45 minute conversation in here dropped like i want to say 50 plus musicians and i'm guessing not everyone knew the names of each person that we dropped so yeah just talking about all these great musicians and the sort of effects that psychedelics and cannabis has had on these musicians and yeah i just heard my contribution uh i ate at edible a couple weeks ago and i made a seven hour spotify playlist so you know you can go get that i am i'll check that out yeah send that to me send that to me i'll put it we were talking the dead debbie so i bet you there is there's one or two songs on there because as we know how beneficial or influential the the lots were to you know can and to getting the message out on canvas hell yeah i put one 11 minute long grateful dead song on there and then i realized well i can't do that again because um that's when people turn off the playlist but uh that's when some people turn on the players yeah dark star that dark star is too short i like alligator i put alligator on there because that's the ultimate um lsd recording you know like that's the one where they were just so high on every drug possible they're like let us in the studio you know do you guys listen to the uh xm channel the grateful dead channel on xm they have today in grateful dead history well um the last couple days they've been playing the shows from the fillmore east uh february uh uh 11th 12th 13th 14th new york uh 1970 you know oh yeah and i've had these on cassette tapes since i was probably a sophomore in high school so i'm going back to 1970 [Music] i don't know eight ish so oh my god to hear those and such great sound quality is just unbelievable and the almonds came out during i think it was love light or something like that and you could hear greg almond singing because greg almond takes the mic and you can totally make out dwayne's playing because dwayne just sounds different than garcia it's just not garcia at all i mean i've been listening to this piece of music for it isn't you know where the almonds really got influenced by the dead to really go i think so i'm in shred yeah i feel like that was yeah they always had they had the two drummers thing going on too and i think both of those bands mutually influenced each other but if you think about that as such a magical period for the dead because they were just about to go into the studio and record work in men's dead then you know later on in the year they get busted in new orleans and so now they gotta you know quickly put american beauty together so those two albums came out in 1970 you know when i was only eight years old when they came out but um i was on tour you know just a handful of years later and it was just it was oh my god so so magical they were so great oregon country fair show where they did um a springfield creamery benefit which was ken kesey's brother has a springfield creamery which is nancy's yogurt which is the first yogurt in america to have probiotics thanks kankeezy for and and family for introducing probiotics to us in our yogurt back in the early 70s and then to have 20 000 people show up at the oregon country fair lot 1972 minimal cars in the parking lot because most people came in and school buses are hitchhiked and it was like 110 degrees out well that was during the gas lines too so nobody wanted to wait in the gas lines they're all head to china anyway sunshine daydream is is the name of this yeah the movie yeah i think that movie is either on amazon or something you could watch it i think there's clips of it on i know the bird song is up on is up on youtube and again yeah that really weird you know naked completely stark naked hippie that's kind of like behind jerry right and the camera every once in a while you get jerry and you get this naked hippie who's kind of like doing that sitting up on a pole oh yeah it was what an incredible just again had those tapes for years some of my most played cassette tapes that i have in my collection are the those venita shows i randomly put on my my dancy bear scarf i don't know if you guys can see this but i just apparently came right in at the right time by the way atm remember all those uh farm kids that you that came and helped us at cannabis action network like the second generation kids from the farm in tennessee yeah yeah yeah we actually went to the farm in tennessee and they made us fresh mushrooms and fresh tofu and yeah they're great amazing people man steve and i make asking stephen gaskin actually married me at my original wedding at the high times cannabis cup i was there no steven and ina also made we're freaking cool because of our midwifery connection and anyone who doesn't have the book spiritual midwifery that is a must-have book whether you're having a baby or not there is a beautiful stories in there of people that took their power back and had home births they created a whole line of buses and school buses that went around the country and then they finally settled in tennessee and created a thing called the farm and the farm still functions to this day as a let's say a women in children's health clinic along with educational outreach for midwives we're not talking about the seven tribes buses are we those crazy brown and white buses extremely different the twelve tribes is the the group that got the people that were too high that was joshua and then they they've comforted them with jesus and and christianity and food right and i have to say i pulled i pulled my girl friends off of those buses all the time my first modus operandi was if anybody was missing i would go and see josh away in the buses and be like all right someone's missing and there they would be drinking shy in the back telling me they were having the best experience of their life and they were going to go home to oklahoma with them so you know it's also you know the 12 times also is a very amazing group of self-sufficient people that creates really good food at festivals like common ground which is now more of the common there's even 12 tribes up here in british columbia and they have places that are really powerful so you know it's it's it's definitely a cult a lot of the mustard seed cafes and stuff are still run by them but they're not they're not so um uh scary they're like earth-loving christian anarchists i remember the common grounders that moved into winnipeg and they were definitely very much the same people that had those buses on dead tour they like come and eat our bakery goods and you couldn't have the stay away from those bucks oh dude i'm telling you because i wanted to see the people that they that they that they were able to attract in the background so so endearing the spinners i wonder how many of those people still are around with their little followings yeah i don't know you know i would i haven't seen spinners in a long time but that's definitely where i would hang out i'll say this much they couldn't keep up with this five and a half hours and that was pretty incredible i feel like i entered a new realm we talk a lot about you know drugs and and and meditation and things that get you into other realms and into you know other lines of thinking and spinning is unbelievably incredible and you know the whole sufi religion is is sparked off of that and anyone who hasn't anyone who hasn't taken a moment to spin in a really big open field and spin past where you're scared spin past where you're dizzy and there's this incredible calm in the center and you know people spin to find that incredible calm and they say that it's a place where you can clearly speak to god and it really is like a true place and i found that balance so many times at dead shows and i never even knew these people i never even spoke to these people i would just go and spin for four hours next to them and feel this vibration and and and find maybe some questions that i was looking for in the week or you know in my life between sets at oakland there was the spinners percussion players yeah just beyond the confines of shakedown street usually toward the end they had the disco bus you remember the disco bus and so the disco bus would put these really big speakers on top of the bus and just blare the loudest disco music and just attract this crowd and really spun out people all around just grooving disco it was great man it's so funny spun out is when you don't find the center of the spin when you find the center of the skin you have mcdonald's i think it's interesting you know how the luffy's are you know extremely you know they're muslim you know and i think we're paused and and the disco bus for sure because it always made you say yeah after the show okay i'll have another hit because you knew the disco bus was going to go on for another four more hours and you were safe and taken another killer bags of weed were found at the disco bus and eventually the nitrous mob would find would find the disco bus and so then the people would start buying balloons which would feed the disco bus so you'd have all these lunatics all sucking on nitrous all dance and disco it was just i wonder how different the scene would have been if the full melt bubble could have been there on the early grateful dead days they never had one there was there was full there was bubble and keef at grateful dead it just wasn't popularized in the same way there there were heady insane hash oil filmmakers in eugene at the time so just not before you never saw full mouth hash you might have seen hash oil but you weren't seeing full melt hash at those shows when you dry sift those dry sifts melt as we know they do they absolutely melt they just aren't full melt they melted what they thought was the meltiest of the dry sift they were probably 50 heads but there was it's just there was beautiful origins there we'll see yeah there was also the old uh there was still an import uh business at that point with the hashes coming through so we said i mean none of it seemed very good but you could still get the uh kind of brown and black hashes that came in in bricks totally totally that was the more likely and i feel like that that would definitely bubble up i don't know anybody that tours you would buy it and they would just uh measure it out not half a scale because having a scale at that time either was difficult or it was always the triple beam and you didn't really want to have a scale on you so they had the long coils and then they would just measure it out to like a half inch or an inch and that was what the weight of it was and when you lit that up right at first it definitely had a sweet bubble to it but it was really quite no no not even close to full melt but it would bubble just for a second and i remember talking about how cool that was you know i just remember being at the whole enchilada country fair like really early 90s and some crazy amazing hippie coming out and pretty much knocking us over with keith you know like we were just like what the hell is this and it was just it was really special you know it was unicorn tears back then country country fair was the collection of the most heady people so that you know you were gonna find you were gonna find the best the best either there or at the southern oregon barter fair one of the two i forgot about the days when we're all experts at eyeballing the weight of cannabis just by looking at it with the the the art of uh eyeballing the gram and eighth and uh quarter an ounce hell yeah it was based on his head the fish scale how many fingers yeah taking it back time for a dab everybody let's do this up got some cookies and cream going down in my bowl right now let me go all this talk of hash got me excited me and atien son off uh from denture onto the other tours we did uh vans uh further we did uh lollapalooza horde we were everywhere fishbone took us out uh prime minister's out private took us out yeah that was fun were you guys at the festival what was it the last outside lands where they actually allowed cannabis sales on site at the festival i didn't know that one the green lands or something like that it was called i missed it right yeah susan's doing that i think susan soares was that a success or did the people who put that together i mean are they gonna are is there gonna be more things like that you know i think they'll definitely be more things like that yeah as soon as uh you know they would have had one this time i think it would have happened again definitely yeah i know susan was also doing it at um oh what's the big festival down in southern california in this right in february yeah yeah coachella i know they're gonna do that as well you have to buy your cannabis over here and you have to smoke it over here you're not going to be able to like mingle in the in the rest of the crowd i mean is it going to be like really restrictive on where you can use it you know no i know people are trying to get kiosks at uh like shoreline and other places so that whenever there are shows they can actually show up and actually have a cannabis kiosk but i've only heard the discussions of that i've not actually seen it in real practice because that was all getting ready to kick off pre-covet but yeah my fear is the same as you mark is that you wouldn't be able to bring in your own canvas you would have to buy this expensive ass you know whatever weed we decide you have to buy and to consume it here i don't know if it's a brand new yogurt or being white in the beer garden area that they're telling you to consume it in it's not like you can buy it and take it back to your seat which is [ __ ] which is even worse with cannabis because they want to put up a wall because like somehow it's okay to see someone drinking something because you know that could be water it could be juice it could be alcohol but smoking like in washington they've done a few events and then they can put up an eight wall eight foot wall in the park so you have a band over here and you have the sectioned off eight foot wall where everyone's smoking weed they can't see the band and then there's two people in front of the band like uh cc here at the emerald cup in california they have the alcohol people penned up in their pens and you can smoke cannabis anywhere pretty much so yeah that's what's up that's how it should be and that's how hopefully it will become but yeah this separation of church and state yeah alcohol they need to be pinned cannabis agreed agreed here here what's that sound the biggest music event that folks have been to uh with me it was 400 000 people hmm i would have to say my biggest event was certainly not a music event it was the maha kumba mela and i think there was like 2.8 million people there did you meet most of them i met like a good chunk of them you know all the ones with good hash anyway the ones that i needed to meet was there a porta potty in sight no you just [ __ ] in the ganges dude i'm joking this was in the north it was quite clean everyone thinks the ganges are so disgusting and dirty because of varnasi where they burn the bodies this is up north in haredwar near uh rishikesh no the water's quite nice up there it's beautiful i was i people were like oh my god you went in the ganges i'm like yeah dude it was like looked like north vancouver like it was just like water coming out of foothills of the himalayas like it was it was it was really beautiful all right i wanted to kind of oh go ahead i swam in the ganges in banaras and i saw pieces of body burnt float by yeah like a hand it was actually less than a hand oh it happens i kind of wanted to change the subject a little bit because recently what i did was i went on a three-day tour here in um uh the interior in the okanagan i went to penticton and i went to vernon and i went to kelowna cruised around to some other little smaller spots like oliver and i went and visited all these different people with shops and i kind of wanted to get your guys opinion on this because you know these people have some of them are legacy some of them are not either way both sides have like spent an enormous amount of time and energy to get to where they are by now first being potentially civil disobedient but now kind of saying okay we're going to follow the rules we're going to get in line we're going to jump through these burning hoops and so they've got their shops and of course you know all their shops are there's some difference um i definitely didn't come to the coots i would have been at your place you kidding me um that was josh and kelly texting me privately better not have come to the coots of course not i would be talking to you for sure so you know to get this out basically you know there's you can kind of create different vibes in your shops but every single package looks exactly the same so there you know it's this canada packaging thing that really kind of affects you know your ability to stand out i will give it up to the cottage i believe in penticton um i've i i thought it was so cool and if you go on my instagram you might still be able to see the shots it was a little cottage and then you walk in and it looked like the foyer of a little old lady's home with these beautiful couches and plants and stuff and then there was plants growing down the walls and then you walked into this great room that was all hardwood floors and all wooden kind of walls and beautiful uh wallpaper like what's behind josh and kelly you know really cool all around the place it set a vibe i felt like i was visiting my plug who stayed at his grandma's house the night before and then you walk in and there there's just a guy standing there behind a couple of counters and he was super nice and super cool and so you've got all these people working really hard trying to get this done and now you have this other element you have the indigenous people who are like well we want to play too we've got our sovereignty we want to play we should be allowed to play so i wish i remembered her name selena who is in vernon had told me the story of a good friend of hers who was a native is a native woman and was trying to go the the the route of the legal and it was just like one obstacle wall after another and finally she was like you know what i'm going to throw a sea can down right on native property and we're just going to start selling weed like that i think she even created something called the green mile where there's like a bunch of them all kind of together and if you drive through the okanogan they're everywhere they are literally everywhere and they don't have limits they can sell as much as they want they can advertise so they have signs all over the highways and on posts and stuff and let me tell you it was a point of contention with a lot of the shop owners and i think the rep that i was with was extremely surprised when i said what i said and i think you guys might have an idea what i'm gonna say i said uh they were like well it's not fair it's not fair they're you know they're they don't have to follow the rules we've had to do all this stuff and i'm like really it's not fair hey so but what about when you stole their children and murdered their ancestors what about when our ancestors did that what about that that also was not fair well i thought the rep was going to have a heart attack when i said that to the first store owner in i think it was in penticton i found the conversation to be enlightening i told them that they need to get behind the indigenous population and the natives and they need to support them in every way that they can you do not want to stand against these people on this issue cannabis is actually making something a little bit right somehow cannabis is making things right for the native populace right population right now in canada and i just thought holy [ __ ] this is amazing and i also convinced each and every one of those stores that i had this discussion with that it will help you believe it or not because the government's gonna see it they're gonna realize there's no competing with these no limits and edible no limits and go in and buy a quarter pound if you want and advertise on the street and i really am a firm believer that that's going to leach over into the the legal federal program that we have now because there's no getting away from it this loophole is so good the government is absolutely [ __ ] on this one and it's also the right thing to do yeah exactly materials are not analyzed for safety i would say some probably are and some probably aren't i don't want to say but yet they definitely don't have to follow all the same regulations uh in fact any of them it's their own thing and the shops are busy people are definitely buying at those shops and and uh you know finding loyalty there so i think that not standing standing against them is one of the biggest mistakes you could make as a cannabis shop owner right now in my opinion and i'm gonna say one thing we have we have such an incredible opportunity right now to be able to work with the indigenous nations in canada to be able to get razzle education in there because they have sort of a wide open slate and we're finding that these shop owners and a lot of people the first nations are so incredibly open to doing it right and stepping in in a way that is really empowering the first nations and also empowering cannabis so we're working with the ministry right now we're putting together so many different sops different pilot projects that's working directly with the first nations peoples because this is a loophole that cannabis can have a higher better voice and a higher effect on the federal laws so that we can put things into place to say see look at how this can actually be done better so it would be really silly for the lps to go against anything that's happening there because they also have the ability to go through this direction to change the way that cannabis commerce is being done today also so it's a really incredible opportunity and thank you so much much marcus for both defending that and also bringing up this because we've been living and breathing this um in our home right now and working with the ministry and writing down sops and really working hard to uh you know give cannabis more of a medical stance which is where it needs there's a lot of deep issues on that and i would encourage people to look up uh what residential schools are in canada and also uh indigenous women going missing and murdered in canada is a really huge thing and also in first nations um in in their in tribes there's a lot of issues with addiction and and and cannabis is helping that so there's a lot of tribes and nations that are coming together to accept it to help them you know with their addictions so um we see it as a really positive and i and i also you know for any people who are associated with lps in order to have lps there has to be a portion that you've been uh you've made a commitment towards education you've made a commitment to the communities that you're set up in and i really want to plead and encourage these lps to reach out to these indigenous nations to reach out to a lot of these different shop owners and let's start swapping education let's use that federal funding to make bridges for cannabis this is really important and we still have doors open um to create more education for the general public as well as for the first nations as well as for a lot of addictions that josh was just mentioning that are just super incredibly high here in canada currently in british columbia and this can help currently in british columbia addictions and opioid deaths are killing more people than covet if i'm not you know oh yeah on that and also yeah it's it's way higher so it's like oh great we're all wearing masks but that does is not stopping desks but uh johnny b looked like you had something to say and i'd be interested to hear what you what you were thinking when it comes to medical and you're talking about this and and and you can go into and to say chilliwack and i can go in and buy chocolate that's 10 milligrams but i can go down the street to the reserve and buy a bag of gummies that's 250 milligrams so i mean there's quite a difference when it comes to medical so i mean if you're in need of those type of edibles that's where you go because they actually have what you need they actually have those high doses so i don't have to sit here and eat like 25 of these i'm taking 250 milligram caps i go to the store here i can only buy 10 milligrams at a time so that's really disgusting and then if i if i buy more than four items well that's over my 30 grams so i actually have to leave and go back in right so i mean you got to go home and then go back in because you can't have all of that on you out in the world you'd have to wait i'm medical so i can carry 150 grams so right i can go in and out a few times because i am medical but once again so i'm gonna have to walk out with a huge bag in order to get my so that's why i like what's going on with with uh what's happening on the tribe stuff they're actually able to cater to those high doses edibles that are needed and and that's one other thing that the government's really got to lighten up on because that's another encouragement for people to go there and get proper dosaging for themselves because you can't get that in the legal system in reality but that is a legal system so let me rephrase that you can get this only in certain parts in the system that are legal you know what also johnny that there's there's this real limitations with the legal system for um for lps and the limitation is that if we want to supply a province they're going to require that we you know make some product you know sell it to them and then if they sell that product and it's good and people like it they want to be able to order it right away and if you don't have it available to order right away you can fall to the bottom of the queue and so people are desperate to make sure so right away that limits you massively now there's no way that you can support a craft grower um who's only growing small amounts because what i'm gonna buy 50 kilos from this guy and he's not going to have it again for three more months like this might sell out in two days i might need to re have a reorder available in seven days it's another reason why we're limited to not seeing 90 microns 73 micron how the hell am i going to produce 10 kilos of just 90 micron and then have another 10 kilos of it available in a month or a week or two months so what happens is all of that other small lot gets funneled into medical the very place it shouldn't be because when medical people find something that they like they love they need and you're never gonna make it again oh sorry man that was just a couple hundred grams you know we just got a certain amount of stuff from so and so and we're probably not gonna see that stuff anymore i think he killed the clone you know like so they've got it set up to protect the recreational market so you always have more and it's available or you drop the queue but they they've left the most vulnerable people once again the very people who everyone used as their shield for the last 10 plus years in canada so they could continue to grow cannabis sell it and pay their mortgages while claiming it was for the patient uh it's just [ __ ] i mean there's a lot of [ __ ] still there but civil disobedience got us this far a little bit more civil disobedience will get us further sorry debbie did you have something oh i didn't mean to interrupt i'm so sorry but uh yeah on the topic of [ __ ] i wanted to tell you guys the bad news about california law which is that um uh people who live on the uh native american reservations here if they want to participate in the cannabis industry they have to uh sign away their sovereign rights so uh there there is only one cannabis company that's owned by a native american in the entire state and nobody that lives on the reservation who's going to sign away their sovereign rights to to be able to participate in the cannabis industry it's an absolute travesty travesty so yeah i was going to gonna gonna bring that up i'm in washington it's the same similar deal because of the federal lack of federal um you know allowing allowance that the tribes here they they in washington choose to operate under one they've done it they've a pack deal and it's been a big big to-do it took them a couple years to figure out they did some pack but they basically operate as if they're licensed recreational stores you wouldn't know the difference they have the same product they buy from 502 producers um interestingly they they lined it up where they can ship to other tribes so they kind of did have that forethought that they could ship to any other sovereign nation you know tribe but um it's it's not what you're talking about marcus you know and they didn't have the they didn't have the guts i think because of our you know our federal deal you know and yeah totally give me and i don't necessarily want to get into it right now we're dealing with state of emergency all over the place here in canada are being given up left right and center and handing it over i know that's a bigger conversation but wow my heart goes in down into the chair and i think people could see so relevant right now they could look into what it means to be a soft i'm thankful for what's happening in canada right now though because there is you know a medical program that is still functioning and that is a good thing for medical people and i would just on the note someone finding a strain or one particular varietal that works for them and then being worried about whether they can get it again i think it's really important for those people to look into potentially if they can having that strain on their land and growing that is one of their four plants because especially in canada you can do that and nothing connects very much yeah grow your own and now you're connected to the plant itself you're connected to the create life creation process and you're making your own medicine which is a self-empowering action and you're continuing to have the same varietal that works for you and if you can grow four of your own and you're going to do it outside because you don't want to invest a whole bunch of money into having an indoor system and you don't know how to do it well i really suggest that you do it regeneratively because if you need those 200 milligram gummies throughout the whole year then you want to grow those plants really really big and you want to grow a heavy weight and you want to grow really good medicine that you can have throughout the year and now that is having sovereignty with cannabis so if we want to talk sovereignty with cannabis everybody can grow cannabis still here in canada and really we all need the federal government up on that and also have medical for more than than for i'm gonna say yeah and those four plants can be as big as you can grow them look down south they're growing plants getting 25 pounds out of one plant so i mean you can veg this all through your winter inside if you want the first bit of sunshine put that thing outside bury it in the dirt have those soils ready and feed that thing because it's gonna reach for the skies guys and and you can really because you're not limited to how much you're only limited to how many you can only carry 30 grams with you but when you're at home sky's the limit so remember that so it's not about you can get as much as you can there's different methods of growing four plants indoors i did for one plant under each light i've seen people now just at a place they got completely bonsai to plant made one plant really it's four feet by four feet i was pretty amazed i'm gonna go back and take some pictures today this afternoon it's really cool what people are doing out there with their four plant limit guys so definitely grow your own i love it hey and i want to add to that grow your own i want to give selena and the wise woman seed company a huge shout out because she gave me this incredible pack of seeds from wise women's seeds and they are like air heirloom heirloom tomatoes you know like sage plants um some violets some some amarith just like just endless amounts of awesome seeds all sorts of foods and companion plants and uh i am definitely wanting to shout out wise woman seeds and selena in particular for helping curate this for my wife and my family and i we're gonna build some i'm gonna be talking to the dragonfly earth medicine we're gonna get some uh some proper area built up and some good soils in and uh yeah get these seeds kraken grow your own baby because we're gonna head out to the coast here soon we're gonna come help you build it awesome that's what's up you're gonna stop by my place me too and help me yeah yeah definitely johnny for sure that we're without a doubt we're awesome we're also heading out to victoria um to see a fight with um elias who is the first canadian athlete to be a thc um cannabis athlete and he's on our story right now so big love to elias and the work that he's been doing at becoming a cannabis athlete so we're going to be really and really pushing uh the the conversation forward that how silly that you're saying that it's okay to use a plant but only part of the plant and and this sort of you know uh separatism has to has to end okay well you can use the plant but you can only use part of the plant and if you use this part of the plant then you could be tested and i mean it's just absolutely ridiculous i think that often humans run themselves in a circle and eat their tail and we just need to stop this the plant gives us what it needs in the right doses that for us to to to be able to get relief from and for us to be able to live happier healthy lives especially athletes who are not really supported except by sponsors and maybe they only would get free material or or you know free whatever from different sponsors but they're not supporting their health their longevity and their well-being well into the future so that conversation really needs to change because there's a tremendous amount of youth that look up to athletes in the world and athletes need to carry the conversation forward with the sponsors backing them of education of health and well-being so that the youth can be raised in that type of an educational platform and i would just add that part of cannabis what it's given us is earth conscious it's giving us that nature awareness so like when johnny b's talking about having to go to the store and get a stack of 10 milligram things i mean that's a lot of garbage so why so and a lot of sugar healing ourselves while ailing the earth or we're getting diabetes to be able to get 200 milligrams like let's create a little bit of sense here in the idea of holistic understanding like and i have to bring it back to science like we keep relying on only this idealized you know specific you know standard that takes away all of the holistic versions of it and then we are only looking at things with blinders on and the more that we sort of open up the conversation and sure we can use that scientific experiment for one of the great discoveries to be able to explain something that's fantastic but if we're using it as the only way to explain something and also be able to make laws and move forward on then we're really missing out on you know something so much more deep and something so much more powerful for humanity as a whole also i just say you know shout out to tarly um tara lee's been is doing a start your own seed thing on her youtube channel so for home growers that are interested in having a larger plant or a big plant in their backyard or even inside starting it now you know with the moon cycles is going to be a really good way to get a large plant and that is you have to decide how big of a pot you're going to put it in and how many times you think you'll have to transplant it in the few months you know two or three months it's going to take to put it in the ground but you know there's some good in-depth conversation going on there and d.e.m pure is going to be putting out a contest but we don't want to call it a contest we want to call it a protest but it's not like you're a traditional type of a protest it's sort of like a fun protest and um put it out of like show us your four plants and you know talk about all the other things that you could be growing and show us your your legal plans so that all those people can partake in in this education too and and the backyard stuff backyard transformations we're seeing incredible backyard transformation it's been unbelievable uh brian lammy on instagram you know has dug out in the lawn in his backyard and made trenches and put wood in there and he's like i don't know what i'm doing i'm throwing logs in the ground we've watched people take up their entire concrete in downtown l.a literally venting a jackhammer their entire concrete that they had you know for 25 years is all dug up it goes on and on and on we've seen so many pictures of people's backyards fully transformed we've been talking with earthkind a lot over the years u-r-t-h-k-y-n-d earth kind and cannibism 420 he lives in south central los angeles and sometimes in oregon but south central los angeles and and we have uh as a group dem peer have been talking about creating a regenerative uh farm not farm but an inner city urban farm where you transform a vacant lot into a beautiful garden and also he's talked about creating i think this is good for other municipal areas where they have local backyard gardens come together as a co-op and make medicine for themselves neighborhoods of people getting together growing four plants in their backyard and then creating meetings where they can share how to make medicine together and they all make the medicine together to work to give to themselves throughout the winter it's self-empowerment it's community empowerment and it's it's herbalism you know it's it's learning about herbalism because you'll always have companion plants you'll always have flowers and mint and all the other and what brings community together better than talking about their buds that they grew in their backyard i mean come on we all love talking about our buds that we grow so it's it's i you know josh and i always say that backyard gardens you know are going to save the world and actually believe that it might be the only thing they have to say to the world so i think it's like a song they miss wrote it it's come together right now over weed i like it i love it i'm uh dealing with uh on the side here someone who's my admin has offended in one of my groups i don't think people realize how hard it is to administrate these groups on facebook and that there's a lot of people who go there just to kind of cause trouble when we're just kind of trying to curate these groups to share information to let everyone kind of gain information and it's endless how many people hit me oh your mod deleted me or i treated me poorly and i'm just like man it's because of the stress he has this poor guy is literal and he's been on hash church before this poor guy has done a lot of good in these groups he shared an enormous amount of knowledge with people and you just can't win with these hey i would like to shout out uh a few things here real quick i want to shout out to johnny b thank you very much for my hat and cubes as well as my mask um it's much love and appreciated all the way around there uh i also want to uh congratulate patients out of time they're having their 25th anniversary right now and of course the emerald cup uh we're actually uh yeah we actually changed the actual voting in the last couple of days because uh packaging and labeling was part of the overall and now that's been pulled out and it's gonna be a separate part of the um competition all together so pushing for environmentally sound packaging and um last but not least just to be uh to deal with the realism we lost an employee this week at berkeley patients group one of our employees she was only 30 years old morgan medina passed away suddenly this week so um prayers and ups and love i've never lost an employee actually um we've had others retire and pass away but um shout out to their friends families and employees and support out there and you know she was one who just celebrated her one year anniversary with us just last week and she had extra care and love for patients and she was one of those unsung heroes that helped everybody so much love and respect thanks for sharing that uh that's sort of sorry to hear that go ahead debbie so sorry i'm gonna blame my uh stuttering behavior on the raw gardens dab i did a few minutes ago because i like forgot how to use the english language for a minute but i think i'm back um no our buddy beau from oregon passed away too i wanted to mention that he is uh so known beau for probably 30 the entire 32 years i've been involved in the movement and um shout out to the oregon family and uh yeah yeah we love you and happy valentine's day everyone too i'd want to say that let's keep love each other all the time oh bo uh uh i was a general manager for ed rosenthal and for his first trial i had to disappear and i disappeared a few times and uh beau hid me up in oregon for three weeks and allowed me to go to work in the gardens for john cejo and the oregon crew of which i went and fixed the gardens they had a whole bunch of large plants that were overgrown with white pottery mildew so i went in and fixed the plants the whole time i was kind of you know sentenced up there and beau fed me hid me out gave me the room and everything man much love bo you were a great spirit and condolences to the bpg posse that is never easy no thank you just to remember everybody you know we never know if today is your first year last so you know hug and love and remind each other that you know life is short life is quick and we have the time that we have so enjoy it and don't forget to tell anybody you love them and uh in that case i love you all especially all you all here much love love you guys sorry for your loss i really love you guys thanks so much and i just wanted to say that this time has you know created such incredible divisiveness you know in the world in politics and now you know unfortunately even within old households so you know this divide is being felt everywhere and and it's running really really deep and i guess just since it's valentine's day you know i think that building bridges for love is really important and you know if we're gonna make a choice and i just always really resonate with what the the ancient buddhists say and and and the dreamers who dreamed this existence into time and that's love and fear and i just really encourage everyone listening and all of us and even myself to really resonate in fear and i mean resonate and love and to outright fear because it really isn't serving anything and it just creates a continuous noise so happy valentine's day everybody and here's to love you know on that note i think i'm gonna cut her short today i've got my wife and my child waiting on the other side of the door to go hang out and go for a nice little hike i have absolutely enjoyed today's uh episode and show with all of you guys we had some good conversation um i do have a couple of small announcements i wanted to mention segre's um talk that's going to be had here soon i believe it's mark lewis from napro ryan lee chimera genetics rob clark rob connell clark is going to be there mojave richmond is going to be on that panel um i had sent out an email to rob mentioning that hey if you wanted to come on here and promote it before and he sort of said you know what before you know let's not scoop the scoop let's i'll do we'll do that and then we'll come on hash church afterwards and we can talk about it so i i know hey marcus yes hey marcus he's actually in the middle of a patient's out of time conference today yeah yeah i've been emailing with him actually yeah thank you so he'll probably uh those guys uh mojave and all those guys will get them on in the next couple of weeks two or three weeks and go to segre dash int and they'll have a registration form you can fill out and you can check out i believe it's on the 25th of february the segra you know heavy hitters growers breeders panel i think it's going to be really awesome with the group of guys that they got on there i also wanted to mention that i did invite corvain cooper on through his group he just was released from prison i guess he was one of the guys that got a uh um trump um pardoned him and so i thought it would be cool to use hash church platform to help him with his re-entry maybe you know help f you know put some money in his gofundme and you know let him tell his story use the platform so we're hoping on getting corvain on here uh in the next week or two and uh other than that you know everyone thanks for coming and shooting the [ __ ] and chatting and being so cool and i also love each and every one of you so thank you hey wade has something to say before you go yes please uh two things uh i heard on clubhouse last night that corvin cooper is looking for a place to stay somewhere in southern california for the next two weeks he's got a an apartment he's going to be able to move into on march 1st but between now and then he's looking for a place uh to stay so if anybody's uh hooked up in that way and have a spot uh pointing out that point in that direction the other thing i wanted to say was about valentine's day saint valentine is also the patron saint of epilepsy and um i spoke to forrest the other day for the first time in i don't know almost two

see it starting to milk you guys see that see how it's melting trying to keep you guys good view there but I'll have to start adding pressure guys because do this two-hand thing but see it melting guys so you kind of got to use a little bit of your weight as well and that's a slow process but I'm just doing this so I could show you guys the melt and then I'll start hammering it out so you guys can see that melt there now all right see how beautiful it is just melting all together it's like a liquid so anyway guys I'm gonna luck I'm gonna continue to roll this I gotta be somewhat quick but I'll roll it for about a half hour or so and then then I'll roll hash balls but right now the thing is is to get it D carb and I gotta do this then I need to flip sides but you could definitely see it melt you know what I'll finish this and then I'll show you guys oh well it melted but it's got to continue to melt remember guys this is just hot water in a wine bottle i boiled it to 103 degrees Celsius I think that's around 220 Fahrenheit that's what you don't want you don't want that Ripple it's alright though I'll fix it look at that guys your milk just from a wine bottle over top of it Pierre Pierre Pierre unbelievable a Pierre milk does caramel just from dropping a wine bottle on there for a couple seconds anyway guys I'm gonna get at it and I'll give you guys I'll update you guys in a couple minutes okay guys so it's coming along pretty good I just wanted to stop here for a second and I'll flip it over show you guys look at the full health or what guys so now I flipped it over and I'm gonna do the other side it's only been about five 10 minutes of pressing and I want to do this for at least a half hour guys so I D carve everything properly and and just so we do a perfect job on it see it's too hot now it's like an oil pushing I'm pushing it all up okay guys I'm going to continue like this okay so I just keep rolling you guys and then I'm like moving the paper around as well I'm like turning it but it's really hot guys when it's pushing all the one side I just got to roll it on pretty much just gentle no wait it works out pretty well now I gonna let it cool a little bit flip sides look at that guy's that's not beautiful Dan that's nice the way that's melting I can't even apply pressure to this stuff because it just rolls it all into one spot but it is definitely D carving and that's what you call well-known people so I'll be good and I won't need to reheat the bottle okay guys that's good enough for me now now that's how I'm gonna let it cool a little bit leave it awesome that's breasts Oh unbelievable a very very nice stuff very nice okay so I'm gonna let it cool guys then I'm gonna do my thing have how I'm gonna make my hash balls so I gotta let it cool though before I start trying to take that apart so I'll get the video back up in a little bit here I wish you guys could smell this right now it smells so delicious guys look at how beautiful that is nice very nice full melt wine bottle 100 degrees Celsius a little trick I learnt from the pro in the game not even half as good as that guy but definitely produce some decent looking hash good tasting hash and Ashley gets you pretty good in high okay so now I have this part on so I can show you guys how to get your hash back to hell you have to how you'd want to have it fold it in half try not to get your hash like stuck in the creases of the cellophane see that yeah [Music] I didn't realize how I have that Sylvain they didn't realize I have it folder so he put the sound guys for the annoying [ __ ] I wish I knew I had this bulb it I thought it was just one sheet guys so you see you just kind of keep folding it until you get it to the size lon yeah smells a little crazy so crazy yes I should be telling you guys what I'm doing here sorry I kind of just got stuck in the moment but yeah I'm just trying to get the ball down sighs now you know you got to stretch your paper let's get stuff cause it's stuck in the creases guys so I'm gonna do one more fold here trying to grip the bag sorry about the sound guys pause this and fix it oh you guys I'm sorry about that I didn't know it was a double wine bag sir those I'm trying to fit into a nice big bowl and I'll do this for about five ten minutes and then it will make a beautiful beautiful ball so pretty sticky stuff okay guys there it is follow hash now I'll let that sit and cure for a bit probably perfect full mouth that can't even stay as a ball guys flatten right oh it's unbelievable that sir days sorry I gotta go there my suffers burning name I must have bought a different helmet on anyway guys hope you enjoyed the video sorry about my fire alarm going off there but I gotta run there cuz she's smoking so I'll uh thanks for watching guys remember to sub up like the video and we'll see you guys in the next round ace", "yEhezyBVYfc": "hey we're coming at you again from wacky bags calm today and we're just introducing our new and totally awesome agitation unit the wacky rocket tank now we included in the unit you can see here that we've got two of the small zipper bags we've noticed that the two smaller bags tumble in there a little easier and move around with the agitation a little nicer than the one large bag that we were thinking of including also with the set comes a four bag twenty gallon all mesh set at a 161 ten seventy three and twenty five micron we're also gonna include two of the large wacky pressing screens also included in the unit comes to ball valves one half inch ball valve and one three-quarter inch ball valve with gaskets for each ball valve to be attached and they are attached with a tri clamp quick and easy to use also included is this racking arm which with this specific ball valve can be put into the machine and after loosening the Tri clamp can be moved around to focus your agitation in whichever direction you want now you can see that these two ball valves will allow both air or aux or air and co2 to be used simultaneously or if you'd like you can just have two airs or two Co 2's whichever you prefer this particular piece right here is a temperature gauge that we've attached to the outside instead of the inside just to allow more room for the bag to travel and not to get all caught up on it there and that's pretty much what comes with the with the unit so we're just gonna quickly take you through a very simple step to install one of the ball valves here and this is pretty much and now we're just gonna take you for a little more of an impersonal look at some of the features of the machine as well or the unit story you can see that it stands really well elevated off the ground with the ball valves below here the welds are so beautiful very nicely done nice and and polished up here we've got a multiple clamp system holding the the lid on which is very very sturdy really really great and tough handle system that is very durable rugged and you could easily lift the unit and pull with the handles without a problem might be heavy for you but the handles are gonna handle it no problem anyway we're just gonna quickly take this lid off and show you what's underneath here okay so now we're gonna open up the hood of this bad boy here have a look inside we've taken all the clamps off the lid and you can see in here what we've got is a beautiful gasket that goes around the top easily removable and also easy to put back on that works really great now if we have a look inside here we can see this little hole at the bottom near the drainage space which is where the racking arm would come through if you had it attached and you can actually attach it through the through the barrel here and you can see it it rotates to whichever way you want it to so that's where that goes and if you look on the side over here we've got our measurement gauge here like this is a this is in the nine gallon mark here but if you wanted to do a smaller amount or a smaller batch you know you can fill it up to a couple inches maybe midway from the the bending point to the nine gallon and that's going to be around you know six seven gallons something like that and that would work really great with one of the small bags if you're gonna do a little bit more you might want to fill it up a little more put both bags in in which case you're going to want to probably adjust the pressure the PSI on the co2 just to get your full agitation fill it up with water here now and now as you can see we've filled it up just too close to the nine gallon mark here and we've put one of our bags in the small zipper bag with just some rag in there to keep it buoyant or whatever and we're going to show you how this this bad boy agitate so we've currently got our autor compressed air here to 30 psi and I'm just gonna crank it open slightly and that's that's just a touch so I'll I'll give it a little bit more juice so that's the the oxygen now we're gonna do the co2 and we have our C our co2 currently at 40 psi so I'm gonna crank this guy just ever so slightly so that's just my hair open well we'll slowly bring it up for you here [Music] this is where you're gonna want to be careful just maybe baby step your way through this part find out exactly what psi you're looking for and keep an eye on it as you're doing it just to make sure everything's safe and sound and yeah okay we've got this lid on now and we're just gonna walk it back up and take you for a trip and you show it with the lid on it and yeah there's a lot of clamps but trust me the clamps are a good thing hey so there's a hole in here and here's also a pressure valve there so or a release valve sorry so we're just going to put the the compressed air into here", "bZP9G0GOiUs": "[Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Laughter] flip [Music] [Laughter]", "uIG-mBThhV0": "hey guys epicenter Brian here hey today I'm going to start a sequence of some tips for you guys now some of these tips are gonna be for new users some of them are going to be for everybody this one happens to be for everybody and we're going to be talking about the drain tube and that's where the water comes out when you do your defrosting of the chamber okay and most people use a bucket like this to catch the the water and the big thing is you want to make sure you get in the habit of emptying that bucket every time you defrost okay because if it builds up you also run the risk of having this one catastrophic thing happen to you and every single one of us have done this once and that is if the drain hose is actually sitting in the water when you open the valve then it really causes problems and I'm going to show you exactly what happens okay then I'm going to show you a little device that we're going to put in line with that that is gonna help prevent that in the event that you mess up I've taken the the rack out and the wire is just sitting in there we've got a camera here that's gonna catch that and we have a pump running over here and right now I'm just gonna go ahead and turn that pump off and we have a good vacuum doesn't really matter what the value is but this is what happens okay so normally you'd come over here to open your your valve and I'm gonna just kind of angle this a little bit so you can see what happens in this hose and here we go oh you hear that we just had water shooting on into our chamber that's probably enough let me just close that but you can see what a disaster this has just caused now that water has sprayed and gotten on all of your dried food in there which means you have to rerun the bat but it gets even worse if you don't clean this bucket periodically then that could be some nasty water and it means you're probably gonna have to throw out all the food that you just did okay like I said this has happened to everybody once and you know that the only thing you could do is is open that Valve slowly and and look to see if something's coming up that hose but the easiest thing to do is just get in that habit and go ahead also and install something like this it's super cheap insurance and I'll show you what's involved alright we've installed a couple of these fittings let me show you what it looks like so with two of them you see that the hose remain straight of course it's in the bucket of water right now and I like the way this particular part works out you know you can get something like this in plastic at any auto parts store but it's gonna be a y-you know it'll be shaped like that and you really need two of these installed to get enough air flow so that so that the vacuum can't pull up the column of water up that pipe okay so the cheapest way of course are with the plastic ones but anyway I decided to go with these I like the way the the hose lays and you know it remains straight and everything they're not cheap they're stainless they're about twenty bucks for a pair anyway if you can't find something that you like and you like this idea I could probably sell you a pair just get it get in touch with me you know you can go to our website and send an email and I can arrange to do that for you so anyway we're all set up we're gonna do this again let me just turn off the pump real quick okay now over here we're gonna open this valve up and here we go okay and like I said you do absolutely have to have two of these or it doesn't provide enough air to keep the water from sucking up the pipe okay so that's about it you see that that works very very well and really prevented any kind of problems so hope you guys liked that tip and that's about it for today for the epicenter comm i'm epicentre bryan signing out", "9q82snVI-NE": "I've been lied to Rostow passed over and cussed out number up nights struggling even an upright snow touchdown a bin bin haha i cut down had a calm down gonna stay sane got up in the game and effective brain of a field like I going half nuts now I came up in a rough town tell me", "N3vDm9HXWOU": "welcome back to turkey eyes in today's episode we're going to be pressing one ounce of fresh frozen full plan ice water hash we get big yields using the directional flow method as well as show you how I butter the rosin after being pressed [Music] let's go over the items we're going to be using during this week's episode we're going to need parchment paper any brand will do I always go with the unbleached version pressing bags I ordered these online in a custom size to fit my pressing plates perfectly allowing me to maximize the amount that can be pressed at a single time as for micron science I go with the 37 micron because I mainly deal with ice water hash or teeth if you're going to be pressing flour but with ninety micron and I always remember to double bag your product a couple Dobb tools and a set of tweezers lastly obviously the material I'll be pressing you already know from the title we're going to be doing a single press of one ounce the material I'll be pressing is fresh frozen ice water hash this was from one of my previous grows it's a blend of green crack barber bud and Harley Quinn bx4 this is also material that's been freeze-dried I'll be doing a video shortly covering how I made the ice water hash and using my freeze dryer so be sure to hit that subscribe button you can notified when that gets posted as you can see the material is getting pretty sticky once it comes out of the fridge making it very difficult to talk the pressing baked properly [Music] using one of my job tools I packed though ice-water house down into the bag as evenly as possible my hand I give it a good pre-press evening out the material as best as I can at this point the ice water hash has already become warm and it's very sticky not allowing it to be moved around much in the bag [Music] for today's press we're going to be utilizing the directional flow method a benefit of using it is that it allows you to watch the flow during the press you can see the flow from start to finish allowing you to adjust the variables accordingly this becomes very helpful at all stages as you're about to see I forgot to double bag my material which resulted in my bag being unfolded squishing out the ice water hash out the one end this became noticeable immediately allowing me to stop the press right away unfortunately I forgot to record me collecting the material and just putting a second bag over the other [Music] [Music] I stopped the first pressed short not noticing the flow of the rosin still happening [Music] I then folded the pressing bag in half and did a second press giving additional amount of yield [Music] letting the freshly pressed live hash rasa sit for a few minutes allow it to cool carving the rosin eyelet cooler temperature helps with a collection of it using a long-handled dab tool makes the collection of the rosin very easy since the second press was very short I'm going to collect all the rosin together after collecting it all into one patty I like to put it into a glass jar it's process butters the rosin to texture I find more appealing [Music] I simply put the glass shard in between the two plates with the lid tightly screwed on and let it sit for about one hour at 150 degrees Fahrenheit then I open the jar stir the rose and whip it around mix it up place it back in between the plates I had a hundred degrees Fahrenheit for ten hours after the ten hours I collect the rosin out of the jar and place it into a storage container if you enjoyed this video don't forget to hit that like button [Music]", "QGF4-IHnloY": "all right guys I'm Preston five and a half grams of some rosin I had to reset it it started to move on me that's why there's rosin on the hot side of this parchment paper you can see it starting to sizzle through as I reapply the pressure a little leap the shooter come to the ditch [ __ ] really crap a little darker because I'm running a little bit of hot attempt should party lower at about 20 degrees but it's alright we're still getting a lot of runoff oh I just put it in here Bowie [Music] all right guys this is the finished product I'll probably press this one more time just to get the little bits out of the bag for the most part is out all of it looks like pretty decent quality to me I'll let you guys know how she tastes have a good won't be safe", "5FboBwdy_7k": "what up what up what is up guys this is the beer fridge by fogel and i use this to dry my hash you can see there's a few different stages here most of it's sieved up for the most part this top layer is all sieved up probably ready to press we'll wait till tomorrow down here this one needs to be sieved the second second shelf it could be sieve some more this one right here you can see there's still some chunks so this one really needs to be sieved a lot and then down here i think that one is the same same thing there's still some chunks all along the edges the middle is sieved well uh down here same as well so uh still has chunks to be sieved still has chunks still has some chunks pretty well sieved needs to get one more run through the sieve to make it look like this this one is sieved up and ready to go on the top now these trays were full like solid full trays of hash just uh scooped right out from the bags onto the parchment paper uh i use a stole this from the kitchen i use normal parchment i don't even use this parchment normally i use a cheaper parchment but uh i start off by pulling out a sheet and folding the corners and then i'll flip it over and have the parchment here this is where i'll scoop the hash onto and just get laid out as flat as possible i'll show you guys that method next time but once i get the hash laid out on here i'll bring it over to the bridge open her up slide her in and it stays in here for about three to four days it all depends you know you always want to go and check on it uh as it it will freeze first and like there'll be a little dry layer of hash on the top and you can go in here and use a spoon to kind of just gently scrape off that top dry layer and it will reveal reveal like a the wetter layer underneath you can also flip the patties too to get it dry sometimes i'll pull it out of here and stick it in the freezer for 30 minutes or so pull that out of the freezer give it a good sift and then separate like i have here separate the chunks that didn't break up and the sifted hash and then put it back in here to dry some more and before i had this i did the same kind technique with my fridge and freezer [Music] in the kitchen you know in the house a house fridge or freezer so that's where i started literally started out doing just paper plates [Music] started out by um making hash and putting on paper plates to dry and instantly the first time i did that i realized okay i can't just put this hash wet hash on a paper plate i need to have something some barrier so that's where parchment came in parchment paper plates um one paper plate facing normal with the parchment and the hash and then another paper plate upside down on top of it so it kind of creates a little dry environment and then i put that paper plate um somewhere dark and cool as cool as i could find that turned out to be the fridge why someone the smell wasn't um wanted in the house i got pizza boxes um just like this pizza boxes i live in southern california so i go to smart and final right here and they sell these bad boys um these are great see if that's just gonna fall down or not almost but yeah so i would just line this whole thing with parchment um scoop out the hash get it as flat as possible and then the same kind of tech i just break it up slowly i'll sieve it spread it out as much as i can and these things will just go right to the fridge stack up fridge or freezer i hope that helps you guys been really meaning and wanting to to share more of this technique um when i get a camera not a camera but when i get a uh a tripod i'll be doing some uh action shots you know you guys will see me doing some action working with the uh material shout out to sean flores guys artwork right here quick little story man i saw this uh piece of art on his page and i just loved it totally screamed me you know just washing making hash hustling grinding working and uh i bought um he had he sells prints and he sells you know the original canvas like really good work i bought two prints off him like normal size prints and he knows i was watching this and i like this but um i don't spend my money on dumb [ __ ] you know i don't spend my money on stuff that i want you know but i i really uh it was a small investment for the small prince but he gifted me this big print of the one i really wanted and i'll never forget it when you come across people like this like this is just like myself you know so this is to me this is the the universe throwing back all my good energy that i like to put out this is coming back to me so thanks sean you're the man let's go let's grow maybe well here we go guys fogle beer fridge hash dryer um you got the freeze dryer that is expensive couple thousand or you could do a beer fridge you know uh this thing you can get uh brand new i think it's like a thousand bucks maybe a thousand eight hundred bucks um way cheaper than the freeze dryer though you know and also once you graduate from the beer fridge and you do get a uh freeze dryer it's dual purpose throw some beers in there i see a lot of hashmakers like those uh heady beers those colorful cans and whatnot here you go so yeah uh not much else to say i [ __ ] hate talking because my nose is so stuffed up i'm sure you guys hate the way i sound but uh let's grow hash guys i got a lot of work to do all this [ __ ] is a material waiting to be washed keep my room as cold as possible because my freezers are my freezer is full very full full freezer overload full freezer ready to work i guess we'll slide into this uh a little uh sneak peek to the freeze dryer and the issue i'm having here the uh the hose sorry for the raw the raw footage too guys like i said i'll get a [ __ ] uh i will get a tripod soon but yeah so connecting here and then connecting to the pump you see how the pump has a flared uh compression fitting that's for these hoses so as you tighten it it compress it compresses and it seals up well the harvest ride doesn't have that connection up here so i ordered some parts you know but the threading was the wrong size this connects fine this connects but this part this threaded part is not good to the hose so i had to order a new part help from a buddy and uh yeah we'll get this thing going and we could wash up all this [ __ ] material fast i can't wash anything else right now because uh i got no room to dry it but it looks like we'll be doing some pressing soon guys so uh stay tuned i appreciate you guys let's grow this youtube channel let's grow that solve on this hash let's spread the love follow my instagram deal grows d-e-a-l-g-r-o-w-z um watch me grow just chasing my dreams man used to work a job used to be a hvac technician used to i knew i had this passion for hash for a very long time i just had to plan my escape from the nine to five as a lot of you guys are probably thinking and doing the same thing right now as well trying to plan your escape from your nine to five to follow your dreams well if i could be that example sure i needed that if i had someone else doing this i could i would equip my job probably a lot faster but you know trying new things it's uh it's scary it's risky but it's way worth it i'm super happy can't complain um so yeah if you're all about it follow me on instagram deal grows follow my youtube youtube videos here we're just getting started i promise the production will get better let's grow", "svZJV6qAhPY": "4:20 Kings grow in Ontario back at you with another unboxing so there's two items that I've purchased on Amazon I've purchased stuff on Amazon from this company before so what you got here is the only real the glare there it's really only marking on it that would tell you what it is so not that big very small you know an inch by whatever half an inch and then then another label on the side that just talks about the FBA the person who's doing it and whatever it is so this is the company that's actually making this but anyway start as you can see I've got a bubble bag washing machine and I said a bottle back so this is from bubble bag dude I will put a link into my description because I found that there's many different combinations of these things and for some reason some are more expensive than others there was a separate link for the bags which are here I'll pull these out we'll see what micron bags we got and a separate link for the washing machine together as a toy as a package was more expensive than buying them separately so I'm not sure what's going on with that but anyway so that's how it works so I'll make sure I give you guys the proper links so if you guys are interested in this you can get it at the at the rate that I got it at which is again cheaper for some reason separate so the bags are here I don't really want to tuck this open too much so I'll just rip it open here so what we got in here is just a little bit of those two kids always possible yeah a little carrying case and it says right on it bold bags waterproof new toys so someone's with a sticker guys logo look somewhere I guess comes with this little card some information and it comes with a five gallon 25 micron bag each bag is colored and like I said I've seen these these bags are fairly decent friend of mine has these and he's gone through them and he's use them quite a bit with no failure so that's why I went back with this company seems to be decent enough 25 bag a 73 micron bag 120 160 twenty-five sheet there for putting your stuff down on some cardboard and drying it out and last but not least the 220 back work bed so anyway so I'm going to do a video later of how I'm gonna make this stuff do some extractions there's a bunch of different ways to do it the bottomless bucket weighs probably probably the best way to go to let it drip through instead of sitting in the water so be on the lookout for that video it'll be after this clearly cuz I'm just getting it now and unboxing it out so yeah that's it for the bags put these off to the side now on to second item yeah that's a really big supposed to be a five gallon capacity all right so first away in the bag open it up styrofoam protection that looks good plastic covering around the Machine cell phone good down in there it looks like it's more styrofoam down at the bottom so let's get this out loaded onto the table all right wash the cover huh all right so we have the machine here you live well there we go you got the 25 so what is the fuss about six you twenty to twenty work bag pull this out little boy oh I'm gonna use this let's try it once I get it though another sticker another card to tell you issues so anyway so here's a two twenty bag that you can put all your material in right and just kind of put it in the machine so that it doesn't come out excuse me like I said I don't know I'd like to see the difference between using this and then not using the two twenty bag in the buckets see how that worked because it was me I think I want the material will be moving around in the washer as much as possible to get it to do what its thing is right so knees wash machine little information packets yeah this up a minute there's a drain hose that looks like a little rubber on one huh kind of a seal another one I've seen some videos of people using these well it was a little just troubleshooting here make sure it's not spinning work properly excuse me so yeah we'll see how that works but I've seen some people using these you know here's the here's the drain first thing I see does it go oh it's one of those corrugated things can't stuff get stuck in there so I think I'm gonna replace this tube for sure not only that a great Howard s got a nice little hook here what you can just drain it out once you're done right is the drain go into your bucket but what I've seen is a lot of people have issues with is filling this too full and then well you know once it's two-foot like filling in Thibodaux here somewhere because if it once it's here that's the level they are room starts spinning instructional I don't want to have that problem I want to go fill this thing up to where it is and have its best chance at doing it so let us look underneath here I'm gonna pull it apart I don't know how I'm gonna pull the party gonna see get in there and see where it goes but once I pull it apart maybe I'll do a video on that so I'm gonna replace that tube I want to take this out and give it something else I don't know how that's gonna happen I'm gonna have to pull it apart almost any other videos out there people doing it or not I just know I don't like that and I don't want to put an end on the top where I can cap it and maybe a valve or something and just release it go from there so how all those the one thing I've seen that a lot of videos but when I was buying this is people using it as that's not becoming an issue that that drain holes becoming issue so I don't want that to be an issue so anyways so it's got Bowl bag dude logo on here it's go-time ER just like a manual timer so it'll run for that long and then shut off so yeah pretty straightforward well what's left of them thank you for your purchase you hope you get to enjoy their products any questions contacts directly perfect so seems like yeah they are good for a certain thing so I guess that's the drain hole there it's got some don't let a bunch of material through so yeah hopefully need to run this in there I think I've take up a lot of room the ice and the water and stuff so anyways pretty straightforward came through doesn't look damaged everyone looks good there was a hole in the box but it was still good so yeah so all it is is a washing machine with a grain hopefully it's gonna make making bubble a lot easier alright guys so that's that's it for that all my stuff here I'm going to shrug this video down I don't know if I'll add it to this if I'll create a new video I don't know how much work it is to get that bottom off and redo that but I think I think I'm gonna want to do that I don't like that house I really don't don't like the spill ability and also the the this is a small house I wonder if he what's going on here Oh what's here what's going on I don't know what this hose is for I'm gonna have to look in the instructions and figure that out but yeah it's another courgette of hose - I don't know if it's meant to elongate dad or go somewhere else alright ladies and gentlemen that is the bowl bag washing machine and bubble bags themselves", "YUMZOQ-81Zc": "yo yo yo what's up everyone dank brown is coming through uh i'm gonna try something out going to [Music] try to make some dry ice bubble ash [Music] i've never done it before watched a few videos went out got some dry ice today i have a whole bunch of uh trim that i'm gonna be using and uh we'll get to that in one second i just gotta get the trim out sorry about the poor lighting [Music] it is what it is you know what i mean you know what i mean so let's give this a shot first i'm gonna break up some of this uh dry ice i came in a five pound brick of it so i got to break some of it up first or it's cold even having a glove next to it oh man i got a towel here to wrap the block up in try to break some of it a little bit here there we go we got a little bit of that broke so what i'm going to do bag of trim here get it open and i'm gonna put oh i'm gonna go ahead and put a a two to a 160 micron bag down into a five gallon bucket i'm gonna pull it up about halfway maybe or so so it leaves enough room to shake everything out into the bucket you can do this a couple different ways you can do this over a uh trim bin or into some other sort of bucket i'm gonna do it right into the five gallon bucket and scrape it out from the inside i'm gonna put the five gallon the trim in there i'm gonna put some of the dry ice put the bucket over the lid over give it some shakes and hopefully we'll see what we got let's start with our first little bit of trim here smell it even though it's frozen so i say right through the bag still this is a mix of gdp and blueberry all right put the gloves back on always make sure you got your gloves on when handling dry ice never never want to handle it without proper [Laughter] all right that should be good for this first batch starts to get it pretty quick hey jackie i am making some dry ice bubble hash sorry about the lighting guys i wish i uh knew how to fix it but so i've already got my product in the bag i've already got some dry ice in the bag so now i'm going to take the lid put it over you never want to you always want to make sure with dry ice you you leave some air it will make um a dry ice bomb and shake away i got the the bubble bag it's about four or five inches from the bottom what up bro it's making making uh trying to make oh oh my god instant trichomes there is trichomes covering no this is my first time jackie i've been watching videos left and right and the inside of this bag right now there's trichomes just covering the inside of this bag it is wicked i can't wait to see what's in the bottom of this bucket doing good bro it's awesome thanks for stopping by guys i appreciate it now i watched someone do this over um a trim bin and i kept thinking about all the stuff they were losing now when you're doing it over the trim bin that's it's open in the air and they were getting a lot of uh you could just see that it was everywhere not only were they breathing it in a little bit but it was just getting everywhere so i was thinking man they're losing a lot so i did a little more research and found this trick here with the bucket with the bag right inside the bucket made sense to me give my arms a second here and we'll go ahead and give this one more shake and then we'll see what i got out of it so far there's so much just on the sides you never seen this before dry ice yeah i just learned about it myself [Applause] it instantly freezes all the trichomes and it should technically sift through the micron bag into the bottom of the bucket i'm gonna do it once in a 160 micron and then i'm going to do it again in a 220 see what i get back there is just trichomes loaded on everything if you can see this there is trichomes covering it all right take the bag out for the first time see what we got hopefully it's worth the arm exercise oh my god guys yo scully what up homie how you doing bro good guys guys this is insane this is absolutely insane look at that pile look at that pile in there guys are you seeing what i'm seeing can you see all that in there look at all of it stuck to the side still holy cow oh my god grumpy bear look at this guys i am so shocked right now at how much just came back i've never seen anything like this dude i am floored yo you guys see that right i am floored right now i haven't seen anything like that before i seen what the guy got back on his run but man it's nothing like doing it right in front of you and the smell oh my god this smell is amazing now the hard part is getting it out of the bucket trumpy yes sir i see an aap's video and then i watched a few others just uh just to really really get a good feel for it before i went out and did it here are you guys ready to see this are you ready to see the super dead look at that pile i just got look at that and that was only off of one like uh a walmart bag half full of trim and about three pounds of dry ice i still have all that left in there but oh my god look at the color on it the color on this is perfect look at that blonde look at it that is nice nice blonde keefe right there that's going to hopefully be pressed into some hash i got to figure out how i'm pressing this but hopefully this is going to be pressed into some hash i can't believe this came back last time my last harvest i did a uh my last harvest i did bubble hash with ice water and ah super dad what up what up um yeah i hang out with aj and i think i've commented on a couple of your videos or something like that you had a giveaway i was in your uh chat the one day you did a bean giveaway super dad yeah so that was a mixture of how many uses for that stuff you know what scully i'm gonna do a second um i think i'm gonna dump it into a 220 micron bag and give it a second shake to see what i can get back off of it or should i leave it in the 160 you think i'm not sure but uh i know i got to give it a second shake i'm not that stuff's not done that was a mixture of gdp and blueberry that i just grew it's really really potent smoke the gdp is killer killer smoke so i'm hoping this hash is going to be amazing watch the color okay what do you mean don't do it too much so should i not do a second run i was just about to do a second run super dad what do you think i still have all this other plant material to do and i still have about a half a brick of my dry ice but i was gonna go another run on the gdp it gets greener the more you shake so don't mix it with the first run okay so keep them separated beautiful fresh clean plate it starts turning green then stop watch the color okay [Music] put the gloves back on because this [ __ ] is cold sorry about the lighting guys i'm down in my basement i'm not up at my desk like normal but i appreciate the uh the attendance guys this stuff is killer i can't believe the return so does anyone know what how to press this stuff properly i don't have a press machine um i do have access to a vice could i make some sort of mold and press it with a vise no dasher [Applause] that first batch is super super blonde there's it's not really green at all i just don't want to burn myself out i got a lot i got plenty to do left plenty left to do and a lot of ice left i do notice yeah definitely oh gotta try it man i had all this i had all this trim and a buddy of mine um a buddy of mine threw in from his grill and uh we're just gonna split it i'm doing the work so all right so my uh i'm noticing all my material is super fine and powdery now it's not anywhere near the material that i put it in um i'm guessing that means it's probably close to being done this run for this stuff oh yeah bro i'm not done yet i still like i said i still have about three pounds of dry ice left and i got another probably another pound of uh it's not even trim it's outdoor it was just some really shitty outdoor um that the buds didn't get real dense uh the color just was not dark on it it wasn't nice and green but it's got hella trichomes in it so why not give it a shot oh you know my sister trumpy you know diamond lady that's my sister i didn't know you know my sister that's awesome small world oh guys dude i got another massive pile uh let's see how this stuff came out color wise from what i can see even though it's in a dark dark uh gallon bucket from what i can tell it looks kind of green well honestly guys i can't tell the difference that's awesome trumpy she's a she's an amazing amazing woman i love my sister she's the only one out of the three that i keep in contact with really dude i'm so excited i got sweat dripping you know what to be really honest i can't tell the color difference it's dark in my basement but there's really not much of a difference from that yeah there is never mind oh sweet did she really oh good sis no she gave me uh ap and someone else's you must be this the other one right down my sister's awesome this is all this is all because of her she helped me uh get this going with aap ap sent me some beans maybe i got some beans from you too trumpy i'm not really sure it's been a year now and i'm a major stoner all right so let's move on to the outdoor this stuff like i said is really tricoming it's got a lot of trichome in it but the color of it it was just it was just crappy outdoor that's all you know what i mean just some crappy outdoor all right now i gotta figure out how i'm gonna go from one bucket to the next all right i can just dump that all in here a second here guys getting ready for this next run i'm gonna do a fresh run here should probably go get a couple more paper plates tap it out on and then you're gonna just separate that though so i get to keep what i just did the first stuff is all mine the first batch i did is free and clear all mine that was from my harvest now the second batch i'm doing since i'm putting in the work i'm keeping probably like a 60 40 split on it i know my stuff had a lot more trichomes it was a lot more dank weed this stuff i'm not really sure so i think i'm going to go a little heavy on the product and a little lighter or a little heavier on the ice too than that first run bear with me guys sorry i'm not paying attention to chat right now all right oh damn i almost dumped the whole thing in there by accident whoops that's right that'll just be enough to tap her off i guess oh hell might as well just dump it all in right down get all off there this has been an adventure guys thank you for sharing it with me bigger chunks of ice left over from the other one i'm gonna go ahead and toss in here i don't want to really waste any of the ice it was expensive let's go let's do this round three to make sure that when you do this and you're using a lid you want to make sure that you don't seal that lid completely tight it will blow up you want to make sure you have a little bit of air to make sure no back pressure is building it's a little tiring but no different than bubble hash i did my bubble hatch by hand last time instead of using a uh drill bit to mix the ice and water i did it by hand and that was a pain in the butt this isn't no worse or any better i mean all right let's see what the first little bit killed us oh that stuff broke down real fast and there's a lot more a lot more teeth all around the inside of this the inside of the bag has so much keith on it it's crazy let's see what we got on this one guys uh god there's so much on the sides of that well safe to say i got more back off of mine pure goodness yes sir i definitely got more back off of my indoor than i did this outdoor this is a better color though i think i don't know that's that this has got kind of a yellowish color to it it's not really green but it's not blonde either it's more yellow i'll show you in a second here uh oh the smell on that is so nice god there's a lot of this stuff in here well guys first run look at this outdoor is green yeah i know trumpy that's the outdoor right there compared to that nice blonde color of my indoor well that's only the first run i'm gonna go ahead and uh get another one in here wondering if i shouldn't bump it up to uh 220 micron what do you think if i bumped it up to a 220 micron do you think i'd get a little more back on this uh second run try it yeah too big you think stick with the 160. i think i still got a bunch more in here i think i just didn't shake it well enough yet i use all the different sizes right um super dad when have you done it this way with the dry ice i know when i make bubble hash with ice and water i definitely um use the different bag sizes i wasn't sure doing it this way if i should though i think i'm just going to go ahead and give it one more shake in this 160. i half-ass want to just combine everything i have left into this last shake matter of fact that seat is cold where i had that lid 160 seems to be a sweet spot yeah i'll tell you what what it's producing right now man that first run is so blonde i can't wait wait to smoke that i can't wait to get into that first run what do you guys think about mixing everything i have left for this last run i have it separated i have everything separated on different plates um can't hurt nothing right figure one last hurrah get all you can out of it yeah so [Laughter] do make edibles with the greener stuff what's easier to make simple sugars is it easier to make simple sugars or is it easier to make like a can of oil with coconut oil i'm weak i know don't judge me alright guys hey give my arms a second here oh with that just dump it right into the brownie mix okay that's easy enough right down into the mix uh if you look at my instagram dank underscore brownies 11 i have a picture of a s'mores brownie i just made about two weeks ago with canner butter i should have put the recipe because it came out awesome ganja wizard yeah brody check this this was the first run that was run number one ganja that was run number two this is run number three

to go take a shower that first run yeah that blonde yeah buddy that is where it's at right there there's so much so much keep on the inside of this lid i don't even know what to do with how to get it

from the grow I'm right now I'm just hurrying up and showing you guys this I'm gonna show you guys the next batch that I make more detailed and we're also gonna make some canna guards today so we got a lot going on for you guys see that the bags right here 25 microns however started off 4573 we got the 8 bag kit autozone is gonna help us out today you know how it goes and when we dry it off I'm gonna show you guys the scooping the emptying process all that so uh I will be back I just wanna let you guys know we're starting off the day pretty raw we've already got some categories packed in there guys we're gonna roll those out and see how it goes let's get it welcome back guys just got done the first trial of my Koenig are rolling it came out alright just rolled the leaf in it everything my Roland's a little my tying process is a little [ __ ] up first time we're only categories guys but although the research has paid off I just need to see if it's gonna work now so we'll let him dry up for uh I'm anxious I probably just a day or two and we'll uh try them out leave that standing tall tell you the edges it's the bottom just the top say what they look like before my utensils just nice little around perfect cigars I say it made from the finest wheat so uh well that's what we're doing right now so take it easy guys I'm gonna get back to getting back to what I'm doing still got to get that uh bubble hash all out of here let it wash for about 15 minutes do a spin cycle for 15 minutes and now I'm just letting it all settle it's been settling for about ten minutes so I'm gonna start pouring about you know what you guys get to witness that right now because you're here while I'm about to do it so so all you do now map your specimen anything that's been settling for a little while get your gold baby so make sure you don't spill anywhere my guy just did so make sure you don't spill everywhere I just spilled everywhere but if I get lost a little bit I'll clean that up just let it drain out into your bags shut it all today no it's real cold coming out real cold going in foamy that means you did good let me get ated it enough when you get that phone now because I'm gonna do another run out some freshmen cereal I'm not gonna stress about getting every last drop out of there just yet plus I want to clean that spot up so i'ma let y'all go real quick I got to do my thug thizzle oh I gotta clean up cuz I'm [ __ ] up right now and we're gonna get back to rolling can of gars get back to running counter guards and everything's gonna be good life is looking lovely right now peace out everybody so this is the most fun part empty not your bag just see what's in there I've already got some good stuff here a little bit of yield from both sides of spectrum there so it's alright um well me I've done one two runs so far get them out you just gonna scrape it up you know I'm going to show you guys a bag real quick if I can probably count on one hand so I'll show you guys what I do to get that little bit of stuff in the middle cuz I have one handy I set it in the [ __ ] sea and then just wash it out you just wash it out now you're not washing away the weed or washing away the impurities that don't fit through the screen see how concentrated more into the middle now now all I do is take it here and get my spoon and just scrape it up that's it sound easy Bubba hash is that easy there's a little tiny bit on there then you just take it over here well on your pile corresponding with the micron bag that you took it from some people just like to mix it all the way I try to keep some different grades as you can see it gets lighter it gets lighter as we're going down to the smaller micron bags this is 220 these are I think 160 and 120 this is 90 I believe or this is 90 and this is 120 one of those two anyways so just on you guys what's going on about to get back to it still got some more sit inside of the washer so I'll show you guys how I pour it out and everything will get it going okay peace out yo what's going on everyone back again sorry I didn't make a video about the bubble hash getting poured into the buckets or too much scraping as well I didn't have any free hands to do that sorry I didn't do the kenig our actual rolling videos but uh you got a couple of counter guards now we got a can of garden here this is Koenig or hash and whatever else it's Koenig our hash this is a gelato flower gelato sift hash Keef all rolled into one messed up a little bit on some of them my eyes my stuff not focusing right now anyway he's messed up a little bit on some of them but for the most part we got it down this might be the best one because it's all freakin mummified wrapped we'll find out when they um finish caring when I leave them in there for a week let them do their thing and that's pretty much it that's all we can do leave those right there hopefully they all stick together and hold very well I can't wait to try one anyways just wanna let you guys know what's going on got a chance to spray the babies they're looking good right now these are all the least ones over here on all of the seeds that we popped different seeds these those are the clones everything's looking good just got a get it to the next one next step I just want to give you guys a quick update real quick all right well it's gone to grow gardens signing out have a wonderful rest of your week take it easy Andros something for your boy I'm about to throw me something regular real quick little Swisher you know I'm saying but I got the hash when I got the hash though I got the hash so we're in the game babe anyways hope you have a wonderful rest few weeks take it easy guys do you think peace out", "Pkw1nkZqG9I": "hello everyone serious here with Grove Edie calm and we have nebula behind the camera hi everyone and today we're going to be making dry ice hash so what is drive hash well hash is just a collection of resin like scraping the good sticky stuff off your cannabis and kind of putting into a pile and you have hash dry ice hash is just making that hash with dry ice that solid is using dry ice to extract that sticky stuff off the weed and into a pile that's all it is and so the benefits of this is that using dry ice is easier the whole process will be much quicker and also you get more in product so good stuff and using dry acids actually really safe as long as you're aware of a few things there's four rules I use so let's go through those real quick and we'll make sure that you do have a very easy time doing this rule number one make sure that you do this in a well-ventilated room to make sure that you do not put dry ice into an airtight container you'll just blow the lid off of it three don't touch it with your bare hands gloves are essential and for when you're done with the dry ice don't try to flush it or put into your kitchen sink you'll free the water pipes which we want to do is just get the drives when you're done with it and just put into a well-ventilated area and it will sublimate mean turn from a solid into a gas directly and they will just kind of float away outside and that's it all right so now we know those let's go over the stuff we're going to need to get this whole thing done so we need a five-gallon bucket it's all in your face there Britany dry ice this is what this stuff looks like you can see it coming off there I'm really cold we need gloves to handle the dry ice or just to be safe with it make sure it's not touching your skin we need a flat surface we have a table here some plexiglass stuff taped to it so it doesn't move at all we need a scraping tool this is a brand new paint scraper but a credit card will work in a pinch going to need some products I'm THC Laden product it means what trim dry trim or in our case we have about 2 ounces of dried and cured and ground-up blue Auto Mazar and they show you that real quick there you go it's been ground up really fine so it's kind of oh really stinky and lastly we have bubble bags also sometimes called - bags or the local hydrosol some pollen collection bags but essentially you're going to need these and a today we have using three sizes this one is 73 and this is the main one and that's because all this catches is resin nothing else so this makes the really clean stuff everyone likes so much then we're also going to use 160 and then also a 220 just to collect the rest of the stuff that is definitely good stuff it's just not as Pierce as 73 but in my opinion is definitely worth collecting so that's what we're going to do alright so now that we have everything I think we have it we everything like together right yeah we do alright so let's go ahead and combine this stuff and then get some dry patch made alright so we have all our materials ready let's make some magic happen all right so let's get this started we're going to go ahead and get the actual the cannabis that we ground up we're just going to toss it in there there you go get rid of that next we're going to get our dry ice there you go we're going to toss that right in there okay that's good too alright now we're going to do is get this bag this is the size 73 bags you definitely to do this one first I'm just going to simply slip it over the bucket a little bit and I have to go all the way down there you go that's good so now we're going to get this we're going to shake it for about a three to four minutes so let's go and do that now who did you poo-poo all right according to my lady arms that should be about four minutes then put this here for just a second I'm going to wipe off this little spot here get all that moisture off there her dick still cold under there but I think we're going to be alright okay so now we're going to take this so we've been swirling around for all that time you're going to turn the bag upside down make sure you get it all out of there there now pull the bucket out and we're going to kind of put this over here on this side I'm gonna gather all this together and it's going to shake it over our surface kick top okay taut so I think that's about good so you want to take this material and you want to dump it back into the bucket because you're not done with it just yet so I'm going to go ahead and do it off on a side here all right take off this glove and now I think it's going to be fun let's do this if we good see that but we're going to scrape some of my stuff together and that looks fun I think it was fun collecting candy oh look at that huge chunk they got stuff their optical back and get him but as you can see this was not a taxing process whatsoever just kind of shaking a bag for a few minutes and this is what we end up with I'm going to clean the rest here I'm going to leave that there for you that's the 73 this is the stuff that people are looking for when they're trying to get ashes the pure stuff this is just resin just a sticky stuff off of your cannabis and the best part is this is just a part of what you can get that's stuff that we just use we're gonna do the same thing again or in this case you could do the same thing and if you don't want to go any further you can just keep this or you can get the 160 bag and then put it right back on there and use the same material and you'll get more stuff out it won't be this pure but it will be good I can tell you that for sure so it looks like we're all set here I'm going to leave you to do the 116 or 220 or just to enjoy your 73 all by itself if you want more tips and tricks and tutorials in order to grow it easy calm and we'll see you later have a good one music in all over the table you see that", "kBu2G1-upTU": "okay so if they were making hash bricks have two bowls 47 grams of Bruce Banner keep two bowls of 45 grams gold and ice aluminum brick and a couple of these parchment pieces brick is presses a brick of hash perfectly take a spoon take our key oh my cause on us so very pretty stuff press it down press it into the corners to the edges gently this is a fluffy Keith takes up a lot more space than it usually does and every strain is different can you grab me a business card kind of just flatten it out on the top roll around the edges this is because you want to be able to tuck your parchment into these edges nice type of cover battle machine in search ii parchment drop the top of the brick very carefully say you know ship the parchment around we lost about a third of a gram right there but such as like things happen give it a good squeeze we're gonna wrap it a couple of sheets of paper towel and we were going through our vise Jimmy because it will not fit into our press unless we clamp it with everybody so I'll be back in just a minute one all right so we're starting with our brick this thick and we are going to squeeze it down until it is about half as thick squeeze it hand tighten the vise at room temp flip it over just so this is even as we can make it and then it's back to the heat press it's now that thick so we have our heat press heated up to 105 degrees ours only presses on the bottom so we have to keep it sealed to get heat to transfer to the top and because it only heats on the bottom we're gonna take the thick chunk of our plate and put that on the bottom that's where most of the heat needs to penetrate this top plate is much thinner and much easier for heat to just pass right through so it'll go on the top side which is warm but doesn't have the doesn't have the extra power that the bottom side has this will lose its heat very quickly we only have it up to 105 degrees because we don't want to squeeze our our hash out through the sides this will want to retain a nice brick form we wanted to only really hash over on the outer layers and have the inside remained remain as a pristine as possible so before I run and I want to show you what it looks like well I guess I can't this papers aren't your type it was very tan yeah it's a very blonde and yellow when we put it in open the press fixing it on the bottom Center it in the press lever shut I always forget yeah to make sure it's nothing it's not squeezing too far give about 15 seconds and then you're gonna pull it out and it should be a darker color with a really nice gummy consistency something kind of like oh I don't know yeah something like that now these little blocks often get stuck if they do you can use where's my little rubber string use one of these little things to get up in there kind of force the park I didn't take a lot did it down to parchment one does two fingers push it down a little bit the other side two fingers in the corner and fold it up okay very clean you get a look closely camera yeah not a lot of residue at all it's good brick has been sufficiently cooked trim up the edges a little should you do that with a knife but don't want to cut your little papers cuz these things take forever to make and there you go oh wow yeah break a hash and a consistency go a little lower with your hands there you go oh yeah what kind of smell would you just go coming off that very high and carry off lean carry a filing tomato tomahto very high in Mersin kinda like cheesy mm-hmm grandma's Bistro mouth mm-hmm yes that's how we make a hash brick awesome and then for chopping so plate clean this is for chopping we just have it Oh first we should weigh it we going wreck it this brick weighs 47 grams pretty much every brick weighs 47 I'm sure those chocolate we I set it long ways yeah something like that tell is epic and then yeah it's chopped but we want to do that here at here as well yeah thanks a lot elbow grease doesn't it oh yeah whole lot of love goes into this product if you are a consumer and we're unaware takes me a whole lot of blood sweat and tears to make your tasty hash there's no real blood here but yeah hopefully no sweat yeah making some nice tootsie rolls huh yeah this stuff stuff is quite gummy it's very easy sometimes it's kind of powdery doesn't want to cut up very easy every stream behaves differently and also ending on how old it is how cold it is ki prefers to be cooled and also just the different temperatures at which you press this break out if you use no heat it will not really form up into this gummy consistency a more powdery want to fall right apart to use too much heat it'll turn black nasty and might squeeze up out the sides of your press all sorts of problems this looks like chocolate doesn't so yeah break me off a piece of that fat hash bar seriously oh yeah a little farther down there yeah beautimous ha and yeah that's how we make it that's how we make it guys and won't you tell the folks who you are I'm Josh I'm the processor here tops off campus for a little while longer this is my keys my process hey guys I'm Mike thanks for watching if you like to see please like share and subscribe we love you Josh", "ToRtiCbiCJE": "what up YouTube coming to you live from Tokyo Florida a little additional content some different took a step out of the flower room and came upstairs to show you what the [ __ ] I got going on up here so let's see here is the bubble hash that I have made the last run pretty nice we have 129 T 7345 25 micron this is the first run this is the second round and these have all kind of falling together all I know is that this is the 73 and this is the 25 I don't know what the difference between those three is like they got mixed up and they obviously don't know so but anyway I concentrate on the first run so what I mean my first runs like a run for those like you don't know run your trim once through your bags and then do it again the second time pretty simple so here we have the 90 a little green but nice and flexible bubbles really nice not not a full melt but definitely definitely throws off some nice bubbles so there's that one I'm going to go quick because I already shot this video once and it went to 15 minutes and three seconds which means I can't upload it because I can only do 15 minute videos so here we have 73 micron which I broke for the last video but there's the inside of it when was that here is 45 from the first run which this is absolute foam out there was only a tiny little bit of it though it was probably out of four times the size of this but obviously it's not going to last forever around here this is token re Florida let's how we do it so look at sparkles sparkles like diamonds so there's that one here is slightly my hands a very chapped grocery here is Lou 25 my craft so pretty sparkly and then that's the second round and stuff which is more of probably just when you use that as the top around a bowl something like that's usually what I do I just got scrapped a little bit or you know break a little bit of it off because it's not this dust real bendy pliable you know gummy kind of sticky not sticky but gummy like it's good squishes you know I don't want to squeeze it because I don't like to press my hash but this left a little more drag not quite as bendy this one's kind of bandy second round and then here's the 25 a little psycho on [ __ ] a dog sparkly even from the second run so yeah stuffs real nice real tasty get over here to the next thing just wanted to show you guys some buds this is two-headed monster from the original seed run this has been curing for a few months and it will be caring for a few more months or a couple more months until the Denver cannabis cannabis cup which I will be attending on april twentieth and twenty-first I'm not entering but I will be there super [ __ ] excited just kind of made a decision to do it go to drive there it's the first actual cannabis cup that doesn't have a medical attached to it in the title in America so pretty excited for that I think it's pretty cool oh yeah look at the sparkles this two-headed monster is no [ __ ] so if you are in Denver for the cannabis cup will have this at that time it'll be almost six month cured ounce to share smoke let people try so woo mean nice bugs they're all real dance is nice just bowls it's just so frosty so I have that here we have L alcoholic absorbers we have L alchemy stuff from the Sidra I put this paper down to help but I actually think it [ __ ] hampers think the dark the background needs to be dark but not so great sitting with super crunchy if you watch my previous videos I called the captain crunch the family [ __ ] thing was absolutely just a mess I don't know what I did wrong but so there's that jar of that just now to that I'm in here next to it I wanted to show well I could do this I can do a side-by-side here is alchemy alchemy stuff from the that's not a manner that is a leaf but this is from the clone run yeah much nicer definitely improved when you look at them side-by-side they're not even the same color they do however smell identical they don't taste identical but they do smell identical and the smell on that is life savers original original five flavor 5-pack not the current one where I think they have [ __ ] green apple on their back from when we were [ __ ] kids because i'm not going to disclose my age to you guys but i am a i'm well into my adult years let's just say that so I remember when the original five pack had lime in it so this one this smells like that original five pack of lifesavers when you first ripped open that little wax string to pull out your first lifesaver that smell that wafts up into the air the this is it that's exactly what this [ __ ] smells like after it scared it smelled like apples when I was growing it I mean not like Apple I mean like apple candy without the sour smell but now that it's cured [ __ ] the smells of lifesavers okay moving on so then here we have two headed monster from the clone run this was the first clone run that I did nice and frosty sparkly sparkly find a better putter there here we go and normally just so you guys know you I would not be handling these buds I don't know the people that get this herb my you know their patients and normally I would not be handling these but these jars not all of them but they'll be coming with me to the cannabis cup so these are my own head stache jars so I don't mind handling these but normally trimming everything gloves all the time never handle the buds with my bare hands so that's just for I don't know I mean I'm not dispensary or anything but it out of I tried to do this for the right reasons and I try to do it the right way so whether I live in an actual medical state or not I will leave that up to your imagination whether I actually live in Florida or not I will leave that up to your imagination this is hash plant haze so this is the most recent one taken down nice lemony smell slight lemon taste just not even not I would I don't want to say has a lemon taste it has an earthy taste with a slight lemon undertone and it's not even fruity at all it's very earthy smell or a very earthy tasting of course it has no cure on it yet so I can't really speak of what it will turn out when it's cured because honestly it does make a big difference but nice and frosty trichome heads are really small on this one but the buzz is great to first it's a really good day time I grow mostly indica dominant strains so it's nice to throw us teve in there and have something to smoke during the day and seiko you know completely motivated and level-headed so just you know takes the pain away takes your anxiety away whatever whatever you need this for even if you just use it for recreational purposes only I don't care I think everybody should definitely indulge in this but you know our government uh I don't know has [ __ ] chastised this point for some reason and I have absolutely no [ __ ] reason I have no clue why makes no sense it's probably just because they know that they can't make money off of it and we could all grow our medicine in our own basements yeah I mean obviously doesn't work for everything in no I'm not one of the people that believes that this cures cancer in no way shape or form I think that it cures cancer but I do think it helps with the symptoms that come along with what comes along with cancer so that's why I do this you guys like that sudden previous videos my grandmother's a survivor breast cancer survivor one of my good buddies mom just had a double mastectomy she is also a breast cancer survivor so that's why I do this you know you can say whatever you want do it for profit blah blah blah blah blah but I don't I mean I could you know this is really good quality bud that I grow here and I could really get top dollar for it if i sold it out on the street but i don't choose to live my life that way so I do this because I love this plant I personally love to smoke it I smoke it from my own reasons I smoke it for recreation I smoke it for pain and I smoke it for anxiety so there's my reasons and I would just like to say the government is wrong please take it off the schedule 1 it has absolutely no [ __ ] business being there you know it we know it anybody that has ever smoked this plant knows it anybody that appreciates what comes along with this plant joy happiness it brings you know if they know but about to go over 15 minutes here so anyway I just wanted to shoot some additional content you know give you a little insight to how i feel about some [ __ ] so live from token reef florida and i'm out", "9XwbSz7RwUY": "hey there welcome back everybody this we're gonna be checking out some of this fire on the mountain just do a quick little review on it and get a little Stoney on and just ramble a little bit I was gifted this by bubble modes this is their in-house down there at Northwest alchemy their in-house trains it's not a strain called fire on the mountain I believe they're mixing two strains together about hundred percent sure what they are I think it's the fire alien that's where the fire comes from and then I thought it was deadhead but I don't I don't see how that relates to on the mountain in any case they're mixing two strains together as fresh frozen they're watching them they called it fire on the mountain this is the 73u six star is what it says on the lid I do know that this was their doped-up entry this year yeah I don't think it won any awards maybe it did I think they did end up getting an award after the fact but I think this had highest turps two out of anybody's stuff down there alright sticking out from find a piece of parchment paper here piece of white parchment that is so work if you guys want more melt make sure to check out a couple other videos on the channel always melt enough some hash and talking about it I got pretty good response from the sh o the video that we did last time so look forward to another one of those I definitely have some more to review and I have some of my own that I would probably just poof let's take a look at this mmm the smell is absolutely delicious it's got a lemony og real strong lemony smell to it see if I can get a nice close-up of this stuff I'm on Betsy be nice to me today very nice Golden Nugget goodness I believe this was microplaned that kind of looks chunky though like it would be sieved but pretty sure bubble modes micro planes all right it's been out of the fridge for a little while it seems pretty stable which is awesome we do up maybe a little bit got back in some nice cold air as a battle hit who's it fire on the mountain nice juicy juicy juicy pieces this thing is actually doing a decent job of focus and today I'm just going to fold that right in half there give it a couple finger presses our trusty hair iron out still use a little blue here it's real getting real reliable for me I grabbed this at at Target for 18 bucks or something like that I'm working real well no issues at all a couple of dabs wonderful work you I can already smell it Oh Lord it's just very very pungent annoying just super lemony a great job with this stuff I'm actually excited to try this again a little bit more uniformed that's true the paper here Oh there we go get a nice fatty going here oh not that one wasn't a fatty nice thick piece I should deliver a very massive hit well clean the snail off here she's fat hash it's off this thing yesterday was a five-star though so they got a lot of residue on this nail that we did that back it's real turkey hatch for sure wasn't perfect but very flavorful we were just dabbing extra time now which always makes a bit of a mess all right see if we can get a milk shot all right get it the fire on the mountain Cheers that smoke was just trying to run away you gonna pull it ma'am the flavor is absolutely amazing exactly what I expected super potent Wow definitely sweats from that one's a pretty nice size one yeah real lemony I think I can get more of that fire oh gee coming through but it really is nice mix I can see why everybody's loving it so much super potent Wow definitely definitely sweating awesome awesome awesome stuff obviously needs to go back in the fridge and start Nikki grease up on me nice lemony lemony super lynnie pledge flavor very pleasant a little bit of sweetness a little bit of OD God if you ever see them drop this stuff I would recommend grabbing some you won't be disappointed especially if you're in OT lover check those guys out at Northwest alchemy places got a lot of good hash awesome looks great glad to have this stuff out again I got a little hitter for later yeah let's see it seems pretty pretty stable for how juicy it gets really nice awesome really happy with this stuff I want to sleep some more alrighty well I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll catch you next time", "s-Id7GBNGgk": "so back game today late night got inspired to do a video just a little while ago the person commented in one of my videos but well my previous video actually said they like make my nectar collector and all that nectar collector family Jackie for 20 I'll leave a link in the description down below for his channel and all that it's pretty cool it gots a lot of it different kinds of videos weed smoking videos game videos some music Inca videos I'm gonna and check them out its chemical but I checked out one of his weed stuff videos and his playlist weed stuff he was pressing out some live rosin from from some hash with some coffee filter and I decided to go ahead and give that a shot myself a little bit of twist on my end this is piece of a coffee filter cut out myself the rest of it prove it hmm sit down for a minute here it's not Keith there's some ground up really hard hash that I had got here to prove it still got some chunks in there I'm tiny chunk a hash it's really dry some of this just turns into powder next Elaine here my fingers oh yeah yeah let me see if I came in see ya not really no but it's breaking up into a powder just in my fingers breaking up like that but I'm gonna take that no Keith no I didn't get all that from that no go ahead keep in here before I was trying to save it to make video making some moon rocks but I'll do that later Keith I'm gonna mix the two coffee filter in this turn give a shot that way get it all together and just like in their video you want to make this into kind of a puck yeah you can do that a couple different ways just by taking the parchment paper like I have here getting it sent up and then just end most part you usually press it together you can see their eyes and hold them in shape and then tell us it back and forth I [Music] said there's gonna be a little bit of a twist because I'll have a hair straightener to help me on this one so I'm gonna be using a torch and one of my old grinders I'm gonna see how well that works out this is a silicone mat that I've got a while back and just using that keep everything off the table you had a hair straightener that's been going a little bit easier because applying that he would start melting the Turpin teens and the all the others to compounds and they're together to form into a puck a little bit better than just pressing it like I am two seconds and go get my silicon glue [Music] this final press here I'm gonna be taking the old grinder I'm gonna be using when you heat it up just a little bit not to get a little bit warmer than warm I'm just using the glove just to be on the safe side heat resistant silicone gloves take that get a nice fit and press that down over there now it's not that I can bear to grab with my hand I just use the glove to be on the safe side with the torch well it's not a solid of a puck that they had in the video but I want to go with it anyways take all that but in the center of the coffee filter actually broke it up a little bit but that's okay I'm still gonna make it work in the coffee filter yeah it doesn't look very pretty he didn't say it look very pretty in the video either but it worked so I wanted to let him give a [ __ ] got some dried hash Keith in there Clayton parchment paper to put that right middle if you have a hair straightener available I highly recommend using that instead then you can apply heat from both sides or than one side at a time you wouldn't want your hair hair straightener very high like low and medium setting okay Chris I said not to start Mary alright I started a little hard I'm gonna cheat tear off a little bit cut off a little bit of this excess filter torture like this as you saw it flipped it over like I said hair straighteners because then you can apply heat rent it from both sides at the same time since either basic idea of what I'm doing I'm just gonna go ahead and skip ahead to the finished product well skip ahead for you guys not for me but see you something just quick recap here in the middle it's starting to press out you can see that ring there I just took it back out real quick to show you how it's turning out I'm gonna go ahead and put that back in keep pressing I cut off some of the excess paper here because I realized it was a little too thick of a cup cover replace that keeps pressing hopefully it comes back just wanted to give you a recap of what I did no not necessarily recap I guess but let you know what I did okay so I got nothing Kibby because I used too little of an amount I had a too spread out not enough enough of a stack to be able to press down on itself that's highly possible not enough compression maybe I'll try it again when I have more maybe not after re-watching the video I realized how I realized the yield amount based on the size of the to Keith bucks that he was using yeah not bad about the same yield percentage that you'd get from blowing wax in the first place but I would assume so close to you probably but I didn't get anything through my pressing probably just poor equipment poor material anyway I [ __ ] up but in a previous video I tried to press wet hash into devil go wax my issue there before my hash was too dry like I tried to use here I got some more roundish here more bubble hash you can see that no this one's not dry at all I can press it Nick forms pretty easily and all that it's pretty sticky I'm gonna be pressing that into some hash real quick and almost press it with just your fingers clean parchment paper reapplied granny's already kind of one time that I hope for too long don't want very hot when you press it out anyways you know hash when you press it out like that would heat you don't you can't just open up the paper right away cuz they just won't that work you gotta call it off you look like it's in the freezer cold table cold I mean there anything to cool it off I'm gonna pause and be right back then I'm gonna go pull it off real quick what hit the something cold I have in the freezer alright back one more time cooled it off in the freezer you can see looks almost like chatter it was a success this time bigger chunk of the bubble hash yeah that started with same soft texture sticky finished press product close to death didn't break a tool I got a tool comes out just like shadow I had to grab a rig if you're curious what strain that hatch was it's a sour pineapple diesel first time step Cheers mmm tasty we be hashey almost a little stale but it's still good mm-hmm well did you like the video give it a thumbs up like I said I didn't get that rosin pressing idea from my own hat I got it from Jackie 4:20 I'm gonna be leaving a link in the description down below for his channel probably for the video that I pulled it up from too but at the very least I wanna put a link in the description for his channel go check him out a lot of cool videos on his channel yeah I'm just giving him a shout out because that's where I got the idea from yeah but success on pressing hash this time I like it thumbs up like it more share it don't like it I'm sorry I'm here to please some people but not everyone see you next time peace", "WlngHtOun44": "okay so this is the bday yeah that's your the moneybags money bag we like to call it you said the b grade is more flavorful no captures more of the truth we just want to pour lobe I had to pour the iced out yeah I think some customers on the REC market don't know like why it's a B or C grade so this is kind of interesting it's it's microns way yeah it's mike micron size is what the microbes capture the trichome heads there's a larger ones on smaller one so what are the 3 micron sizes here oh this one is is 160 mm this one here is 73 and then the money bag is 25 that was cool

in it's bigger than our old machine and I believe you'll get bigger yields than you did with our machine that we had before this is the new machine let me show you the old machine you can see the different size this is our old machine this was a six gallon and you can see how much bigger this machine is when it's the same price but just a bigger machine and even if you say well maybe I don't need a machine this big well it's nice to have a machine it's a little bit bigger because you might grow into it in the future let me show you what comes with it full instructions to show you how to use the machine it comes with a field line you connect to the top here and then you connect to your faucet and that allows you to fill the machine with water be careful do not overfill the machine right now I'm filled to about right here I wouldn't go any more than halfway because you still have to put ice and then you have to put product plus it's going to melt some and you don't want it coming out at the top so we'll word to the wise what else comes with it is our 220 micron bag it's got a zipper young zip add product add some ice as well zip it up we've got a little string here you can put it through the zipper handle and tie it shut that means absolutely your products not going to come out of it and then we have a little flap that you can flip down as well okay now I'm going to demo the machine for you just take a little bit about it you might find the cheaper machine online but cheaper does not mean better that's for sure this machine I have it custom-made just that you used to make bubble I have a special motor put in here as a copper motor it's more expensive it'll last a lot longer if the machine was to get hot because you had too much ice in it and it's struggling and it shut down this copper motor you let it cool off and it will restart right back up a lot of machines don't have the copper motor and they won't last as long now to demo the machine okay this is your drain line right here you take this off thread into a sink or excuse me bring it into your bags which you'll have a five gallon bucket like this with your bags layered in them you have to buck it a little bit lower and you just drain the water when you're finished into the bucket through your bags okay I've already added some water in it now I've got about this much water in it but you know you can always I you know just add some old water as needed be careful you don't want to overfill it or of course you can use plenty of ice don't use so many so much I set the machine can't turn can't turn the ice this is one small bag right here that I just added you might need more or less than just two pens now you can see it without up to this level next thing you would do is you would take your 220 microns upper bag that comes with the machine and you fill it for your product and put some ice in it and then submerge it into the machine close the top and then you have a timer here let you set it for three six nine twelve and fifteen minutes we suggest 15 minutes what you do to the end what I'm going to do now is I'm going to take the camera off the tripod and I'm going to give you a close-up of the machines you can see how powerful it is and how good it turns the ice and water to just bear with me if the camera Wiggles a little bit and I'll give you more of a close-up of the machine you see that there's the timer and here's the machine here's the ice and the water and I'm gonna turn it on a little bit might splash out one way I just wanted to give you a demo on how that work it's a very powerful machine and when I have it built I have it set to turn at a certain speed and for how long it'll turn one way and how long they don't turn the other way a lot of the machines you see online will just spit in one way this is much better by spinning you know one way and then in the opposite direction but it's simple to use if you have any questions just drop me a line their own eBay and I'll be glad to answer any questions you have thanks for watching the video", "86PTjfOT09U": "hey guys welcome to this video I'm going to be doing some dry sift my making into hash as well I'm not sure and I would that's kind of the plan I mean do this bit differently than I've done it before I've been watching a few other people learning and yeah we're gonna do differently so stop nicely 1:24 bag [Music] lucky for me that's a nice perfect fit over the bowl all right so I've got popcorn and trim sugar leaves and all sorts in there these are from my last couple of runs three bags here a lot of sense eat in here longs to Amsterdam genetics and some various others so it's gonna be a nice combination so this has all been dried well dried now and dried and cured at gas really has been dried for a few months yeah fair few months and then the last two days I've had it out in two and I had it in them in paper bags so just to get it bone bone bone dry as you can and then it's been in the freezer for the past 24 hours so bad forget slide on it I want to do this quickly because I don't want it to warm up so Wow while this is cold basically you know you can just you just see you just see them falling off because it's so nice and brittle so yeah so I'm going to work on this I'm going to work on this really quick and it's not gonna not going to take me too long you okay then guys and you might noticed I just started doing that I realized that I could see as the trim was getting warmer it went flying officer court case that's why whacked the other backs back in the freezer and just gotten that when I needed them okay so let's have a look this could be really embarrassing let's have a look and say I'm not look at all I did have a peak at the beginning and then I didn't okay so I'm gonna take this off and hopefully we're gonna be left with something nice and you can see that okay now then right don't look at it now it was just quite my brush then we can see this is just uh just one of my cooking brushes a pastry brush basically oh we can scan you say I managed from around the edges and correcting it in the bottom then we can get it order together a bit and then we can see what the color is a bit better copy that I've got to say [Music] pretty good huh okay what I'll do I'll get it out and I'll wake up and we can see what we've got so there we go if you can see that 3.33 I can zoom in on this so this is like the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me basically I didn't mix it long literally each handful had maybe two three minutes if that if that is it clumping up already as well work yeah obviously the mistake I made and I do realize that is that I got my gloves ready and then forgot to put them on so I've got it all over my hands ridiculous yeah rookie mistake but there we go okay um not sure if I've been doing anything else with it I think I might just just just leave it like that for now okay guys thanks very much Cheers", "QR9hz7ihYu8": "hey guys I'm gonna make some bubble washer in this video I got some product here from a friend gave me this stuff I think he said it was some shake from a seed run that they did so it's mostly just leaf but there's trim in there and some but in there and there's some good product in there I don't know if this maybe seeds in there but anyways so I'm getting my bags ready they're all cleaned and ready here I'm gonna be just doing when you're using product like this or when I'm using product like this I just use for bag system so I got my 220 bags a garbage bag and I got 73 and I'm doing 160 well that's the 25 so that's the bottom bag with the when you're using this kind of products you guys the 25 is really mess will see the way so I'm gonna get my bucket right here you know I just put my bucket outside this winter to be cold everything to be cold so guys the first bag to go in is yeah 25 the purple bag there is still some stuff in there but that's actually good stuff in there that's nice hash the bottom of that 25 is whatever is still in there will go nicely with whatever we make out of this next one go in is our 73 micron bag and I'm just making sure I don't have any shot here you do have a cat [Music] sixty [Music] there's still some time minutes in their past ones well these ones are pretty clean [Music] [Music] kind of what I like to do you like to have more it's a lot easier to do this now than when it's full of ice and water I'm happy to remember this time I'm gonna pull that down a little further because I want the bottom of my bag right around there and I wanna just all sitting at the bottom all four bags just piled up at the bottom there I want them all raised up a little bit so they can do their job and like put them on like this and have them all be about an inch away and if you can see the seam on it here so about an inch away like that right per bag that way they got a bit of space space in between each bag as well [Music] or to all the points on how much material I'm using sometimes to do this [Music] last bag sometimes when I'm making dry ice dry sift guys I use just this blue back and I just put my products in the blue bag and I put your ice on it and let that sit for a while and then it just shake the dry sip dry ice maybe the bags are a little off bags are different size okay so here [Applause] I don't want to grab snow [Applause] more snow oh there you guys they were stuck your hand and snow to see how long you can leave your hand in there for not very long so the smell is freezing so I just let it dry my hands off cessful yeah we'll be ready so now already so I got my buckets ready I got some snow in there so I'm just gonna take some of the product here here a couple apples take some snow [Music] just a couple leaves fail quiches pale so this is actually probably gonna make some pretty good stuff just kind of break in the snow off of it okay and I was gonna pop that in there again okay so what I was saying about if you ever stick your hand in snow you can't keep it in there for long it's just freezing your hand of death right so that's what we're doing with this stuff now so it's snow product nether layer of snow product another layer of snow that's what we got going on there right now so we're just gonna leave that I'm gonna set it outside again so this is gonna sit outside for about 15-20 minutes and then we're gonna add the water nice and starts tarnish hey guys so it's been a little while we're and grab that stuff now [Music] you guys saw me smashing this ice the more coarse and rough the Isis the better it's gonna break up and break the trichomes off the we're gonna take myself off break the try shoulders off hey get off this water gets high school break the trichomes off of the product so is just sitting there in the snow old [Music] it's starting to fill up now we start adding the ice box and race wait about there so stop that there I'll see how we're doing here so I got two tools for stirring you guys I don't have a drill yeah I'm gonna get a drill yeah so I'm not gonna make you guys watch me stir this but I'm gonna add the rest of this right and I'm gonna stir the crap out of this so come back in a second okay guys so you're just gonna keep stirring this up and obviously you can see I get comfortable when I do this okay so I want to just explain about this thing that I used to stir with you guys it's a good stir stick it was nice because when I'm stirring this around I can feel this little ball here touching the mesh screen there so I know I'm just just braising that I can even hear it sliding around on that screen so you know inside the pail there it's sliding around on the screen helping stuff sift through and it I can go along the sides here and really make sure I get all the products sturdy really well and I can get some vigorous stirring going on here here with this nothing we want to do wanna break those frozen trichomes off in there so now I'm not really using this so now cleanest best product you can consume now as far as concentrates though I was so skeptical skeptical of making this bubble hash before I started doing it now that I've been doing it for a little while it's really like the only thing I want to smoke besides from smoking normal joints range from smoking flour okay will be nice lifting the bags out now what I want to do is this is quite a bit of water underneath the bags so now I want to make sure I can rinse all those trichomes off [Music] kind of let the sink down I'm just gonna stir this and as I stir this these bags are gonna sink down if I move this out of the way you can see how it looks there right that water's not very green because we're dealing with really dry brought up here just gonna keep doing this these bags sink down you kind of push them down with it and then more water is gonna fill up in all right so we're gonna get more water in here and that will help Oh we'll be back then the next step here okay guys so I'm right it's well-stirred okay so what I'm gonna do is put this in here the pond and I'm gonna kind of rinse this off pull it out I know I'm not doing a great job with this doctor wanted it anyway we'll be back in a sec so now I'm just gonna pull these out one by one so I'm just gonna pull these out you guys let them drain and we'll come back and start looking at what we're getting out of it guys so I'm gonna start taking these bags out so what I do is I kind of slowly take it out and kind of shake it and slow without the water and the hash fall down into the bottom bottom of the bag here then we get an idea where we got out of this so remember guys this is what came out of the 220 so this is our worst quality shears I'm not too worried about getting this we want to see lots of is in 73 and in the 25 I could have put the 120 between this but I just thought you know I might as well have this this is kind of pointless it's not watching yeah but dealing with this kind of product you guys usually want to making this kind of stuff that kind of low-grade product just not that little great this is mostly contaminant in here there you might be able to make some edible with that okay so this one here is the one we're hoping we're gonna see something and one way we'll know is yeah this is really like to see is that this bag is holding a lot of water here that means there's something blocking the water right from flowing out of here so shakes and yes this is where we she gets decent amount yeah oh my god again another time where we wish we had smell-o-vision you could smell this is this is a very nice creamy goodness now you can use a spray bottle too to do this I don't have that particular set up right now nice nice little surprise here nice surprise now my bubble bags are a little bit different so I I get a really high quality 25 micron out of my bags but this is crazy this is very nice to see right here that big beautiful patty of hash right there that's gorgeous I can hear you guys all going whole yeah big that is huge that's very nice that's very very nice I can tell you right now already because of the way those ones came out okay this one here is going to hold a ton of water see that because there's a lot of product in there this bag is basically a big bag of water now grab this bag and you can do these motions I know you'll hear that water comfort other speed up the process okay now like when I'm making this from my own product I well sometimes or all the time actually drink some of this water here it's very chirpy and rich very very good for you loaded with healthy nutrients and I also feed it to my plants as well so I do have some plants in my drawers right now this stage here guys I like to let it just sort of slowly happen so we're gonna cut out the video and I'm actually gonna stand here and hold this for like probably five minutes we're doing another video here and I just want you guys to see how nice and creamy the color of this is and you can see we've got a lot of water to still filter out yet but that's looking good that's a nice beautiful light creamy color in there guys now we're getting this piece out of the 25 and I can tell you it turned out really really nice as well so you can be really happy with what we've got here I'm gonna take out this stuff around it kind of first we'll have that big patty there okay guys so now the next step is these have to dry for a while and once they dry for a while I'll show you guys the next process which really makes this stuff awesome makes it sweet you okay guys so this is still got to dry out a little bit more before we move it from here over to here so from this stage over to this stage but I'm just gonna show you what it was that we got here so this is what transferred from the two 20 micron bag to the 160 micron bag so it was the two 20 micron bag above and then below is the 160 micron bag and this is what we scraped up off of the 160 micron bag then after that was a 73 micron bag and I was this one this one here is what we scraped up off of the 73 micron bag and then the bag after that that we had was a 25 micron bag and that was this one and this is what we scraped up off of the 25 micron right so that's what we've gotten so far so this is kind of our crappy product here that's not very good and that's all we got of that and this is our gift stuff here which is what we wanted to get lots of the good stuff okay so here's another stage guys so I got some parchment paper ready I kind of fold a little line down the middle to keep them to separate I'm gonna do the different microns here so you just put it in the go under guy there and then you just kind of slowly just work it through and move here stranor around a metal strainer you [Music] [Music] don't want to do too much at a time so [Music] worth and this is really looking really nice nice huh and then we'll the reason why we do this guys is so it dries out properly and we don't damage the heads too much and we don't turn it into oil gummy you guys gonna do smells how much product we're getting here now I'll try so that was the stuff that was in 73 and this is the stuff that was in the 25 [Music] [Music] so when you're doing this you want it to still have some moisture in it but you don't want it to be too wet it's too wet it'll just come up in the strainer if it's too dry it'll gum up in the strainer and so it's too dry it'll turn to oil in the strainer and it'll just it won't go through here and it'll just come up and all the Pens are not segments kind of cut out there because my phone storage filled up it's had to delete some stuff make some more space but there you go so that's when we made again super nice super blonde super clean hash wait till you smell this stuff so this over here is the 25 and this over here is the 73 just gorgeous so there you go that's how you make the the best quality concentrate right now bow wash", "icuI3WpxQxk": "hi I'm Cass and this is honey and we're here with Matt Natalie and beautiful green sea to retreat into phyno and we are about to do the coolest thing we are making on our gummies so not Natalie they're the experts and they are going to show us so what's step one oh well first of all you want to get yourself some cannabis so this is purple blue so have a look at that and maybe you can pick a decent size and I'll go to that that we can chip apart a little bit maybe they're all done man that number to which you could have a look at a little darker so you both can go ahead and pick some cannabis out of that bag just how much can we pick maybe something close to 2 3 grams whatever feels right you can either choose a big mug or even just a few small notes we're gonna switch this down I'm not to a compressed pop okay so that's gonna be one of the first steps once we've picked out the cannabis so we are making these gummies from rosin so it's a solvent list product so it's a great canvas extract you don't need to use like any weird chemicals or solvents or anything like that so it's a super exciting way to D carb and income means a hundred percent it sounds like yeah pretty much all using is sweet and a bit of pressure to squeeze out the trichomes off of those buds so we're gonna have an extraction process to remove what we want off of the buds and you can play around with the different heats and pressures so the idea is to maybe find the ultimate way to get a great yield of different strains might be different pressures different temperatures so there's a bit of a science to it and a bit of a logging process to see if you can dial this in and get as much out of it as possible what are you doing here so we are going to pre press the flower so basically you're gonna weigh out how much cannabis you're using and we are friends at rose and unity have created this amazing database program it's online so you go to rosin unity our OS I am you and I - I gotta come and you can love all your information so you're going to want to weigh your flour and then you can track it so there's gonna be a little spa there it says how much weight and I'm gonna say 2.5 grams of cannabis and now we're going to put it into this crazy little 3d printer puck press that resin you'll be babe that's good and you're just gonna press it that's the muscle in this room right now I'm gonna let him and we status it is there a way that you could do this that you couldn't press it that hard is there like a machine that you could buy that we're doing are well in some in some presses you put them in a little baggy a little screen it'll lose through but in this case it's just parchment paper so you do need the puck in a sense to make this approach go down mm-hmm so there's a company called Kanna clamp and that's who we're gonna press our Roselyn today which reminds me we should fire them up yeah and they the Kanna clamps come with a little press a little box press so it's like that but instead of a circular puck it is a rectangle and so if you buy a set it kind of clips you will get one of those presses with it right in a sense but the kind of line look at that no there we are we've got ourselves a bit fragile actually you're a nice step president as impressed as possible so now we're gonna weigh that puck again just to double-check so at 2.3 to you or a 2.5 we're also gonna wear our parchment paper before we get anywhere further with this process so on the data base it's going to say paperweight in so this is just your paper parchment paper as it is culinary parchment from paper chef is the best rosin parchment paper to use paper chef's you should probably just make Brussels paper we're gonna basically fold it twice and make a little pocket this is mechanically they're made in the States so it's basically a hair straightener on steroids yeah amazing it's really easy to use one button to turn it on side button turns it up so you can try two different temperatures again you get to log them on your AWS and unity to see what temperature you squish that and see what your yield is like the one thing about the can of clamps it's important is first of all they get hot so do send them down on a silicon mat to protect your comb and the second thing is that you want to make sure you line up your bud in the middle of the clamp so you want to make sure that you're squishing the whole bud and the whole pot in otherwise you'll miss some of the squish so preferably the puck is centered so none of it is gonna okay those guys venture sure cos okay now I don't have much pressure on this yet but we're gonna want to start a timer as soon as I do apply some heavy pressure and from there we'll just see what happens all right I'm not quite there yet once I'm feeling I would say there's some pressure there now and you're at 225 so there we go let's do this so I'm gonna clamp this in as aggressively as I can't we're gonna get this nice and tight the handle is plastic so I'm not gonna go crazy and we're just gonna wait this is pretty accessible though like this isn't totally large of an appliance to have yeah and as the heat compresses this puck I'm able to actually squish down even further so over the minute now we're just over a minute I've actually squeezed it in even further what is the last thing we let it go to two minutes all of this information so the big thing is people are excited about what they've switched with turning this unit you're done is the main safety feature because these are hot so that is the one disclaimer to be careful is turning this off between squishes okay so this is your rosin here it is all this liquid here so you always get like a little clam better pop and don't throw these away because these are still good you can like melt these in with butter you make popcorn topping so they can't recycle then tomorrow can you maybe tilt that towards the camera so they can see what we got out of that now how its strong would you say that is well we'll find out we're gonna win see actually what kind of return on the switch we got we'll see exactly how much we have here and from there we can get a better idea how much rosin we have all right so everybody can huddle in and have a close look at this because any basic dab tool we'll just go ahead and clean all this stuff it'll all stick together so once you've got a clump going you can just literally almost like vacuuming the parchment it all just comes together and actually that may be why you're right it's really yeah it really is this was actually a nice consistency array of squish and just like that we've squished that bud and we've collected all the rosin so that was a an extraction just like that Wow yes it really is and this will be what we D carb activate and use for our edibles so we're gonna take the rose and look at addy carbon in the oven at 275 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes so we have preheated the oven to 275 and you're just gonna put it in a mason jar and cause a lid on it that's going to be carbon because Robin you don't get enough heat from squishing it to be carpet so you're just gonna get a little bit more for your cannabis if you and your awesome if you put it in the oven first so what does D carbon mean then her so deep carbonate is basically activating the cannabis so that once you put it into an ethylene it and your stomach acids will break it down so if you didn't decarbonise aim effect at all that's right yeah okay there we go two minutes all right blue represent movies well the stuff comes the long way to get old lady should now remaking rosin as well and rosin you know what your yield is so on that purple blue we've got a 13 percent yield no not bad 20 percent yield is like pretty fantastic they're not all beggars look at that yeah cool so that will make the bulk of our edibles all right from 30 minutes 30 minutes start your timer so you know so you want to use a quarter cup of water with your bus with yellow whatever flavor you desire no super classy weird jello gummies Angelica mystic so we only had a third cup measuring so you want to stir it yeah red her Brides putting a half gram of rosin if we had a larger ER with more rosin it would swirl more efficiently no we're scraping there yeah we got it nice a second in goes the jelly into the bowl to later go into the molds all right everyone get to see ours Easter Island bolt can't fire grotto like that show to the campfire Stern had to give him something and probably see him on the weekend at the event let me get out of your way Oh gonna put him in that fridge Emily and this guy says the fridge for 20 minutes so look at them how long were these in the fridge for these goes-- were like 22 minutes in the fridge we're just testing out this ice cube tray and it's silicone we did line it with an oil I would recommend using like a coconut oil we use pen a lot well because that's when we had access to it just helps it slide out [Applause] yeah Roz I love these I caught these perfect they make these in like 40 minutes a lot like mr. Z Z is making a cheesecake and so we use half gram of rosin so it's 250 milligrams and we broke it up over 500 their food was I don't know 15 milligrams per piece 40 so I would like start slow you know well it depends where you'll feel like this day don't give that to your grandma you taught us that such a clear easy awesome way and now I have these delicious affordable when I make gifts thank you thank you and huge other two rows in unity for hooking us up they showed us Ryan at rosa unity you go follow them at Rose music on Instagram they're killing it they go to super cool Rosen database and he showed us how to make these two days ago and now we're spreading the love and you guys I see it and we have been looking for and specific resin edibles and now we can make them thank you so much Matt and Ali and you have an amazing story and you're gonna hear about it on our show regular Canadians enjoying weed so with Cass and honey now check them out this time thanks green sea to retreat for having us here gasps gunfire we're hooking up today yeah it's been a [ __ ] wicked day all your eggs edibles this day has been absolutely perfect and kind of interesting so this is just gel our Joan something that kids know how to make thank you", "whDNJbZtXgY": "hey what's good everybody jay ping here checking in respectmyregion.com here today to do a quick taste test pre-roll joint review featuring the hash bone one gram infused pre-rolled joint i'm excited to review this i've heard a lot of great things over the last year or so about this company about their products this is specifically the cookins slash lemon jack 32.95 thc it's gonna hopefully taste lemony i'm hoping for a little bit of cookies i'm hoping for a little bit of jack if it doesn't have any cookies hopefully it still is just gonna be an electric electric lemon jack strain um let's see manufactured on october 30th 2020 it's got a about a year and a week long shelf life uh what does it say remove protective seal twist open cap light and enjoy one superior one super quality pre-rolled hash cone single serving one gram at hash bones oh ingredients 25 bubble hash 75 flour and then a natural paper cone so yeah here we go hollister cannabis the hash bone here we go the way that we do these taste test reviews is pretty simple 10 points 10 categories um 10 points a category 100 point review this is more focused on taste tests and so this is going to be more about the quality of the flour the taste of it all um it's that's going to weigh heavier on the final score so tap in follow like subscribe respect my region on all places smash that like button because here we go one hit you all know the rules i'm gonna talk about it two hits give you the score three hits score out of a hundred let's go dry hit has turps that's good i taste that lemon i taste that jack that's starting off solid already you know wasn't packed overly tight right away that's important all joint smokers should be massaging their joints anyways when you buy them pre-rolled but this one wasn't too bad didn't need a crucial massage all right here we go you guys you definitely get that hashiness the first hit it overpowers the flour flavor let me try it again i'm just really not getting that lemon jack flavor on the on the flour i'm getting whatever the bubble hash is if it's cooking's i don't know and that's what's kind of confusing is is the lemon jack the flower or is the cookin's the flower uh what are the terpene profile on this you know there's some questions that i have about the product just based on presentation and then now smoking it i'm definitely getting the bubble hash and i thought i originally tasted some lemon jack terps but maybe down here towards the bottom is where the flour is going to burn better let's try it let's try to get a little bit more one second y'all all right so with that said four or five smokes hits whatever it is i've got a score in my mind for the taste the taste on this is really a 7.5 because it's not tasting like a strain it's just tasting like you know a joint with some hash so on the taste of 7.5 on the potency and the appeal and the rest of the experience i give it eights to nines across the board and my final score is going to end up being you know this isn't this exact pre-roll is probably an 8 out of 10. i think it's going to be energetic it's definitely high potency but i'm just not getting the strain specific uh flavor profile and so because of that 75 on the taste i'll give it an 80 out of 100 on the final score so big shout out to hash bones the infused joint we've got bubble hash 25 and then 75 flour so this is a potent product i really i do enjoy it and it's a pretty solid so you know definitely go check it out let me know what you guys think in the comments be sure to like follow and subscribe uh respect my region on instagram and youtube and then of course at hashbones on social for this company so i'll see you guys

telling a friend of Kentucky there i'll make them bubble hash pretty much get these bags and stepped up version but you pretty much get these bags here I've got the 32-gallon the five gallons easier and smaller batches but so I kind of step you through the process of how to make victims shows how simple of this kind of airway man i'll have nobody helped me two days them i'll be back and forth their key the whole deal this temperature everything cold as possible so you pretty much start just imagine the rubber scam being about your own bucket thanks layer ice it won't take as much of the back I one bucket I'll have to record your mate the better it is the better it has come out but you use sales way pretty much anything sorry two three pounder in the bottom there are two builders layer of ice on top of it all the images the color you can give it a better result you have got a layer of ice a layer of makes another way advice will not allow amazed that's probably about seven pounds dried mixed up leaf bud trimmings Oh another thing it's best to keep your trimmings in the freezer place the baggage is going to work with your ready to mix it I just said temperature is everything the kind of tricky cuz when it's dried and then as much but when you start adding waters really fluffs up always makes about my quarter has a barrel all right water this is just water we've used before I like to recycle you know save on the water bill set this down here while I pour you what I'll dump it all out just to show you it's always good to save a little bit left over that's actually wet hash there just needs to be dried out through it again usually you can add a little water to it flush it up keep your container screen already just walk moment bows will turn the water on and I'll be back alrighty i'll take working but compared with me i'm doing pretty much so Paul you made the glass the hot water put something in it you I think he'll wait for that water Disputes love hearing lovers he's kind of a jerk CP mix there was easier to serve the tacos what it is a tough own will freeze and break off and the meat you need the water believe is enough with the truck honking sink to the bottom and being called an ice cream bear I guess this could be reviewing the 32-gallon bubble bags food if you have plenty of trimming the way to go over the top gallon bags run run run you never get nowhere well I mean depending on what you're looking for I guess you see the water level starting to tear on top I mean we get enough water to cover up what was that makes it so far so now more ice the frozen John hey tough love that's a good one not too much top it off there may be a half pound I just have doing it layers there to get it mixed up better this one big big of a deal with 5 gallon buckets and you're running 33 gallon bags it takes a lot of water a lot of Rotom get better results that's about right I could actually have more water and more makes but I'm hard today to let her own all right leave a message a mic here guess I should have that Freddie for Stewart on megavideo pretty much a drill paint makes her a little tricky there with a Firebug it using a paint mixer if it's easiest way to is mixing I mean you can use egg beaters or even paint stakes but this is the way to go good answer my helping out of the bag instead I felt like a bit overweight anyway what you're looking for is this crane you know you're when you're mixing it good you get this cream you don't want to over makes it big to death but just a good mixer there and yes I'm using impact I do have a drill but it's actually being used for someone else at the moment to win yeah anyway here's idea you gotta mix it up real good what about like a half steadily that it makes it that camera not of it it's about what you want you want to overdo it but it's this gradually spitting it there good to do it for about 10 minutes if I go home run a little short for the video there so you're not having to sit here watching me service but anyway so far the process again the battery's about to go dad i'ma drill so yes it's about the time to put the pause button one day I could have mentioned there that's good though when you first do your mix up get everything mixed up to let it set for 15-20 minutes to let it get good cold but as I said for the video I'm trying to speed the process along there so you kind of get an idea what we're doing this way alrighty well I guess I'll either hit the pause button or make a second video but this to the board where you stop you let it set for 15-20 makes you mixture eyes you're mixed together you let it set for 15-20 minutes kids come and close it off for something over top of it you can trap in the cold but essentially you just want to get it as cold as you can possibly get it and that gives the time for everything to settle down pull the bottom air tube all right we'll get your video too", "5nkk5tnttWE": "hello my name is Trina I'm a medical cannabis patient I'm protective cannabis on a regular basis for PTSD arthritis in both my knees and ankles social anxiety and a few other conditions you can learn more about throughout to the previous shows on this channel this is the productive cannabis kind of sewer a channel dedicated to medical cannabis patients and adult 18 and over so today what I'm going to do is show you a better look at the hash that we made when we did the bubble hash video series as I mentioned yesterday than the video that I loaded up that I forgot to well not forgot I accidentally deleted her the last process where we're actually scraping the hash off of the parchment and shaping it into the hash balls I accidentally deleted from my camera so we don't have that final process but yesterday I did a video and I was trying to show you what it looks like but I was outside and it was so it was like bright and really light I had a hard time focusing it so just look like a white like sphere that I was holding in my hands so today what I want to do is show you that hash and smoke it and talk to you about what I think about it and yeah it's like a hash smoke session which doesn't mean you have to only smoke hash if you're smoking along with me you can smoke whatever you prefer as far as cannabis goes so I'm going to show you look at the hash here so there's a number two on the container I don't know you can family see it because it's a done in sharpie but that means that's the number two bag number two micron bag that we use the second bag that was used when making the hash we could get more further into this breakin done and talking more about it when do the next hash video which will be coming up soon it'll be another bubble hash video so so this is what the hash looks like I'm sure you can see it a lot better because I'm indoors and it's not like bright outside very dense very dark one it seems like the first in the second back so that comes out darker but it's my first time trying it too it was my first time with this um this bubble hash series first time making it so ah helping to make it so I wanted to be a part of the a part of the process so hope you guys are having to wondered it wonder day a wonder day hope you guys are having a wonderful day Cheers oh my god for some reason what it's reminding me of this hash is like when I buy it into spearmint leaves cuz I have a spearmint plant when a spearmint plants pyramid bush in my backyard and when you bite into the fresh spearmint leaf the flavors at minty flavor and that green you know chlorophyll tastes burst through your mouth I'm not saying chlorophyll as in like someone forgot to flush out the weed that we used to make this hash because sometimes that can happen if you don't flush out the vital the stuff that you've nutrients that you put into the the cannabis as you're growing it it can have a very chlorophyll rich taste to it maybe something that people would not like so much but anyway that's another story a friend of ours came over to try this hash last night we're not to try but came over to visit and we let him try some of the hash and huh the first time we met well second time that bubble hash was made this same friend tried the hash and it wasn't that strong to him I guess then this time around he was but more blown away by it and enough it admit that but it was it seems like it gets stronger each time because you get better and better at it and more familiar with what you're doing just like with anything the flavor of it like I said has a very strong spearmint flavor to me like a spearmint fresh spearmint the herb what's the effects in the feeling I was having really sharp pain and my back like right in my shoulder area right here sometimes I'll give a sharp pain in my shoulder and that pain is not here I had some of this hash a little bit earlier and I noticed that that it's really wonderful for a relieving body pain and like I mentioned in the previous video that well actually in the hash making video talk about it he'll it's great for insomnia it's great for people who have a hard time getting their mind to rest so their body can rest too I mean I've been there before I had the cannabis I would use I can melt tea or valerian things of that nature all in like holistic herb type of category nothing chemical because I don't want a result I didn't want every result to like sleeping pills or anything like that but into the lying game with this eye doctor also say it's very creative um hash very much so I mean with my art I have noticed that I'm just feeling like more relaxed and pain-free and more confident when I'm relaxed and pain-free then I feel more confident and that confidence carries on to everything I do especially my art and that's something I'm really passionate about and I noticed with the hash mark and the hash and creating my art the ideas flow with ease and added notice of there's some times of the week I felt like panicky a little bit just for like financial things that most people concern themselves with and I just smoked a bowl of hash not a ton of like a huge bowl but a moderate amount and just went outside to relax and that did wonders for me so overall it's just a concentrated version of the flower that is known as cannabis and it's yet another way of partaking in this beautiful herb another way of processing it to where it's a little bit more of a concentrated form trying to bring it out of there it's like war is more of a concentrated form for those who have really chronic pain for those who have been in accidents and pharmaceuticals aren't doing what you want them to do they're just maybe just basically putting you to sleep but not giving you a healing restorative sleep and not setting you up for tons of side effects and injury to your body in the long run from using pharmaceuticals like pain medication so yeah thank you for joining me today for today's hash smoking session the bubble hash smoking session I truly enjoyed hanging out with you guys today I know everybody doesn't have access to what I do in order to make hash but I just want to share it with you guys nonetheless and if

would like to see on this channel to help us learn more about this beautiful plant called cannabis already guys have a great day peace you", "UakugjgYDg0": "hey guys what's up we're here with some more stuff from legendary wellness this is their hash that they had in there today amazing price on it I think it's like eighteen or twenty eight gram a Tina gram and fifty and Heath just I mean stuff is cheaper than Bud to be honest they say it's full mo I'm not sure if it's exactly full amount but it does bubble it's got a good bit of oil resin in it it's got yeah it's got a good surface bubble to it has a good bit of breakdown not exactly I wouldn't say full melt but maybe like 1/2 or 3/4 melt for sure definitely at Studio City or the wheat this would easily be easily 20 or 25 a gram no no doubt about it and your hold on a second guys I'll be editing this anyway Mouse course I'm alright guys sorry about that I had to let Charlie and real quick he was scratching at the door but yeah where this this would easily be 2025 a gram at Studio City this is a some og bubble hash really really good it comes in really powdery which is just something I really like to see because then you know for sure if I can get this under here you can see I get it to the rim you can see it comes in super powdery when you buy it which is something I really like to see cuz you know they chopped it up fine to get all that moisture out you're not gonna get any mold or anything like that in your hash there you go I'll label where you guys would you push film Oh like I said I really know if it's uh so I mean it's not really a full mount I can say but it is very very high quality bubble hash like I said it easily 2025 @co city in the weed but I pressed it into this disc and zoom out a little bit [Music] yeah I pressed it into this disk sounds a little bit easier to work with it's like a drop bits of it in the hot hit bowl excuse me and then I saved a bit of it for some fantasy bowls for later for us we'll be seeing that but yeah there's a really easy way to do this I'll show you guys in a minute but I'll try and break this hash up real quick without [ __ ] it up too much alright sorry guys got interrupted again real quick but we're back again can't really show you the guys inside that will try and zoom in [Music] it's really kinky really nice kind of moist real good bubble hash for sure zoom out oops as you can see I haven't really finished fully pressing it yet I don't have like a hash pressed or anything like that I just use [ __ ] elbow grease and a piece of very thick I guess a magnifying lens lens because it's contoured and it has a center focal point which makes it kind of easy to press for a lot of pressure in one spot and press your hands down so that you guys can see that I'll show you guys real quick a little trick to turn this powdery hash I have a bunch I got a quarter of it and first time patient deal you can get I think a free edible of the max power bar you can get you can get the free you get a free joint or you can have an eighth upgraded to four grams so they actually let me do that with the hash as well so I got this hash eight upgraded to four grams for my first time which is really nice so what you do here is if you want to turn all these little pieces into one big patty you kind of just push them all together in the center give them a little bit of pressure that they kind of have their stick and you see it'll kind of start to form like that and then you can take this paper fold it over and like I said I had this even C contoured like a lens to magnifying lens I got kind of [ __ ] up I found it in the middle of the road Steve did it's really [ __ ] helpful as hell because you take it and you just put your hand on it and you push the [ __ ] nice and good yeah just give it a nice good press real good do a lot of [ __ ] pressure you're not gonna hurt it and then you can see it turns it into a patty you couldn't even tell that was a bunch of different chunks see that you can see it somewhat but when you keep pressing it I'm going to keep going with this guy but if you get these little edges and stuff like that they're not really working out too well what you do is you just fold them over take them off and break them off and fold them over back into the center push in the center and push the edges in so you have to have all those edge pieces on top of it marrow and rinse and repeat these can see better Patti now [Music] a little bit easier to work with and then when you get down to the powders you can pour the powder out when you get to the powder part you can just take the disk you already made and just go and pick it up like a piece of tape just use it like a big old gooey piece of hash tape and then I'll start picking up all those extras a little snowball I just start getting bigger and bigger [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] that [ __ ] was kind of corny when I was a kid dude I cannot stand everything you guys see now you have a big ol chunk hole [Music] these fits [Music] so I've gotta get my hands in the way because I'm trying to really work with this guy you have to put a good bit of elbow grease in if you don't have heat presses and [ __ ] but I mean it's not like I'm working with [ __ ] pounds of hash and then they get that again [Music] and you keep going along with that tell you're done but I'm gonna give that a rest since you guys get the idea [Music] [Applause] so I don't want to get it stuck in the container all weird but we'll get back to this one so as you guys can see this really really nice hash good bubble hash anyway oh gee hash for sure got that really good cushy flavor nice lemon eNOS even I'm scraping off my fingers I could taste the bit of lemon that it has it's got a nice nice candy lemon flavor not the or in addition to the to the hash really good sweetness breaking off a ledge hunk here [Music] all that make it flat as he BC you guys can see as much surface bubble as possible or hair drop this in the suspended Lux Bowl as you guys can see that they're getting ready to get melted up burn up you want to do the the honors of the Greens yeah [Music] do you guys know what I have a whole bunch of new videos are gonna be watching all right [ __ ] this [ __ ] is take the homeless then I relax I'm getting to it [Music] the og full mouth bubble hash well label this one well but I go to the Y - from legendary wellness in Santa Ana there you go Fisher [ __ ] that shot up so bad ya gotta [ __ ] that up they really [ __ ] up the whole shot I'm just gonna cut this part out of the video [Music] don't worry though you just leave it I'll just blow it out [Music] cool that did all right guys we're back sorry I kind of [ __ ] up the first shot on the last one so we're back with a new green so you can see the oil bubble out of the resin or out of the hash so I'm not gonna [ __ ] this one up I promise yeah go for it [Music] not too much surface bubble [Music] yeah it's still a good sweet oh gee ash no not full not exactly full amount I don't think I wouldn't say but it does break down quite a bit of Topshop [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah really really good hash there I mean 18 a gram 50 and 8 I wasn't even expecting cool melt to be honest or something but I mean for the price dude it doesn't matter if it's phenomena I'm gonna definitely buy this again if they have it because it's an amazing deal it's amazing good og ash and I really really like it some good stuff very potent for sure very potent very heady I definitely feel a bit more indicate influence in it that might be just because it's a very strong cache but it's very very good I really really like it I'm really enjoying it and you can see a little bit of plant material but I think that's honestly from me because of compressing it I have a little bit of leaves on my desk from the extraction the other night just going around still so those might just be so kicked up moving around stuff yeah really really really good hash I like you a lot easily 20 25 other clubs for H in the gram and 50 and 8 so amazing deal great quality of legendary wellness another very very satisfied with another noise another but very very satisfied with another mother or their medicines very very good [ __ ] I really enjoy it and yeah we're gonna be getting them to the buds next so I'll see you guys", "c5sWVkiCt7k": "[Music] thank you for watching because your first time to make sure to have that subscribe button more great content uploaded every day [Music]

need for hash to make it in bubble bags you need your bubble bags they consist of eight bags usually you have a work bag that's usually the highest micron which is 220 and then it goes down from 191 60 120 90 45 and 25 and that's my bag then these are cheap bags these are grow your own h PS grow lights store calm so they work I've made hatch with these things for a while now it probably needs new beds but in the meantime excuse me so the work beds here it's not filled yet and what I do is I pre chill some more the best I can I have ice you need ice and you need some kind of wooden spoon or whatever else you think works but that's what we're doing today I'll try to like maybe film this see what we could do all right if not I'll see you in a minute all right so we ran out of the battery again but we were adding the water you know continue to do that all right so that's that gonna is one material it does working try oh I have some fresh frozen in here as well so that's good I didn't know I had any of that it's been so long my family has a week but before that it's been a really long time but it's some good news here I don't know why but in these little zippy is what I was thinking just some more fresh raisin that's one oh yeah good look what I froze put the football back and come on now we're gonna mix it up a little bit there's your face water water just need a little more water I remember that the ice melts so want to lead yourself bring this charlie and you kind of just spear this for about 15 minutes give it a nice stir I may add some more ice want to get down to the bottom really wear gloves not because of anything just so I look at my hands on their seat gonna hit some more ice that's a consistency were morning there's next general idea I have to spin this up for a while 15 minutes plus alright so we'll check back with you guys in a bit please all right guys we're back it's about 15 minutes I did my stirring okay so what you're gonna want to do is you want to go to get it hot out for your work bag or if you have another bucket you could use a bucket but we need this bucket and I'll show you why in a second so it's stirred you see the bubbles you know there's more the ice melted a lot so I think it was nice it almost gets like a serial moisture sitting on the milk too long pent consistency with the buds and you could almost see there's no trichomes on there and that's what we want okay any clean as you go that's that's important just because it's annoying to clean all right so why don't we just come back I'll remove the work bag and we'll start harvesting some hash and I'll show you how to do that piece all right guys we're back I did put on gloves just this part I want to you could see I took the work bag out so you can see that golden luscious water of trichome head filled edge now what you're gonna need is your hash map which comes with the bubble bags that needed to 1/2 tspoon everyone who's anyone has a hash spoon or in my case semi soup spoon you're gonna need a beer and some paper towels some paper towels and we're cleaning the bowl with some 75 percent or 71 percent isopropyl so what we're gonna do is set this up and I'll show you from there one second guys please alright so we took the ng bucket [Applause] alright so this bag here is the 190 all right we're probably not going to get too much of goodness out of here but this is what you do all right the feel there's nothing in there [Music] [Applause] not so that all right so you take this and you put it in here go and then we move the camera detective whoa and then what we want to do okay so you guys can see what I do I'm gonna pause them alright so now you can see see we have a little bit in here there's some some material in there because my work bag has a tiny hole in it but that's why we have the 190 bed so with cold water all right so with cold war and if you don't have one of these use a regular that's spray bottle and you want to wash your hands in handy by pushing in the center and all the material and to get the water out this is a lot of green material so just doing a little spooky spooky yeah very much [Music] so I put it on your little pad over here so that would be it hold on hold on you must chill yeah what's up paper towel always does that or something else is wrong it's moving on its own that's so weird all right so why don't I get the next bag out and we'll start again all right guys so this is now pulling the 1/16 bag okay and you got some nice blonde hash here with a little sediment from the bag itself but you can see that's nice oh [ __ ] you you'll forgive my language tonight I'm a mess so that's that let's harvest NESC yeah all right so [Music] nice that's nice that's nice hash dude alright so we're going to do a little more watching see a lot more all right so to anyone who doesn't know this nuts okay guys we are back now this is the 120 bag it doesn't even look like it yielded as much as the 160 but it looks a little cleaner a lot better thing is um I wanted to mention it seems like a lot of people who make bubble hair this is dry system right there they seem to get a lot more than I do alright so I don't know if it's my bags I don't know if it's my [ __ ] or anything else I don't know if I'm not stirring it long enough but I just don't seem to get as much as they should that's kind of annoying but either way it works we're almost on here we're getting to the cool bags that I call fool that's a [ __ ] production I'm sorry guys I'm just uncoordinated I guess so let's move this along we're going to the 90 bag hopefully the 90 comes out awesome it feels awesome it feels awesome but what happens is as the microns go down in size then water can't escape as fast so you feel like you have like a pound and then all of a sudden when it's all arranged like donk donk but this one looks good yeah this one looks all right boots Rock they mix a little bit of hash stick them right in there they'll miss the music oh yeah we doesn't been hit let's take out an impurity real quick as I said my both legs aren't the best all right so yeah a nice day yeah site good batch nice batch of hash let's get that on a [ __ ] spoon the 90 bag came through get on there look at that chunky monkey - that's nice [Music] got more on there [Applause] [Music] yeah so we gotta wash it down right [Music] nice we'll leave that alright guys this is a nice pull this is the 73 micron bag and came out great I'm gonna harvest this make sure you guys see find it this is one of the best pulls I've ever had I mean look at that that's some [ __ ] up hash man there's a lot more whoo-hoo this is great you know I should do this on camera more often oh my god [Music] Wow this is [ __ ] great look at this - man hell yeah dudes yo we're almost done we're getting towards this is the 73 so right now we keep it a mental note or a visual note on the hash the 1973 killed it killed it so forth so we're gonna see if the 45 does the city justice I mean you guys want to stand for this I could always fast-forward the [ __ ] but I mean might as well and they takes a while to drain the water on these like the 45 and the 25 like I said but oh yeah I think I got a good one yeah we got to do a second law but I won't show you all that I figured I haven't really produced a ham studio in a while that was completed [Music] yeah I think this one's gonna be nice too I don't want to jinx myself for nothing but I see hash oh yeah if it's gonna be a little bit of half it's gonna be quality [ __ ] looks pretty cool let's check it out not as much as the 73 and we now we're getting war in this thing so it's still soaking up some hash [Laughter] so this is pretty good this looks good yeah as I said not as much as the 73 but the 45 looks like but uh nice right all right let's pause you alright guys so I had to just stop and feed my dogs real quick the battery's running out wanna talk to you guys in a minute please hey guys if I could show you quick this is the second pull the second washing I got Rick Lee he's fish man as you go up like that's the 190 that's the 160 120 and then the 90 and then the 73 did great and then the 45 and 25 and you can see nice and this is the first one all right so we did the hash the wife came home she went upstairs to watch housewives so I'm left alone with some hash and you guys so we're gonna go down to the garden and check everything out I'm actually smoking a bowl so mmm there we are let's go to the garden alright we are back we're looking at flower you can see the place is stuffed with buds we're gonna look at the BT y ou G crossed with Spartan cush it's on day 50 it's just about in flush what I'm doing is I added on the last feeding a overdrive from advanced nutrients a sweetener which is I use my Humboldt honey and and I used my microbe which is photosynthesis plus so bt y OG crossed with spartan kush from ph nerd [Music] nice frost on this female [Music] okay and you know down here nice for us coverage they're finishing out you can see the pistols are kind of withdrawing going back in but this piano here this looks like the Reeve edge fee know that I'm gonna have to do comes out the frost hissed big chunky nugs all the way down nice and frosty like her a lot and I can't remember what phenol number it is look in a second I'm sorry about that I hit the cage and it's leave it or not this fee know that I like the most is in the one of the smaller pots that I have so she is female number 11 and this Fino right here nice and frosty but this double it was more like that stunt e1 and AD and she's so right but big number 11s where it's at number eleven nice frosty nerds very so moving right along we'll go over here to a ninja fruit number two I have just healthy as hell frosting up like she always does she's on day 35 ish and she's great okay and back there oh I almost have it dinner let me get over there that's my swashbuckler frosted out nice just on the same day as the ninja for number two over there so day thirty something healthy frosty nugs so swashbuckler now come this way alright so in the middle the big girl here the one that's just taking up most of the space and leaning it over that's a ninja fruit number two also but he's on day 40 ish and she's huge huge and she's Fox Talon on some of the some of the buds that's probably because she has Fox held on me in the past it could be close to the light is so strong to be the heat just the temp does get up to like 85 sometimes not recently but so you can see she's a beauty really Frost's it out as always so nice let's move over we'll stay away from their commission but but here is another big girl which is my Sauer bruja number seven keeper not as big buds as the mint for number two but frosty which you can't really see and she smells like tangerine I mean you can see the frost you see I see a hair but she has bugs everywhere they look good is Riley we came to join us what's up girl but she's dead yelling he out a little bit hold on right from over here don't get in trouble she's yelling out a little bit the sour bruja number seven at days mid-40s and I definitely gave her a lot of newts they got five gallons between both of them and enter from number two and the sour bruja so she think I'm at exactly where I want to be we had asked Frost beautiful alright guys so that's kind of flower in a nutshell we're gonna go check out a couple of things and get the hell out of here ninja fruit number two ninja og smells like black licorice and grape and other things that people told me sometimes when you grow you can't smell too well alright let's go please alright guys so I guess it was about a week and change that you guys up file upload the video that you watched and I had the clones in of alien rip malibu pie of swashbuckler well this is where we're at when we got thick thick roots everywhere and we're gonna transplant these tomorrow probably after work so you've saved our genetics once again all right guys let's go check out that we'll probably make this a little quick and the reason why is it's kind of a jungle in here no pun intended with jungle the guy genetics but what we have in here for the next round as everyone knows we have a sour bruja number five discontinued on mod N but I need to grow her out one more time Malibu high right there budging out nicely you could see shoots just coming up real nice over there is the alien rift down there is nice and then we have the swashbuckler in the corner so obviously he just saw the corner so we have the swashbuckler and the Cologne or the alien rift Malachi we're not cloning that and everything else that's like really grown out like this and this and this one piece is jungle - God genetics it's a ninja fruit cross with dragon's breath you got a bunch of them over here we got nine of them in here all different phyno & their sex and out good the ones that are still in one gallon Ponce I they're not sexing so I don't know maybe they're male but the female sext pretty much but let's move on because I have a lot going on in here here we have three Sauer bruja number seven that you just saw in flower and they're all topped and we have two I mean three ninja fruit number two's that you just saw in flower and they're all tops ninja fruit has these big-ass families like look they're gummy and just each families cover and everything sometimes you just got to remove them you know like that just to get them some light so those are those another ninja ninja fruit cross with dragon's breath and over here are the new genetics which is two beyond dreams from north genetics to velvet cookies from a bruja from jungle of the gods genetics and then we have a which might call it true love two of them but this little one is still surviving so now but not grown teach ruler some drinks proof so those are the next round ball magnetics everything looks good in here that's a jungle but I'm psyched look at the size of this fan leaf on the ninja fruit cross with dragon's breath I mean seriously unbelievable just huge I almost want to

gasps no gasps at all just earthy earthy floral at the end but for the price and the deals I'm very excited very happy Aloha elevators", "Kg8MX7yE_54": "easier welcome back everybody this step we're gonna be doing a little bit of a hash review I haven't done any of those and like a while so I just wanted to do a quick smoke out and talk about some of the hash that that I have seen that is not mine and you know we'll smoke it and talk about it I obviously got this stuff from bubble modes this is from a whole plant fresh frozen run I gave him this cut of the cookies and cream that I you know pop the seeds from a while back and I gave him a cut and he decided to wash it and it came out amazing I cannot talk about enough how much this stuff is fire super surprised this is a fee no I hadn't washed before so I mean I thought it was just I thought it was just a strain that would look good in the bag I didn't think it was this washable I mean I have a different fee know that I was washing and sifting I don't know which one is better I think the one I have still is better for sift but I might have to give that one another try obviously it was I mean everything whole plant fresh frozen means that it was chopped down and went straight in the freezer even the top coalos we're not just talking about trim and then larf this is like top rock-hard colas going in there too I did a similar run with the pineapple Express where I I mean I washed everything about it and it's drying right now I'll probably smoke some on the show with the later date because is like the first time that I did it and it came out absolutely phenomenal I'm gonna check it that out it's amazing or what oh my god look at that and again I mean the camera it's it looks phenomenal on camera but the camera still isn't doing it justice like it is it's like white white this this light kind of makes it look a little yellowish I mean when you pour this stuff out it is stark white super impressive pretty stable he was worried that it was still a little wet so we'll give that a shot and see if it is if it is it's not a big deal I was kind of impatient anyway I said he'd been drying it for like Oh ten days or so and he still wasn't sure if it was dry which was crazy I know his room is spot on so I mean it's in the mid 30s as far as humidity which should be drying hash out in definitely seven days but this strain just might be that greasy I have a couple of people that were asking me if it's worth it to wash whole plant I mean it's kinda not like BHO where you're gonna get a higher yield because it's Bud like it's pretty much gonna be about the same yield you would have got off a tram which is discouraging but I feel like the hash is better mean you're gonna get the same amount of total weight and resin but I think there's gonna be more heads in the bags that more heads in the bags that are good so there's gonna be more 90 more 70 less 25 yeah and even I mean my experience with whole plant I mean this isn't a hundred percent of the time but it seems like even the 190 and the 160 seem to be extremely better than then they would have been just off of trim mainly because you know the 160 and 190 bag are on and you let you guys take a peek at that I know you guys like the hash for him hmm good clear one before yeah really nice glistening juice the 160 and the 190 are like you know they're for bigger particulates realistically but when you watch whole plant it seems like there's more mature heads on there so there might be some big bulbous turkey heads that end up landing in there and I've seen some 190 melt like five six star same thing with 160 which is is rare if you're washing hash and trim I think I think whenever I do trim runs it seems like that 190 is a little green and the 160 is maybe a little bit lighter but same kind of texture when it comes to the the hash kind of gritty and you know fiber risk I mean you could already see this stuff I mean it is like see-through so yeah when people ask me hey am I gonna get a better yield with with nugs I generally just tell them no because you're not really you might get more six-star but not very much more it'll definitely beter beer and now that rosin is in the game it really is more no prevalent because if you take all that lower grade hash that you normally wouldn't smoke and you just rosin it up and it turns into six star or better I guess some people claim some people like to call it seven star or I've even heard somebody call their resin ten star which is kind of silly no again didn't really have too much terribly to talk about today I was going to put up another video instead but I hadn't done any of these cache reviews in a while and I got gifted this stuff I got some other stuff too I gotta ask him what the names are for it I he called it something but didn't write it on the thing so god the smell is just so cookies-and-cream if you guys have ever had the strain it's really like super cleaner a little bit of cookies in there but just heavy with with like a cleanness and if you've ever had any of exotic genetics crosses that Starfighter that starfighters creaminess definitely carries on you gotta go nailed it all right pack them a little bit extra on there probably would have taken this a two hits normally but I don't want to get it's the first thing in the morning I want to get a nice juicy one for yours so again thank you bubble modes really appreciate these type of gift this guy makes awesome hash I can't really say that enough one of the most humble guys I've ever met and he really started off just not knowing much at all about you know extracts and just cannabis in general and he's gone from like zero to a hundred in and just you know over a year and I'm just super super impressed with the product that he is churning out yeah look out for this guy dude this guy is killing the hash man for sure I always loved to see new products coming out of his corner they're definitely worth the time to check out the quick smoke on I think that's pretty much all I wanted to talk about if you guys have any questions or comments feel free to leave them down below I do not mind answering them I'll try to keep it positive though there's been a couple trolls hanging around you know basically just saying my hash is garbage which is kind of silly to me but everybody's entitled to their own opinion but to those people I really don't know why you stick around and watch my videos I I know I have to be long-winded and just unpleasant to watch if you're not enjoying the content so I would just maybe not watch the video if you don't like it just the suggestion though by all means come and spend 20 minutes to hate let's just take another look at this stuff I mean I wish I could shine a light through it for you guys it's super duper clear exciting alright cookies-and-cream whole plant fresh frozen Cheers oh man super Turkey Wow such a Perla just to even be sampling that but do you believe that this is the 90 you obviously the makers stash a lot of people don't get to try this bag and definitely that's where all the good stuff lives such a creamy flavor if you haven't had a chance to just try some of exotics genetics you know cookies and cream Kimbo Kush and I know he has a new dessert menu coming out for his seed line but the cookies & creme Kimbo coach are just so flavorful I know that he's been winning cups with that also look at the screen here is that not an insane melt I mean ah just straight juice but I definitely would call that six-star and I wouldn't enjoy getting more of that I would smoke that every day it's absolutely a pleasure mmm Lim cleanliness to start the morning I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll catch you next time", "1_llM38XO9c": "how's everybody doing is the bubble back they just wanted to take a moment do a video fibular product these are all mesh bags being cared about six months now the great thing about them is there's nothing to peel off on the inside and they drain real fast if you've used standard bubble bags before and you get into the lower micron bags of twenty five to seventy three some stuff they don't want to drain these bags the water can come out through the side since they're all mesh and they drain much faster and they last a lot longer because you don't have all that stress on the bags from the water these bags are made out of German mesh they're a heat stamps parade a mesh super thick I have these bags made right here in America I used to have my bags made in China like everybody else the quality was not good so I gather my materials and I have a ladies of all my bags oversee everything I have a 30-day warranty on them was a 30-day no questions asked you buy the bags for any reason you're not happy with them send them back for a full refund I'll even pay the return shipping this is what I do for a living I sell bubble bags I oversee everything I put my heart and soul of these bags and you will get huge yields with a guaranteed we have one gallon bag as well and we have a 20 gallon bag as well that we will stop real soon and we have presents when it comes it and you also get a storage bag it comes with the kids one other thing you might be interested in is our 5 gallon level machine if you're used to making bubble and stern it in the bucket the old way where you just need a bucket and you stir it with the ice in the water well now within these machines and what you do is it comes with a free 220 microns if ur bag it unzips you can enter product in ice and the machine you add water and ice then you come over and drop it in and turn it on when you get finished basically have your vocal bags you take your drain line it's right in it into the bag works awesome I'm going to show you the inside of the machine doing this video myself so I've got to take the camera off the tripod if it gets a little shaky excuse me okay here we go and give you a close-up of the machine I just want to show it to you there's the timer sits from 3 minutes to 15 minutes here's the inside of the machine I'm even going to turn it on and show you how it works it turns one way you've never used one of these machines you should try they work great takes all the work out of it if you have any questions drop me an email you can also check out our web site at www.wku.edu/oucampus you", "1DiTnAF2KO4": "but I found this is round 2 at a wedding cake bubble hash that we just ran this is the second wash right here this is a 15 minute wash it you did about somewhat the same kind of maybe a little less but the quality fell off but it was still worth it to wash I'm pretty sure you probably could have went a third time and probably got some something off though too but nothing that was really worth it to me but this is really some decent quality for a second wash pretty happy with the results all ball we should would do it a little bit more but the quality is totally there especially off this first wash which was uh it's gonna be well worth it yeah it was a six minute wash being the but this is the wedding cake it is what is it wedding cake is cookies and cherry pie for sure you know cookies in shape are so you know it's the second wash now we just gotta let it dry so we can press it up and turn it into rosin or whatever will melt we'll turn it off and the Russell just keep the sprinkle on top of stuff will smoke those about to get into some of this curtain wall yeah are you two about to get a party piece", "vDq9xoT3_cc": "always though it's it the pass away the time always [Music]", "diA2T1djMSs": "this is from a couple plants that uh i put up too early and started flowering they didn't get no bigger and then i saw that they started revenging again and i didn't want to lose none of the trichomes or anything that was on there and i didn't want to go through any more [ __ ] so i just decided to go ahead and end their life and this is the time that their life would have been ended uh like about maybe two weeks ago three weeks so yeah um one thing i'm not sure i couldn't wait and i dried it halfway i don't know if that's an issue if anybody could let me know in the comments or anything you know isn't my second time doing this so just thought i'd let y'all know man i'm gonna show you another little video after this so uh y'all stay tuned man appreciate y'all much love", "Tuwzbvm09X4": "alright we're back I started for about six minutes and this is what we got decent foam on top when I'm stirring they're not being too bad for DeCinces crazy train i don't know if you can see that the waters purple turns out really nice with crazy train you know that i have the number five is really perfect tends to turn your water that color so I'm going to let this sit spray down the edges of water let this sit and settle for a few minutes and then we'll start filtering through the bags see in a bit", "q772B_dsYgQ": "so the most questions I've been receiving from the Rossum tutorial video is where to get these filters from this is a 25 micron filter for ordering them on eBay they come in a4 sheets a little bigger depending on how much you want to order and you can cut them to size for various types of hash weights to ground well then whatever you want to do depending on what you like to achieve and sometimes when I'm just cleaning bits of already made of oil then I use very small bits and wrap them up but this is about giving people the opportunity to do it for themselves where they might not have access to gain this kind of stuff so simple solution French coffee press or a French press coffee press or whatever you want to call it it's a particular type of one it has the three parts sandwich on the bottom and it allows you to unscrew this part you don't want to have one where they've actually glued it all together and you'll notice that on the ones that are poor quality they tend to have a nylon filter here but what you ideally want is one that's in three parts like this where you can take it apart and this filter that's left behind I would say looking at it could be between 50 and 90 micron but it's difficult to tell but it's better than nothing and it will clear your hash and clean your hash to a relatively good level although you may still get some residue when dabbing although that's a small price to pay for at least having access to some kind of good filter and you can always wash it once again once you've cleaned the oil in order to make it a little bit cleaner than it originally was if you can find anything finer than this then please let me know because it'd be nice to share with other people that this is the best I've found so far that's available in most normal shops or supermarkets", "r6aahFWX4-A": "yo bubble have you nope in this Bureau hood I'm rocking the machine bags already ready to go the after-effects yeah the bubble machine and so I just got it on would have got on wash setting for 15 minutes we run that and see how it goes first time so it's all experiment but made it before just manually worth the money in my opinion if it saves the labor and time and produces better stuff it's hands-free so yeah that's pretty chill so two bills for the machine and the bags and everything pretty much all included to help be interesting maybe I'll show you the finished product see what I get out of this heist that's pretty interesting it's already getting frothy that's after 15 minutes see green the water yes I can actually see little particles of like you know the teach deaf I'm using a 220 mesh BIRT micron bag for this and then I might run it through another 2 - money to get the extra particles which I see summer coming out which will happen with this mesh and then I'll run it through a different hole different issues I think 5 in total a 45 micron 70 to 120 160 something like that and even at 25 but usually you get the best in the 70 range I believe in 45 something like that all right so just update click update in the process of making the Haitian cool so far so good alright final results of the double hash machine so got over a half ounce there I just threw in a bunch of shake and I think it's of actual bud so you can see the different qualities but that's my big main guy that's over a quarter of a turn and then the [ __ ] the 180 green but I actually like to smoke that tube I like it all and then you can see this nice shiny one I think that was the 45 good Turpin there good oil stuff muster capture them the rest so that concludes my first bubble hash run not too shabby I'll be smoking on some nice bubble head powder", "Ur61k7_EK7I": "what I found being a wife out here making some bubble hash off of the wedding cake right wedding cake yes wedding cake [ __ ] or was it was it was wedding cake [ __ ] from Grandma that we had got not that impressive of a yield but the quality is there yes no bubble no these colors look very very nice so everybody pretty much has a tutorial on how to make the wash you don't know how to do it just put in bow wash and but I will give a shout out to bubble bags and bubble man because he helped out with creating this quality we're here also the bubble now machine that thing is the bomb it pays for itself the first yes so worth having if you're into hash doing it yourself definitely yeah this is the first run and we're gonna do another wash even though it's not that greater yield it's just what the quality that's there is definitely worth the second wash so we'll be back would uh would around to here in a minute", "wJGZfZHjWsg": "so to finish it off we put it in the silkscreen like I mentioned there's different uses I usually the paper towels are really absorbent napkins and definitely recycle them when I'm done with reuse them so don't hate on me for being a waster but anyway I know like I've seen in sub Cole's video he mentions using a chamois or a ShamWow and they I've actually used and they work awesome I don't know where mine is but whatever you can do to dry it out now I press mine I like to press it before I put it in the freezer it's just I'm greedy I want to smoke my [ __ ] and so I want to get as much water out as I can and then I find that any internal moisture when I put it in the freezer will build on the outside and we'll take a shot of this later so you can see it but basically that's it you run it through the machine run it through the bags properly sift it properly and we have a couple bags to go but this video is probably already you get the gist of what we're doing and you take that water and you put it through the next set of bags boom all right there we go get back in a minute", "HWrtIn7oqBk": "g-dog word up I got my lead guard and [ __ ] and breaking the laws got this [ __ ] over eighty degrees nice and cold [ __ ] Randy ass winter yesterday I haven't dulled me the pool in months so this is my first time diving don't laugh my belly flop or splash or something let's see what actually happens I'm scared it's looking to get hurt well at least I got a okay here we go ready Cheers nice and warm I do want to open my eyes under there because I just added some chlorine yesterday got that [ __ ] up to five I don't know if that's ppm or five what but it's five it's colder when I'm out of the water actually it's seeming like cement I think I could do it like this I turned the fan off and the windows are already fogging up like crazy the fan sucks the heat out in a part of my body that's out of the water ends up like getting cold so I do this to stay warm I don't want to get my hands like some about to be dabbing her a minute but yeah been a while since I did one of these weekly pulse s or waking Baker went around I know what it is whatever what it is in the pool but figured I do one again I know all the babes like seeing my ripped body so I figured I might as well do another one with my shirt off and all that [ __ ] cool you know what's another thing the trolls like you worried cuz I have an email I pull oh my god guess what I flew in a airplane to once we're actually like five times 1/6 Begg got some full melt dry cyst I got some full melt water hash and I have some solvent free clear raw the raw when people are talking the solvent free the clear this kind of stuff when they say raw it's not in the sense of raw like co2 oil where it's not been winterized yet it when they say raw it's because there's no terpenes added to it the process of doing this requires quite a bit of heat and the terpenes actually boil away before this the actual cannabinoid start to boil away so when they collect the cannabinoids is without just no turps so it's just the cannabinoids and there's when I say no Terps I mean under like a half a percent because there is some heavy Terps in there does have a little bit of flavor to not much but they add food great herbs which are the same molecule that Delta limonene that's in [ __ ] weed is the same as Delta Y ammonium that's in oranges and the pine een is the same that's in [ __ ] trees in the [ __ ] Houma meaning is the same that's in hops and [ __ ] go on and on mangos sorry mercian is in weed and mangoes so it's not just been weed so they take the organic food grade terpenes and add them to the oil which to me it kind of tastes a little [ __ ] weird but people who like flavoured lead and like flavored cigarettes and plants and all that [ __ ] they probably would like this there is a big market for it and a lot of people do like I don't like the raw I actually have half ounce right here this is going into pins I have the lid on because I'm buy a [ __ ] swimming pool how clear it is when they say clear the antlion and it's not liquidy I mean unless you're hot it's like sad it's the consistency this was made by extracted up here in Washington usually they'll purify it'll be a hydrocarbon extract meaning like pho butane propane all that's hydrocarbons they'll start with that they'll winterize it with ethanol and then after they winterizing they purge away all the ethanol then they've got an oil that they go and they distill into that and though they day like I said they usually start with their own hydrocarbon extracts but this is actually made with co2 oil so they started with co2 oil first and then did it which in the end product it's got the same color test about the same but the flavor is a little bit different but I'm digging so I'll dab some of that here on a different rig but let me show you what we're working with this is some memory loss rice it right here I've already got it pressed and cut up into dabs then I've got some chain mix or Chavez from conscious extract four star double which is on the dark end now it's in the little square so I'm going to go ahead and start off with a dab of this memory loss it's funny because I held it always keep forgetting with it the strain name is someone was like dude the story behind that must be awesome and it's it's nuts there's not story its if I can face off og which there's where the loss comes from and amnesia haze is the mother the father's face off og the mothers it means you haze so that's where the name comes from go ahead and take a dad starting to feel a minor headache come on not liking that we are dry sniff division you're just fat bag right next to my man boobs sure [Music] nice family ever actually was gonna bring I think there's one more dad left of the CB diesel I was gonna bring that in here and dab it but like long to save that it tastes like cherries even stronger than like pho would so crazy because usually dry SEPTA's like a really awesome flavor of the string and are the way the strain smells and what's funny is that [ __ ] smell more like almost like a diesel a candy you can imagine that and it was a CB diesel but the actual residence weed out that of the straight cherries here we go I'm gonna go ahead and dab this [ __ ] chomp shame it's all mix or whatever one of the bud tenders ain't about dinner anymore well he might still be budgeting is a career but from urban healing he's being working there anymore but one of the buttons that used to work there it was check and I like when I saw cha I don't know if it's cha mix of chain makes but yeah his name is Chad I used to call him Shamu because I used to call the other person Timo and Barger was like dude that sounds like you're saying Jomo that's [ __ ] up and I'm like no dude I'm saying jmo he's like nah dude don't call him that as [ __ ] up somebody calling my children oh yeah here we go dab of chain makes you know I don't know what the strains are in this sure people are gonna ask Wow that was nice [Applause] like that black man have they came into pool yet he's a little sketched out by it not as much as defective red man red man he don't even like coming in at pool half these days in the [ __ ] basement whenever we're in here he freaks out oh yeah when you give black man a bath he just sits in let you spray him with the shower hose and scrubbing down and all that but I think he thinks it's weird what we're swimming around in here I think it looks weird too but yeah he has no problem like being by the pool when we're not in the pool same with Redman like go walk to my room that's my bedroom door right there and that's the basement door so when the dogs come in they come in through there and walk along here go to my bedroom well one day since black max black he doesn't show up good and dark which is a good thing for like intruders and [ __ ] they would be able to see him red man could distract him while black man comes in for the kill so what they do is red man or black man so I was laying right there asleep and I was walking out of here and I stepped on his foot and usually he'll just squeak until you step off his foot but I mean I fell I stepped on him with all my weight and then fell to try to take my weight off him and he was just good like that really loud so I pick him up and he stops at my god I broke his leg to have to cut it off so I thought we were gonna have a little tripod dog which I don't want I mean we keeping all that of course but it would suck if he was already crippled within the next two hours he's jumping if he instead of just going down the stairs all the way he goes down he gets like third or fourth one through the bottom and jumps [ __ ] idiot and then of course he lands on his forearms the one I stepped on so yeah but he hasn't been limping at all since like the first day but yeah we're about digging into that [ __ ] emergency vet thing we've been his arm all around it's all cool but yeah I never heard he make a sound like that before that was crazy so trying to recover because the dab that I'm about to take it as clear as you can see in case I haven't mentioned in on YouTube if you don't follow my Instagram just one tenth barbies already two tenths after the four so it's just one slash right here each slash is two tips there's one two three it's pretty much four point two four point four four point six four point eight five so it was at the four point two and it is 0.51 we're like oh because it's denser than water a milliliter of water is still less than a gram because there's thirty milliliters in an ounce and there's twenty eight point four three or three four grams and uh so yeah a lot of people will go buy milliliter and actually with this is with the note herbs and [ __ ] like that it's pretty damn dense so just let you know that right there is probably 100 milligrams and this ninety-six percent THC so about a hundred and 141 milligrams in one dad how's that gonna go out I think that's gonna work oh boy drink some more of this my grandpa said people who drink so all the other LDL does that drink - so does a day your LDL gotta some of these you like that you smoke pot you're like this much more time to get cancer then uh cigarettes no tell him sit like do because anything can bust me you're in hell of that so you know you don't combust [ __ ] vaporizer after you've explained that to him - but like one time he inhaled some secondhand gadbade word and he started coughing and he's like that can't be good for your lungs it's making me cough can't be good and so he always likes to talk [ __ ] say I'm gonna [ __ ] die and all this room from pot people are weird their whole so here's the oil carb cap the reason task rock put the side hole on here these are the ones that they unfuck dude I talked about the day these debuted at the cigarette house for the pnw Sirica though I'm at the side hole I guess people like know the one holes came out in Denver you're right that's when he dropped those he first came to the seattle cup with the three holes and then made it to the and they didn't have a dabbler they just had the screw from that from the v3 nails forget to it so then he went from there home he said you should just have a dabber on there so he made the dabbers which is these twist ones he made first and then later on he made the straight flat ones and now he is Oliver I mean he has a whole bunch of sick [ __ ] designs but the the sideways one from all the you know the people at the cannabis cups we have the hats all the pins when they're dabbing with these and they throw it on like these tiny rigs it hits their hat so that's what this is for I also like that you can dad cab in with this one you have to do a whole nother [ __ ] 90 degrees which simplify getting stoned so here's the sgw waffle perk v2 speaking of task rock there is the og original email nail let me show you that verse that takes a 16 millimeter coil verse I think this is the 14 millimeter coil right here on the Infinity now you know so two different coils and a lot of people don't understand that that I mean if you both had these if you like let's say you had an email set I mean sorry you had the PID controller set at 600 and you had had this coil plugged in first and let it heat up with this nail head and you unplugged it and then you plug this one in the exact same one exact same temperature the head wouldn't be the exact same temp the way it conducts heat is different these ones actually grip like there's this big piece big mass of titanium underneath the head and that's what the inside of the coil grips these coils are made for injection molds is what they are they keep things warm while they're injecting like hot plastic or all kinds of [ __ ] into them and it's what's the inside that actually heats and so it's gripping versus up here the only thing that's touching is just the head touching the very top of the coil another thing is a lot of people like to tell me my [ __ ] clothes are upside down no they're not the thermocouple the thing that measures the temperature is right at the very end of the coil you see the very end of both of them there's one right there there's one right there that's where it measures temperature and when I throw my carb cap on BC I throw it on here it doesn't touch it watch when I throw it on here since the smaller head remember these heads came out before carb caps came out so did those but those weren't made for emails but so he would have never known that he's gonna make a device that goes and touches it and watch this is gonna turn red here in a minute reason being is it's cooling down the temperature has already dropped 100 degrees on my screen because the titanium is touching the thermocouple a lot of people think my dad is cooling it down right dad let's see it now it's starting to glow reason it's starting to glow is because the PID controller is giving it more power to try to make it go back up to it's at 10:00 when really the nail had never changed his temp the thing that changed his temp was the very end of this thermocouple and it made it think the whole thing was cooled down so something I wanted to say a lot of people [ __ ] don't understand the variables and they think the number on the [ __ ] PID controller is the temperature of the head and [ __ ] just this titanium head versus a brand new one if I put a brand new one on here I got to turn my temperature down 100 degrees because a brand new titanium isn't oxidized and conducts heat the hell of a lot better than oxidized titanium just as your nail gets more oxidized it conducts heat and retains heat a hell of a lot less so a brand new brand new titanium he's going to be able to be at a lower number on your PID controller until it starts to get old and then you're not to either turn it up or replace it so people always think it's replicated and some of them I see the numbers as low as like 200 on the PID controller I'm gonna just the calibrations so my just say 5 and I want to just do that to Falco people said no how are you camera five degrees wouldn't it freeze it like the one this one's 900 and this one's a 780 this was really nightmare degrees they'd be [ __ ] glowing the coil 2 and oh my degrees but that's the number the PID controller says i won in my bedroom has a newer head so I have to have that at a time just because the heads new if I can put this hat on they shoot up to 900 and then the tighter it is against the against the coil means that it makes difference too and also the amount of surface area that's touching it there's just a tiny bit of the coil that's touching it or if you have them flat coils those flat coils touch these a hell of a lot better if you're honored on the Infinity now if you're putting it on a real email then it's actually good to have these kind of coils but I do dig them flat coils I might get one also takes the heat away from my joint by having it all closer to the head I hate these long-ass coils because it's always got the heat right on my giant so I'm gonna put this back over here now that I got then rambling about that when you take this clear uh excuse me Mountain Dew Turks this looks like a tiny [ __ ] dad but you guys saw right there that's a [ __ ] $10 dab if you're buying this [ __ ] retail in Washington where it's [ __ ] 75 $80 goddamn grand for the clear trademark really Cheers the shit's really strong and I'm gonna sleep actually just didn't think of that before it'll be dad probably not that smart he said the cord touching their the coil and then I wouldn't i touch my nail but just quick so I got it just a really quick my finger that I don't really feel yet maybe I'm gonna try it some water why cough Oh I don't know if geckos watching this everyone so well sorry oh yeah well Rose you might be watching this but Hank I didn't seen him post he was telling his fab it's when we already had a sawed it off 4,500 and this is the this is a clear one it's not one of the crazy worked ones but I don't know maybe it was like one of the first generations maybe there's something about it that makes it worth or maybe she's directly whereas Pavan that's how much they're [ __ ] gold for I don't know that would be crazy enough and I've seen someone else offer 6000 on there I'm like oh my god so they're going for that much holy [ __ ] still I don't want rid of this keeps your

richard young said enough for both of us there ain't even enough for me yet oh [Music] born ruthless tube said did you even mix anything up with a drill no that's how you get like [ __ ] that you

the chlorophyll in your hash look how blond even my food grade how blonde that food grade is come on now born ruthless tube said wait have vera tricia world of madness said wow [Applause] that's what i got so far cheeseburger said even wood spoon is too rough cheeseburger said was my first fail green hash i mean i had some hashtag trevor leahy said yup cheeseburger i've had some hash that turned out green when i was finished with it but it cured out and melted beautifully when it was done so how's everybody doing i'm getting tired this is my last book smokey's oaks said plunger breaks radio said why not a drill and a stir because it breaks up the plant material while you're trying to spin it therefore you get plant material in your hash i know what i'm talking about because i've placed corn ruthless tube said how many pounds of trim did you start with cheeseburger said chick break tricia world of madness said take a break dave midweek hype blinky said and power drill blinky said real dono blades mushroom said they thought lol cheriman 89 said might as well go for soda breaks radio said if it's good enough for bubbleman it's good enough for me trevor leahy said power drill makes it terrible blinky said that's why you have a 25 minus 220 micron screen bags to screen out plant matter cheeseburger said and stem wraps around the drill squishing team material other h breaking heads of born ruthless tube said no pieces of green after five bags first off i'm gonna say [ __ ] second off the 220 the 190 the 160 they don't filter out all the plant material just so you know foreign ruthless tube said yup blinky look at somebody's full melt blinky said imagine using a plunger for bubbly hash and the rest is [ __ ] plant material look at a spectral analysis of bubble hash and tell me that you're getting all your [ __ ] green out you're lying to me and you don't know what you're talking about so i'm just going to disregard that fj mayfasan grtg dcf said lol tricia world of madness said dave's knows what he is doing breaks radio said that's why you use gift cards to sift bubble hash to remove rondo plant material trevor leahy said look at it blinky speaks for itself fj mafia sanchez livingsley grtg dcf said used plunger blinky said lm foul dave been making has 23 years and how you do it it's straight tweaker status trisha world of madness said he got this yeah i never said 23 years you [ __ ] idiot 14 years second off whoever the idiot was who just said that the 220 gets all the plant material out well here's the 160 bag see that 160. trevor leahy said lol wow fj mafusang livingsley grtg dcf said please tell me the plunger is new lull see all that plant material in that food grade and this is three bags in so you're trying to tell me that that's that the two [ __ ] 25 gets all the plant material out you're a [ __ ] idiot and you're gonna get banned jesus see that was actually cheeseburger said proof is right there brent balkam said old joke breaks radio said looks like bootleg bubble bags team todd burgundy said dave how burger yeah i blocked the trolls it's all it's all good anyway now that we're back breaks radio said calm down jake come here tank what are you doing come here bud come here hi it's who think they know what's in here go good boy want to see something cool trisha world of madness said ah i got four seven pound bags of ice that's what i made so far all smokeable once it's dried out not this this is good this is good this is the best it's really yeah brent battlegem said it's just closed-mindedness there's a method to dave's madness i doubt he would be doing it this way if it wasn't efficient enough into there and squeeze it out is that i i don't really squeeze nothing what i do is uh put it in here right take it out put that basket on put that in it and then once that's straightened through i pour a little bit of water through it to get the rest of the [ __ ] caught in the plant out and then i take this bag put it somewhere else take the water and run it through all the bags right catch more catch more catch more they're finer and finer screens yeah the first one i put in is the finest 25 45 73 90. i'm not using a 120 today because the first batch i went through um like every different kind of wheat has like different size trichomes right right so like different strains require different bags gives me just a minute to get it like it takes i always have people talk [ __ ] about my plunger never even been in the bathroom but uh no but like it works better plugger gang or life blades mushroom said lag in a bit [Music] but i appreciate him sharing ideas gotcha well you got a lot of debates so far said he never actually said it was the only way definitely not the only way i said that there's many correct ways to do this this is just the best way that i found [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] breaks radio said do you freeze your trim before bucket crack a cold one said so much wasted thc on the ground now i've got more than enough i'm not worried about a splash getting on the ground dude jesus [Applause] crack a cold one said up crack a cold one said bubble hash the grass that got splashed on [Applause] cheeseburger said the grass will be extra green there next [Applause] year [Applause] [Applause] shed gang for life said is the butter ready yet am i making butter i'm making bubble churn in the bubble double bubble toil and trouble we're making a halloween batch [Applause] [Applause] shed gang for life said oh hell to the [Applause] yeah uh brent balcam said the people coming in here insulting and criticizing a differing method seem to have a problem with witnessing a method they don't agree with if their goal was giving usable advice they failed joji said dave is getting a workout today it's because people are afraid of change y'all and like people get caught up in their shitty ways of doing things and they don't branch out and experiment and find better ways to like burgundy said l mouse smoke break kk [Applause] joji said hundred points symbol breaks radio said i'm sure a rubber tipped instrument disturbs the material enough it's not about mixing it the tricia world of madness said this harvest is coming along good vibes dave blades mushroom said they think it's better cause it's easier w a drill superficial exactly yeah no this causes an agitation that goes inward on itself not around which causes less breakage of the plant material that's why a plunger works better the agitation the siphoning agitation is what you want what do i know i've only been doing this 14 years cheeseburger said like when you boil water but cold joji said makes sense to me cheeseburger said rolling cold boil todd burgundy said lol hmm uh said bro you spilling so much todd burgundy said just a little spill that's a drip that's not even a spill joji said thank you for streaming this dave no problem bro any time find it fix it said what's bubble hash brent battlegem said dave has more than enough to not be paranoid about a bit of spillage as tactito said that's a lot of bags todd burgundy said extra protection no you need this is the right amount of bag cheeseburger said i was surprised to see how fast that he's all through the water shed gang for life said magnum as tactito said love the crate technique bro todd burgundy said magnum xl todd

streamer i used to i pretty much cheeseburger said my lull is not like our lull as jake always wins said lol as tactito said the plunger of the gods shed gang for life said i'm glad kato earth globe europe africa moved on finally shed gang for life said elbow cow time as tactito said freezing and sweaty this is going to be some good hash hell yeah you're right bro definitely going to be some fire just by the looks of it right now before it's even done it looks good that means it's gonna be good [Applause] it's the last spin i'm all out of ice after this as jake always wins said looks like

never wins not only does he never win but he has never won joji said hundred points symbol hundred points symbol shed gang for life you're not first to your last [Applause] okay so as tactito said that's such a good idea great life brent battlegem said now if someone could get five ounces of some nice light and fluffy bubble hash out of that then i add maybe take their advice cheeseburger said would snow work shed gang for life said are those calvin kleins yes snow works so much better it's like oh my god uh boston proud said hello thanks for the stream very informative what is this set called to purchase on ebay their gross sun 5 gallon 8 bag bubble bag set search for that it comes out to 30 bucks after shipping cheeseburger said ought to try it snow works better than ice but it's harder to spin be uh breaks radio said colder the better you want the trick homes to separate from the plant okay take this off look at the hash said i didn't get my notification dang youtube keep rocking dave you are doing god's work appreciate that tap cheeseburger lol here's the melties so so so um i did two main strains uh but i i did be total but cheeseburger said like honey all right guys

Fahrenheit so this is bottle tech as you can see and bottle technique applies for four hash to as long as you get it in there right and melt it as you can see very nice very a blond hash hair that was made for trim this is what came off of the 73 micron bag I got one of those new machines those bubble hash machines they're efficient there is no there's way less work so now you got your bottle tech like this as you can see so what you want to do is make it like a package make sure at all press down we can all form this you want to make sure you got your bottle tech down here right and then you want to about 3/4 of an inch about the top I go a little bit less 2/3 of an inch this is that 25 micron bag by the way for a bubble house you want to use twenty seven twenty five or thirty seven I don't have any thirty seven but I'm gonna get some try it out see if I like it better and then you know like a package people fold it like a package bottle tank so we're gonna do some politics with this cheap parchment paper from Dollar Tree by the way I'm drinking a scary crap cider very good and we are business wish smash this is for the guy who sold me the press and such a good deal I told him I would send in something so this one's for you turning I don't like to fold it on the back you want to make sure you got those happy right put it in there make sure that bottle things very very important the bottle technique I'm gonna have to give you guys some [ __ ] speed up photography for this what you have to have to clamp down a little bit on it like that let it let it get some mountain mountain look if I hit my flow out the back what am I looking for I lost my magnets too so after 30 seconds pass blows out so easy people keep that in mind all right the hash blows out I am going to get my hat as you can see here comes payday you have to go down slowly now or you'll blow out for sure I don't know I came to America so we've got squid as you can see people it sure looks like a blowout though I'm giving it more pressure as we go I'm filming you stand right Brendan no thanks don't you know it's not very exciting meal but as you can see very very very blond very nice experience okay about 300 seconds on the squish and I will increase the pressure just a little bit you got to be careful with hatch though it blows out all the time just let it flow or that flow we're gonna flow dr. Bernie's gonna enjoy this it's like I said full milk bubbles turns into five-star rosin and as long as you see bubbles you know it's still producing rosin and I put a lot in there in like four grams let's give it a little bit more pressure look at that all I'm gonna get it though it just looks good see this video is long yes you must feel guilty on happier for what as you can see you blow out on the side anyways thanks DGC i'll catch you next time until then keep on growing", "3icfRUQ_Fu0": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]",

making what I'm gonna call Canadian rock hash in my bucket yeah charge the battery see with rocks rolling around in there them being frozen it's knocking the crystal off the pot it's breaking up the pot here's my bucket see this all I've done is use the handle made a loop put a couple of holes in straight things simple and I keep my camera out I'll show you what comes out of that bucket once the battery's dead it's all broke down anyway so so this is just regular old window screen so this will sort of Li [Music] [Music] and you can see there's very little coming through an out so we put the red bag inside the orange bag inside the yellow bag go inside the back now I want to take this and do it with ya just three cells okay so now this though there's a screw in here and then I bend it over the wire like so because it's a stiff up here I put the cover on okay but no rocks and we're good to go okay so what's your two batteries I wanna get as much of this forum as I can it was like lots of lots of crystal flying crystal that made it through the yellow bag this and it cut the twist tight so that I can straighten out the yellow bag some sweep it off put that in there let's inside the bucket now I want to follow that now I want to put that in a jar and keep it separate it's just like talcum powder it's so fine oh nice smelling stuff but now I'm gonna take this inside and will empty the bags I'm ready there start here you you so this is my little hard wooden mold that I made and so anyway you want to take this out leaving the parchment paper inside the mold you want to be nice and even and there because have not some will confess more than the other okay that's ready to press on my dress just a big old c-clamp that I've abused too much and it's starting to show its age like to centre things up looks pretty much sounder I'm gonna let that set for a couple of minutes okay so that's that for a while yeah and it just happened something my friend good I'm taking this water showed up so we'll take from here and I'll take it over to my right so let's see what you think of this and yeah that's this video right here so you're not on it gave my friend is sungki hash

Ashton it stay tuned for the cameraman videos cuz I got a lot of little projects on the go and I think you'll like some of them", "LBd3nmFBEoU": "so of everybody has a so mash strawberry-banana bubble - that's the first run also had was a two and half ounces of uh smalls left so I'm running it twice since that's the last bit that I have and see how much I can get anyways got poured it back in the bag okay it's like a frosty or icy so people if you don't know what's going on with this you pretty much throw your weed in these bags put a bunch of ice and water in about half and half stir it up or spin it up with the drill whatever whatever you do and it knocks all the THC crystals off of the weed because the ice it freezes the trichrome heads and they break off and they filter through the bags and you get all the different different sized crystals and just all the good stuff comes through and all the UH all the plant material stays in the filter so yeah that's uh", "v2P5EdDkkZ8": "so my battery not the battery of the camera has ten minute increments so here's the next part we're still giving all our the water out of the rarest bag so catching the other parts of this series and see the process all the way through let's see how easy it is it takes a little time the effort is worth this water this cold was a mountain stream so you're talking about the water from it you can use it like in your bath or medicated that you can't heat it that to them that help heat up the water first [Music] it's like a herbal tea yeah oh my god that is a jackpot what is the beautiful beautiful okay there's a good shot yeah there we go all right okay let's see let's see it onto the parchment so we take it and put it on the parchment so the dry and it takes it dries overnight so so at least overnight it up to fight it can take it's like five days either to depending on the weather like if you've got humid weather and it might probably take longer and you could put it in the oven I'm sure you did that once um mess with the integrity of it as long as you keep it like say under what 200 degrees or so yeah I keep you ready to to partake in it right away and you don't wait no that smells good I got some of it on my hands it's really interesting this process it is and how much different the effects can be sometimes and just regular flour but like I've said before that I've had flour that's been just as powerful as hash just depends on the strain but yeah the last time we had made this it was really strong very nice and a lot of people have been deciding to partake in hashes of [Music] slight drinking as an alternative for me not to not saying completely drink stop drinking that I mean some people use that as a method of just cutting down on how much alcohol they consume personally I'd drink less yeah thank you have access to medication definitely that done it's been a very productive I just rather just bathe in it I you know I yeah the timing of this video is turning out really well cos we're losing light mosquitoes are out big-time sadly we'll have to wait a while for this to be ready again yeah it's nothing is it's worth the effort it's worth the wait it's definitely no this is a great way for the end of having a lot of it's a great way that's nice oh look I'm a to use what maybe wouldn't be that good total oh you know low-grade or secondary yeah that's what it's good for stuff that say wouldn't be marketable yeah that you you know I wouldn't give to a patient not as strong yeah but well in this form you could give it to a patient totally when you do this process it um it's in its concentrated form so it's gonna be stronger just like anything like in you know when they make herbal tinctures to know a little bit left that's cool a little double do here so yeah I'm thinking that I'll probably conclude this video okay so um thank you guys for joining us today I hope you found this informative and helpful and know that it's pretty it's fairly easy to do I get to do is have a supply of herb and a little bit of patience all righty we will let when this dries and raise your smoke will will show you what it looks like and will tell you the effects of it so we'll do a video on that too so stay tuned for that have a great day guys peace"}
