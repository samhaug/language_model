{"n1MoumCl-3A": "hi welcome to grief alienation your trusted source for CBD reviews in education I'm Christina and today I'm going to talk about muscle freeze from Mary's Nutritionals but before I do that please like this video and subscribe to our YouTube channel as a cannabis coach and a mom I try everything that I put in and on my body as well as the people that I serve my clients and my family so I'll talk about the good first when I was ordering from Mary's nutritional it was really easy to order it was well priced thirty five bucks for a 1.5 ounce bottle with a pump top and it arrived to my home really quickly I like that now the branding is beautiful so this is something that I would be able to give to a friend or a family member which I didn't really like to do with happen hemp extract but other than its looks what I also look for is things like ingredients and dosage to be clearly articulated so I see all the ingredients listed the instructions are to apply generously over the affected area and I also have the manufacturing information distribution it's made in the United States love it and I tried this this is the muscle freeze for Mary's nutritionals and first the good I think that the dosage amount is good I used one full pump and it really covered a very large area you sit on my back my shoulders my hips and my legs a little goes a long way with this product so use it sparingly I've also been using this on some of my smaller muscle groups to alleviate some pain and inflammation from repetitive movements so I basically use about a quarter dose here just a little squeeze and it is very potent Lee fragranced with some camphor there's a lot of different ingredients in here one of them it has that very medicinal scent to it kind of eucalyptus menthol camphor I don't love the scent but I don't mind it very much if you really dislike that type of scent profile this might not be the product for you however it takes a minute to absorb so careful around your clothing when you're applying it but once it gets absorbed it's pretty good it's not really greasy it does take a little while to get in there but feels nice moisturizer this as well what I like about it is that because of that camp for you have a cooling sensation wherever you place the product so you know where you're putting it and in in that toque and I do like it a lot now a couple things that I don't like so much about this product this scent is really overwhelming if you want to clear your sinuses as well as your inflammation it definitely might do that for you so if you are sent a verse or you really don't like a very camp for eucalyptus scent this might not be for you but it does do as it says it's going to do it works it seemingly I needed to reapply it after maybe an hour or two so it didn't work for terribly long so this is not for a cute muscle pain I would say more of a therapeutic everyday kind of want to avoid muscle soreness from working out or some minor trauma I think it's great there's only 75 milligrams of activated and extract in here so it's not super super potent but that might explain it I do like the overall feeling of the product my husband liked it too and I even used it on my daughter's legs after her soccer practice so all in all yes for 35 dollars I would definitely buy this product and enjoy it so have you tried this product if you have leave your own review in the comments again the give us video a like and subscribe to our YouTube channel thanks again from Green Valley nation", "CJo6u2QZ78A": "what's up everybody welcome back to another strange city review guys today reviewing the good old mary's mussel fries had this for a good bit now guys I would say about a month good things about this right off the top one got 71 milligrams almost 72 milligrams of just CBD only two milligrams of THC for those people that are kind of skeptical about how THC and CBD counteract each other you would definitely be safe with this 3 it feels so good the cooling factor is definitely a plus as a topical because it is a very soothing sound like a girl there is a very cooling feeling and it feels good on pain I don't know it just ices feels good ice has always been you know a good thing for you know D inflammation so the cooling factor really helps with the surface level pain and then that CBD works really well over about a 30 minute period to about an hour period to kick in and just fully attack that pain guys and that's basically what CBD does is is reduces inflammation and and I mean it's one of the main one of the main cannabinoids it's one of the the most important cannabinoids along with tetra hydro cannabinoid or cannabidiol sorry so either way it's an important cannabinoid guys and CBD is just CBD is that's what it is so basically this comes from elite the elite line of Marys which I do believe comes with it is made with him I could be wrong I tried the elite patch and the elite line I do believe was yeah I'm not surprised so don't quote me on that but I do believe that um that it's made with him but is a very very good cream guys very very reasonably priced twenty-five dollars available at doctor's orders silver stem life flower a lot of places carry this a lot of places that I review carry this so please guys go check them out go hit them up get you some air use medicinal muscle freeze peace guys that's gonna be it for this review if you like this video give it a thumbs up below and subscribe for more bye guys", "gYRxVaqA5Ss": "you're America's most please a little bit about Mary when he started in Denver Colorado almost seven years ago at this point and we produce in 11 states right now we actually are one of the if not the farthest reaching cannabis company out there in terms of geographical and so it's pretty awesome if you guys have friends and family in other states the Kennedys infrastructure we are more likely there we really always just been about providing the accessibility to or really high quality cannabis medicine so diving right into the product line there's really two concepts to understand when talking with learning and talking about Mary's medicinals so the first one is going to be transdermal cannabis versus topical campus can any of you guys kind of speak to those suits about difference at all you look it's formulated no any other guesses good afternoon we going through this game rather than just on the skin you're absolutely right and so there actually isn't biochemistry to this cannabinoids and molecules are actually too large to absorb past your dermis and epidermis which are the top two layers of your skin so traditional cannabis topicals that's as far as they go there is no concern for failing a drug test or any kind of euphoric high feeling with a normal topical Merida's products are truly transdermal we actually a carrier agents in our change circle audacity of 3x it's a pageant the transdermal gel offense and the other transdermal compound where there are carrier agents that actually push the cannabinoids and the terpenes seven to ten layers deep so they actually are able to reach the bloodstream our identity the patches and it comes atiba gel pens actually do have a high associated with them because the medicine actually get into the bloodstream other THC probables he won't get either of those effects because of the nature does that make sense to everybody okay the second concept to understand it's called bioavailability is anybody know what that word means nobody does it's not automatic so bioavailability is the rate at which a substance absorbs into your bloodstream into your body okay so it very easily aim to create products and her high rate a file of a liability so more efficient delivery methods of cannabis for more efficient absorption into your body so to put it into context for you guys topical products so brands like public or the dr. Kirkland and Hannah various muscle trees in particular these are true topicals so they have a 0% rate of bioavailability none of the cannabinoids or the terpenes are getting past those layers of skin so nothing is getting into the bloodstream okay I don't know cannabis products and this one usually surprises most people in the industry only about a 10 percent rating of bioavailability and you swallow an animal Canada's product almost 90% of the cannabinoids in the terpenes get destroyed by stomach acids and digestive enzymes before they reach your bloodstream smokeable so cartridges concentrates and flowers only about a thirty percent rate their bioavailability he loses more than half of those cannabinoids that you're purchasing and putting into your body so clothes are about a 60 percent amazing in true transdermal fake berries are almost 100% bioavailability so that's why our products may seem like their lower dosage you know our dolmens are only a two milligram our capsules are only five milligrams are passionate only 10 to 20 milligrams they are designed to absorb so much more efficiently than other traditional cannabis methods but you're able to not only start with a lower milligram of cannabis but maintain in a similarly low dose of cannabis throughout the first-ever gifts so if you're somebody that's using cannot relate therapies or cannabis every single day and I'm using a product I love berries you're able to use less cannabis which means you're going to cannabinoid system is gonna stay more reactive or more responsive your tolerance for things stay lower and ultimately your concert and stay lower as well that make sense to everybody yeah so that's really the whole product of our life we're kind of excited spaced more so than any other company out there that I know of and we really are at this very patient focused for all those reasons I just mentioned you know for me I've been used the identity trio system anything for chronic pain of be using the same time milligram going to one pouch for six years ten milligrams maintains to be micros so you'll notice with those other methods and just mentioned like had a balls and smokeable bill senses methods in particular you have to consistently increase the amount that you're consuming increase your dosage to get the desired effect and it's because of the low rate of bioavailability all right so if you forget to grab all right so no latex no silicone so they're really really allergy only occasionally we do he's lowering people that have an allergy you're kind of like an edge to it or more than lengthy alerted to be adhesive and these people more than often know that they have an incineration issue but other than that would work really hard over the past six years to eliminate any kind of skin irritant allergies and things like that so they all look like this there's no markings online so they're really really history they all are maybe distillate as well except for THC is and to not to GU car during this deletion there is a huge difference between ours and Papa Marcus if you guys are familiar with their capsules at all or if you're not spot specific you want to actually put the patches in one of two places on your body either on the inside of the wrist right here or kind of on like the top side of your foot right there where you have thin skin and a lot of things Kaname with attraction absorbency fat so if you put a patch on like a sore shoulder or your back or the hip or wherever it may be the cannabinoids will just go into the FAQ and ask you what you think they won't get into your bloodstream that make sense to everybody so you just want to make sure the various things clean with the patch on their heat sweat and water-resistant I wear my patches spinning if you guys have ever done I exposed a penny before you get like really trippy sweating is gross that's what I think my a child playing on they say that's what they're designed for they're designed for active people active lifestyles you can also cut our patches down to the huge difference between ours and protein bar please they are come on Leslie dose and if you cut the patches down at all activate that so if you wanted to cut a patch in half which I'll tell you why you might want to for some people in some precious if you're the kind of patch in half or a quarter you'll get a half or a quarter of the cannabinoids but you'll still maintain that 8 to 12 hour time frame that I just provided typically is about 30 minutes for people to start feeling the patch as soon as you put it on the heat of your skin it starts to activate starts to activate and then destined to 8 to 12 hour time release goes into the body questions so far on that oh cool so in terms of the dosing because of the higher rate of bioavailability the intensity of harvies are twenty milligrams at 10:00 those 10 and 20 milligram dosages are worth a lot more when you're comparing them to traditional Canada suggestion methods so we've created a really easy tool for you guys to use and it's a one to ink ratio so one transdermal milligram infirmary's is equivalent to about 8 milligrams and you're comparing it to an average of the smokeable or inaudible so let's take the 20 milligram independence atiba patches multiply that 20 milligrams by 8 this is working about 160 milligrams of a dose spread out evenly and slowly for 8 to 12 hours but comparing it to inaudible or smoke law so for most people especially into constitutive patches you may want to suggest that knock them down and again quarters half however small or large whatever shape you want it's totally homogeneously just so you can kind of go with the flow on that one even with the less of the non psychoactive project you may find that we have a quarter or half a one 200 th the a patch is enough and if people are able to use less cannabinoids or less of the dose safe than money keeps to end up in our plant system more responsive tolerance lower sets are gonna make sense okay another good question I used to get it to the bartender a long time was if I kill the patch off which is this is one method of cannabis or if you're not enjoying in fact there's no reasoning can kill the patch off that'll stop dispensing the medicine into the bloodstream the question I always get is can you put the patch back on sure you can he said they have just kind of worn off a little bit so you might have to put it like an ace bandage or a go pad or something like that so hope to those parlor that is the patches will go to the different canal events at the ends it's kind of a class to everything the gel pens these look a little bit intimidating but they're actually a very simple and super cool product we actually have a US patent number for the cannabinoid application of this product that's pretty cool if you guys ever want nerd out and take ten minutes to look it up it's written right on the packaging for you so there's no needle in here I just say that because these kind of look like that be tender in fact these are totally pain-free what's in here called transdermal gel pen that's really want kind of like a lotion or cream consistency that's in here it's the same concept as the patch however these only take about five minutes to kick in so if you somebody with who the escalating anxiety or panic attacks you know epilepsy with a preemptive breakthrough pain anything that requires that really rapid onset so the process after you cannabis products after a simple so how they work cap pops off this end just twist back and forth to lock and unlock when it's locked you can't press it down when it's unlocked if it comes to coffee mechanism there's fifty measured pumps in here it just spits out like a pea-sized amount of lotion I like to do it right on my wrist rub it in it's not greasy or green or it's actually just smells like terpenes rub it in it's going into your bloodstream the guys without five-minute onset so typically tomorrow 3:00 to 5:00 hour dose window so fast you're acting shorter lasting really incredible on the door - it really you do you want to stick to that restore talk with what occupation but we definitely had a lot of people find success for cluster headaches and migraines and things like that finding a job in medicine all the time Bulls were kind of like behind the ear area also the CV each open in particular for things like cystic acne small co-stars rashes skin issues this is transdermal not just topical - expedient product a lot deeper than - topical one questions there okay last but not least with the transdermal my favorite product which you guys do have it you guys did order it but it's a slight delay it should be here this week or next week so called compound it's a one-to-one CBD THC this is a bomb it's these fastening but whatever they switch these doctors actually the thing that's pulling about right now going into but this is a spot specific option whereas these two I got but because it's change dermal runner you're applying this product it's gonna push this cannabinoid seven to ten pairs deep so we thought people that use it for things like Crohn's disease colitis and a new trio says because of the trends that will ensure wherever you're putting it it's pushing they're making so much deeper so it can actually reach muscles connective tissues in joints so every one of the products I've described thus far all of the transdermal products would absolutely call the real drug test the only product in our line that would not is the muscle freeze which I'll talk about now topical and not a trade journal so to see you guys are aware the large minister no TPS quite the opposite role on this moment is just kind of like a nice easy bottle but it's a cooling CVD topical so I'm sure you guys are pretty familiar with what to use chemicals for inflammation muscle spasms you could use this for something that extent but our skin irritation as well but since this is a true topic will even batch to batch of there's teeth a little bit of th in it because there's some truths don't want it to it there is no concern of filling the drug task or any kind of high okay great question you buy those two all right our teachers are really incredible we have three they're all vegan and sugar-free the oil means smooth without a little bit tipsy team sure what you guys are going to get in as well lemon-lime flavor the sugar-free aspect makes it really good for people that are diabetic or that have dietary restrictions they are the dropper is our measure to see the lines there hopefully but I believe the doping on this one it's a cornered robber is it's just under 70 milligrams so there's about 60 to 70 milligrams per dropper which is today that it's very very competitively priced so she doesn't have that problem that we have really awesome capsules as well CBD and CBN and let's talk about CDN first I didn't know where it comes from yeah so CBN is actually degraded to HD with THC ages or it is exposed to keep away or we actually fake it ourselves at Mary's teach the actually chemically converts into a whole other cannabinoid with different properties so we have really special ovens and we also test the equipment in how seminaries so we're basically taking huge Pyrex dishes full of THC oil or distillate and basically begging it so I think the reason you don't see a lot of companies in cheap seats using CDN products is because it takes them incredibly long time to make CDN it takes about one hour to convert one gram of THC in stevia and we also lose about 30% of the actual oil during boat called the bake-off so but when that happens when the chemical conversion happens tht loses almost I'm sorry okay now we wouldn't lose almost 90% of the euphoric or the hi feeling from THC but it becomes about seven times more sedative when it's in CBN form so additionally deviant only receives into cb2 receptors which are going to be in our body and our brain so if you feel asleep in it absolutely is before it but you feel it like the muscle relaxer type of fat person any kind of cerebral and then they know what's again might be good for terms of issues sweet good one so in terms of sleep you can actually even actually do stage 4 around sleep which is really interesting to me because tht we're seeing an obviously derived from TV even actually block our brains from to me whereas even can give us into that eat later sleep where we are or to be more loose that you're more back with each other which is very interesting other issues TVA can be great for medicating I'm a severe spasmodic issue for the Parkinson's or multiple sclerosis epilepsy tremors Tourette's things like that before you can also see deity use this alcohol replacement you get that nice relaxing the sedative effects without having to consider the whole which is a really nice option for a lot of people it can be great for treating anxiety you know and we make a really awesome set of CBM products that can really be tailored because it is sedative you know depending on how you're using it and while you're using it with it absolutely will cause you to be drowsy and scented sedated and possibly fall asleep but we make products like the gel pen or the patch that you can cut down where if you are running benefit from it during the day some of those spasmodic it was anxiety issues you can absolutely tailor a CD Empire to whatever you're looking for something to note about CBN it will actually increase the psycho activity or the euphoric sense of tht so opposite of how cbet you see work together well CBD will kind of really negate the high THC when these two are working together if you're using THC along this kind of CBN and you're definitely going to increase that I feel so using that as the warning labels really important but also a lot of bartenders a book on this initiative tend to have higher tolerances the most we could perhaps incorporate CBN into your regimen while using THC to increase the high feeling that use less THC to get there so lots of different leads to either that make sense to everybody well our capsules are made in such a way that they don't get broken down the stem across its we use equipment interior coating so they're only dosed at five milligrams because of the way that they're made stomach acids don't touch them they go all the way to the small intestine and that is the most absorbent part of our GI tract so you're absorbing almost all of that five milligram dose versus another or possibly doesn't use that technology so again being able to use less and less and consistently use that lower dose in this last but not least our baits are free about off so just showing these to a couple of me with the second row but we have three variety THC one to one committee of CBN and three to one DVD so our moths previously adjustable voltage on the battery and wrought iron chopper so if you have people that are looking for really exact ways to dose the raves this is a comment from Maryland we take a hit a little up to ten seconds max which ten seconds is actually quite a long hit people literally that's nothing but there was like a challenge so the CBN Bank is obviously a big hit for for big reason TV and movie was pretty incredible for the relaxing trying to fall asleep withdrawal from opiates or alcohol or nicotine things like that just a really awesome combination that's with those two that was just so you guys are aware all of our CVE we have special folks that have created genomics specifically for marries everything is from outdoor pesticide free and organic & Chandon which is violet Passover walls here in California again we are CBN in-house so that really sets us apart in terms of the quality typically our CDE tests out about 80 dating products percent in distillate form so this product in particular one of our other teachers called the remedy the original remedy this has 500 milligrams of CBD at 215 doses just one single drop is a 2 milligram see videos so just to kind of give a percentage of the potency and the concentration there yeah there's really no not many other that go to bat or an expense to is your Auggie and Reese's TV products so that's always kind of set us apart always looks bayberries dude it smells really a top-quality line so yeah I'll open it up for questions now with the gel pens where would be the best place to put it same loss on the wrist or on but for someone who was having like they have to look yeah mr. the [ __ ] really the best I just like doing the restaurant just go like this but you're exactly right for somebody that has an image so many different uses for it but yeah those are really the best places though those water off like headaches or migraines you can go here here but the transdermal czar really designed to go into the bloodstream so hot in those areas within the skin and a lot of things within the ideal also in touch on th da ask you guys what do you guys know about it so it's HBO completely naughty for it it doesn't know there's no kind of using you for it instead of psychoactive everything you put in our bodies a psychoactive whether it has high or anything for you to it is what berries they're so th you won't have any honey bee for a sense to it it's really similar in effect to see ETP you can get the appetite stimulation there it can help you have help with pain or neurological condition new disorder it can be great for muscular recovery as well so it actually helps with circulation to flush out lactic acid so if you get in like an accident or if you're starting to work out or you're going skiing for the first time of a season or something like that we've got so much for tht is a really incredible products and then has a nice bit of energizing faculty to it where a CPU kind of talked a little bit about their do you for some people so it's a really cool one to try if somebody is using a CVD regimen and their tolerance is building or not they're not getting the desired effect they once were THD is always been excellent I'll recommend incorporating it's really an awesome canal element that I think gets forgotten about and the reason that we only have th PA and a patch and not anything else is because it can so easily activate there are other edible companies out there I think your company and specifically excuse me where they recommend that not even anything caught for like an hour before or an hour after through using the THC a teacher because it can actually activate in your body and the th deactivates it becomes THD so it becomes it goes from a product that's somebody's intending to not get that high turn it into a sellout keeping into the passion allows for a lot speed really a way to use it alright well that's all I've got for you guys are busted is full of great information you", "SPEIJirIB9A": "what's up everybody today we're covering topicals and i got a couple in front of me from two different dispensaries as well on my left here we have mary's medicinals muscle freeze that's from Liberty Health Sciences and on the right and the box we have the move a rosemary mint hydrating cream I've really enjoyed both of these but for surprisingly different reasons so I'm gonna start with the rosemary mint it has a refreshingly cool effect after applying and this one lasts it seems to be about 1/2 like 3 hours but it's not really any noticeable effect really I used it regularly after a sunburn because one of the ingredients in here is a lobe bard aloe and I didn't have any of the stinging or pain or anything that really normally goes along with sunburns the application area is a lot more hydrated noticeably after like two to four hours and after a few days of regular use it seemed like my sunburn kind of went away a lot faster than my family's pain relief is minimal at best it's great for like sunburns and kind of those right on top of your application sight pains but as far as like my stomach cramps and muscle pain it didn't really seem to do a whole lot to that deep-rooted pain if that makes any sense rosemary mint is a super soothing smell and I really liked it it was a great lotion to use on my face as well keep that hydrated I know that's pretty important hydrating seems to be the name of this lotions game if that makes sense it doesn't have any intoxicating effects that I could ever feel move does have another line called the evolved lineup that does they have application gel that basically goes into your bloodstream that sounds interesting maybe I'll review that in the future this one is a one to one so it's a THC and CBD mix and it's blended with antioxidants green tea vitamin E safflower oil shea butter so all kinds of stuff that you'd regularly find in like other kinds of lotions so it's definitely more on loschen side of the topical spectrum moving forward into the Mary's medicinal this is an outstanding cream and if you guys are looking for like the medical side of medical marijuana this really feels like it when you use this it has kind of the Vicks VapoRub kind of menthol smell and it has a really really neat cooling effect as soon as it goes on and it's really really soothing I highly recommend this honestly I've been using it everyday for about a month and I have been so impressed with it the initial onset is very cool soothing after about 30 to 40 minutes it has a warming and relaxing effect it's really hard to explain it's kind of unlike anything else the long-term relaxation is really great with this I can use it in the morning and go out and run errands for a few hours and be great the whole time it really works to hit that deep-rooted pain I was mentioning earlier and totally totally knock out my stomach cramps any muscle pain I had any back pain all that stuff it was really really impressive as soon as this bottle is done I'm gonna be going back for the larger bottle that definitely seems like it's worth the investment to me I used this overnight if I wake up with cramps and I try to go back to sleep with a little bit of it it really works great as you can see the dispenser is pretty small it's my iPhone 4 scale it fits my fanny pack if it's in a medicine cabinet and it doesn't have very many medical marijuana markings on it at all so it's pretty cool pretty discreet I really like this product that's pretty much it for this video I did pick up some of the blue crumble from move I'm gonna be doing a review on that I still have other flower reviews coming like true leaves green crack flower pure leaf Afghani and a couple other moves brought still subscribe to

release of lactic acid into the muscles which helps alleviate inflammation spasms and soreness as an athlete maker Matt Haider was familiar with that post-workout muscle fatigue and decided to combine the methods he knew worked I started this company out of my own self needs so I was playing basketball one day and caught a knee right in the leg or a stinger and try the typical recovery method such as a lacrosse ball a foam roller and ice I just couldn't find the relief I was looking for and being a former athlete training at the highest level playing multiple sports I knew what I wanted and nothing was out there use it virtually anywhere on your body free roll it or place it in a specially designed rubber grip your hand doesn't get cold I used it after my workout and found it super

which I know is not a marathon but still I run outside and running on the pavement often hurts my knees so I'm was looking for a solution that I could apply on the you know pain area directly and so

250 milligram at $44.99 and the 750 milligrams at 70 799 their cream is a blend of CBD menthol and arnica and that's what provides that rapid cooling effect and really helps with joint and muscle discomfort I just rub it on my knees right after a run and it provides instant relief and usually it lasts for a couple hours and then after that the pain is gone for the day also with this one the menthol smell isn't too strong so you can just apply it after a shower in the morning and head off to work no problem and as with all other matera products these guys are 100% natural and organic they don't contain any THC they are made in the US and they provide the 30-day money-back guarantee in 4th place we have nano crafts cooling sports cream this one is $59.99 for 500 milligram which is great if you need an in-between dosage from Matara this one has a pump dispenser like the matera one so that makes it really easy to dose and apply the cream this one is also made in the US with non-gmo all organic ingredients meaning that it doesn't contain any pesticides herbicides or chemical fertilisers etc and they also provide the 30-day money-back guarantee in third place we have another product from nano crafts it's the muscle and joint bundle so this one is great if you're already convinced and want to take it one step further so this bundle includes the broad spectrum CBD soft gel capsules with curcumin these are packed with 25 milligrams of CBD which is perfect for daily and consistent consumption to make sure that you have a smooth start to your day they also have the broad-spectrum pure CBD drops which are also packed with 25 milligrams of CBD another way to consume CBD if you're out of capsules you can just take a few drops as is there ginger sytrus flavored or you can simply

CBD brands they have a ton of product variety to choose from so the ultra relief gel comes at $59.99 for a thousand milligrams of CBD this one is great if you're looking for big CBD dosage at an affordable price the smell is not overpowering the pump makes it really easy to use and you can really feel the cooling sensation in this one I really recommend it for like intense pains so if anything is keeping you up at night then that's probably a good gel to buy and then in first place I chose the CBD infused pain cream so this one comes at 1199 for a hundred milligrams of CBD that's a really good option for like small pains but is also super affordable if you're just looking to get started or unsure about CBD in general then you might want to you know get started with this one and see how you feel and then just work your way up to a bigger dosage this is also a really good option if you're not comfortable with the oil format it's really easy to use and spread on your area of pain I started to feel the effects about 15 to 20 minutes after I applied the cream after my run and then I was good for the day so I really recommend this cream or any of the five that I listed in

everyone welcome to the session on Goldie and I'm Sarah and today we have special guest Ally green stone in the lounge from our favorite company on the market marries and medicinals okay thank you guys so much for having me I'm really happy to be here with you of course we're so we were so happy to have you and um today Holly's gonna tell us a little bit about the Mary's product line but first she's gonna tell us a little bit about the history of Mary's meds so um how did Mary's get get it started yeah so we're just about three years old now which is pretty amazing headquartered here in Denver Colorado just so everybody knows we're in seven other states right now which is pretty amazing but how we started is actually pretty funny it was from a bet so our two female founders Lynn and Nicole we're out to dinner I believe and they are talking about the cannabis industry and you know how many products are coming out that could really help people with medicinal issues like epilepsy and I believe it was just based off of a bet somebody bet I bet that we could make a cannabis patch and now three years later here we are with a full line of transdermal products that are all over the country which is pretty amazing very cool very cool and tell us a little bit about the different products that you have in front of us here sure yes we have quite a big line now over here is our staple product which is a transdermal patch which we have six different kinds and what we do with Mary's we really focused on cannabinoid specific products so we only have a few items that actually solely focus on THD we isolate those other parts of the plant like CBN CBD THC a cvce all parts of the plant that are traditionally non psychoactive to really benefit folks looking for the medicinal benefit without necessarily getting high so the transdermal patches we have our transdermal gel pens we have our CVC compound and our muscle freeze which are meant for spot specific use we have our been video oil which is a tincture CBD and CBN capsules we have powder products the whey protein and our good greens which are to be mixed with beverages kind of like a juicing alternative and a protein supplement and we have our new CBD distillates which are meant to be dabbed and last but not least our rescue product which helps to bring you down if you're too high from THC all right which is really good for those who are for other states that haven't really tried edibles and maybe accidentally eat a few too many because they're delicious we've got a nice little cure exactly it's also safe for animals to use too so god forbid that situation but it's your dog or cat or about that gets into your edibles pouch or eats a brim shatter the Mary's rescue product can be a great way to just eliminate their anxiety that's good to know yes great to men yes a high dog is a very scared dogs very scary so I mean this is definitely kind of like a lifestyle product I mean Goldie and I are always recommending different Mary products for our local sessions right it's a great way to discreetly get high while you're out and about in the city I'm why would you say people are choosing meds I mean we do see it as like a lifestyle but why are you saying sure absolutely I think you guys are totally spot on with that Mary's products are really meant to be in people's lives consistently these are products that people are relying on for their quality of life whether it be pain relief home with anxiety related issues sleep even more severe things like diabetes and cancer and epilepsy these products are really more like a dietary supplement their your multivitamin they're your medicine so people really have a lot of brand loyalty with Mary's which is why people continue to use our products like the early in and request our products my name oh yeah well I know yeah um so what is your most popular product sure definitely so you know we're mostly known for our transdermal patches this one here is CBN but I believe our most popular is our full CBD patch and our one to one which is equal parts THC and CBD which is amazing for pain relief without any psycho activity and then after that the remedy oil this one right here this is our sublingual CBD tincture just one drop one or two times a day is the dosing and there's two hundred and fifty doses in here which is pretty amazing this one you can also use topically if you want I know we have a pretty incredible testimonial with a facial melanoma patient this one is safer animals to use too but in terms of the quality of CBD that we use and the concentration there's really nothing else like it in terms of cost effective 'ti and just quality of CBD product out there so that one and then lastly the CBC compound I believe is our one of our top sellers is the spot specific treatment for pain muscle spasms GI issues like Crohn's colitis IBS and maybe trio sis cramps skin issues it's a transdermal topical so it works a lot differently than traditional cannabis topicals for a really more inside out approach so this is my personal favorite as well so you can find all these products on the recreational side as well as medicals yeah our line is actually identical in terms of the dosing in terms of pricing everything is the same for us we were really about accessibility so we want everybody on medical and recreational to have an equal opportunity for our products and as well as marriage Nutritionals and mary's pets people who want access to more CBD products through our sister companies have access globally which is pretty incredible so you can actually order your mary's Nutritionals and Mary's pet line online perhaps oh very nice yeah and then that can be sent to all 50 states all 50 states and other countries that allow hemp products we take that same CBD oil which we source from here in Loveland Colorado which is incredibly high quality and we have another facility that's not a marijuana facility we remove even the slightest trace of THC that exists in hemp oil and we basically have just duplicated the lines so we have CBD patches the gel pen we have a CBD compound the remedy and a few other products on there the muscle freeze which is apparently one of the most popular ones that ship legally to all 50 states and pretty much everywhere in the world which is pretty amazing that is incredible and I actually heard something and I don't know if it's true that Mary's meds is actually the fastest growing company behind Eber and lift I have not heard that that's amazing I actually heard that from Nicole really actually yeah Wow one of one of the owners of Mary's meds yeah she said that um it's like one of the fastest growing companies in the world right now I believe that with Nutritionals I mean and the global accessibility there I mean we have people from different countries coming in to see our facility and talk business weekly Colombia Brazil Canada the UK Australia I mean CBD is an incredible is an incredible thing that's not illegal and so we're able to grow really high-grade CBD here in Colorado that can be shared with everybody just incredible Wow fastest growing ally on what are some of the ailments that you hear that this product line helps less sure and so of course everything that that we can share about cannabis and results are purely based off patient testimonials there is not available research now so I do have to say that but my god it's a huge range of ailments things like diabetes and cancer may actually just released our newest primer that talks about the four ways that cannabinoids actually attack and prevent cancer cell growth it's not just treating the chemotherapy symptoms or the pain anymore you can actually treat cancer with cannabis but popular ones that we recommend are products for multiple sclerosis fibromyalgia diabetes is one of they're doing a lot of studies with with inner neuropathic symptoms as well as the blood sugar regulation but anxiety related issues OCD PTSD ADHD and a DD can commonly be benefited with a CBD regimen pain inflammation really those are almost like the goat cheese now they're like the basic ones it's just pain sleep issues um hormonal issues it's unbelievable how many things we have testimonials for I love that well we certainly love the line and I am I find line to be very balanced so for anyone out there that is curious or interested in kind of trying out the marriage line on what I can tell you is on the full lioness balance it's not going to throw you off in any direction and it's really just there to kind of alleviate a pain or elevate your mood or just enhance your life enhance your life yeah it's there to enhance your life right though as really say we highly recommend that you patch up it's like the greatest thing twice bread sure thank you guys for all the love and you know something I can say we we really believe that we have a product for everybody we do have products that will get you high if you want to come back we just put it in a more therapeutic and discreet manner like our gel pens that indicate gel pens one little pump you know and it's a time release those for four to six hours so it's a lot different than an audible or a smoke that kind of coming waves or taper off quickly you know or the other products you make that will get you stolen but may help a lot better than a teepsy regimen for truly medicinal needs more eye care yeah I mean is so Ali I know that you have the merriest medicinal line in the marries nutritional line but you also mentioned that you had a pet line yes we do so we've one product right now under the marries pets line suit anymore from what I know but this is technically under the nutritionals umbrella so it is a product that's available in all 50 states to ship as well as other countries to so we've essentially duplicated the transdermal CBD gel pen and we cut the dosing in half to be able to cater to animals as small as five pounds and it's only using CBD so it's non psychoactive and it can be used for arthritis anxiety seizures and epilepsy in any kind of animal so this has been incredibly popular we all know how much money we would spend and what we would do for our animals in our pets so this has been a really wonderful product to have on the market with our incredible CBD that's grown you know and I'm sure it's great for high anxiety pets which I know a lot of people especially out here have yes with storms going in the car fireworks rescue animals oftentimes suffer from anxiety related issues that older dogs or younger dogs that deal with pain arthritis post-surgical we've really found this is a great way to to medicate you actually pump the gel on their inner ear is if you're giving them an ear rub and it absorbs it to their bloodstream right there for an extremely fast-acting dose so I'm just doing a nap can you also use it with tap yes any kind of animal so typically my dogs dogs are what I mentioned cuz I'm a dog mom but cats rabbits horses any kind of animal this product has been proven to be safe for so yeah that's a problem yes I like it we all have been Oh cannabinoid system so our bodies as mammals are meant to process these types of things so there's no reason that it couldn't be used and there's literally product for everybody yep okay I like it well Ali thank you so much for coming into the lounge and explaining this product line to our guests because um we love it it's like it's definitely the best I don't think we can recommend it enough no we can so if you do end up coming on a tour you will hear all about this again but everyone thank you again for joining the session as always we love having you tune in please continue

and showed you guys in the unboxing videos earlier this week this is a one-to-one CB n to CBD distillate vape and this is actually the first pax product that we have in the state so they come in these little pods they're specifically for use in the pax era device so far so good I've really enjoyed using it this week so I wanted to start off and kind of explain the effects of CB n the way it was explained to me was that it was gonna be more of a sedative kind of tiring and relaxing really for use before bed I would agree but also disagree effects were relaxing but not tiring I felt more of the CBD than the CBN and I never felt like sedated or kind of exhausted the way that I thought I would I will say I really enjoyed that this had absolutely no THC in it that's kind of a problem with a lot of the one-to-one ratios in this state balanced THC in a balanced CBD level but this totally had no psychoactive properties pulling from this there's no chance of you feeling high or feeling too spaced out to be able to focus on anything I really really enjoyed that part of it especially throughout the day it felt like they've definitely focused on the non psychoactive parts of the plant leaving literally no trace of THC in there it doesn't say it I could totally still function throughout the day I felt the benefits of CBD and CBN and it really worked well to relax my muscles and tension it never made me feel too sedated to continue to work or function throughout the day I used different temperatures at different parts of the day just to try the full range of the pax Arras capabilities and I was talking to someone on reddit who was kind of concerned about the temperatures I would have been using I was surprised by the noticeable like clean air kind of like medicine taste at the low temperatures and the really really big clouds at high temperatures like it's like a little bong rib also another point is that the packs pods are proprietary Pyrex and wick coil I just think that I'm using it pretty much in the middle of the range right around 575 so I don't see how that would be any any worse than you know 400 something battery life on the PAX is all right I've charged it twice this week using it I got about two days out of it had to charge it on like somewhere within the third this is a lot smaller than a true stick so like I would say that's pretty much why I kind of mentioned the taste earlier but it was extremely hard to pinpoint I can't put my finger on what specifically it reminds me of I said kind of the clean air or medicine it reminds me of like when you're in your car and you turn on the like recirculate and you have you know the outside air versus your cabin air definitely more like your cabin air it feels like you're inhaling something that's definitely like clean if it makes any sense it definitely has the standard medicinal CBD taste also like a small hint of almost like berry or like a sweet grape kind of its kind of like sweet undertones maybe the taste is really distinct though compared to any of the CBD vapes I've ever tried before overall I really really enjoyed this pax pod it was great to sip on throughout the day I used it on low temps pretty much I ended up mixing it with the nine pound flower that I picked up I would say that I enjoyed mixing it with that more than using it by itself it felt a lot more sedating when I mixed it with already sedate 'iv indica strain obviously you can find what suits you best I ended up keeping mine around the same temp most of the time and never really felt like I had to jump up now I will cover the device itself in another video shortly I did that firmware update that I mentioned in the first video and it introduced something called session control and what that lets you do is have micro sessions throughout the day someone like me I love that kind of stuff because that's what I do is micro dose so I'm definitely going to try those again when have the THC vapes I like to talk about value in my videos I've showed you guys the V fire pods and everything these are just a bad value bad bad value I can't even recommend it $70 it only lasted me about five maybe six days if I can continue to use it throughout the weekend I'm really disappointed in that I know I was using it throughout the day but on such a low temperature honestly using it so sparsely throughout the day I really expected it to last a little longer the pod is only 0.5 gram for $70 it's already a stretch I had mentioned in my first post that it was only 238 milligrams of active ingredient for $70 that's a ripoff absolutely I can't believe that is like allowed this is gonna fall in line with something like the true pods where I've tried it once and I'm not gonna try it again I really enjoyed it while I could but I'm gonna you know get the a froyo THC pods next time but I don't really see the benefit in spending more on this when I don't really get the CBN like a sedative effect that is kind of intended in this product that's pretty much it for this one I wanted to tease that I have the muscle freeze finally it works really well so I'm excited to do a video on this I'm gonna be doing more of the pax pods when they come out later this month a couple more flower videos coming out from true leave I got 9 pound hammer flour as well as the star dog flower from cure leaf I got the first 48 in the flower cups which is different than the first 48 I have tried previously which was in the little silver tin things this is a lot different and I'm excited to tell you guys what I think of it stay tuned for those until next time [Music]", "S0S4bMrmj-I": "- This is my very first\nshipment of CBD oil. (upbeat music) Good morning y'all, rough morning. I honestly was not planning\nto pick up the camera until I was feeling a little better, but something adorable happened. Harlow, while you are adorable, I'm actually not talking about you. I managed to make it downstairs, and I found this from Judd. This is gorgeous. Got a sailboat, a pink sunset, wow. This is so touching, it says, the card says, with you,\nlife is an adventure, happy Valentine's Day. And he wrote the sweetest most amazing... I'm not gonna share what he\nwrote 'cause it was personal, but you know this is\nnot typically like Judd, the romantic gesture, so I know he put a lot\nof thought into this and, I've got a great man. Alright I have made it to my destination. I need the heating pad, I\nneed my nausea to go down. I will see y'all in a bit. Hey Harlow, you wanna be snuggled, and your nose is like right in my armpit. Well y'all I am feeling a bit better. Harlow actually slept on our\nbed all night last night. Usually she'll get up after awhile 'cause she gets too hot, but I woke up and she was happily\nlaying between Judd and I. She was actually kind of invading Judd's space and like pushing him, so that Judd starting\ncoming into my space. But we made it work. Anyways I've got a\nphysical therapy session and the PT should be here any minute now. And then I'm going to\ntry something new today. Alright I had my physical\ntherapy, it went well. The first thing he asked me is, \"Do you have your AFO's yet?\" And I said no, but my appointment, I'm not sure if I told y'all yet, is Friday to get my AFO's and my joint braces from Hanger Clinic. So, looking forward to that. Anyways as a Valentine's Day treat, I am making Judd some pulled pork, one of his favorite things. The last time I tried to make pulled pork, it went not so great. I cooked it on high instead of low, so the pork really didn't shred well, but I think this one's\nready to be shredded. Oh my goodness, yes, it's\nshredding beautifully. Okay so the secret is to\ncook it on low for six hours instead of high for three hours, ta-dah! Alrighty, so I shredded it up, I put some of this sauce in it, and I actually have a\nrecipe to share with y'all 'cause I was like if I mess this up again, I wanna blame it on a recipe. So I put a link to it in the description, and then I added some Sticky\nFingers Carolina Sweet, and I think he's gonna love it. Alrighty y'all, I said I\nwas trying something new, and here it is. This is my very first shipment of CBD oil. So I've been talking with my\ndoctors about my chronic pain, and we are always looking for new ways to improve my quality of life, and to help me manage my pain, and it had been suggested\nto me to try CBD oil. And if you wanna learn about\nmy pain management plans and past discussions of this, I would check out my\npain management playlist. So originally, I was\nopposed to trying CBD oil because I was worried it\nwould lower my blood pressure, and I already have problems with that. I have to take medications\nto keep my blood pressure up, but I think that was just me\nnot knowing much about CBD oil. Some people it doesn't do anything to BP, some people it goes up, down. We don't know exactly how\nit's going to affect me, but I talked to my pain\nmanagement doctor about it, and he thinks it's at least\na try 'cause many people have had a lot of success with CBD oil, and if it helps me, how\nwonderful would that be, especially since it is natural. Now I did a fair amount\nof research on CBD oil before deciding to do it, and before deciding which company\nI was gonna purchase from, and one of the first\nthings I learned is that many people have very strong opinions on which company is the\nbest to purchase from. And what I think will be\ntrue in this instance, is that every brand can\naffect everyone differently, and you really need to do a little bit of trial and error to see\nwhat works best for you. So the company I decided to go with first is one that a fellow EDS blogger uses, her name is Christina Dougherty, and this company is called Theramu. And if it works well for her, I felt confident in giving it a try to see if it works well for me. Now CBD oil may do nothing for me, I know a lot of people\nhave success with it, but I have spoken with some people who said it really didn't do much. Or it did very little that it\njust wasn't worth the cost. So I am moving forward with\nthis, cautiously optimistic. I really, really want it to work, but I'm not going to get my\nhopes unrealistically high. I like my saying of cautious optimism. If this one really doesn't\ndo anything for me, like I said, different brands\nmay affect you differently, so I will probably try\nat least one more time with a different brand. I was looking at Lazarus\nor Bluebird Botanicals, those look good 'cause they\nhave third party testing on their products, but anyways, this is what I have right now. So this is... It just came in this box, this\ndoesn't fit in our mailbox so they delivered it\nto the leasing office. It was fine, it came with my receipt, and this pretty stuff that looks like, I don't know hamsters would use it, or like birds for nests, whatever. Packaging I guess and\nit came with this box. Now it's open because I\ndid try it last night, I put a drop on my skin first because, you know me, I'm\nprone to allergic reactions, and after awhile, nothing\nhappened with the drop on my skin, so I put one drop under\nmy tongue and went to bed, and I was totally fine. I wanted to try it first last night because, well, that's when it came in, but also Judd was home,\ntoday he's working. And so you open it up,\nand here is the oil. It was facing the right\nway when I first opened it. And I got the Theramu Calm Pro. Which I think just means it's a higher strength\nthan their original. And it is mango flavor,\nand 100% pure hemp extract. Sublingual dietary supplement. 750 milligrams pure hemp extract. And this is one ounce. Supplemental facts, serving\nper container, about 120. Serving size is five drops. So I get one drop under my tongue. The dose would be five. Other ingredients, pure Emu oil, organic mango extract, it's gluten free. Directions say shake well before use as pure ingredients naturally separate. Place five drops under\nthe tongue subliminally. Up to three times a day or as recommended by your\nhealthcare practitioner. Hold under tongue for 20\nseconds before swallowing. Store at room temperature. Does not contain THC. So yes, I'm using CBD oil,\nthere's no THC component which is the component\nthat makes people stoned. And this is legal in all 50 states. If you wanna know about\nprices for this specifically, just check out their website, I'll link it in the description. That's kind of what I worry\nabout, it being cost-prohibitive 'cause it is kind of pricey, and depending on how much\nI need it, but we'll see. I don't even know if it's gonna work yet and some people say it has\nto get into your system, so it takes awhile to\nstart seeing affects, or it works right away. I didn't notice any difference\nyesterday from my one drop, but, oh I forgot to shake it. So we're gonna shake it up. Alright, I got my drops. I'm gonna like open my mouth and use this while y'all are watching me okay. So here we go. And then I leave it under my\ntongue for like 20 seconds. You really can't taste anything, it doesn't really taste\nlike anything to me. Maybe like a hint of mango, but... Has it been 20 seconds yet? Okay I left it for like 30 seconds 'cause I wanted to be safe. But there we go, we shall\nsee how it affects me. No difference yet. (laughs) But I will keep y'all updated\non my journey with CBD oil, I am really, really hoping and praying it will be a good resource\nfor me, but time will tell. Hi y'all, I've made it into bed. I honestly do not feel a\ndifference with the CBD oil. However my pulse is giving\nme lots of issues tonight. Generally my heart rate is 110, 120, 130, so still tachycardic, yes\nmy pulse gives me issues, but it looks like my baseline. Not tonight, I am up in the 160's and Harlow alerted to me twice today, one syncopy I was able to prevent, by laying down and elevating my feet, the other one I couldn't even prevent it, so, I mean I'm okay. Harlow alerted, I was in a safe place, but (sighs) my pulse is bad tonight. And it started to get worse like two hours after I took the CBD oil, but I don't feel the CBD\noil is making my pulse worse because I was having issues\nwith it this morning. And just the nature of the beast I guess. With the CBD oil, I talked to Judd, and kind of our game plan, is that I'm going to finish\nthe bottle from Theramu. The current bottle I have,\nI'm gonna take five drops in the morning and five drops at night. I watched the video. I edited the volume a little bit, and I think I put way more\nthan five drops in my mouth. It's kind of hard to tell, but anyways, I'm going to take it in\nthe morning and at night until the bottle finishes. If I don't see any difference with it, then I will try another brand and I've decided I'll\ntry Lazarus Naturals. And you know I wanna\nreally give it a good try, I'm really hoping it can help me. Also, if y'all have\nbeen watching the news, I'm sure you know that something really tragic happened in Florida. There was a shooting at a high school and it happened in Parkland, which is several hours South from here, but, gosh, it's hard to\nknow exactly what to say when these things happen. It's heartbreaking and\nwe feel it, I'm sure, all through Florida and\nthrough this nation, and my prayers are with everyone affected. Snuggling Harlow close to me tonight. She's also very attached to me because I'm not feeling\nwell with my pulse. I'm actually gonna be running\nan extra liter tonight to hopefully help with it\nso when I wake up tomorrow I'm hopefully not struggling as much. Anyways, I'm going to bed, so with that I'll say goodnight, and thanks for joining\nus on our adventure.

systemic products we also have topical products the main difference between the two is systemic products have a built in a care agent to pool all those cannabinoids into your bloodstream the other type of product we have are known as topicals which sit and activate just basically right on the skin's surface what exactly is hemp oil what is what is CBD cannabidiol is obviously the full name for it and it is a certain part in that flour which is normally when we consume flour the CBD is actually kind of what balances it out it brings us down THC it's normally going to raise your heart rate a little bit one of the most profound things I think about our line is that patients have a nice option between psychoactive products and non psychoactive products and being able to choose what's gonna fit them for their day the THC a patch is going to be good still an acid form which just essentially means it's not activated you're not gonna feel psychoactive effects but you can still get that cannabinoid into your daily regimen the gel pens can actually be used in combination with our patches to change or kind of modify your cannabinoid profile so you can put a click of the pen and then lay a patch over it you could add cbn to a tha patch you could add CBD to an indica patch so a lot of different varietals the general athlete's smooth muscle tissue just general muscle fatigue I'll normally recommend our muscle freeze which has a really intense cooling action only activated cannabidiol in there we offer in a 75 milligram and a 200 milligram size we even offer a rescue tonic which is designed just in case you get a little too much medication in you some people are you know we're unfamiliar with our tolerances in terms of edibles so this is kind of designed just to bring your blood sugars up a little bit put some of those essential nutrients back into you and kind of take away some of that awkward feeling which you can get from you know large amounts of cannabinoids especially THC it's always good to be conscious where your CBD oil is come from and go with a company that's open source all of our stuff is coming from the elite botanical grow in Colorado the facility that kind of pardis multiple CBD grows I'm including Charlotte's Web our strain is similar in the fact that it's a CBD rich cannabis based strain we know that all of our products are made with the utmost care and highest quality I know because I'm personally responsible for everything in Arizona so we try to keep that quality always being open source about testing ongoing in-house HPLC

it this nice gloopy texture as you can see and that gives it like that it's nice and dirty i don't know if i [ __ ] love it so yeah mix that through i like to add vanilla extract as well just a tiny bit for that hint of you know vanilla super nice literally that is some good [ __ ] try it makes it cakey i use frozen strawberries and frozen fruits because generally i make this before my coffee so i drink my coffee and i let this defrost and then i have frozen mixed fruits as well also 100 grams and then for the crunch i like to use pears also 100 grams i have some healthy fats i do 10 grams of seeds on top of everything pigs in the morning i just like to get my fats in and these are the healthy way of fats and yes i love my sweetener so i'm gonna put in two grams of sweetener that's just the [ __ ] it's like snow flaky i put in syrup drink syrup zero sugar zero calories for that strawberry oh well in this case what the [ __ ] do you call this again well from bose is dutch i don't know in english but it's a sugary syrup and i get red fruits i learned this from my grandparents because they always put it through their yogurt and there we go so there we have it so this is what i generally eat off a breakfast super easy to make i got my fruits got my cards got everything which you need in a breakfast i'll put the macros on the screen or in the description below also the ingredients so you can follow along if you like the recipe which is not really recipes just what i eat for breakfast and it's high volume so it keeps me full and obviously i got my coffee got my third one this morning but i mix it with decaf and normal coffee so it's not very caffeinated it there's still that caffeine in there that keeps me you know satiated seashed i like to keep it simple for breakfast and the second recipe is going to take a little bit more time but oh that's good [ __ ] man so yeah yo so it's time for the second meal of the day so these are gonna be chocolate cauliflower pancakes topped with no bake cream cheese frosting so yeah it sounds insane like sweet it's sweet but it's gonna be healthy so i kind of experimented first with banana pancakes but those weren't filling enough and too high calorie and then i went to carrot pancakes but those tasted too much like vegetable so i ended up with cauliflower because those are such a neutral vegetable that is so low in calorie so it works so good with these pancakes and i know you're gonna love it because i love them plus they're chocolatey and the frosting man cream cheese frosting like come on bro so that's what it is that's what we're gonna do so we're gonna start off by making the cauliflower so over here i have 350 grams of cauliflower rice but actually i just blended up myself because i like to buy the whole cauliflowers instead of the frozen ones or the pre-packaged one so now we're going to start off with our dry ingredients so over here i have 45 grams of egg white powder so this is the equivalence of 340 grams of liquid egg whites this is so much more cost efficient and easier to use because all you need to do is add water then you have the liquids you can use it as a shake um i found this online so i'll add the description in the link below so add that in there because this is going to be the binder to our dish and of course because it's chocolate i have here 10 grams of cocoa powder yum yum so i've used salt i have santax gum which is like a thickener baking soda 2 grams baking no 1 gram baking powder 2 grams and then i like to mix that through first get this like rough paste and now time for the liquids so i like to use liquid sweetener for this one because i also need some form of liquid to bind this all together instead of you know the sugar so i use liquid sweetener this also has barely any calories and it's just a very neutral type of sweetness so i have like 15 milliliters i love vanilla extract i love it so maybe like that plus acidity a good squirt of lemon juice so that's going to bind it all together because you know i want a nice thick like consistency oh did i mention that in the intro they're gonna be apple pancakes as well so i'm adding 250 grams of apples also to increase the volume and the sweetness you can also add like apple apple water apple water or the applesauce as the the the you know the binder but i like the sweetness and boom as you can see that increased the volume a lot so there we have it this is the mixer for the cauliflower chocolate pancakes it's going to be really delicious go go go go go go go go okay so this is done we can set this to the side or we can really start cooking so i'm going to make the cream cheese frosting now also super simple so now for the cream cheese frosting you want to put everything into a blender if you have one if not you can also just mix it with a spoon so we're going to start off with 200 grams of non-fat greek yogurt in holland we call this cork oh maybe like this so you can see it and then we have 75 grams of light cream cheese and 100 grams of cottage cheese is the trifecta of dairy so over here three grams of granulated granulated sweetener and a pinch of salt put it in there i have two types of vanilla extract yes i'm a weirdo like that i have two different ones this one's a bit more uns and this one's a bit more uh so i like to add both it's kind of like a new york cheesecake type of thing because i also like to add shitload of lemon juice boom baby and that's basically the frosting so i'm gonna blend this up right now as you can see that's nice and thick bro that is so good hey okay so there we have it food has been made so with that recipe i make four big fat heavy stacks of pancake chocolate cauliflower apple and then over here i got you know the cream cheese frosting this is some thick stuff you know and that is good and you know what my favorite thing to do is drench it drench it am i going to do this right oh baby boom oh and it's kind of like a cake dessert but you know it's filled with proteins vegetables fruits so this will satisfy me definitely can't let it go to waste so there we go pre-workout meal i don't really see it as a meal because you know it's kind of like a snack before the gym but i still like high volume and i don't really have specific type of you know ingredients that i use like oh fast digestive proteins or fast digestive carbs it's just a delicious snack for myself and this one i generally eat popcorn because i just really like it it's high volume i can dip it in my own dip so i make like a peanut butter powder with a protein powder i have dark chocolate or cinnamon so let me just show you how i make it super fast super simple and let's go okay so first we're gonna make the dipping sauce so over here i have 13 grams of peanut butter powder just add that in there and over here i have 25 grams of dark chocolate powder uh protein powder you can use whatever protein powder you want but i like the combination of you know peanut and chocolate so then i first i mix that through a little bit and to make this you know like a sauce i add my almond milk plus i also like to add a little bit of sweetness you don't have to do this but i just i'm a huge fan of sweets so i do that and you're gonna you're gonna make it like a little sludge out of it and depending on how thick you'd like it you add a little bit more milk or not it's all up to you okay so this is the consistency that i like it so over here i have 50 grams of popcorn and i like to do it myself because then i can you know measure the oil see how much i put in there but of course you can just use microwavable popcorn just make sure you don't take two sugary ones watch the food labels so let me show you how i make it i just add it in there i add a little bit of my salt i spray it with the oil give it a little mixy mixy and i close it and then i put the heat on low to medium do you hear that so when it starts popping like that then you give it a little shake and you put it back and you do that every single like 10 to 15 seconds so you have to pay attention to it and don't walk away because you're going to burn your popcorn and you don't want burnt popcorn so keep on shaking it yeah [Music] what it do my favorite snack of the day is done so okay here we got the popcorn i'm going to use my hospitality skills put two on the plate boom dip it dip it dip oh [ __ ] um i love this you know you just chill you dip your popcorn in the chocolate spread so good or i had to do it i had to get the ketchup the ketchup came out mmm combination between salty and sweet so yeah i love this as a snack it's my two girl snack easy to make so now i wait for like an hour or a half an hour before i go to the gym because generally i don't really have a time slot in between my meals maybe like two three hours it really depends on how i feel how hungry i am because all my foods are pretty high volume anyway so i'm pretty stuffed so i'm gonna go eat this i'm gonna go to the gym and we'll get that post workout meal ready okay so post workout meal is gonna be a vegetable vegetable first of all fried rice i know veggie fried rice broccoli but it is so good it's about the sauce and the proteins that you use there's no carbs in it well there's carbs of course but no rice so it really reduces the calories as you can see it's still sunny out because i'm filming this another day i need the sun to film and it doesn't really matter because you can fit in meals differently in the day if you just get your calories and your macros in it's all good so i'm gonna show you how i make it and it is bomb so the most important thing that you need for this is this tofu protein and especially get the little bits because when you're cooking the fried rice and you have small bits throughout the rice it reduces the sense of vegetables so it seems more like a fried rice rather than vegetable fried rice and also you need to cook everything step by step don't just chuck it all in there because then you're reducing flavor you need to sear this sear this and then sear this and every single step of the way you season it with all the seasoning and then over here i have egg white powder like i use for the cauliflower 20 grams so it gets nice and thick so we have nice chunks of egg in there at the end you're gonna stir fry it in this delicious sauce i'm gonna put my recipe for it as well today i went for the indonesian so i'm using ketchup onions the lower calorie type this is insanely tasty and i'm also using sugar-free sweet chili sauce 100 gram only has 9 calories it's crazy plus sweetener and soy sauce also very low calorie sources of sauces salt i want paprika so then we have pepper we have garlic powder and we have cumin okay so the tofu is done you set that to the side and then you add your carrots and you cook this out and then again this one you season as well so the carrot is done put that to the side again and add the broccoli because i don't like to use a lot of oil in this case i actually didn't use any oil and then season again and mix it mixy broccoli is done set that to the side as well and as you can see i don't like using multiple pans it just means more dishes just chuck it all in there super easy and over here we have the egg whites so the egg whites are all broken up right now i cook it a little bit longer because it gives the next extra texture because i like it a little bit extra burnt i don't know why i'm a bit weird like that and then you add everything else and like i mentioned this is what makes all the difference the sauce or and you just throw it all over there let that cook out deglaze it so i cook the egg whites add the rest of the ingredients and then also add the sauce and as you can see it just doesn't even look like broccoli anymore it just looks like a delicious fried rice okay so this is done okay so here we have the fourth meal of the day so today i went indonesian inspired with the ketchup madness in my broccoli fried rice sometimes i go japanese inspired with ketchup or i go tines pipe with a black soy sauce it really depends but today i was really feeling this type of sweetness and i love having a fried egg on top so the yolk goes through it instead of having it through my fried rice and healthy fats for the avocado plus avocados legit and then i also like to top it off with some sriracha sauce because you know sriracha sauce has basically zero calories wait let me do this first let me do this first book do you see that go oh well it's not working out is how i hoped it would be but this is my favorite part and then i top it off with some sriracha because you know it's basically zero calories boy okay so this is my first move of the day i show the macros and hopefully you like this recipe that you can you know get inspired by something like this and because this is heavy this will fill you up like for sure because it fills me up and i can eat a shitload so i'm gonna munch down on this and yeah just chill i guess and then later on i'll show you my delicious delicious dessert it is insane sometimes i eat this twice on a date it's so good so we've come to the last meal of the day and it's going to be a chocolate protein ice cream because you know at the end of the night i want something high volume and something that takes a long time to eat because at nighttime generally my hunger is like for some reason at its highest and i can eat so much so this is the perfect remedy but this one actually takes a quite a while to make and some dedication because i don't have a good blender and i've tried different methods and this method method is that you mix it all up you put it in the freezer you wait an hour mix it all up again and you wait another hour and then you mix it all up again i know it's a lot of effort but the thing is like i cook my dinner or like i cook my fourth meal and then right after i finish that then i make my ice cream so by the time i'm hungry again my ice cream is ready so we're going to start off with 400 milliliters of unsweetened almond milk and to that we're going to add 500 milliliters of water you can always add a little bit less or a little bit more water depending on how you know how much you want but this is already pretty big so to that we're going to add 20 grams of cocoa powder 20 grams of dark chocolate protein powder 8 grams of santax gum so this will be the thickening that's how it gets also nice and creamy 125 grams of non-fat greek yogurt or cork that also makes it nice and creamy adds a little bit extra protein and a little hint of vanilla extract just the white one just a little bit because this is pretty strong i'm going to add the sweetness after the freezing process because for some reason the freezing process reduces the sweetness of the sweeteners and you want it nice and sweet of course so i luckily have a hand blender which makes this very easy but i used to use a whisk that also works but that just takes five minutes longer so as you can see it's pretty thick that's quite a lot so i noticed this is quite a dedication because you got to come back in an hour and mash it up mash it up again and then do it again for another hour so that you know you don't get the chunks you want it nice and smooth so i'm going to put this in the oven in the oven i'm going to put it in the freezer and we'll be back in an hour okay so it's been an hour as you can see it's been frozen a little bit but now is the time to scrape it from the sides because if you leave it in there for too long it's gonna get stuck and it's gonna be impossible to remove so you do that from all the sides as you can see see the middle is still not frozen enough while you mix it through you break it up because you don't want big-ass chunks and of course it depends on your freezer how cold it is but my freeze is per one hour so maybe yours needs a bit longer or a bit shorter it really depends then okay so it's been another hour and i mashed it up again so as you can see it's nice thick nice and gooey i like mine really sweet so over here i have three grams of granulated granulated sweetener and over here i have 25 milliliter of liquid sweetener because this one's a bit more stronger in sweetness and of course it's ice cream and that's crazy sweet so i'm gonna top it off with 200 grams of pear but normally i also like to top it off with strawberries or blueberries so the i see these as little candy pieces throughout my ice cream so you have like different texture combinations and it is so good this really fills me up so here we go there we have it this thing is huge you see this i'm looking at the camera and this is a massive so this is what i like to do so this time it's you know with the chocolates and the pears and i love to top it off with this oh this is like a zero calorie sweetener this is caramel sometimes i put this in my coffee this is so good so like this am i doing can you see it and then i just drizzle it kind of all over so i have the combination of like caramel and chocolate over my pears and dude it's so [ __ ] good it's so good okay so this is my last meal take a bite oh that's what it's at so this was a full day of eating five meals high volume high protein and pretty easy recipes as you can see keeps me full throughout the day i don't really think about food all the time and i just eat when i get hungry so this is perfect for night time i'm going with my room binge watch black clover that's like anime show what you're watching right now i have the ice cream on top of me and i kind of like eat it like this so thank you for watching hopefully you can incorporate these recipes or ingredients into your you know deficits and thank you so much for watching see you next one", "MYlSj-gCx6g": "my name is Julie random and director for experimental histopathology and front hutchinson i'm going to review for you the optimal procedure for prior preserving tissue it's important when you're prior preserving tissue to get the best possible sample up front so we can provide high-quality sections and staining for you down the road some of the protocols that might require prior preserve tissue include laser capture microdissection where you're going to go in then and extract the plague acids such as DNA and RNA a monistic chemistry protocols such as cd4 and cd8 for mouths tissue and special stain procedures including foil read home so the goal is to ensure that you're freezing tissue at the optimal rate you don't want to freeze tissue too quickly or you will disrupt the solid membranes also if you freeze the tissue too slowly you can cause a lot of ice crystals and that will cause freezing our fan the technique that I'm going to show you today uses something a little bit more interesting it uses a unique technique including an aluminum block that we've frozen in liquid nitrogen this is very easy to use in your lab as well as in an accounting the first thing you want to do is to get your freezing compartment ready that's going to include a Styrofoam container and then an aluminum brick that I've retrieved from the -80 you want to store your Lumina brick in the my space to keep it at a cooler temperature so it takes less time to come down to temperature with your liquid nitrogen so this is your brick it's all aluminum it is about the size of a standard masonry brick I'm going to put that in my Styrofoam container and then I'm going to add liquid nitrogen I'm going for the liquid nitrogen over the break and you can hear it start to boil off but you want the liquid nitrogen to be about an inch below the top of the bridge so while that's coming down to temperature I can show you some of the other things that I have on the table you would want your specimen to be in ice to keep it cool while you're waiting to do the procedure that as will keep the tissue from degrading it's also handy to have another Styrofoam container with some liquid night or I'm sorry some dry ice in it dry-ice and then you can put a white box with the cardboard dividers in here to organize your your blocks education sucia and I also have the other tools that I'm going to need I have my cassettes here that are in this box I have oct the optimal temperature cutting media I have some paper towels to blot my tissue I have a cutting board and some cutting instruments either a razor blade or a fresh scalpel blade and then I also have labels to label my cassette or resistant a solvent resistant pen forceps to manipulate my tissue and then long-handled forceps to transfer the cassettes onto my liquid nitrogen so you can see the aluminum block has stopped boiling I'm going to tip this a little so you can see the alumina block in here and as I said the liquid nitrogen is about to level that's about an inch from the surface and one right the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to label our cryo mole so we have our mold here I've cut the edges off the mold because I find that those break when they're frozen so we have a cryo label that we put on our molds and then I can use a solvent resistant pen and label that I'm going to use hot dog today as a demo so I'm labeling my caramel is hot dog I've got my specimens over here in a transport media such as PBS on ice so you want to keep your samples cool while you're waiting to freeze them but you want to do this as quickly as possible to eliminate any Italo sassette might occur in the tissue so my sample here and I'm going to use a very sharp instrument to cut that such as a razor I'm going to cut this down to size say this is a liver sample I might cut it like so and then you want the same rules that apply to paraffin tissue you want things to be about 2 to 3 microns thick 4 millimeters thick cutting that there being careful not to saw or to compress the tissue so here's my sample I'm going to fill the cryo mold with a small amount of OCT or optimal cutting temperature media like so I'm going to use my forceps and I'm just going to blot the tissue very gently on a paper towel or I can light something to take any excess liquid off of it that might form ice crystals I'm going to rent the tissue then in the crime old in such a way that the side that I'm interested in looking at first is going to be down in the mold because that's what we're going to cut through first I'm also going to ensure that there's plenty of room around the tissue so that will be filled with Oct so I can get a good section once that's done I'm going to fill the rest of the mold completely with oct try to avoid any large bubbles if I do get bubbles I want to get rid of those that will make cutting more difficult now that you have your tissue embedded in the Oct you can take a long handle forceps and move the cassette onto your aluminum block so now the oct will start to turn white as it's freezing but you can see that it's freezing at a controlled manner it's not freezing too fast if we were just to put the sample directly into liquid nitrogen like so you can see how that boiling and that might cause damage to the tissue and it will often crack the Oct to the point where it cracks through your tissue scene there you can see it's not a very flat surface but here we're getting nice freezing and we'll have a nice level flat surface to attach to our check for cutting this technique can also be used to cryopreserve cell samples that you may have grown in culture you would want to scrape the cells up from culture you wouldn't want to trypsin ice them you can pellet them I appear a tube full of red dye so you can see this procedure a little bit easier I'm going to resuspend the cells in a small amount of Oct that's been diluted 5050 with PBS just going to bring this up and down a little few times to mix it with the oct I'm going to place that pallet self palette right in the middle of the crime ol I'm going to try to avoid bubbles again take some out and then as before I'm gonna fill this mold full of Oct I'm going to go around the corners here to keep those cells within a ball you can see you've got your cells right in the middle and then we're going to freeze that as we with the tissue like our tissue specimen we're going to take the cells that we've embedded in our Oct inner cassette and use our long handled forceps again to place that specimen on the aluminum block that will start to freeze the oct once again in a controlled manner around those cells giving us a high quality cell pellet that we can section for stains as you can see we've got a nice block here you can see in the red those are representing ourselves so that's flat against the surface that we're going to cut first and we've got a nice level back that will be great when we go to attach the check for cutting", "05ISQVnTDfY": "[Music] [Music] hello again this is Robert Beach here and this is my video review of the heal fast therapy the relief loop this is made by company that makes active patch called the company called bio electronics now this one is sold primarily for animal use and it is will work for seven complete days once you turn it on it stays on and then you get the use out of it for those hundred hours or seven days of continuous use this is primarily used for dogs cats and horses it will reduce swelling reduces pain it speeds healing of muscles and tendon injuries in my experience it also helped heal wounds on a family dog that we had the process that this does one of the processes increases flow of lymphatic fluids in cells it can help relieve joint and muscle pain also now they also the company makes active Patchett that's available to use on humans for a whole host of things back pains muscle pain to reduce inflammation and help you get off of a lot painkillers so going back to this you can see it has a loop on there the therapeutic area is inside that loop so if I was working on a wound I would make sure that the wound is in the center or the muscle areas in the center of this loop for the best the efficiency and their therapy now this little book of talks about how it works and how to turn the unit on here's some of the benefits again relieves joint muscle tendon pain reduces swelling information proves mobility accelerates healing of wounds decisions and bruises has no side effects works well on pets and horses now they've had high power units that you have to go to a clinician or a doctor's office and the concept here is make a very low-power in terms of microwatts of energy into the tissue and have it from longer duration as opposed to high power shorter durations so that's how the thing basically works now to test this we're going to turn this on and then it's going to be on for the duration of it's used 100 hours and on the back of this it looks like he has a little piece that you remove and that's a little cover and on there is a little micro switch and it looks like it's a type of switch that you click once and you hear a clicking sound right there I'm a camera pick that up and now you see that it has a little green LED going and it is doing its job now if I go to click that again you can see that it does not shut off so it's a one-time operation and that's how it works now to show this is doing something it's hard to explain because you can't see things just like the air we're breathing but I have a a special k2 meter that I've modified to hear audio and visual and I'm going to turn this on so the k2 meter adjusts and if I take the loop and I go there it you could see what's happening it's showing the energy now let's take the loop away and it goes back to the zero position now let's bring the loop in and what happens now you see that there's energy on the sides too and so what is going to reach other areas was not as strong but the bulk of the strength is in the center of that loop and that's where you want to have your wounded area or your sword muscle things like that now I've used these things probably for maybe four years and these really work I just recently had a really twisted back muscle from sitting in a doctor's chair for too long on a weird angle and I tried blue pills and it just didn't do much for me I put one of these on my back with paper tape and at about 3 and 1/2 hours it kicked in and I had it on my back for three or four days and I'm telling you the pain was totally gone and I kind of moved it around I moved it around my back to different areas where I thought the pain was just like that and it got rid of the pain and I don't have it on anymore because after three days the pain was gone so this product works you're gonna like it because pain slows you down and I feel not only does it eliminate the pain over over time but it actually improves because it reduces inflammation I think you're really going to want to use this product and you're gonna benefit from it just like I have so I'm gonna give this product which is the heal faster pay relief loop I'm gonna give it a full

regarding revolving around my program online nervous system rewire program smart body smart mind now we've been doing many of these over the last few weeks especially the last week and there's good reason for that because you have lots of questions for us around how this course works if it can help you how is it laid out specifics that I'm going to get into today and it's important to understand or I will tell you right now just a tiny bit of history if you're listening to me for the first time and if you're watching this after the fact on the replay which you may be doing if you're watching this right now excuse me if I've repeated myself but there are some that may have never landed here and listened to this so I want to just give a quick overview very quick of what this program is why it came to be and what we're seeing really in our alumni who've gone through it so I was in private practice for quite a few years really since 20 2005 right now when I started working in the mind-body world and before that I was in fitness and in health and working with nutrition and recreation and community center settings so settings so I've been working in some form some shape or form with humans and the body and wellness and healing since as far as 1997 which is quite a few years so I got into working with online learning like this and through smart body smart mind because in private practice when I was working with folks who were there to heal trauma many were there because of chronic illnesses PTSD it was not enough for me to do a one-on-one session once a week if someone had the ability to come once a week usually it was every few weeks maybe once a month and then a person would leave and they would have no no tools no skills no education to continue the process and so what I was doing in my office as I was starting to draw pictures on a whiteboard and also on paper to give to people to explain how the autonomic nervous system was working why they would feel these shaky responses why they would sense tightness 'as in parts of their what symptoms are where pain comes from and how it gets expressed I would have to teach and give audio homework assignments via recordings I would record audios and give them to them so they could take them home and use them as a way to keep practicing how to feel and tune into this body of theirs and how this body of theirs can reconnect with the environment because here's the thing we've had post-traumatic stress or when we're living with post-traumatic stress and we've had traumatic experiences whether we remember them or not it's very important to know we may not remember things that occurred to us especially when we were young and especially when we were infants and especially in utero we only feel through our somatic system so I would offer people these recordings and over the years and over time I started starting to compile and compile more of these lessons I call them neurosensory exercises and over time we have created I have created what is smart body smart mind which is a combination of Education high-level education I don't hold back I teach and give you exactly what I have learned through my various trainings in the fields of somatic experiencing which is the work of Peter Levine somatic practice which is the work of Cathy Cain and also my training within the Feldenkrais method which is the work of Moshe Feldenkrais he's long past he was one of the pioneers of neuroplasticity back in the 60s 70s and 80s which is when he died so I brought all these things together into this on line four which is smart body smart mind now since we started gosh over five years ago now this is going to be the ninth time we have run SBS M that's the abbreviation SBS M we've added to this it's become a robust program that has ten modules so I'll go through these things right now because we have been getting questions around this so I'm going to structure this call this way I'm going to go through more of the the specific details the features of the program some of the more commonly asked questions we're getting in through email support right now and we'll get through those I'm going to check out the questions in the chat here and then I've got questions on paper that were submitted by email so that's how I'm gonna run today hey there Cara hey there me okey if you are watching me here live right now let me know who you are where you're from because I can only see you if you type into the chat I mean if you have a question for me around this program and really whether or not you have a question about yourself or maybe you are a practitioner and you want to know how this can help your own students and clients please let me know we have kind of an equal amount of people that come in to smart body smart mind who are just there for their general health and well-being and then we have another subset of people who are there because they work with people in the health how I call it the helping and healing professions and they are wanting to get very trauma-informed and also work on their own stuff let's call it that we'll keep it simple their own stuff so that they can be better helpers for their clients so some of the common questions we're getting are let me get to them here when does s BSN or run again so we run this once a year so we are gonna run again around this time in 2021 kind of this early March time so if you know that this is not for you at this current moment we start officially tomorrow next year will be the time to start and I'll give you some options about how you can start in other ways between now and then how's the program delivered so the way it's delivered is through a website so I'm pointing at my computer so if you go to a website for example and you register for let's see if you think about any website really that has top tabs and dropdowns basically the smart body smart mind website that you get access to when you're a paid member has got these drop-down menus with all of the learning and it's organized by week we call them um labs modules it's organized by the calls the training calls that we'd have it's organized by orientation week which starts tomorrow and it's organized by the bonuses that we offer throughout the course of the 12 weeks so everything is on this site and you can access it 24/7 so doesn't matter what time it is you can go in and access let's say the first lesson of lab one at your own pace at your leisure we offer you a suggestive guideline to how to work through the program but the one thing that you'll hear me and my my team say over and over again and if you check out the FAQ section on our registration page and Crystal may have already popped that up there but I'll get her to if she hasn't already is it's really this is really about going at your own pace and listening to your system and the reason why that is so important is because when we have had traumatic events and an environment where we grew up where things were not safe we couldn't go at our own pace we had to either push or override or maybe slow ourselves down right because our exuberance and our creativity was too much for those around us so we had to kind of introvert ourselves and hide and not really express who we are and so the program is about learning learning how to connect to yourself and that is going to be very individual but we lay out the curriculum over the 12 weeks kind of like a university course where you would go for a semester you would have your learning instead of textbooks we have it in the form of the written word we have audio lessons that I am guiding you through those are the practical exercises all of the audio lessons are transcribed so they can be read because we found that some people like to read it slows the process down a bit our video trainings that give you the education the theory the equivalent to how I would draw graphs and that in my office back in the day for my clients they are on kind of like a slideshow a PowerPoint presentation that is recorded so you're seeing images and graphs and and you're hearing my voice all of the video trainings are also transcribed they're captioned so that you can turn on a caption thing and see the words pop up and we also give you the audio of all of the video trainings so that's how the bulk of the practical and the third theoretical content are laid out within the SBS M program website the next thing that we have our calls and this was another question and just make sure I've got it here what if I am going to be away for a couple of weeks should I wait can I register now and start later and the answer to that is if you go away not a problem because the content will stay there for you and if you are going away and you do have a device which many of us seem to carry around with us a lot or if you want to print stuff out some of the readings you can print out the material that we've already covered and review it when you go away and then when you come back you can get into the new learning in terms of the question can I register and do this later kind of the same question but yes you can and it's important to know that this program is not even though I call it like a university course and we end in June it's the live component that ends in June the program site every single lesson every single video training every single audio all of the bonuses and all of the live calls which we'll talk about in a second they live on the site throughout the entire year and so at anytime you can go back and I encourage my students to treat it like you're learning a second language I've said this before I've used this analogy many times we are learning a second language and really for many of us we're learning the language of regulating our nervous system as adults as big people this isn't something that we just stop at the end of the live session I'm going to really put a pause on that it's like taking care of our entire body we would brush our teeth all year round we would eat healthy food all year round we want to do movement and sleep to restore our system all year round so there are these things that we do as humans that we sort of have to do every day to stay well and healthy and this work is no different so it's not one of those things where we think okay I'm going to do it for 12 weeks and at the end of the 12 weeks everything's gonna be different everything's going to be healed and I don't need to look at that material ever again will there be massive changes within those 12 weeks very likely and this is what we see even within some of the first few weeks of the program but I'm very much pressing upon you to say at the end it's just the beginning and that's what's cool about this is this is not something that we have to get all in within 12 weeks so that goes back to those questions what if I'm going to miss a week what if I can't start till let's say June or May not a problem everything stays on the site the calls I'm going to talk about so there's a component of the program that isn't the audio lessons and isn't the pre chorded video trainings there the live calls so throughout the 12 weeks I do eight live training calls we I call them training calls they're sort of like the lecture of the program and this is added information that is designed through my my creativity in my brain bringing in aspects again of my experience my education within the fields I am trained in and we do training calls or these lectures to coincide with the learning that's happening at the current time again these live training calls aren't all recorded they're done through something called zoom which is not Facebook but it's a video conferencing software where you can see me I can see you you can have your video on you can have your video off and we record it all of it gets transcribed all of it gets downloaded into audio so you can listen or you can watch or you can read or you can do a bit of both so that is those are the training calls and the fun thing with those is I provide handouts that are quite comprehensive and they they help you go through the learning and we have two types of handouts one is fill-in-the-blank one has the answers so depending if you I'm someone that likes to write when I learn we've given you that option to be able to fill in the blanks the answers as I work through those training calls the other type of live call that we have our Q&A calls we have 18 of them over the course of the 12 weeks they are run by myself and my husband and colleagues Seth Lyon and just like today I've got these questions that have been submitted you submit a question to us before the call we get the the question and then we answer it live if for some reason and we can't get to all the questions not a problem we ask you to post that in our Facebook group and we will get to that there so we have a team of about 10 people I think there might be a little few more but definitely 10 of my colleagues all trained in various somatic experiencing and somatic practice program so they're trauma-informed at this body-based level and a lot of my team and you can meet some of them we can pop up the the link here on this site if you want to take a look at their faces are all very very much trained in the somatic healing arts in counseling some are psychotherapists some are Feldenkrais practitioners some are more trained specifically within the work of Peter Levine and Cathy Cain as I am so we have a very robust group team lion we call them who are within the Facebook group answering questions when we don't get to those questions on the live Q&A calls there's one more type of call and that is my facebook i call them facebook chats and our facebook forum kind of like this but it's our own private group and that is where I do live I call them integration question and answers where I'm priming you guys to to ask me questions around how we integrate this work into everyday life because if we're not integrating it if we're only becoming book-smart let's say and really good at the audio lessons in the comfort of our own home if we're not bringing those out into the real world it doesn't stick in the same way it's kind of like again that language thing right I love this analogy but if you were to try to learn a second language as an adult and you only did it at home reading and speaking with yourself or with the you know the app that you might be using to learn any language if you're not outside or in that country where they're speaking in that language the language doesn't stick in the same way we're not we're not being tested and put under stress in a positive way to get our brain to start to make new connections so those are the different kinds of training calls QA calls integration tests that we have then we also have some bonuses that we offer you one of the one of the I think best ones are the movement lessons with my teaching partner Elia Barak he and I teach live movement workshops all around the world and so he's part of SBS faculty and he has more he's trained in dance and he's trained in Tai Chi and Qigong in Eastern medicine movement practices and so his movement practices are a beautiful blend to the audio neurosensory exercises that I teach you in the program so we've got you covered with lots of different methods to get into the nervous system through movement through bringing attention to the self through our I call it intention but it's really sharpening our ability to visualize and see our physiology and that's a big part of this of this program okay let me make sure I've covered those questions oh yes when are the live calls so the live calls the Q&A calls are varied throughout the 12 weeks we have them at different time slots so 9 a.m. 12 p.m. and 3 p.m. Pacific time and again everything is recorded our training calls where I'm teaching live or are at 11 a.m. surround this time on Tuesdays however do not let the inability to attend a live call deter you from joining some of our most consistent alumni live in Australia and for them to show up for an 11:00 a.m. call as some do I will admit some have get up and there go heart their diehards they're up at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. on the training calls with me but you don't have to if you need your sleep everything will be there the following day so that you can listen at the right time that works for you so know that if you can't make the live calls that is probably I would say 80% of the membership can't just because of work and time zone differences etc etc ok I think that is all for these basic questions when is SBS run again next year how is the program delivered and can I work at my own pace absolutely the other thing to to note when you are an SV SM member and you join is you've got this program for as long as we run it so for life it's a lifetime membership that means that when we do this again next year you can come back and repeat the program with the new members with your peers you can join the live calls you can ask questions in our Facebook group and any new material any new bonuses any new updates that I make which I do do over the course of we've done many updates over the course of the five years we've been running this we've added content everything you get is free of charge so that one time beginning cost to join it gets you through for as many times as we run this program so that's a nice little perk as well let me just see here I have something to wet my throat okay there Vanessa I think you've got a question and I've got I don't want to miss any above so give me a moment to move over so I can see Rachel asks is it okay to get body work done when starting s PSM 100% yes I do have issues with my head and neck bones being misaligned I had a whiplash happen about 12 years ago and lots of tight muscles in that area Rachel I know your pain girlfriend I spoke about some of my old whiplash traumas I've had probably over a hundred if not more in my day through all of my crazy sports I did as a kid and in my 20s and 30s and so yeah I believe big time and body work good body work especially osteopathic work and craniosacral work and really good muscle work depending on you know for persons trained in myofascial or just good old massage therapy when you have the knowledge of SBS M and you're bringing it into your system the body work you do is going to be much more powerful and more potent and if you have a practitioner and I highly recommend this who is open to learning about trauma and understands how that gets stuck not just in our nervous system but it's everywhere right the trauma that we hold in our bodies is within our nervous system and it is within our organs within our immune system within our cardiovascular system our muscles the way our bones align and it's almost hard to comprehend that but that is the truth and so part of our work here for SBS M is rekindling and opening up and reconnecting with as many parts of our body as we can so that things that are trapped and stored in these nooks and crannies that is or that is the physiology of the human system can be moved up and out in a natural way so yes you definitely can use other methodologies and complementary medicines and bodywork so that you can complement and support your system in the way that you need it to be supported [Music] hey Vanessa you said if I fall behind on the program is it best to skip a lab to stay on track with what's being taught week by week or to work through each lab in order even if it means being behind with what is being delivered that particular week you can do a blend of both the for example on my live training calls if you want to attend one of those because it's live then by all means attend that as we're going through however the labs and the lessons are chronologically ordered to follow that concept of neuroplasticity so neuro plastic healing sequencing I got dyslexic there for a moment so neuro plastic healing sequencing this is what I talked about in video number three three of the healing trauma videos where I speak about the importance of gaining foundation cassadee and really getting robustness back to the system so that when we do get into working with movements and sounds that help bubble up and stimulate our healthy aggression responses for example it's one example we have the solidity and we have the foundation in place so I recommend if someone misses a week you go where you left off and you just know that's part of the way it works and I will admit to everyone here is that this will challenge our old patterns of how we related to the school system how we related to how we got our homework done was there trauma around that was there pressure was there a sense of I can't get through this fast enough because I just can't keep up be very aware of that and if we can be aware of that and go at our own pace and honor our biology that in itself is healing massive massive survival stress that is often connected to learning I know that I had I was deemed mentally not but very slow and they thought there was something wrong with my brain when I was in elementary school and there wasn't it was just that I didn't have the system that did well in that kind of environment I am thankful that my parents kept me in the school because I had great friends and I liked the other parts of it but it came I came home to academics I did not do well I nearly flunked out of grade one two three four five and six and seven and it wasn't until I started to get into more complex subjects in high school and then university that I really started to love learning for whatever reason so it's important to learn your learning style and also be cautious of the old patterns that might be driving you to be that perfection person or to procrastinate they go both hand-in-hand so it's adult learning it's this is about healing your human system and if we can look at it that way as opposed to this is a big test that we're trying to try to complete it shifts things a little bit so hopefully Vanessa that answers your question hey there Gloria feathers Curie I like saying that that's a fun name you're from Scotland hello I'm you recently registered awesome thank you for doing so and you look forward to learning and releasing even more freeze as this has already been happening feeling more alive awesome you're welcome that's great to hear vanessa goes i'm just add i'm wondering if it's okay to ask questions for example on the live call in week six related to the work from for example week two absolutely absolutely when we have our live question and answers you can ask any questions related to the content of SBS m and your personal process within the program our Q&A calls are not for private consultation they're not group that they're not one-on-one therapy i'll be very clear with that so we're in a group and we are answering what very similar to how we are now your question and we have a chat box open and if for some reason we might want to unmute you and talk to you if you want to we can do that but i find that it works best when we keep it education based on the Q&A calls because ethically we can't do one-on-one therapy with you in this format and that's where we suggest if you want to do and i know this is what your question of an esse but just for people wondering this isn't the place to do specific trauma work with me or seth when we do our QA calls it is about understanding the education and the practice is better so that you can take this and do the work yourself and that kind of puts the you in the driver's seat in many ways however this doesn't mean you may not want to seek out additional support a dish '''l consultation for something very specific that you might be working with and I encourage that I think it is important for us to know if we need to get extra support and what I do know is that this work will help you be better when you do do one-on-one work and by that I mean I've seen and my colleagues have said because many of my colleagues who are team lion moderators within our Facebook group they do one-on-one sessions they have private practices in-person and online and they will say that those who have gone through s PSM have a better base to work with because they're not having to teach that client in that precious hour that they have or maybe 30 minutes what the stress response is how to notice and feel sensations in the body it's already part of their vocabulary and vernacular which means that they can just go right into the trauma work that needs to be done so I think that's really cool Tracy hey there can you clarify do you have lifetime access to the program yes definitely we have got alumni who keep coming back for more we have some people that have gone through the program seven eight times this is the ninth time we have run this program so everything remains yours for as long as the internet exists and heck you can download everything and put them on CDs if you want to there's ways of transferring this stuff to paper and audio so even if in some weird strange world the internet goes away which I don't think it is wouldn't that be odd if it did you can still have access to this material and that is why we recommend when you go through the program to download what you want print out what you want we have a few of our members who are very proud of their binders and their their binders and they have things labeled and organized so that they know how to find things so everyone's going to have a different way in which they work through this but a hundred percent yes lifetime access means for as long as we're here doing this okay I'm just scrolling you guys there we go Michael hey there Michael you said my son and I both could relate to your experience in school yeah um you know I think I'm really blessed I'll talk to talk about that as a personal moment you know I'm really blessed that back in that day in the 80s when I was in school there wasn't al had time for my parents to get worried about the fact that I was getting C minuses and DS in elementary school cuz they knew I was a healthy kid that knew how to relate to them in the world and I had fun and and I was clearly bright I just didn't like school but I loved it when I got into high school senior high especially I loved grade 11 and 12 I loved what I was learning and I think it comes down to we have to really like what we're learning to perk up and we also have to not be stressed because when we're stressed as we know our higher brain can't work so I'm really grateful that we didn't classify kiddos in the same way that we might now because if they had it probably I would have turned out very different so um thanks mom and dad for being that way and just know I really know you guys that this learning experience within SPS M can heal a lot of that trauma related to school and how we were maybe told that we weren't good at something this is something that you can become really good at because all of us have a nervous system all of us have this biology that wants to be well it doesn't want to be stuck in those survival impulses and those survival responses it is taxing on the physiology to live at that high level that's why we call it when people have been in those worlds chronic fatigue there's a chronic fatigue of the entire system because it's desperately trying to continually fight the environment that we perceive is unsafe if that was our trauma map or our safety map this system is constantly going to be looking for danger and if there's no danger anymore like true danger it's not it's just not needed right and it's in many ways a waste of our resources okay let's get back to the questions I can go off on rant sometimes great Tracy asked is this similar to the Gupta program for your rewiring the brain and the autonomic nervous system it is not and I have not personally done the Gupta program which I know is structured it's marketed towards fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue chronic pain those sort of autoimmune conditions I've had students that have gone through the Gupta program and there's a reason why they're still looking for another program from what I've seen it doesn't get into working with the actual trauma that is within the physical system again I haven't done it but from what I've understood it's more mine based it's more brain based and this stuff is in our biology it is in our movement patterns it is in our organs it is in our immune system it's in our gut our brain stem the joints of our body and especially it's in how we relate to the environment I'm always doing this when I'm talking because we have to understand even if we do all the great body work in the world I need to have a little zip here even if we do all the great body work in the world if we are not doing it with a keen attention and focus to how we connect to this external world how we feel our systems shift when we interact with someone that we either like or don't like if we are not aware of the nuance in how our mind-body connects to the environment we're missing a hundred percent of the picture and I mentioned this in a call yesterday so I might be repeating myself for some of you who were here yesterday but at the beginning of our world before we have had any massive traumatic experiences or bad things happen to us at that moment in time when we come into the world the traumatic things that occur to us are from the environment they're usually not happening because our system is creating a trauma inside its from the outside there might be a rare exception where if a human being is born they have a heart defect and the heart isn't working or the immune system isn't working like true genetic defect but most of the time it's something that's occurring to us at us around us and so it's the environment and so if we don't connect this beautiful body work that we do and intention focus work and maybe visualization work with the environment we're missing a big piece of it so from what I've known Tracy and what I've heard it isn't completing the full picture in terms of restoring health to the whole system and while I can't teach you everything under the Sun that is taught on this human planet of ours or on this planet of ours where humans live we do a pretty good job at covering a lot of the bases the curriculum is robust with in SBS M and that is because I've brought in not just one modality but three powerful methods into one hey there Linda from BC good to see you Lisa asks and I'm gonna make sure was this up yes you're the same person so I have a question that you wrote in the other group so I'm going to get to your question now so that we get them all together so you say here I'm worried about my experience going through the program and dissociation so I almost never feel good dizzy vision problems confusion migraines body aches I don't want to experience at all it's way too much and you had another question here which I will read that was in the other group that had to do with you've done EMDR I did only once during five years of EMDR so you've had some EMDR done worried that something will happen that I kind of come back from I know it sounds silly but I have extreme anxiety haven't been able to work and planning to spend my last money on this I just do not trust my body and I am scared this treatment will make me worse and maybe I can't get myself back so this is a really common mindset and reality for many people it's important and I will talk to this that we have in our system still I call it a speck of knowing that we can heal we have to believe somewhere in our body even if it's the tiniest little drop of a cell we have to believe that we can get better and most importantly Lisa and this is for everyone here we have to believe that we deserve it I'm going to say that one more time we have to believe that we deserve it because if we don't feel that we deserve it if we keep ourselves trapped in the past which I know is hard to break out of when our system is not well and we're feeling a lot of symptoms it can be really really easy to stay stuck in those loops in those mindset loops into that that knowledge that this has not been a good life and I'm afraid and I think fear is a fine is okay to have and can there be a map I'm thinking of like a piece of paper you know there's been this way that our traumatic experiences have been experienced and we have a map in the way that we see ourselves in the world and we will say things like I am this I am that for instance I am someone who has this is very different than saying I am that and so by that I mean sometimes our languaging needs to shift around let's say we do have a chronic illness but if we say I am this illness it owns us as opposed to I live with this chronic illness just like someone who lives with a spinal cord injury they are not their spinal cord injury they live with it but they are them part of this work part of the reason we get so lost and a lot of these symptoms you talk about such as extreme anxiety and and vision problems and and pain and aches is that we're swimming in this kind of vortex of lots of bad stuff and usually and I don't know your history but when this is occurring it's because a lot of bad stuff did occur to us a lot of stuff that was unfair maybe we didn't have solid caregivers who knew how to take care of their own system and so we had to take care of them all the time there's so many examples here and so if we know that our history created this map of badness of scariness the system is going to live like that until we finally in some ways put a stake in the ground and say no more yes I have these symptoms yes I'm feeling these sensations and how can I sense them and be curious with them how can I reconnect to my body in the smallest way possible and a littlest way possible and find one drop of goodness and sometimes it gets really simple like wow I have two legs and two arms and hands that can feed me and clothe me and and keep me well as simple as that might be sometimes we have to go with the simplest things and we call that it's being grateful having gratitude but to me it's just the biology biological reality of what is good what is in your system right now that is not a hundred percent horrible but is okay and we have to work with that little speck and then make it bigger and bigger and bigger so in terms of the fear about experiencing too much this is up to you the student this is up to everyone to be smart I mean there's a reason we call this smart body smart mind to be smart in how you relate to yourself to listen to your system to go you know what I think five minutes is all I'm gonna do today I'm not gonna you know push through and try to get through this lesson I'm just gonna do the first five minutes and then I'm gonna pause it and I'm gonna see what I notice as opposed to trying to drive through the content and this again is one of the hardest things for me to convey to the new students and even the alumni sometimes is that we can't push past what our system wants and in the past usually traumatic events occurred to us and we experienced more than what we could handle this is how it becomes post-traumatic stress right is we're experiencing something that has overwhelmed us to the point where we have disconnected from our body and so when you say that a lot of your symptoms are those of disconnection of not having proper orientation to the world and being confused we then know okay this system had a lot of stuff happen to it that had to go into these survival responses you need to understand that and then how can we slowly start to rebuild that foundation through education through basic practices so that these responses can lessen and become a little less chaotic so I hope that answers your question feeling fear is not an issue it's when we fear the feeling of the fear I know that seems like a bit of a play on words but that is exactly what happens the fear is not the problem when we go into shutdown even that isn't the problem it's when that shutdown is coupled with more fear that it traps right we want to go into shutdown if we have a scary experience happened to us we want our system to protect but what we don't want is we don't want those the system to have trapped extra survival stress on top of the natural survival stress and for many of us that is what hurt and so we're trying to like I have this image of like pulling apart really sticky glue right everything is just stuck in this ball and that's very indicative of what you've said here with your symptoms it's just this big ball of stickiness and so we we can't just rip it apart in one go we have to slowly warm it up we have to slowly actually look at the stickiness and be like well what is here why is this here and then start to move from there so I hope that answers a bit of your question oh good I was you see said Lisa this is exactly my history taking care of my caregiver a hundred percent this is really one of the more common traumas that many of us experience especially I found in more Western civilization and Western world's where our country has just not taken care of us we haven't had you know the social structures to really have time to heal and have our babies and recover after a common cold and all these things that really seem basic but when we don't get those and then we have children and we're still unwell as the caregiver it's very attractive to have our child help us and a child doesn't have that capacity and yet they will figure out a way to help their parents because if they don't that essentially means death for them right if mom and dad die no one's here to take care of me so a child will do as much as they can they will override their own sense of safety and well-being to help their parent because if they don't that's not good you know for that parent to not be well so for those of you that have lived that reality know that you know you are doing what you had to do to survive but that level of physiology and drive it has to get turned off and it has to be healed and we have to grieve in some ways that childhood that maybe was lost because we were taking care of those that were supposed to be taking care of it's a tricky thing but knowledge is power and when we understand why things are happening things can shift pretty quickly but we just have to stay the course and know that we have to go at the pace that we need to go at and really honor and respect and know that our system actually wants to not be in that chaos but when it's been in that chaos for a long time it's going to take some convincing and some time and some commitment ok I'm gonna answer a question that Harriet had or not sure if it's Emily or Harriet one of the two in our Facebook group I was under Lisa Marie's question crystal if you're listening you can let her know that I've answered this or I'm about to so you say that I noticed you mentioned another Q&A call that people can get a certificate to put towards their organization and board for continuing education credits can we have a certificate to say that we are trauma-informed you know what we can do that I've never thought of that this is something that more people have been asking us for but I definitely can have we can have that because when you do work through some our body smart mind and you do the practices for yourself and you integrate the learning you will become probably the most if not the biggest group of trauma-informed humans on this planet for obviously working with your own system the program is not designed to teach you how to train or work with people's traumas per se unless you are already a therapist already a somatic experiencing practitioner and you have that you know certificate that allows you to do trauma at work with people so just a very clear distinction SP sm is not a certification program to teach you how to work with trauma but it does give you an ultimately high level of trauma-informed knowledge and practice and from what I've seen Emily Harriet I'm not sure which name it is when someone already has a really strong robust scope of practice let's say you're you're a body worker they can take this information and really do really amazing the stuff with their current scope of practice without going over the boundary and starting to do specific trauma work and I think the reason for that is just because we as humans when we're a tuned to our nervous system and we have a skill and we're able to attune to the person with us we can do a lot of great work just like the natural instinct to parent and attune to our young is there when we're free from traumatic stress we know exactly what to do with babies and kids when we are well regulated in our system and we are social creatures social creatures right there's a reason why other mammals when they have their babies they don't have to go to a book and start to read they know exactly what to do because it's written in their DNA we have that too but our DNA and that expression of knowing what to do kind of gets dulled it gets skewed it gets bleached out of us when we're living in survival stress and we're not connected to this body of ours and so a big part of this work too is being able to really connect to the system so that we can connect with others in a much more meaningful way I'm gonna get to some of the questions that were sent to us the first one here is from Romy hey Romy and I met you it - was it in Stockholm I pretty sure it was when you came to up and down so you've signed up for SBS M it looks like that's great and you have a question about expectations so you say and this is great to hear your autoimmune issues have improved so much to the point where I'm no longer even showing antibodies in some test that's great but you said my peripheral neuropathy is getting worse I'm 45 and have had it since childhood you say that it's idiopathic which means that there's no unn there's no known cause for why it's there but you're told it's very common amount among the sufferers of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue so for two years I've been reducing stress healing trauma and my diet is perfect and I'm fit and I can't see myself returning to work in the corporate world and getting off of disability while this chronic pain continues are there any examples of SBS M participants curing idiopathic nerve damage such as peripheral neuropathy Romy I wish I had a list of everything that every single SBS Emer and people who have gone through my 21-day nervous system chin up have experienced I don't we don't keep track of those court kind of statistics and so if this is something that you know is idiopathic and that is connected to the fibromyalgia system the you know your system having these chronic pain responses here's here's how I'm looking at this again I wish I had a crystal ball and I can tell you exactly when this might shift and if it can shift I don't have that kind of psychic ability and of course even then it depends on the person and what they're doing I know you're dedicated to healing your system and the fact that you are already at this point where you're you know you're not the antibodies aren't there most of your autoimmune pieces have shifted I want to urge you to I know you've been doing this for so long keep going keep at this and the image that I saw when you when I read this earlier is capacity and while our body necessarily isn't going to get bigger the space inside our joints and our nerves and all of the pieces here our cells can gain more flow and more juiciness and more aliveness and the lessons that we teach an SBS M specifically for some reason these are coming to my mind so this is where some of my psychic ability comes out the diaphragms and the joints are telling me I'm being told by something that those will be really really beneficial for you for whatever reason I've met you so I Ivan more history with you so I'm just imagining the system and you who I met before and if you think about it the autonomic nervous system so a little science lesson for everyone is the peripheral nervous system so we have our central nervous system which is our brain and our spinal cord but then all of these nerves which are called peripheral nerves come out of that main spinal cord and then they feed everything our skin our muscles our digestion viscera hormones everything so when we think of pain at this level and we think about the fibers of our nerves they form they're part of that entire system and so I believe again everyone's going to be different but I do believe that the system can heal massive things and pain as Peter Levine speaks to it and I believe this is trapped sensation and if we think about the people that have written about why they believe fibromyalgia occurs the way it does what is happening at the the level of infancy that's creating constriction in the system I'm thinking about Roberts scare if you haven't read his book trauma spectrum romy it's a really good one but his he's a neurologist a medical doctor his hunch with folks who have lived with and have fibromyalgia as their main kind of symptom ology syndrome his hunch is that there was something pre verbally occurring when that little one was sleeping that was causing massive contraction of the system while sleeping so the system is literally going into a bracing response while sleeping for whatever reason who knows it could have been you know was there a surgical trauma were you left in a crib to cry yourself to sleep at night in utero was mama under stress and was your system having to contract constantly constantly to stay away from her stress chemicals that were coming the umbilical cord right if we think about that if our mother was under high stress and she is constantly going into her own bracing pattern we as the fetus connected to her are continually going to be pulling away from her trying to get away from those chemicals and so that creates this massive bracing and when we have bracing the nerves don't flow well and they're they're squashed and I get this image if they're small right and so let's just say hypothetically because I don't know your history but this might help others here let's just say that that was the case and we know again through research and talking with people that usually with fibromyalgia there was some form of pre verbal trauma so if we consider the fact that there's all this squeezing embracing and you've done so much good work to already heal the cells and the gut and your immune system and your hormonal system it's almost like these peripheral nerves it's like the last piece of the puzzle because those were the ones that were impacted primarily when your little system was starting to develop back in the day when you were in mother again this is totally hypothetical but I'm making this up based on how I know the nervous system how it works and how these early in utero and pre verbal traumas can impact our entire physiology so again I wish I could say yes there is this example who this person said this occurred and it was peripheral peripheral neuropathy that was shifted and healed I don't have that story to share with you I'm mainly sharing my intuition when I pieced together how the system works and how it can brace and contract and because you said you had this so young my hunch is there was just something that occurred a long time ago maybe it was surgical maybe it was birth trauma maybe it was in utero it could it could have even been transgenerational intergenerational within your ancestry you know was there huge traumatic events that occurred throughout your your your historical ancestry that is indicative of bracing you know this person of the body personing of the lips holding anger in holding expression in having to keep armor on the body so that everything stays safe so those are my kind of hunches so I hope that's given you a little bit more insight and I'm glad that I got to meet you last year hopefully we'll see you again in the future okay gonna go to another question here on the Facebook then I'll get to the next question which is from Nara so if you're here listening Nara I got your question we will get to it soon okay Julie I'm pretty body aware and contract sensations in my body orient myself in space and have done a SC sessions with the therapist who are still who is still undergoing training I feel like I'm still carrying gestational early childhood trauma ah so I just talked a little bit about that there are times when frankly it's quite challenging let me just move this to do the work on myself and I would like the holding from another with this course still be useful as a foundation or should I be seeking a therapist to work with who's training Kathy Cain's work it can be useful it has been useful for many people and you know yourself best and we've had people do both we have had folks who have started to do smart body smart mind and they have you know said you know what I really need I need one on one person I need to have someone here this is that this is what I need to stay connected and resourced and they've decided to not continue and that's fine we do have a 30 day refund policy others have found that the way in which the lessons are taught knowing of course that they can still do one-on-one work on the side but the foundations and as you said here the foundations are are really built by learning the theory by getting into the basics of acting even when we've had a lot of training already and know that a lot of my if not all of my moderators who help in our team so team Lyon they came in to SBS M on their own accord right they did it for their own practice and their own sense of curiosity and they already had training and somatic experiencing they already had training with Cathy's work with the Feldenkrais work with other forms of work so I do agree and I know that for some it can be very challenging to do this work on their own and each person has to make the decision for them what they want to do what they feel is going to be best for them I do think that you have to go with your gut Julie and there's nothing wrong with looking for someone who's trained in Kathy's work I recommend it if people can find someone I do not know who that person is that you've just mentioned Judith Blackstone I don't know who that is and I'll be really honest - I have been to lots of trainings in this field and as have my colleagues and just because someone is trained in something doesn't necessarily mean that they're regulated and should be doing the work and so I did a video back in December November I think it is and crystal can pop it up for me it's how to find a really good somatic practitioner if you if depending on the path you choose to take Julie watch that video because it'll give you some insight into things that you will want to question potential therapists and practitioners this is for everyone actually it's a really good video because it just outlines some of the basic facts that we need to think about when we're looking for a somatic practitioner and I just want to make sure that people work with people who know what they're doing because we have worked with people with in smart body smart mind and also in my own private practice and my colleagues proud a practice where they've seen people who have been trained in exactly what we do and the results have not been the best and a lot of it comes down to that practitioners own disregulation and their ego a little bit of that and not listening to the person's physiology and going more by-the-book of what they've learned in class so we need to have both but we also have to be very discerning and so if we think of SBS M if I wrap it back to that if you can be very discerning and really go at your own pace I do believe all people can have benefit from this but you got to know what your style is and really listen to your system and go with what it needs okay Jules asks could you please say that author and book again I think I mentioned trauma spectrum by Roberts care he is one of his book I would say is probably one of the least mentioned books in our world of trauma healing and it should be mentioned more it's probably one of the books I look at the most what I'm looking for a reference around specifically chronic illness things like ticks Tourette's torticollis even working with stigmata which is when bumps and bruises come out of the system for no apparent reason I say that air quotes so he's really done his homework and looked at what he sees is kind of the missing link also in working with people who have these chronic conditions really deep deep conditions that have been with their system for a long time okay I'm gonna go into another question here on my papers this is from Nora and this is a great question so all them are great questions you guys but this is one that I have not had before so I'm gonna have a bit more tea how do rockstars sing all night long I don't know okay so Nara asks um I do not have any health issues I've never dieted I've never exercised so you're really healthy which is great and you're fifty years old and you have a good family life you're in a safe neighborhood neighborhood so you want to know so far what attracts me to SBS M is being and to the benefits because we have a list of things that shift as being more productive in our daily tasks and careers so here are the top three things should you say lately I haven't been able to organize or clean my house or cook somehow I don't seem to have time I end up choosing rest entertainment or sleep so this is really fascinating cuz Nara you are really healthy from the sounds of it which is great and there's something underlying that's telling you to slow down this is what I'm seeing here is my head my sense is you used to be able to organize your house and clean it and cook but there's something that's telling wants you to just rest and there's kind of a I don't know if it's an epidemic but it's a it's a way of living for especially women where we're where we keep on top of things and we don't miss a damn thing you know we have all of our bills paid everything stocked in the fridge everything is cleaned everything is pressed everything is organized and that is really useful and really important especially when we have a family life and it's busy it can also be and I say this because I have had this my own in my own experience it can also be a sign of pushing over things that we don't want to feel and if there was little things that occurred when we were young that pushed us to have this level of organization and well-being again all these things are really important these lifestyle behaviors aren't useful and important and if there was something that occurred when we were young that made it so that we had to be perfect and take care of ourselves so well eventually eventually some down somewhere down the line something will knock on our door and say you've got to stop now this doesn't mean that we stop and want everything to fall apart but there's something here that's knocking on my brain saying I wonder if your system is wanting to just have a bit of a rest so this doesn't mean of course that we want everything to fall apart but there's something that could be wanting to work with in terms of it and again I don't know your personal history and you don't have that down here and that's fine but is there something are there emotions are is there a sense of what we would call functional freeze this is something I lived with my whole life until my early 30s I was in a functional freeze so I was super organized super productive super successful great relationships you never had been in any types of massive situations that were dangerous to me but then I realized wow I'm also not noticing all these other things that have been stored and trapped away in my system and so what occurs Nara is that the body will start to give us things to look at like you're just gonna we're gonna make it so that you don't keep your house clean and that you have to rest more and so it could be that your system has reached I got to have a glass of water here it's like it's reached this point that it doesn't want to do anymore and so the system is going into a bit of a shutdown response that's kind of what this sounds like and it's very normal and the fact that you're asking this question is so good because this means that there's my senses there's something under that needs to be addressed ok the next question then I'll wrap this up into a full response you say that I've been a few entry-level positions for the last 20 weird years so under achieving my potential and definitely not earning enough to support my family can't figure out what self business would be a good fit either so this is a career question too so again again I'm making an assumption because I don't know your history but if we grew up in a world where we had to personality-wise be a certain type of person show up in a certain way be perfect in a certain way our true individuality a lot of people might call this authentic self I don't like that I'm like I'm more about who are you individually that individual spark that essence that life force energy is there but it's kind of like hidden somewhere like in your big toe or in your hip or or it's in the gut or and I say that in a kind of half joking way because somewhere in this body of ours is the essence of who we are some may say it's the soul some may say it's in the intuition doesn't matter where it is but each human from my experience has an individual spark of genius their creativity Elizabeth Gilbert talks about this a lot in her talk she's the woman that wrote Eat Pray Love and so when we've had to perform and be a certain way from very young if we were that baby who is left to cry ourselves to sleep or who was fed on a feeding schedule I mean these are the sorts of things that throw us off being able to listen to our biology we can get by really well with life which you have but then there'll be a point where the system's like there's more I know there's more and I don't know what it is but I know there's more I found Nara that a lot of our alumni who are in careers have changed their careers I'm thinking about one in particular one woman who worked a government job in DC I think the things she still is but she's looking to find ways to get out of that and she's building up her foundations her resources so that she can make a move and shift and learn how to go into healing work because she's realized that she wants to do this kind of work that i do which i think is great but a lot of people have just figured out their career paths by getting connected to their nervous system and getting out of the functional freeze that they might be in and it's possible that you don't even have the awareness that you're in some form of functional freeze and that is okay neither did I when I started this work and it was doing the practices working with my sensation tracking my emotion behavior that started to shift all of that you also say I'd like to start driving I take the train to work but need to start driving kids to various activities I took several driving courses still no luck I don't have that carefree attitude that I did when I was young and driving was no big deal so you want to know how can this course help me how can it help me organize my house cook achieve my potential with my career and start driving I don't think anyone mentioned improvement in those areas so to me this is all lifestyle right this is how you want to do the work that you're meant to do driving is an interesting one and we've had a lot of people say that their ability to drive has changed they're more aware of the environment around them they can feel their intuition a bit better their sense of spatial awareness is different so again this all comes down to how can you treat these things like driving as an experiment in nervous system physiology can you apply the practices that you might learn in SPS m to the wheel to seeing things around you to feeling your butt against the car seat there's a lot of ways that you can blend in and integrate the work into things like driving true story I worked with a woman ages ago she was quite young still living at home but an adult and we did one session online it might even been an hour I taught her some of the basics of just paying attention seeing the room around her etc and I think it was maybe four days later she wrote me back and she said for the first time in her life she spontaneously cleaned her room on her own without her mom having to ask her I know that's a one-off case that I'm talking about where we did one thing and all of a sudden boom she was able to clean her room but the essence of that story is that she shifted her focus to what it was around her from a more biological point of view rather than a behavioral I have to clean my room she started to see her surroundings a little differently and that spurred her to get in to clean her room so I wanted to share that experience so I actually I believe Nara that this will be a great fit for you because your system is doing quite well and the one thing I will suggest if you do choose to join is to go at your own pace so really like I'm thinking of enjoying like a meal that you really love rather than Wolfen down the sandwich like really or a bowl of soup take your time so of course that's a metaphor but smell it taste it stir it have one bite put the spoon down based on what you've said my hunch is there's a little bit of functional freeze going on and that's why you're finding it hard to find Drive in other parts of your life it's kept you really fit and well up until now and just know again I don't know your history but know that there could be some unresolved survival stress in your system that when it starts to come out you will feel maybe more experiences that would be this fight/flight energy and when that stuff gets released that life force energy starts to come up and it's part starts to spark and that's what we want a lot of people will say I just feel so dull and dead inside I don't have any Drive I see here that a lot and that's because there's this this freeze that's keeping these old survival energies inside of the system and so when we start to free up that shutdown by reconnecting and reconnecting to the environment that underlying survival energy will start to come up and we may feel that as anxiety and I don't want that to scare anyone because anxiety isn't a bad thing it is merely the survival energy that we are feeling so we have to refocus what we have called anxiety in the past and again I said this may be well over an hour ago when we fear these feelings of let's call it anxiety but it's really survival stress when we fear it and try to shift it and we try to get rid of it that's when it becomes more toxic and so I say this because it's possible that as you start to lift a little bit out of this what I am my hunch is this functional freeze you're gonna feel more energy in the system it might be what we call anxiety but it's just survival stress but if we keep that inside it's gonna be really hard to find our true individual essence because we're just sort of living through our personality versus who we really are at the core of our cells and soul so Nara I hope that's given you a little bit of insight I think I'm gonna create a video on that from my youtube channel cuz no one's ever asked me that and it is a great question so thank you for asking that I'm gonna get to one more question Nadia I see you popped something up there I'll get to that in a second and I get to something that outtie asks asked via email let me have a little bit more liquid here thank you everyone for being here we've got about 40 people listening in live right now and just a reminder if you've popped in the reason viewing this long from QA is because my online program smart body's smart mind we are closing doors for registration today I only open up registration once a year we start officially tomorrow morning with orientation week I can't believe school is already in session and then we go till the beginning of June if you haven't checked this out be sure to check out the program page it is somewhere on this video in the comments if you're watching this on YouTube it'll be within the show more section ok so adios asks I'm keenly interested in signing up but I do have some reservations this is totally natural you said I pursued the tre training and Trey is short for trauma release exercise training and never felt it did the trick for me I felt like I was controlling the amount and degree of tremoring and shaking and I wanted something to relieve the tension and trauma so this is really common and I know many people give me slack or I should say give me a bit of pain around speaking poorly around Trey and the reason why I'm quite adamant about this and because you've said that you've done the training and it really didn't stick or do the trick for you when our system I'm going to rephrase that we want to release trauma and survival stress based on how it wants to get out and so there's a bit of a danger when we try to pry trauma release and releasing trauma out of the system before it's ready and if something does the job if the the release if the shaking is actually genuine and real there should not be any more of that it's gone so once you have a release of something and it's organic and it comes through the body naturally that layer that level is shifted this does not mean we may not have other emotions sensations behaviors old patterns of what we call procedural memory to come out but we don't want to go into the same loop and so I just want to acknowledge that you sharing this is what I have seen to many of our students especially those with early trauma experiences lots of scary things in their lives we'll say that it's just it's either too intense or it's kind of looks like it's like a boat coming into Harbor it just can't find that entry point it's like it's trying and it's trying but there's all this fog and the reason why this often occurs is the system goes into these shaking responses through something like tray it's really an it's bioenergetic work as well it's not just the tray work there's other forms of cathartic work that poke the system to have a visceral motor response but if we're not having that come out organically and naturally we're missing some very pieces of the puzzle so you did say here outtie that you grew up in a in a it looks like an abusive family alcoholic family both parents you Wis and witnessed your older sister being raped by a bunch of boys in the garden I'm really sorry that that occurred and I'm sharing this because this is the reality that many of us have lived with you were nine and you said that this memory surface during a stint of rehab back in 2014 and you had to call your younger sister to confirm and this was never openly discussed so you grew up in a barrio with a lot of gang violence fists and knives so again this is something that a lot of people grow up with and they don't realize how deeply it impacts them until we're adults and we know this through the adverse childhood experiences study that when we've had this kind of adversity but also adversity let's say through birth trauma through being under medical surgery surgical interventions over over doesn't just have to be this level of violence I'm it can be but it isn't just reserved for this so you said that um so this is like a classic history of early trauma where it isn't just one event it's the whole environment was unsafe and so you then say last year you cross the street you jaywalked nothing wrong with jaywalking by the way it's just that your orientation wasn't to the environment so you cross the street and you were struck by a minivan so you had a Shock Trauma you didn't pass out there wasn't a concussion but since then you've had a lot of neck tension and you have to go see a chiropractor every five weeks for an adjustment for an adjustment and then you say I'm emotionally immature and wake up with feelings of fear and anxiety I'm unemployed and I'm living off of savings and they're dwindling so you've watched the three the three videos which is great and you've paid for drop-in sessions so you want to know if this program will help me I again everyone's different so again don't have my crystal ball and I have to be very careful at saying yes this will and because of the way you've worded this and because if you're you you know you have a desperation and I can tell through your words that you really want to heal you've uncovered some really deep past wounds and then you had this shock trauma and in the video one if you can recall I made that example of the two people who get into the same car accident and one walks away and they're fine the other walks away and there's whole system just crumbles in some ways your system is that second system that I talked about person B I think I mentioned in the video and so this is really common and there's a reason I use that example because most of the folks that I would see who had a Shock Trauma like an accident like a car accident like you know falling off of something when we look at their history we realized wow it was a real scary world when you were growing up and now your system basically got cracked open with this Shock Trauma and so part of smart body smart mind is this building a foundation of learning about what your physiology is what your nervous system is how to reconnect to what is there and when you say your wake up it your waking up with fear and anxiety that is a sign that there is and again I'll use my glass of water here as an example there's all this survival stress through the system that's just having a party right and you wake up and because when we're asleep we go into kind of that unconscious state the things bubble up and then we feel it and our heart is racing and it's essentially the system is looking for that danger that you grew up with in the barrio with all these gang fights that was not safe and so your system has created a map of danger and the world is a dangerous place that's how it sees things and so when we have that lens that we live with we can do one of two things we don't orient properly to the here and now and that could be why you were hit and it's horrible that that happened and usually these things occur because we're not connected to what's around us we don't hear the sound of the tires we don't feel the change in wind coming towards us our senses are a little dulled and when our senses are dulled it does make us more susceptible to getting into accidents to having people come towards us who are not safe we can't have the proper perception of danger or safety excuse us and it does put us into more harm's way so if anything to get back that essence of appropriate connection to your environment is really going to be important so that your system starts to shift and turn off of the safety I should say the danger map to more of a safety map working with the stress organs which is what we do in the program so namely the kidneys the adrenals the brainstem the gut all the various areas of the body that we work with in smart body smart mind it's working to help basically wake up and give more juice in life back to these parts of our bodies that have been shrunk and in some ways dead-end due to too much going on on the outside and so we have to shut down from what is in here and so this is where tre for example isn't necessarily the type of practice for someone that has this sort of history Oddie it's it's really about restoring regulation back to the system restoring more capacity back to the system more sense of safety back to the system and then when that is established when we have like I see this image right of solid ground when the solid ground is there and we know it can be you know moved by a stress by something occurring to us the rest that we build above can be more solid and so I have no doubt that there might be some shaking that needs to come out of your body as a result of that car accident or seeing the things that you saw when you were young occur into your sister but we want that to come out when your body is ready for it to come out if it tries to come out too soon it isn't going to do the trick and those survival stresses that I talked about inside are still gonna stay there they're going to stay so stay stuck so I do believe it will help and again for everyone here you have to show up you have to do the work and you have to pace yourself and honor your system and honor when it needs to pause when it needs to rest and to also honor the emotion and the sensations that are felt and this actually so hopefully hopefully I that gives you a little more information so you can make an informed decision about joining and that goes really nicely into the last the question I here have here where did it go where did it go Nadia asked about working with rage and anger here's the interesting thing so when we have had something occur like this history that I'll D give me allowed us allowed me to talk about for whatever reason if we have had things that have happened to us that have been not fair bad maybe we were abused attacked whether it is emotional verbal physical sexual environmental it will mount a response in our system of fight and flight and then if we cannot resolve with fighting off or fleeing we go into shutdown and so things like anger and rage we want them to come out in a way that again is not explosive but is contained and when anger comes out it can come out pretty darn big and it we don't want this to come out until the system has that foundation so that it can really feel that big energy coming out and the system underneath stays solid so a lot of the worry that people have in the fear around letting out anger and letting out healthy aggression and even yes rage an even annihilation energy this is something we talked about a little bit when that comes out again it needs to come out when the system is ready and it will come out spontaneously but so often we think oh I need to get my anger and I better scream I better hit something I better punch something if all we do is scream and punch the only thing the system knows is screaming and punching it needs to have that internal visceral emotion little sensorial connection to that emotion it needs to be met with all the other physiological responses that match with that level of energy and intensity so because I know there's a lot of questions around chronic fatigue and illness if our systems capacity is so small right now we can't ask it to emit that level of energy because it doesn't have the space it's here so to ask it to be like this it doesn't work and so the thing Nadia to working with anger and rage is again we don't go directly and say okay today we're gonna work with anger and rage I want you to scream for 10 minutes we don't do that we build this capacity through these exercises it's very different than what we see in cathartic practices because I am NOT interested in your system emitting something that it is not ready for it would be like me asking myself you know as an example I want to go climb Everest Mount Everest just drop me off at the base camp with a helicopter and I'm just going to start walking today that would be very bad because my system has not climatized to that altitude it hasn't done the physical training to be in the cold with all the gear and I've lost my skills on mountaineering I don't have that skill set anymore therefore I'm not going to put myself at Everest base camp tomorrow and just start hiking and so it's the equivalent with working with big things like anger rage and I annihilated energy even working with shame we don't want to go right into it we have to build up the foundation and really our nervous system fitness if you will so that when those movements and when that emotion comes out the system is ready and it has no fear around it but when someone says to me I'm a really I'm really afraid around letting out this anger most this is a very common thing I'm afraid I'll hurt myself or I'll hurt someone else that is the tell-tale sign that that system needs more capacity because when anger comes and there's capacity there is no question it comes out and it's contained it's like a mama bear protecting her cubs from a wolf she doesn't have to think this is gonna hurt me in that wolf I better no I can't do this it just comes out right because that's the natural world and so humans we have disconnected so much from our natural world and a lot of bad stuff has happened to us that shouldn't have happened to us and so we have this confusion around how to get these big emotions and energies out and so again I know I'm sounding like a broken record but we need to build the capacity and the foundation and the awareness especially the awareness so that we can let these big emotions out and not hurt others and not hurt ourselves this is what violence is violence and abuse is when the person is not able to contain their rage and fight responses they don't know how to stop them and so then it gets exploded out and it hurts others or it hurts themselves anger is really important it becomes troublesome when it becomes violence and harm and criminal activity and so we're really trying to work with this stuff so that nothing like that occurs I mean when we have that containment we will not hurt other people because we are empathetic to the system and the person that we are maybe with especially if it's our kids I've worked with people who have hit their kids and they are mortified by that and they will say the impulse was so strong and I couldn't help I couldn't stop myself and that's true it's because again the system doesn't have a stopping mechanism it's not contained right and so again anger is important but we have to be very careful about how we work with it all right okay my questions are done from the paper let's go here be there for breach Co yeah you say I'm a trade provider and I find it's a marvelous tool as its empowering let me just get this here the reason you mentioned is very reason of the SE training to complement the tray yes too much emphasis yeah so you've noticed that with complex trauma I have noticed with the complex trauma there's a tendency to high energy and high intensity so how to assume that a system will self-regulate when it does not learn self regulation when it does not learn self regulation all its life Leasing in high energy high intensities a coping mechanism I'm so interested in continuing my town regulation skill set and to be able to teach other people during my programs great so I'm really glad that you mentioned that because I do have colleagues I see colleagues who are tray trained and when they get more of the early trauma knowledge and the complex trauma knowledge on board they use it very sparingly it isn't the only practice and so there's a way to titrate that work and the reason I'm very much adamant about talking about why we can't just do that we can't just go into shaking is because right now as a generality people are looking for that quick fix you know you can get YouTube videos and do it on YouTube and that to me is a disaster waiting to happen because if the system doesn't know how to handle what's going on internally it can override huge and then the system will not know what to do so I appreciate you having that that level of understanding Fabricio it's really important okay Sharon says you mentioned working with shame is not something that's directly in the in the program I directly address it in the theory there is no specific exercise though where I say okay today we're going to work with Shane and the reason why is because everyone is different and when we've done the job of building up the foundations tracking sensation and knowing how to track our experiences our body postures it starts to come out in a natural organic way let me explain so some of the lessons work on posture very subtle elements of posture some of the lessons are working with connecting the spine with the head and the neck and the pelvis some of them are working with hand movements some of them are working with hands movements coming to the body to connect to self-soothe to open up we work with some breath movements that move breath into parts of the body so we're really working from a body level lens Sharon not an emotional lens and the reason why is emotions start in the body of sensation and then they get interpreted in the brain via via the brain and then we label them anger sadness right so there's really if you think about disgust and anger and happiness and surprise and all these different emotions that the human has they are a body of visceral quality and so we're really working at that body level so that you as this student can become more intelligent again there's a reason that's called smart body smart mind not smart - smart body we want to work with the body first and as we start to build up the robustness and the flow and the resiliency back to the system it will allow these old unprocessed emotions specifically obviously shame as one of them toxic shame I call it will come up and out and one of the gateway emotions to working with shame is disgust so this element of just that bad taste like something being gross something yucky something being off and so there's really no need to work specifically with it because all these other pieces help to MMM conjure up and support and move and bring those those very old imprints of toxic shame up and out and when they come up and out we have to follow our impulse allow the behavior that's wanting to come up come up and out often with toxic shame and we have that awareness of the disgust there will be a sense of feeling something yucky in our mouth like a real visceral quality sometimes there's dry heaving because it's going deep into the this area here that often what got collapsed when we went into our shame responses and so as we start to move and open up the diaphragm and the viscera and all of the cells that basically were imprinted with that toxic cellular shame the system will will give you what needs to occur for that to come up and out and the reason I say it will give you is it can be different for everyone for some people it might be anger for others it might be deep grief and sadness for others it could be a physical symptom that starts to come up and is moved out so everyone is going to have a different way in which this stuff comes out and so it comes back to the bay the main core curriculum of SBS M is building these foundations I cannot do that movement with my hands enough we're building these layers so that there just becomes more capacity and robustness in the in the physical system for those of you that are here and have not yet watched the videos the healing trauma videos I know we're coming down to the crunch to register for SBS M but video number one talks about my analogy of the swimming pool and these beach balls inside and the importance of having that swimming pool which is my way of saying our body and bigger and bigger and capacities so that the stressors the balls can have room to move and when they have room to move we can release them and it feels less crazy when we have more space there's more room for what's in our system and so really the thesis if you will of this practical work and the theory that you learn in SBS M is making more space not allowing more things to come in because now that we know this information it should be quite simple to go oh well the next time I have a traumatic response it's really important that I listen to that and I stay connected and I feel it and I let the tears the emotion the movement the spontaneous shaking to come up and out right so we could say that that's quite simple but all of our patterns that are going to tell us that it's not that simple will pop up and I'm here to say it can be that simple it's our conditioning that has taught us that it is not that simple right we've labeled things that we feel is bad and that we have to get rid of them and what we're doing in this program is we're trying to reroute and rewire the way in which we have spoken to ourselves mentally but also viscerally so that it can start to express what it needs and wants so in a weird way Sharon we work directly with shame and we also work with it indirectly through getting the body back online and getting its flow back all right I am going to end you guys because I am my voice is ready to say I need a break I've covered a lot if I have not gotten to your question if I miss something send us an email to support I'm also going to do another Q&A today at 4 p.m. but if you are here and you are feeling the pull to do this work with me this year now is the time to get in we are only open for another 12 hours for registration the program at this point has been taken from people out of 47 countries so people from 47 countries worldwide have gone through this program combined with my two online programs we've had over 63 countries sign up for something in the realm of working with me online smart body smart mind is what we're registering people for right now it is again a program where we all move through together at the same time while we encourage you to go at your own pace we also encourage you to be in the energy field of the group and work at your own pace and really the group field the support is pretty phenomenal and we know through a lot of research and science right now that there is real benefit to being together as a group and healing and working and learning together so that is one of the bonuses of starting now as you've got this support for the next 12 weeks as I mentioned when you join you are a member for life so the content lives on and you access it all year round and it's more than just a year you have this indefinitely while we remain here on the internet it will be there for you and we will open up registration again next year so this is really the only time that you can get in this year if this is pulling you if this is feeling like a fit and you want to give it a try please do so we do have a refund policy it is on the website 30 days we ask that you go through the work and you really put in the time and the energy and the curiosity and the learning and the practices to play and if at the end of those 30 days it just doesn't feel right then we will honor your decision to to to not continue and that's fine so just know that there is that security mechanism in there if you want to give it a go and final thing is this is really a lifestyle I'm gonna say that again I said that at the beginning of our talk today this is not something that ends at 12 weeks this is an ongoing process it's a lifelong learning it's like learning a second language I have been doing this work for many many years I started really this apprenticeship of nervous system in 2004 working with trauma specifically in 2008 and while I have solid regulation in my system and clearly I'm able to function in society and do well I am still working with old traumas that are coming through my system so it's important for everyone to know that this is a lifelong process and when we have these tools on board our world becomes a little simpler because things make a little more sense so I will leave it at that I'll sign off with that final note again check out our registration page take some time to read through it I want people to make an informed decision we have an FAQ page there are some six steps success stories of our SPS m alumni there's some videos there's some written words get to know them if you have any technical questions just send us an email support at Irene line comm we'll get back to you and we start tomorrow bright and early 11:00 a.m. with orientation week so maybe we'll see you there if you choose to join us thanks for showing up live and being here you guys and if you're watching the recording thank you for watching this after the fact we will see you next time", "2g4C0LZfA-A": "hey everyone Irene here live on Facebook thank you for being here watching the recording if you're watching this you're probably watching the recording and we just had a little bit of a blip with my sound so I had to come back on so I'm going to wait for some folks to get back here hopefully the sound is working it looks like it is I had one little plug that was in that wasn't the right one so what we want to do today I'm going to be doing a bunch of questions that have already been submitted through Facebook so thank you if you have typed in a question either through this Facebook page or through my facebook group healthy nervous system revolution if you haven't joined this group yet please go over there maybe after you watch this to join we have a few more I would say there's more deep conversation going on over there myself and my team are in there answering questions and it's a place to just have some more in-depth conversations around healing trauma in the nervous system so of course I am Irene Lyon and I am all about teaching you and helping you learn what it become what it means to become your own medicine and to really get into the depths the the the trenches of working with our stress physiology working with storage traumatic stress and restoring health and regulation back to the nervous system and what I'm gonna do I'm gonna start to get into these in a second I wanted to cover one little topic at the start so last week right now it's January 2nd so last year in 2019 I covered a few of what I would call the key things that we experienced when our nervous system is regulated I wrote an article on that and we can pop that up for you it's like the nine key benefits when we have a regulated nervous system last week I talked about the importance of how when we have a regulated nervous system we have better immune system function our ability to come down and out of stress responses is more natural it is more easy we don't actually have to do anything consciously the systems takes over and we come out of a stress response that is what occurs when we have regulation on board now if you're here chances are this is not the case in your system and that's why you're here learning and hopefully you will start working with me in the new year so that we can help you learn to get this back on board today I want to do a little tiny bit and talk about what occurs to our I like to call it our higher brain and cognitive function when we have a more regulated nervous system so basically this is gonna sound odd if you've never heard this before but in my line of work which is the world of somatic experiencing the work of somatic practice that is Kathy Cain's work one of my mentors I'm going to mention her actually in one of the cute cues and a is today and another form of work that I practice and work with in movement is called the Feldenkrais method so I'm going to talk about that a tiny bit today as well but all these methods here when we are working with them they form a really strong hierarchy if you will of methodologies practices to work at different levels as a physiology and when we have got we call it unsurvivable serve I should say this again when we have unresolved survival stress my tongue got twisted there it is really tough for our higher brain to function properly and we would say in our work that the brain up here is an end organ the brain is an end organ just like our digestive system and our kidneys and adrenals and our hormonal systems that all these systems are this end organ meaning that when we are trapped in survival stress when our fight flight and freeze mechanisms are going kind of on all the time whether it's high high arousal or high high shutdown our brain isn't impacted by these stress chemicals and those chemicals specifically cortisol which is a long-acting steroid hormone when we have chronic stress anyone here who is suffering from some form of chronic illness autoimmune that hormone cortisol gets into our cells it impacts ourselves and it is toxic in a way to our cells specifically parts of our brain and specifically an area called the hippocampus which is important for memory it's important for other things but that's one of the key things so when we are trying to think when we're trying to recall a memory when we're trying to write something when we're trying to use this higher brain function and we have this underlying survival stress that is as we would say running the front of the bus it's driving our behavior it's driving our actions we cannot think clearly we cannot take a book and read it and remember what we just read it's hard for us to recall directions where we went the week before all these things that we store in our brain is impacted by our survival physiology when we start to restore regulation back to the system and we start to get safety back on board cellular safety and our stress organs something that I've talked about in the past I have a video on my youtube channel on how to work with the stress organs and why it's important to work with the stress organs this is something I do in my online program specifically smart body smart mind when we work with these stress organs we start to the word that's coming for me it's like we're defusing it's like we're basically clipping the wires to this system of ours that wants to see everything is threat and we're slowly slowly dismantling our over-reactive hard-wired stress response that many of us have maybe had since we were like really little and even in utero and for some of our histories and some of our cultures for generations so I wanted to start off with just with one little quick topic before we get into more other topics here and that's that when we have got our stress physiology that's survival energy that fight flight and freeze running the front of our bus and it's dictating how our entire system works our organs it also impacts our brain and then our brain our higher brain this cognitive brain of ours not the primitive brain but the parts of us that think and create and write and can understand language all of it it gets thrown off a lot of people know the topic ad D so attention deficit disorder this is a term that is has been used and it's becoming I think a little more popularized in that we now know that this is not a true disease it is a symptom of an underlying problem and that underlying problem this inability to have attention to concentrate is because there is this other show going on underneath the cognitive function running the front of the bus as I said causing chaos and then the system can't concentrate it's constantly I'm kind of looking around right now it's looking for danger it's looking for that threat it's looking for that scary monster that we think is in the closet when really it isn't a scary monster it is just this overall sense of unsafe T usually because something early in our life or in utero wasn't safe and the interesting thing with this work is time does not heal these wounds like if you were to get a cut on your hand and granted of course your immune system is in fairly good health eventually that cut granted you don't have a blood disorder or anything like that it clots it seals up it scabs you might get a bit of a scar and if of course we take care of our skin and we have good vitamins and minerals just the basic ones that scar can even go away that happens without us having to think about it without us having to do anything the interesting thing with the human autonomic nervous system it doesn't do that on its own one of the reasons why is because interestingly enough we have this higher brain that stores memory and tensions through our entire nervous system and it locks on to them because of our complexity so I'm going to get into some more questions but as I do that I'm gonna scroll and see who is here thank you for everyone being here we have about 48 people on live I'm glad you guys can hear me now I'm Derek asks any tips for alterative colitis yes I have many and what I'm going to be talking about today is going to be 100% related to ulcerative colitis gut problems digestive digestive problems autoimmune chronic pain chronic fatigue fibromyalgia migraine headache really horrific PMS Rhea nodes are SD so all of these classifications chronic anxiety depression they all fall into a window that we would call syndrome all now if you've never heard that term that's okay it's a term that we use more in our collegial fields within somatic experiencing but a syndrome is a byproduct of the nervous system being in dysregulation or as I like to say sometimes out of whack so we have the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system working at cross-purposes and when that occurs the gut doesn't get a chance to repair because we aren't going into what's called low tone dorsal of the parasympathetic this is what we want to go in to have true rest digest when we sleep at night and we're just and Wednesday we're just chilling out on the couch watching a show or reading a book our system we want our system to go into healing mode but if it is stuck as I mentioned a five minutes ago five minutes ago or so in that survival energy that gut lining doesn't get repaired at night and then that's where it becomes ulcer that's where we get leaky gut because there isn't this barrier that's being stitched back up so the tips are not tips per se they are getting back regulation into your nervous system learning what it means to reconnect to the body reconnect to the natural emotions reconnect to the sensations to the biology I've done some videos I'm going to name some of them right now and then crystal my assistant is here popping them in be sure to watch these after the fact there's a video I did quite a while ago on see if I can get the title right how a chronic illness occurs so it's basically I draw a graph of how when we have too much fight flight and freeze energy running the front of our show we pop into these syndromes second to that I would recommend checking out some of my videos on orienting I have a shorter blog and the longer QA on the power of orienting these are some of the basic practices that I teach my students when they work with me online in my programs and that is reconnecting to our environment reconnecting to our body and reconnecting to the ground under us I know that seems really simple and really basic but when we get into this work even deeper and we're in more advanced levels it is those basic elements that we want to keep coming back to so being able to restore that sense of I'm in the here and now restoring safety to the system and then also being able to consciously feel our biology and listen to it but when we come down to digestive stuff a lot of folks will say and there's a whole industry on helping people eat better and cleanse the gut and all of that I think those are really important this is and what I've seen is just a healthy diet in general is usually all we need a lot of the fancy stuff we're doing it's just not necessary why our system has gotten so far off is because of this underlying stress physiology that's just pushing the envelope too far you add in the stresses of work and family and the world and uncertainty and all the things going on right now on the planet and it's just adding more stress to the system so hopefully that gives you a few tips on ulcerative colitis it is not something that I can give you a 12-step list for and we follow it but there are foundations and basics that we want to start with and here's what's interesting when my students go through this work and they really become apprentices of their nervous systems they'll see if they have something like a gut thing going on that will slowly shift as will their immune system to other things as will their sleep as Werth will their ability to relate better to their let's say there's their kids or their partners they'd find that their creativity starts to shift because I mentioned a few minutes ago that higher brain when it is being influenced by the stress hormones it can't function properly so I'm gonna leave it at that and I'll get to some more questions here Elizabeth thank you for your comment someone just mentioned that one of their doctors is interested in this work which is great and please know that I am one person I'm really obviously online more than any of my colleagues and bridging together methodologies into one but there are a lot of good people out there my colleagues in general who are doing really good work so this work isn't something that I have personally invented it is just the natural biology that I'm teaching you how to get back into so I'm glad to see that doctors and other health care providers are become more interested in this work I think it's gonna take some time but my hope is that by the time I am off of this physical plane this will just be common knowledge to all people in the healthcare world in the teaching world in the medical world because it's actually what was written in our biology to begin with and we've kind of steered off the path because we've tried to pathologize everything we've tried to put everything in a box and now we're starting to see that actually if we work on this one underlying root piece which is our autonomic nervous system and regulating it and getting it back into a restorative spot all of the tentacles that it touches which is everything they all start to improve so I think it would be silly for anybody in the health and healing role not to have this information on board because it'll just help them do their job in a much more easier way and hopefully it'll put some of us out of work you never know thank you everybody for your comments Sophia asks how does menopause affect our nervous system I think this is all very individual I was talking to a girlfriend the other day who just turned into her her 50th year living here on this planet and she didn't have any of it there was nothing one month she had her period and she realized three months later that she hadn't have had it didn't have it and she is very healthy she's in the same work that I do nothing no hot flashes no hormonal changes she's very diligent with her activity with her mindfulness with food with friends as a really good social circle has good work that she does and I know that in certain Asian cultures my mother is from the Philippines she's similar didn't Lee even though she did have stress in her life she was active she ate well just she didn't have those symptoms that so many women do in Western world so I think and I am NOT an expert in women's health but from what I've seen women and other cultures that are more Eastern more to the land in tribe support strong faith they tend to not have the same symptom ology that us do in this world of stress and excessive food consumption not enough activity not enough sunlight not enough sleep so that might not be the best answer to your question Sophia but hopefully that gives you an idea because we have to remember again the autonomic nervous system connects to all of the physiological organs and systems and the hormonal system the endocrine system is one of them and so our reproductive organs produce hormones so does our brain but of course the ovaries and testes produce respective progesterone adjust progesterone estrogen the testes testosterone and a few other hormones and so when our nervous system is well and healthy our organ systems just do what they are meant to do when it is unhealthy it sends signals to these organ systems and of course the endocrine systems within those organ systems and things can go a little wonky and not work the way they should so again I've seen and I've heard within my population of students and clients that this is another system that starts to change it becomes more regular and it becomes less of a burden for many people when they have that health back into their system okay I'm gonna get into a question that was sent in via our Facebook group healthy nervous system revolution and have a little water first this is from Tina and she asks I'd like to know the connection between trauma and OCD so that's obsessive-compulsive disorder for example when one suffers from compulsive movement an exercise and feels unable to sit down is it then the same I'm just going to answer that rather than read the rest of this so remember what I said a little while ago about safety and I mean made the example of a DD it's attention deficit disorder again not a real disease we're starting to realize it is not it was thought that it is a result of circumstance and the environment the best book to read on this is Gabor Matt Hayes book scattered Minds will pop that in the little in the links below probably one of the best books I've ever read not just for that but for parenting in general it's a wonderful book so a DD and OCD and many of these other um things that we've abbreviated are typically a result of unresolved trauma typically unresolved early and developmental trauma if we have had a really strong wiring from the beginning those first three years of life that is when the autonomic nervous system is really being formed and we want those positive healthy nurturing attuned secure connections so first three years of life and when we were in utero when we have a really good early start and we have a Shock Trauma later in life we bounce back a lot faster much faster because that wiring is all there it's like a house that's been built on really strong foundation with really good engineering blueprints and we had top-level engineers and top-level builders and stonemasons and and carpentry carpenters and all the people that make the house solid they were just solid it was really good if that house has a storm chances are if it was built really well it might just get a little weathering on the paint right or maybe a tile will fly off of the roof I don't know a shame something like that you'll be solid when there's stress but if that house was not built securely strongly with good foundation good engineering good blueprints good carpenters and electricians and all of this when there is a storm or an earthquake that house can crack and crumble pretty darn fast and the nervous system is no different so when we have got a person who has had that kind of upbringing where it wasn't solid where there weren't foundations in place what that person as a child adult adolescent will do as they will any devil of water they will look for ways to control because their physiology internally is a mess it is in chaos it is so confused and it is looking for ways to build that foundation but it doesn't know how it would be like um I joke with my husband I am I am a terrible person for putting things together like IKEA there's a purpose behind the story IKEA furniture that kind of thing I just something about it my brain doesn't work with it but if you give me a refrigerator full of food and some sauce and oil and garlic and onions and spices I can whip up the best pasta ever like I can do that stuff intuitively but something about building things my brain doesn't work when it's more structure based I'm not sure why if we think about a child or an adolescent or or an adult and they didn't get that primary wiring that solid foundation and then they're in the world they're in school they're out at a park they're in life and they feel something isn't right inside and they're trying to figure out they're trying to figure out how do I build this foundation how do I build this foundation but there was no map there was no writing of how that occurred that's like me trying to put together IKEA furniture it just won't work I can try it but it's a strain it's hard so when we have things like OCD we we've seen that it is a way for someone to control something externally it's hard to say this stuff in words right the internal is so chaotic and screwed up for lack of a better word because it's true right there's this dysregulation it's a mess and so they're trying to create no mess on the outside and one way of doing that is to have things very typical when we think of OCD we think of lining things up right ever have it everything in order having excessive cleaning excessive safety around germs always washing hands but it can also be as you said here Tina I can't just sit down and be still I have to move that's in some ways mmm verging on that idea of attention deficit or attention deficit hyperactivity it's like the system is so riled up internally it's trying to find a way to shift out of that chaos by behavior it's trying to shift out of that internal chaos by changing the behavior to try that the system is desperately trying to come down it's desperately trying to deactivate when we had that solid blueprint that solid foundation and I'm gonna say this now because I have a question coming up it'll answer this when we've had a solid foundation our window of tolerance for stress is really wide we can have a lot of we can have a lot of those storms and earthquakes and hurricanes hit our house which is code for the body and we bounce back they might be like whoa that was really intense but I'm actually okay and whoo I just need to feel that oh and then the system goes on and it's fine that's having a very high window of tolerance or a very wide window but when we didn't have that foundation we may not actually have a real window of tolerance we might have a window of tolerance that's like a fine line literally and so we can only handle things when we are in control of everything and if we can control it then we know what's coming so OCD ad D eating disorders a lot of narcissism a lot of personality disorders these things where we're trying to control the environment and the situations because essentially internally it is chaos so it is nothing well it's not nothing more it is simply a behavior that is there to try to make sense of the chaos inside so of course the question might be well what do we do to help this and heal this the answer is pretty much the same we have to go back to learning how to listen to the physiology we have to reconnect to the here and now we have to reconnect to the environment we have to work with emotion that has been thrown off and is either excessive or is shut down right with a lot of certain situations they'll be outbursts of rage and anger that is not controlled and so we need to find ways to slowly let that emotion out in a way that doesn't harm the person or other people if someone is so shut down that they've numbed out we have to find ways to stimulate the system so that they can feel the body the sensations so again it all comes back to be regulating and restoring health back to the entire physiology and that is something of course that we do in the work that I do online and of course if you work with a really solid trained somatic experiencing practitioner who is trained in early trauma developmental trauma and working with the body in movement that's what you want to work with those are the things that I have been trained in and that I offer in my so I hope that answer has served not just yourself Tina but everyone here listening who may have individuals in their lives or maybe you yourself are struggling with that internal chaos essentially it all comes back to the same thing same with the question that someone asked about ulcerative colitis while it doesn't look like a mental representation we would call you know we would classify things like OCD and that as a mental disturbance as a mental illness I see them my colleagues see them all is the same it's all about the system being dysregulated and then depending on the person's genetics depending on the environment how that pops out might be as a autoimmune condition it might be as chronic pain chronic tension or it could be an eating disorder or OCD or a DD everyone's going to be different here because we're all super complex just looking here at the the questions for those of you listening to this on YouTube or watching and Nico asks I'd like to know how to approach trauma that I don't remember so this is actually something that I've done in another video a nico so i'm gonna get you to look at that one crystal will pop that summer beneath here we don't need to remember the trauma because if we had had earlier developmental trauma which is under the age of three our ability to cognitively make sense of the world isn't online and so the memories that we form are not going to be cognitive or verbal because it was all pre verbal they're gonna be so Maddock by that i mean they're going to be body based they're going to be completely related to sensation movement it could be behavior it could be emotion but even really really young those emotions haven't been developed so this is where we may feel and hence physiological reaction and it makes no sense I've talked in the past about the first and ever time I had a massive panic attack there was no context no memory it made no sense but I was somewhere where I was confined and I couldn't get out it wasn't something that was abusive I was on a bridge driving I think that day I was a little more stressed than maybe normal I'm not sure but my heart just spiked I started to sweat I started to feel this panic I started to shake I started to feel tingles come down my legs of course because I've got the training I've got I went into the mode of you know loosen the clothes roll down the windows orient feel notice don't try to breathe it away just be with it and it shifted why that happened there I'm not sure I have my ideas based on my history also based on knowing my mom's history growing up in a war-torn country in the Philippines when the Japanese had them under martial law she was trapped a lot of the times perhaps I was an egg and her ovaries and that imprint was still in my system who knows so this is for everyone here there will be things that occur to our physiologies when we start to get into this work and we start to have awareness of this work even having this education on board that you guys are all learning now is enough to prime your system to start to get the wheels in motion for these old past traumatic imprints to come out so they may not make any sense and that's okay so watch that video an eco and then see how it goes and if you would like to of course work with me and my team we're going to be doing lots of stuff in the coming year in the next few months I'm going to get back to another question here on my papers so this is from cordula and she wants to know about much muscle tension muscle tension I used to think that I would always be in freeze mode but now I understand that I'm in a fight flight mode lot of muscle activation and freeze on the top so yes this is very common we can have a lot of that fight flee mode so that's that sympathetic activation wanting to fight and get the heck away run but then we'll have this shutdown response this is actually the primary way that most Western worlds and industrialized worlds live because if we all just fought and fled our babies wouldn't get taken care of nobody would learn a thing and nobody would get the job done to run our societies it wouldn't work so what do we have to do we have to freeze we have to shut down we have to bottle it all up inside and when that happens we are shutting down the impulses to punch our boss in the face or to punch our mom in the face because she didn't listen to us or run into the house because we just saw mom and dad fighting or we just saw something we didn't like there's so many things that we shut down because we actually can't safely express those survival energies so there's kind of this epidemic right now in our culture and we've been having it for many years decades hundreds of years where we have tight muscles we have tensions in our lower backs we have restless leg syndrome at night where we just want to shake our legs where there's pain and your question asks is it good to do progressive muscle relaxation I stretch a lot but my muscles always feel drained so here's what's interesting is there's two reasons why muscles muscles first of all are meant to do one of two things they contract and they relax if their whole held in a tense state something is not right right if I was to drink this glass of water or take a step but keep holding this glass that doesn't make sense I'm done having a sip I need to put it down relax my hand a lot of us will do these sorts of things I'm keeping it a real neutral example and then we'll put our glass down and while our hand will stay tense and it isn't because the hand wants to stay tense it's because something in our physiology doesn't know how to let go it doesn't know how to deactivate and that occurs when other things in our lives have kept us tight so if we aren't allowing ourselves to have a tear come out when we need to cry or maybe we want to say something to someone and we keep it in or maybe we're holding in our urine or our bowel movements because we can't go to the washroom because we're not allowed to go on break yet I hope you get the idea all these ways that we hold tension it's not just a muscle action it's how we hold our emotions how we hold our behaviors how we hold just all these things it doesn't just stay with that it transfers into everything else and so if we think about tension in the body it can be because of that because we're actively holding everything it could also be because of faulty movement and faulty posture if I do this call like this with you guys for the next hour and a half this side of my neck is gonna get really tired because I'm having to hold myself up from falling right same thing if I walk hunched my back and my lower back and my hamstrings and my neck are all working to keep me from falling flat on my face so there is an element here of postural function and having attention to the body and ensuring it isn't stuck in a certain position that is causing muscles to be tight now I worked with many people in my history of being an exercise therapist and a rehab specialist working with say people who have really bad scoliosis and their spines and the spine is tight because it's position that's not relatable to how as humans were meant to be bipedal and moving in flow and so working with those people who've had these really severe scoliosis we need to work on the muscles and help them relax so that they take a break but then when that person stands up and goes back in that position it's going to kind of come back so there's certain real physical defects that might shift muscles into being tight or I should also say physical malfunctions but then there's this underlying autonomic nervous system stress and strain that we keep on our body that creates not just a part of the spine to be tight the entire physiological system typically when someone has chronic tension it's not just showing up in their lower back it's showing up in how their bowels move it's showing up in their immune system it's showing up and how they relate to their spouses and their kids it's rarely just in one spot so you know what I've found is that people who get into this work and notice these strains and then actively are like wow I'm still holding my hand as if I'm holding onto this glass I better shift that and it starts with conscious awareness and this is where our higher brain comes into play because if we're not able to pay attention to the fact that we're tense we're not going to be able to change it so there was a question that someone had here I'm just gonna answer this question because it goes really well with this and Lucy asked if you would have to say what up and down is so up and down is a movement workshop they coach each with my teaching partner and good friend Elia MARAC and we've been teaching this workshop for about five six years now we just did like seven workshops in 2019 we're about to open up registration for 2020 in that we are blending movement and my Feldenkrais background his tai chi chi-gong um games getting polyvagal into play social engagement it's so so much fun a lot of people will come out of that and their tension is all gone and they can't believe how much easier it is to walk into crouch and abandon to sit and to roll and then we get reports from them later you know that week or the next month saying because of the ways that we learned in the workshop we're really teaching people how to notice tension notice when they're holding their breath when their jaws clenched when they sit down on the toilet are they able to soften their eyes when they're looking or is there a strain in the forehead that's like giving them wrinkles right if we're doing a simple movement of the legs are the hands clenched so while we're teaching movement in this class Anna Lucy and cordula here where we're teaching the elemental principles of is your throat and breath easy is your mouth soft is your belly soft is their movement through the whole spine and pelvis are you just moving rigidly like this right so ways to integrate this into your life before you come to a workshop could be as simple as when you move do you hold your breath and 10 times out of 10 when we start the workshop on the first day and we get someone to we get everybody to do a movement that is everyday movement like sitting down or getting up and then I ask the question did you breathe I would say 80% of the people on that first day we're like nope I held my breath I'm like ok let's do it again and what has to happen so that you can breathe while you go down now just breathing doesn't mean that we take tension of the body so that has to be interlaced with are you breathing an are you soft not collapsed but in flow and so that is one piece of awareness to start asking yourselves when you do movements are you holding your breath are you clenching your gut are you straining and thinking really hard to do this really simple thing and so this ability to pause notice what you're doing and then change that is the power of the human brain from what we know no other animal can do it quite like that primates perhaps but us as humans we have got this ability to really self reflect and even remember what it felt like when we strange to do that movement and what would it be like to shift that so muscle tension is a huge thing I mean there are entire industries related to stretching and massage and chiropractic and all these things that we do to try to get rid of tension but from my experience and I've been in this industry since 1997 I started studying in a 1993 you can stretch that muscle till the cows come home but if there is underlying sympathetic and freeze activation in the system that stretch is just going to pop back and really muscles are not meant to be stretched like I said they're meant to contract and relax so we've got to find that sweet spot in the system so that the system can just let go naturally without us trying to force it to relax okey-dokey I'm going up to the questions here Margaret says I've been I feel as how I feel as if I've had a breakdown but I can't stop and that creates such conflict within and I just don't know what to do should I just go to sleep this comes back to really respecting what the body needs and wants and the conflict that's what causes tension right when we're having to who here has tried to make a decision and we're trying to decide for weeks on end months on end and we're going back and forth back and forth rather than just making a decision that back and forth that creates tension that creates wasted and or we're wasting energy right so one of the hallmarks and Margaret you said you haven't been diagnosed with fibromyalgia yet but my whole body aches and hurts and I have difficulty keeping my body upright let alone walk so a common hallmark of those that have autoimmune conditions such as fibromyalgia is a tendency to push and push an override then I talked about override in a second with my next question on window of Tolerance a classic thing you'll hear people say who have who are living with such chronic conditions is that I have to do it all myself I can't trust anyone the world is a dangerous place and we're all going to die so I have to stay alert and doing everything it's another form of OCD in some ways because if I don't I'm gonna die that is not evolutionarily smart because we will exhaust ourselves to the point where from a survival point of view if we had to run for our lives or fight for our lives we wouldn't be able to do it because we don't have the energy reserves and the suppleness in our body to actually fight or rot now I know most of us don't have to do that but that's what our system wants so when we've had that history of having to do it all can't trust anyone and this goes back to early adversity there's a massive massive strong I don't even like to say correlation anymore because it's so conclusive it's pretty much scientific fact that when we have had early adversity chronic stress growing up and it wasn't safe whether through our caregivers or we were subjected to lots of medical trauma and if we don't heal that early on which anyone here living and breathing as adults most likely that never occurred because we didn't know this even 10 years ago we will carry that chronic stress into childhood adolescence in adulthood so that drive of having to protect having to do it all ourselves it wears the system out this is what connects also to the question earlier about ulcerative colitis they're all the same right they just represent differently in the body so part of breaking the cycle of this chronic pain and tension is we have to get comfortable enough to let ourselves stop to let ourselves not be on alert to not be in that a DD sense to not be constantly fighting or fleeing or confused about which one we should do that creates tension that creates energy that is just zapped and then that's where pain comes in pain as Peter Levine founder of somatic experiences with somatic experiencing would say pain is trapped sensation right and so the other thing that occurs when we are going going going and pushing and all these crazy things is we aren't feeling what's there we're skipping over it we're overriding overriding overriding because we're having to survive but underneath that is all this trapped sensation that we are missing and chances are if we had that early adversity and that chronic stress growing up and things weren't safe it was not okay and good to feel what was there because we just didn't have the maturity as kiddos or babies to know what to do with it so as an adult we're trapped in that same immature nervous system and so we have to put our adult brain hat on and have a real honest conversation with ourselves and be like this isn't useful this is why talk to your system this tension isn't serving me it's zapping our energy we can't do anything life is going by what would it be like to just pause and take a nap and then in that moment there's going to be this outside force that's like you can't do that because that is not safe and then that's where you have to come back to the basics Here I am grounds under me I'm breathing I'm looking around there is nothing here that is going to come and attack me and while my physiology might not believe that something in you has to try to convince the system that it is maybe a little bit more okay than it was when you were four years old and you're having to hide in your bedroom because your parents were screaming right you've got to use that kind of higher brain to in some ways reason with yourself and realize that it's a little different and then with each little bit in each little blip you are adding to this pot drop by drop these experiences that let your system know and your physiology know huh I actually was okay if I laid down and took a nap and I didn't die and I didn't get harmed and nothing happened and maybe I can do that again and again and again if we have never done that before it's gonna feel like a lot of work and it's gonna seem like it's not doing anything but trust me when I say over time that strengthens the foundation and then that bleeds out into other things Oh what would it be like if I talked to that person the coffee shop everything in my psyche and body is saying don't talk to strangers because they might harm me but what if I just did this right now and the public looks like the person's okay we're gonna do that and feel it feel maybe the activation in your system or the desire to shut down and get sleepy and just feel it work with it and then assess afterwards that wasn't that bad where I was really scared but they were actually really kind and so we need to make these little agreements with ourselves in some ways to challenge ourselves and sometimes like I said challenge means taking a nap when everything in our body is saying no and sometimes that challenge is I'm going to be social even though being social means danger okay I'm gonna go back to a question here from my papers this was from Judith and jhooth asks I'm curious to hear about the faux window of Tolerance the faux window of Tolerance faux being spelled f you X and you heard about this in the interview I did with Kathy Cain or maybe it was another interview with Kathy so you want to know what this means so to understand so Kathy just to give her credit is one of my amazing teachers and mentors and she's a colleague and she teaches something called somatic practice and she also is a somatic experiencing practitioner she trained with Peter Levine and she started to experiment with a lot more touch work because her background is in Osteopathy and body work and she started to realize with her clients that those with a lot of early trauma history a lot of chronic illness we've been talking about that a lot today fibromyalgia autoimmune OCD a DD this really high level of sympathetic and parasympathetic shut down charges that working with such States requires touch but it also requires working with the stress organs and those are namely the kidney adrenals the gut the brain stem but also all of the body but the focus is primarily on these organs that let out stress chemicals when we're under attack when we're in adversity chronic stress etc so she really mapped out how to work with that from a nonverbal level because when we're working with early trauma we need to work a non-verbally this is where talk therapy fails it does not work at this deep level so full window of Tolerance to understand that Judith we need to understand what the window of tolerances so window of Tolerance it's something that Dan Siegel coined and it's this optimal window where we can experience stress and and activation but then we come back down naturally we come out of it so something triggers us we get activated maybe it's a car cutting us off in traffic and get really and then we don't like it pissed and angry and but then by the time we get home not a big deal it comes down naturally we don't have to do any breath exercises we don't have to say any mantras we don't have to tap anything it's just it comes down naturally the foe window of Tolerance is this false window that a person has to play out or do because they never got the early regulation on board that allow them to come down and deactivate naturally so what occurs is these people and these are the folks who are living with these chronic illnesses mental illnesses so this is a huge chunk of our population and many of you guys probably here watching this is we're living within this foe window where we're having to manage this dysregulation right we're having to find ways to cope with the fact that we can't come down to baseline and here's the interesting thing it's possible that we never actually understood or felt or had the map of actual baseline resting of the nervous system remember what I said about gosh half hour ago about the house and how we want to build a house is with good engineering and planning and architects and blueprints and builders and carpenters and electricians that are all solid building this house so that it's strong and it can withstand everything if we didn't get that chances are there actually isn't a real window of Tolerance there is only a false a faux window of Tolerance so that whenever there is a stress we have to do things to accommodate that stress by either being defensive so this is rage outbursts of anger hurting other people so deflecting or if there's a stress we shut down we walk away we say I'm fine even though we're not we're finding ways to man this dysregulation because we don't have an actual map we don't have an actual house that was built that allows us to have a healthy window of tolerance so this this faux window is something that if we didn't have right now in society I don't think humanity would still be around to be honest we would have all killed each other it just it would we wouldn't be here right so it's kind of weird because this faux window has allowed us as a species to to be okay to make good face and not punch that person out or you know do horrible things or shut down all the time however as we know there are many spots in our world where we are being not good and we are acting out and we are harming others or shutting down so there's these things that are just kind of implicit within our society that are there because we have had to create this false window of tolerance everything that we're doing here at least in my work and with my students and my programs we're trying to bring back a little bit of a window and a little bit of a window in a little bit of a window so that we're not having to be fake in our response so while I'm not telling my students to go around punching people and fleeing can you feel that desire to want to punch and get that movement out with your own body without harming yourself or someone else right when you feel that desire to clamp down and your jaws getting tight because you're not saying what you want to say and maybe you still can't say it can you say to your partner I'm feeling a lot of tension right now because I want to say this but I'm afraid if I say that you're gonna say this and this is again where we have to have safety in our relationships so there's these ways that we can start to inch inch are not even inch millimeter the window tolerance to actually become real but it comes down to are we overriding are we being are we defensively accommodating for things that we don't like do we have support in our environment to allow us to express what's happening this is where a lot of people ask me how do I heal my nervous system when I'm still in a toxic and abusive environment and here's the thing is we can get a lot of Foundation's on board we can start to build that house by learning the blueprints of the nervous system being with ourselves when there's an activation doing all the practices all of the reading the practices the practices are really the most important thing we need the education but then like 99% of the work is practice we need that 1% of Education we need a hundred percent of the 1% but then we also need a hundred percent of the 99 percent I hope that makes sense but we need education but we need the practice so we can do all this work really good work but then if we're still living in a toxic abusive environment where we're having to defend ourselves or shut down it's like building that house but then you're you're consciously pouring bleach around so there's like this toxicity in the system so you might have a solid house but there's something being admitted that isn't allowing you to fully settle right so this is where it can be really difficult when we have got spouses and partners and and people that we're looking after and they're not safe and this is where we have to make some difficult decisions to find ways to extricate ourselves from such situations or have these people leave and it all comes down to choice and and what is possible based on circumstance because sometimes we can't fully extricate or ask someone to leave and that's personal choice but also sometimes it's just reality so hopefully that answers the foe window of Tolerance and it's something that I think in theory we can learn a little bit about but in reality most of our systems are in this situation and if we're living with some form of chronic illness mental illness chances are there was never really a solid window of Tolerance that was built and the faux window is what we are living in so hopefully that answers that question just going through my comments here I'm gonna do a little bit more of some water Julia asks or says since a few days when I sent to orient and feel my body my right foot is shaking I leave it doing what it needs to do but I'm asking myself if I should do more so this is a common thing Julie and everybody hears when we start to get into this work we will feel things and have movements come out I just did a video hopefully you saw it it's my most recent video from last Sunday on the 29th of December crystal can pop that up or you can go back in to my youtube channel or my blog but when we start to go in and really feel our system and orient and really drop into the here and now from a very real and biological perspective we will feel anxieties we've never felt we might feel tensions that we have never felt we might sense a shaking or something that has never occurred and isn't it interesting that all it sometimes takes is that little bit of slightly looking at this differently and then the body if the body could talk my sense is it's like this it's like thank you thank you thank you you're finally listening to me so I can let this stuff out I can let this stuff out so the question of should I be doing more that is something that I can't answer that's something you have to feel into intuitively my sense based on my own experience and my clients there is always something more I am 44 years old I I had a solid regulated upbringing I really did I had that house that was engineered well and I also was subjected and exposed to a lot of things that I shouldn't have been when I was young too chemicals to shock traumas I was an athlete growing up I am still now even though I have solid regulation in my system experiencing old shock traumas intense shock traumas coming out of my body that do not feel nice I was up the other night with a huge sympathetic activation and big big pains that have been coming through my body clearly I'm functional I can think clearly I'm here my digestion is working my immune system is working but there's this other piece of memory that is very somatic due to all of my I had like probably hundreds of whiplashes growing up as a figure skater and a ski racer now that my system is really safe I love my work I've got solidity I've got a good partner there's all these things that are very positive now the body is like okay you are really solid therefore we're gonna give you the next layer right and when you're in it it's not fun and when you're in it and you know what's happening it gives you permission to let that movement through to let the activation be there to ask for the support that you might need does it throw your life off a little bit it does right but I'm kind of getting a little bit bigger on this topic Julie and everybody here because it's really hard to explain to everybody the trauma releasing is just one release and then you're done you have that one big cry and you're done you have that one big anger go and you're done it isn't like that and it's not like that because culturally societally from a human point of view we have not yet lived in an industrialized society allowing full expression containment boundaries discipline silliness emotion out of our systems when we were young we didn't know back in the day that in utero trauma was real so there are so many of us millions billions of us that haven't had what really the human system is designed to have and so the way that we've trapped and stored these past pains and hurts is so complex and this is why as much as I would love to say when you have this problem do this and this problem do this I can't because if I was to do that ethically knowing what I know it wouldn't work because it might be that one night you actually need to take a deep breath right to settle or maybe the next night the last thing that's so you want to do and you need to stomp your feet on the ground right but I can't say every time someone senses a shake or an anxiety that means you do this this is where to me learning this stuff is about like it's like learning a new language probably one of the best analogies I can give you all right now when you learn a new language you learn your ABCs you're one two three you probably don't remember learning the language that is your mother tongue right now it's implicit right we know how to use grammar and vocabulary and here and when we didn't get that foundation of nervous system wiring and regulation at the beginning we've got to learn a second language or this language for the first time as adults so if you think about learning a language as an adult it's not as easy as when you're a toddler right but I know lots of people who have learned second languages as an adult as adults and they're fluent in the way they become fluent they start with the basics sentences paragraphs reading vocalizing here but then to really make it a language that's fluent what do you have to do you have to go somewhere where they're speaking that language all the time you have to bring it into the world it can't just be studied on a book or on your phone with a language app trust me it doesn't work so I'm kind of going off a bit more on this question Julie because it's a really good one and that when we get into this work it isn't about just learning just the ABCs and the one two threes and the theory on paper and doing the exercises that is the important part we have to start with that and then for those of you here who want to really do this work or my students who have been doing this work for a while and you feel stuck you've got to bring it into the real world you have to leave their exercises behind and be like okay what am i listening what am I feeling what do I have to do right now to navigate this activation that I'm feeling right we have to keep doing that to the point where we do it so many times that we don't even have to have that conversation with our brain being regulated in the nervous system means not thinking what do I do now it means the system just does it without you asking that's why it's called autonomic nervous system automatic but when the automatic is set to survival and threat at the beginning we have to be conscious with it hope that makes sense that makes sense and then as we get this language onboard more and more and more we start to need to have that conversation less with our brains it's like the language we don't have to go what's the how do I conjugate that word what is the word for bread how do I ask for water that it just comes out right there's no thinking so the goal if you will when we're doing this work is to get to this point where we're not having to think about it it just happens which is how we would work if we go back to that idea of the solid house that just was built solidly from the beginning um Oh someone named Irene hey um do you have a global list of good practitioners who do this work on the nervous system I don't have a global list I do have a referral list I will admit the people on my referral list are pretty darn busy but crystal can give that to you in the in the link below here what I would have encouraged you to do and anyone wanting to find a practitioner is to watch a video that I made a little while ago called how to find a good somatic practitioner because this work is not governed by any governing sanctioning body the way say doctors are physicians lawyers right there we don't have that level of certification and school that teaches people how to do the work that I do the people that are really good I'll give a quick breakdown they are usually trained in multiple things like I have been they are regulated in their own bodies someone asked me the other day what do you do if you're a practitioner and you're being triggered by your clients trauma history I hate to say this but you shouldn't be working with people if you're being triggered by trauma histories as a practitioner in this work you have to be able to hear the most horrific things and go okay let's start working if you show any sign of fear or unsafety when someone divulges to you their biggest traumas and they sense that you can't stay solid and grounded and regulated with that you have lost their trust I know that might seem a bit harsh but it's true so Irene you want to make sure when you find someone that you interview them like you're interviewing anybody else that you would want to work with your body if you were hiring someone to build a house you would want to make sure their credentials and they're solid at their craft so watch that video and then Google ask around one of the things it's important to understand like I just mentioned there's not going to be people all around the world that have this skill set that is why I created my program specifically smart body smart mind we're gonna start that up on March 2nd enrollment opens February 17th we've had a thousand plus people go through this program it really does work granted you do the work and you are interested in learning the true language of the nervous system I've also found that and my colleagues have found that when someone works with them one on one and they have the underlying training and the knowledge that I teach in my programs when they have that on board the private one-on-one work works a lot seamlessly or better it goes faster it goes quicker because that practitioner isn't having to teach the person the basics and that's how these programs were developed as I was in private practice and I was over and over and over again having to reteach the same thing over and over again and teach the basics the 1 2 3 s and the ABCs and I was like what if we just taught this in a format where people could do this on their own at home with education the way somebody might learn a course or some form of other education and then they put the practice to the test in their own world and then if they want to work with someone one-on-one they're just that much more tuned to their bodies so that then they can do the heavy lifting and the big pieces of trauma that might need someone one-on-one to work with so hopefully that gives you an answer there Irene and anybody else who's interested in in working with someone ok just scrolling here everybody I'm gonna go back to my papers and get into one more question we're already sitting close to about 90 minutes so I want to be conscious of everyone's time so many great questions okay I'm gonna do two more not just one so next one is from Tasman and she writes after have more water how do you support children with emotional dysregulation issues so how to put in place quite a few of the suggested techniques to help with dysregulation there needs to be a certain amount of cognitive maturity so how do we approach nervous system regulation for children thank you so this is a simple question and a difficult question so I'll start from the beginning so how do you support children with emotional dysregulation so the first thing I'm going to slightly correct there is emotional it's it's a nervous system dysregulation the reason why i'm a real stickler with getting the right language is while our emotions might seem and be all over the map what's driving that is the underlying stress physiology that is going crazy when I talked about at the very beginning of this call so I hope that makes sense so there's this this fire this chaos and so then the emotions are running crazy or are completely shut down because of that underlying stress physiology so the the thing that we need to understand is did that kiddo have a solid upbringing and then they had a traumatic thing occur later so after age of three and so is it is it more Shock Trauma or was there not that solid foundational building and then that's why their system is not able to be in a good window of tolerance what I just talked about and they can't properly easily deactivate their system right so we think about quickly with kiddos when we're born we do not have the ability to fully self-regulate we learn how to self-regulate based on how we are shown with our primary caregiver usually it's our mother for some of us it might be a grandma or a nanny a father but that is the the first wiring is with that primary caregiver kids are interesting because they actually are better teachers to us then we can be to them and by that I mean they're showing us with their behavior what's going on inside and then we do this thing as adults is we try to fix it by giving them techniques by giving them now unfortunately medication to get them to calm down to make them be better of course there's being very general here so the first thing is if you're a parent or you work with kids is you got to understand what this means you got to understand the physiology and most importantly how to listen to your own physiology because if we have a kid that is having these problems problems I say that lightly this survival stress that's coming out and just expressing all over you as the caregiver or parent has has got to you must stay regulated in your own system because if you don't they will sense that and it'll just get worse they'll sense unsafety they'll sense that they can't be expressing this and of course as we know in our current history in our current world when a kid is misbehaving they're being bad right there they're not following rules they're causing trouble I can guarantee you kids at their core they do not want to cause they really don't they don't want to harm us they don't want to harm themselves they don't want to harm the people around them but they don't know what to do with that anger energy with that desire to kill energy with that desire to flee energy because they're immature so we have to be mature and take often a lot of what we're seeing of course we do we don't want them to harm us or harm themselves but then we have to be like how can I contain and how can I be with this little animal because that's what they are and allow that that expression to come out in a way that is useful and is directed outwards so it's not going in and it's not harming other people so it doesn't work when we have a kid or even a teenager and we're like I want you to sit in orient I want you to see what it's like to breathe deeply and I know we've gotten into teaching kids meditation and breath techniques I am NOT a big believer in that because what's occurring is we're not allowing that natural impulse and the survival stress that's there to come out and be properly deactivated so while we might be teaching kids how to be more calm with breath and meditation I have a sneaky feeling that we're gonna see something go on in the next twenty years where all these kiddos that never fully got to express this stuff are gonna be having problems that's just my prediction so we have to find ways to first of all you got to understand why this is happening you yourself have to be regulated and doing your own work so that you can attune to what's actually going on and then it depends on why it's there so this is why I can't actually say exactly what to do I can't give you a consult in this format because is it there because there was a neuter Oh stress is it there because there was birth trauma was their head yanked out of moms birth canal and they just need some really good osteopathic work to put things back in place was there a surgery early on I know I'm thinking of a client right now who had a brain surgery when they were an infant and they were deemed a DD all these problems acting out and what had to occur is she as a young girl had to complete all of the self protective responses that she couldn't do as an infant who was being strapped down and operated on so she had to actually be pretty vicious and violent in play so this is where play therapy and art therapy is really good for kiddos she had to take things and pretend she was killing things pretending and getting that that out right she would take matches and like skeleton on fire you know again not hurting anybody or herself but moving that energy out so that it wasn't trapped inside and the thing that's really tricky is more like oh we can't do that that's not nice you would never tell a mama bear who was trying to protect her cubs from a hyena oh don't do that that's not nice right that wouldn't work and so we think about these kids who were subjected to trauma weren't listened to maybe they had a medical trauma or birth trauma whatever it might be they are truly giving us the information and so we need to understand these underlying physiological needs that they have and from the little I've seen with working with kids it can travel and move really quickly when they get the right guidance right the right guidance so I wish I could say you got to do this this and this the suggestions I'm giving you are more broad stroke because it depends on the situation the age the types of trauma and of course the regulation that that kiddo is living in in their house if you were listening a few moments ago to the example of the house that's solid and strong but then you know a toxic person would be like throwing bleach all around it there needs to be consistency with kids the parent have to be on the same page if one person saying this and the other person saying that that causes massive confusion which causes anxiety in the kids system because they're like well who do I listen to and then there then they have a conflict then there's tension and what do kids do and they have tension they act out right they don't say oh my muscles are sore I need to stretch them right a three-year-old won't know that they just know something doesn't feel right and I am pissed and then that's where the hits start that's where the Tantrums start my one of my mentor Steve Carell did have we did an interview together it's on my youtube crystal can pop that up I think it's titled why keep kids behave badly and we say behave in air quotes because the behavior is just the underlying physiology pushing it and so if we can figure out what that is the underlying physiology a lot can change quite quickly usually from my experience it's adults that need more of the work because they have to trust and believe that that that's actually what's happening but we've been we've become so mesmerized by the medical community and this diagnosis of a disease or a problem but if we look at say the field of autoimmune chronic illness we even now know a lot of cancers heart disease it's all connected to this early trauma piece when it isn't resolved so this is no different we our genetics haven't changed that quickly as humans right so it's all stemming from this this sort of bottom-up place and it's really important that we see it that way and then do the work that we need to do to support everything healing um thanks crystal for popping that up it's how to help anxious kids who are behaving badly all right I'm just going to do a little scroll through someone asked about toxic anger so I'm gonna actually do another call next week on the topic of anger because I'm wanting to sort of set the record straight for what anger is anger as an emotion is totally neutral anger is just like happiness and sadness and disgust and surprise joy it is a basic human emotion it becomes toxic when it is expressed as a way that we would call rage or it harms or it hurts or it goes back to us and it self inflicts to our system this comes this this toxicity of emotion of what we would call I like to call rage more so than anger because healthy anger and aggression is important and I did a video on this I don't know your name I wish I could read that but I can't on we're healthy aggression stems from please watch that because it starts as infants and if we weren't allowed to be healthy and our aggression when we were babies when it starts to pop up it gets squashed so that's where it starts one place where it starts so it comes from that not being allowed to express it can come from our systems being hurt as infants there's some speculation and I feel quite my own system quite sure this when boys as babies are circumcised typically it's done without any freezing without any any anesthesia the mother is the one putting that kiddo that baby in that situation it is one of the it is the most sensitive organs on the male system and it is a violation and it's attached to the sexual reproductive side of things and so a lot we think of the toxic masculinity that has come out is a influence of these kiddos who were basically put under some form that was a mutilation when they were young of course does every man that has had circumcision come out and become toxic and abusive of course not right it all depends on how their lives worked and how they worked with their emotions and all of that but toxicity comes out in lots of ways anger is essential if we don't know how to express and move anger out in a safe and contained and healthy way it gets trapped in the system and that's where tension comes in that's where mental illness can come in that is where symptoms can come in so we want to make sure that we can understand what anger really is and work with it appropriately like I said I'm going to work with this a little more deeply in my next few q and A's it isn't something that I can say okay if you want to get angry and move anger you just need to scream or you just need to take a baseball bat hit something it doesn't work that way and the reason why it's like language I'm gonna go back to that language analogy if you listen to that a little while ago if we didn't learn the ABCs and one two threes we can't be thrown into a foreign country and just expect to speak the language it won't work unless some strange thing occurs and all of a sudden you know how to speak the language we have to start with the basics so to work well with moving anger and and regenerating it and having it feel safe to express anger we first have to be safe in feeling just our general physiology and that takes time when anger is really expressed we're not trying to look for it it just comes up we notice it we feel it and it comes out it just happens just like if we feel sad and we feel a tear we let ourselves cry same with happiness so anger is just a basic human primal emotion it should be neutral like all of the others I'll talk about that a bit more but I think one of the best analogies I can give you is it's like learning a new language so I'm going to edit it there I know there were many other questions but as you can see these q and A's are not quick I can't do these quick rounds right just answer because the answers have to be overlaid with the theory and the basics and if you've been following me for a little bit you're going to start to see a pattern here and the pattern is we need to understand how the physiology works why it's expressing the behavior and the symptom ologies that it is and then understand how to come back to the system so that we can learn those those ABCs is 1 2 3 is the basic sentence structure of the nervous system so that we can start to prime it and learn and practice so that it becomes like a fluent first language because we wanted to have that early on that fluent first language of nervous system regulation if we didn't get it as adults hopefully that's why you're here we want to relearn it so that we can have that map and we're not having to think about it all the time so if you have not checked out any of my other work any of my other stuff head over to my website it's just my name irene line comm we're gonna go into some really busy times in the next few months the next two months if you have not checked out my healing trauma video training we're gonna be giving you more of attention on that over the next few weeks there's on my site a crystal can pop it up for us here there's three videos there it's very important essential first step information from that if you want to work with me and my team we will be opening up some our body smart mind which is my 12 week nervous system rewire program on February 17th for enrollment registration closes on the 1st of March we only run this program once a year that is it when you get into this program I'm gonna say just a tiny bit about it you get into this program it is like learning the ABCs in 1 2 3 s the program the curriculum the material is yours for life you get to keep it because we have to keep practicing and working with this past that 12-week period this is gonna be the ninth time we've run this program so many people have gone through this hundreds of people all around the world and the one thing I know from working with my folks my students is that when you stick with it when you treat this like a lifestyle you can create that foundation that maybe never got built in the first place so that's what that course is all about I say it's trying to become teaching you how to become your own medicine and to really regulate the nervous system so check all that stuff out know that your system can heal you need to believe that you deserve that it can heal I know your system can heal I believe that your system deserves it you're the one that has to make that decision in that leak if I didn't get to your question apologies I hope that's something that has been communicated and taught today has helped answer the question and we'll do another one of these next Thursday at 12 p.m. and we'll try to get to as many questions answers within our Facebook groups all right everyone thank you so much for being here and I'm gonna sign off until the following week bye for now", "AeSa0Ght0ZE": "hi everybody welcome I hope we're having a pain-free day Lisa here and I wanted to talk to you today about topical treatments for migraines I'm so excited to talk to you today because I was recently turned on to a great topical treatment that has really helped me a lot and I am NOT a doctor I am NOT an expert but I have been dealing with these for my entire life and I have been trying anything and everything that says headache migraine you name it I've tried it so I wanted to first show you the idea that I was recently turned on to and I thought like everything else this was just gonna go in the trash or into my pile of things that I've tried but many of you may have seen Kelsey from BuzzFeed's fantastic video about her chronic pain condition and I want to thank her so much first of all for putting herself out there like she did about her condition I will link her video below if you want to see it she doesn't mention migraines in her video although that is not her main condition but she discussed this product CBD living freeze roll-on and just like every other product like I said I thought this was not gonna do anything just read the label it says CBD living freeze cold therapy pain relief frother itis back pain sore muscles and joints now in her video she went to a cannabis shop in California where she lives where it's legal I live at north rhenium where it's not legal so cannabis is not legal rather but this product is legal in all 50 states if you're watching this from outside the United States I have no idea what the laws are there but this is 100% legal on all 50 states according to their website this is what's sold in the store where Kelsey was so she bought it there and in the video tried it on her jaw which is where her condition was she instantly got relief so I thought you know what the heck so I went to the CBD living freeze website and I bought it there I she bought two because the shipping was a little high so I thought what the heck I'll try it this product is amazing it has kind of like an icy hot kind of feel to it you unroll it it's got three fluid ounces put it here you just roll it my pain is behind my brow bones mainly so I just roll it roll it mainly there but then I rolled over my whole head and then a back of my neck when I'm feeling a pain literally every time I feel any pain coming on I just roll this product on I keep one next on my nightstand I keep one in my handbag I cannot recommend this product highly enough these are $30 if this was $100 I would buy it if this was $200 I would buy it this is how much I recommend this product I get nothing from this company this company has no idea who I am I am nobody but this product is fantastic so if you are suffering from migraines and you think this might help I can't recommend it highly enough it reminded me a lot of the old head-on products you guys may remember I used to love this product they no longer sell it anymore so that's unfortunate but that thing is much better so say goodbye to the head arm but a couple other products I've tried over the years and crude my Gras stick you guys may have heard of that before this is sold at health food stores it's sold at Whole Foods and just to give you a little idea it's point one fluid ounces it's lavender and peppermint and again it's a roll-on you roll it on it smells fantastic and if you're like me where a lot of smells bother you example when I get on the metro here in DC area the smell of the themes from that I guess it's a gas they they gave me an upset stomach and a headache sometimes right away so if you just put it under your nose that helps a lot I haven't flown for a while but I I'm gonna bring this with me next time I fly to see if that also helps the only problem with that this that I have found is it's very liquidy I'm if you could hear it let me shake it so if you roll it on sometimes it drips down into your eyes and you do not want to get this in your eyes this burns but other than that I recommend it you don't get that much but I do recommend it to other products said I've tried this was called clear my headache it's a roll-on inhalants it says Rowland inhalation I'm sorry and I got this at a Medi spa it's also considered a therapy and it has essential oils of peppermint and lavender although it's not nearly as strong as the micro stick and this didn't get a thing for me but if you want to see what it looks like that's what it's called and there's website on the back clear my head comm and one other one by the brand badger these are all certified organic by the way this one is headache soother cooler and relax my mind this is okay I used this before I found the living freeze but now this one's also gone in the trash because this living freeze thing is fantastic again this this has CBD I don't know if I mentioned that before you saw it anyway which means there's no effects I can may get you hi it's totally legal and seriously if you suffer like I do please get this product I shouldn't recommend it this highly cuz they're gonna run out I better stock up real quick before you guys I'll run them by them but get it what do you have to lose seriously if you can afford it try it ok so take care have a good rest of the day and I'll see you in the next video bye", "I5DBr9jeZbo": "the physician activates the flow of cryogen by depressing a foot pedal attached to the true freeze console extremely cold liquid nitrogen exits the catheter at negative 196 degrees centigrade in a low pressure spray trapping and flash freezing water within the cells causing intracellular ice formation and cell death non-cellular elements that comprise the extracellular matrix such as collagen and fibrin are more resistant to cryotherapy due to their low water content thus the flash freeze selectively kills cellular material and leaves the supporting collagen structure intact the combination of a fast freeze and subsequent thaw destroys cellular components while preserving the extracellular matrix this results in what has been referred to as a rejuvenative healing response due to low scarring compared to the fibrotic reparative

little bit I'm feeling on my legs yes hey hey that's it Claire you're shorting my time okay no you're not okay that was no there's no way Wow okay so I should warm up all right it felt like an adrenaline rush it felt like how you feel when you get off of a roller coaster you know you're just excited and your senses are heightened that's absolutely what it felt like I really don't believe that I was in there for three minutes I think that I don't know I just if that's true if I really was in there for three minutes then that is the craziest part about this entire thing so was I in there for three minutes for real I was okay so that is insane so ten minutes later I'm still feeling that that sort of adrenaline rush oh I could have stuck it out another maybe another minute yeah sure let's go back in and do it again", "bgf_xhQV_ok": "get smoking marijuana or eating pot edibles you probably won't even notice the newest way people are getting high 7 News reporter Jacqueline Alan found more and more are turning to a pot patch even though the patch on his wrist may look like something familiar I think it maybe it's a nicotine patch or something Alain Tonkin isn't trying to quit smoking in fact instead of nicotine this 2x2 square is delivering THC I've been using medical marijuana for about the past 11 years ever since a skydiving accident broke his back Allen's pain reliever of choice is weed but smoking breaks at work well I really don't like smelling like marijuana around my customers and so this allows me a way to do be more discreet about being able to take my medicines this is basically where all the magic happens the magic is happening here at Mary's medicinals in Denver CEO Nicole Smith gives us a tour saying unlike smoking pot which wears off fast or edibles that can take time to kick in it's effective in about 10 to 15 minutes and it can last up to 12 hours they start with cannabis extract the oil isolate certain cannabinoids like CBD or THC spread that on sheets and you have the newest way to get high about 80% of Mary's products don't have psychoactive effects they're being used to treat everything from epilepsy to chronic pain to insomnia you know what it's something that we are continuing to strive towards the patches are not FDA approved and while mary's is funding its own clinical trials pot science is still young for people like Allen though it's been I mean it's just been a lifesaver he's been night and day the proof is in being pain-free with a simple patch the biggest side-effect he says has been sometimes having the munchies Jacqueline Allen Seven News the CEO says her company's not regulated by the FDA because they fall under the same category as companies that make vitamins or supplements and if people feel any negative effect from the patch she suggests just taking it off and claims you'll feel better in just about 15 minutes", "LnkLZqOaGQ4": "Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist Together we are the most famous physical therapists on the Internet In our opinion of course Bob. It's always in our opinion Brad, and our opinion is always right, yeah there you go Just ask us, All right today Brad we're going to talk about can pain relief creams and ointments help your pain> You know your neck, back, shoulder, hip, knee pain, does it help, and we're trying to answer that question today Hopefully and we've done this video in partnership today with iherb.com Again, we had the discussion last time is it iherb or iherb? Yeah, because we always have stupid discussions like this Is it gonna be on the, yeah we'll have a link down below, and there's a reason we like iherb.com, they they fit with our perception and our Approach to handling pain don't they Brad? Right try to do it conservatively in a manner that Doesn't require opioids, right doesn't really require any medications. This is all over-the-counter stuff There's no downside to trying this stuff. I mean, it's not gonna have any side effects It's not addictive, it either is gonna help you or not I guess with the exception unless for some reason you might have a skin reaction, that would be the only Downside and iherb is the largest online store for natural products they have 1,200 brands and They have over 35,000 products and Brad and I are gonna go on there and count them tonight to make sure they have 35,000 That's our old joke The second thing we like is because we're all very conscientious of price Their price is usually 30 to 40% less than if you went to a pharmacy or a health food store So we're all trying to save a buck, and if you use the links below to buy any of these products You'll get another five percent off. You know we make sure Let's give everybody a bargain and the last thing I really like about them Brad is they kind of built this business with the idea they're gonna have these perishable products, they built a warehouse that's Climate-controlled, very clean, they have a rapid turnover products You don't have to worry that these things have expired at all and they go so the shelf-life You don't have to worry about it being on the shelf for four years. They grabbed it off the floor Or that it's sitting next to a can of motor oil They got it all figured out Alright, so Brad and I did a video previously on pain patches, and we might allude to them again today But these are some of the products that they have for pain patches, why don't we just kind of put those off to the side But we also have the ointments and the creams, and I had to look up What's the difference between an ointment and a cream and apparently ointments have a little more oil in them, And it makes them a little more greasy Greasy? That's how they describe it, very good, we have three types here Well Bob before we go any further. I did notice there's a few people If you are new to our Channel, please take a second to subscribe to us We provide videos on how to stay healthy, fit, pain-free And we upload every day and also go over to Facebook and like us because Brad and I like to be liked there you go Alright, so we got three products. Yep, and you've tried all three, Brad? Yep, all three of them, alright and I tried two of them because you had the Tiger Balm So I couldn't try that, but my wife tried that too though She did okay, so let's kind of give our opinion on these two so this is the T Relief and Topricin pain relief cream they have really no smell to them, right yeah that that's what I liked about it Yeah, so there wasn't any of that and sometimes people want the smell, right they want the fragrance But in this case especially like if I'm at work or something like that and working with patients closely So I put them on my knees just to see. I worked out with them and that was fine, too It didn't really leave a stain on my clothing or anything so Where did you try these? On my low back, and I like this one right here, The T Relief I had good success with it and I keep it in my bedroom so that If I got some I back pain I use it and it's nice because before work I can go to work with it, and I don't have to work with patients. There's no I wouldn't say it's an odor but some of these you got that menthol smell. Yeah, again I like that but again I don't want to work with somebody that might be a little bit sensitive to it Here in the medical field you don't want to put cologne on because some people are allergic to it Or they don't respond well, so you want to be very neutral. Yep, so that's that's why these work great This by the way just to give you some price comparisons This is like $12.71 from what I saw on their site This was $9.99 this bigger one here and the tiger balm was $6.80 I think that was this one six dollars little bit more concentrated. Yeah, so all of them they're fairly inexpensive and Now your wife tried this one? Right. Yep. I used the one on my back I had better luck with that, but this actually you get that menthol cooling feeling which helped But again for the reasons. I just started discussed this has that menthol fragrance, my wife used it She had a bad cold so she put it on her throat She had a sore throat and whatnot and you know slept with it overnight and whatnot and that always feels really good Yeah, it gives you that, so I think it's just like with the pain patches Brad It's a really personal thing you're gonna find one that works for you now I looked at the reviews on these and they all had pretty good reviews There's a lot of people that do like them, and we look at these as tools They are not gonna take away your pain Cure it is what I'm trying to say, but we we kind of a formula here You know what we say is you have temporary relief Plus movement so if you can figure out some movements to do because usually a lot of times movements will sometimes heal your pain, right Temporary relief plus movement can equal permanent relief So let's say take the neck let's say you're gonna take some of this cream you're gonna rub it all over your neck and now the pain is diminished enough that you can try some movement within there, some neck rotations Generally with necks we often start off with you're gonna do chin tucks Put the cream on And then you're gonna do some chin tucks like this, and then eventually we want you to work on doing some extension like this This is very actually relevant to me today Brad because I was getting sore right in here, and I was doing these this morning Okay, I should have put some cream on, and it's actually just has loosened up now, Because I was doing a lot of these. Yep. So it worked out really good, for some people That motion doesn't work very good, so for some people you do the chin tuck and side-bend to the the side of the pain So the pain's over here? Chin tuck. Bend to the side. This is the direction I tend to go because I get pain on this side, because I tend to lean like this all day So you want to balance it out For some people it's rotations Brad, and even if it hurts one direction just go in the other direction right now And you can even give yourself a little stretch back in the head and always in really good posture, gentle stretch A little stretch is good might as well crank a little harder. That's not the idea Do your fingertips only and stretch you should just feel stretch pain any sharp pain with any of these You don't want to do that, so again hopefully this is gonna allow you to do this comfortably again It's one of the tools you're gonna have to cope with the pain Again if you can get away from using medications And you can just use these this is a big in the plus column, right exactly Another one Brad would be the shoulder, a lot of people have shoulder problems, you could rub the creams on there and then We're gonna want you to try some Movements with the shoulder, one of the ones that we often start off with is Extension, so you actually It really helps to take like a broomstick or this is a PVC pipe or a cane and My thumb is down here, and I'm gonna start working back like this and again, you know the cream or the Ointment hopefully takes away some of the pain And this should be a painless thing too, you can go up to the pain, but no further, you know a little Stretch kind of a pain is fine But if it gets that sharp pain, then you're going too far and you need to back off a little bit You know and it might be a forward flexion thing You can work on forward flexion too so let me go this way, so I'm gonna go ahead I'm grabbing below here, and I'm gonna start working on flexion here. Yep working into that direction Let's say this is my arm that had arthritis perhaps You can just grab your hands together and let the strong arm or the good hand help the weak one And we just go up like that until you can go, and you can do 10 to 15 repetitions And then leave it rest and come back an hour or two later and work it again And then one eventually you'd like to work on and is you can take a strap or a belt works out good too You can hook your hand in here and take it around like this, and I'm gonna go ahead I'm gonna work on pulling it up like this and this seems like a strange one to be doing But it really actually is one of the ones that you want to use towards the end where the shoulder's getting better To really complete things, you can see if you're having problems reaching back You can compare like if this one's way up here, and this one's right here You know you got to get that one up there too eventually Again just Consider it. These are tools They're inexpensive, and they help you get through the day, and that's all really sometimes We need to do is manage the pain enough to get through so and then eventually improve And you know the body wants to heal itself We just need to give it time and work with these to get through, a little assistance.

Welcome back to my virtual clinic. Today I'm going to talk\nto you about when you need to get your knee pain checked out immediately, but\nfirst I'd like to say thank you so much to all of you who have sent me lovely\nmessages of support, I'm really glad that you found this series on keeping you and\nyour family healthy at home so useful. Last week as you know we did back pain, the week before breathing and immunity and then this week we're doing\nknee pain, please don't forget to press the big red subscribe button to make\nsure you can watch these videos going forwards. So when is it that you need to\nget your knee pain checked out immediately? The first and probably most\nobvious one is if you fall directly onto the knee or if you fall and you twist\nthe knee or do something to the knee where you suddenly get a really severe onset\nof pain, that's because that would indicate that you might have some kind\nof bony damage to the knee and particularly if you can't weight bare\nthrough the leg, so if you're finding it difficult to put your body weight\nthrough your leg then you absolutely must go and see someone to check that\nyou don't have any fractures or breaks in the bone, that's because they can\ncreate long-term issues if they're either not immobilised or in some cases\nyou might need surgery, so that's the first one. The second one\nis if you have a sudden swelling, so if you suddenly get swelling in the knee\nand it's red and throbbing then in that situation you really should go and get\nyour knee checked out because it might be that you have an infection or\nsomething going on in the knee that does need immediate attention and\nparticularly but not only if you're feeling a bit unwell as well, so if you\nhave soreness in the knee, inflammation in the knee and you're generally feeling\nunwell then you do need to go and get it checked out, and last but not least if\nyou can't fully straighten your knee, if your knee is locked and not just because\nit's painful and you're finding it difficult to fully move the knee but if\nyour knee locks into one position then that might be an indication that you\nmight need surgery to make sure that you can get the movement back in your knee,\nso in all of those cases do make sure that you do go and see your doctor. Next\ntime what I'm going to do is talk to you about if you do have knee pain\nwhat you can do about it to treat it yourself at home,\nso please do press that subscribe button and I look forward to seeing you\nnext time, bye!", "UYcAhEhA9EU": "you may have heard of whole body cryotherapy of those big cryo tanks but there's another effective method you could use and that's local cryotherapy I'm dr. David orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine specialist and I want you to feel and perform your best regardless of age and injuries okay you probably saw my video just recently about the me getting in the cryotherapy chamber the big tank that gets down to you know 180 something degrees Celsius below zero and you stand in there for three to four minutes and we talked about how it can help decrease pain and inflammation and edema at least according to the proponents of this study and we talked a little bit about how the scientific studies are hard some show benefits some maybe not so much they do tend to help with what we call perceived benefits you feel like your muscles are less sore the next day you feel like you're able to work out a little bit more and that's not always a bad thing now people dealing with injuries sprained ankles you know knee injury of some sort osteoarthritis of the knee or hamstring injury of the back of your thigh or quads or maybe it's your upper body maybe you could try the whole body cryotherapy and that can be effective but there's another version of that a local version of that that can be really helpful this really started with treatments for things like rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis some of these medical causes of joint inflammation and joint pain but now it's really getting into the elite athletes and the active adults that are just trying to feel better and they've got all these aches and pains and so one of the things you can do is basically the same really cold air but focusing on a specific area so in the case of say you've got a sore knee this these machines basically spray the cold air and it depends on where you are how cold it is and for how long but you get it directly into that area and that can be really effective now if you read some of the websites of places that have these local cryotherapy machines they talked about how it brings an increased circulation and you get more oxygenated blood to that area it helps the muscles relax and it provide this natural animal analgesic effect may be basically pain relieving effect I don't know really how much of that there is but again in some of the studies of some of these arthritis conditions it does seem that it helped to decrease pain but it can be very effective at least cold can at decreasing swelling so I think it can be really helpful after injuries now if you don't have access to say one of these local cryotherapy machines something else you can do is just local cryotherapy where basically you could do it where you freeze some water and a Styrofoam cup and you peel the rim around away and you basically do like a local ice massage amazon has these ice cups that you basically can do that where you freeze water in it you peel part of it off and then basically you've got something plastic to hold on to in this basically this ice brick can basically move around and really help cool that area just where you want it to go so if you're not really looking for the whole body cryotherapy chamber you know the three minutes that you and really really intense cold this may be a good option especially if you're battling an injury

subscribe to our channel and hit the bell on the corner so you can be notified when we post a new video we publish every Wednesday a recent poll completed by Yahoo Canada found that out of 1,500 Canadians 41% of those people identified themselves as someone who struggles with anxiety that's a lot of people and that's why it's really important to keep these conversations about anxiety going Nevada can be broken down into four main responses physical responses emotional responses cognitive responses which include your thoughts and behavioral responses if you want to know more about anxiety check out the video we posted last week where a couple of the 11 most common symptoms of anxiety and I'll place that in a car to step up here you know when people talk about anxiety they often mention the fight flight freeze response and really what this is is our internal very natural evolutionarily based system within ourselves to detect danger and to keep us safe so this thing is a situation where you're out in the wilderness and you come across there no bear is really big right so that's gonna set off my alarm and I'm gonna think wow this is a dangerous situation what am I going to do so my fights like freeze response is going to kick in and I'm either going to want to fight it and get ready for that or I'm going to want to flee and run away flight or are in some situations I'm just gonna want to be as small as possible so that hopefully this bird doesn't see me and I'm totally gonna freeze and think let's just let this thing pass me by now a whole array of things happened within our body but not happens and I'm gonna use Dan Siegel's flip your lid demonstration for this because I think it's really helpful and also an include a link to his website down below if you're interested in this but let's imagine that this is our brain this is our brain stem and we have to remember too that we are evolved creatures and we've got different parts of our brains so we have this over more archaic part of our brain that includes our amygdala which helps us feel different things and this is the part of our brain that also helps us feel fear so if a situation happens while we're out in the wilderness and I come across a bear I want to be able to respond really quickly and the amazing thing about this furthermore archaic part of our brain is it responds incredibly quickly then there's this larger part of our brain the more developed more involved part of our brain that we call the neocortex and that's the part of our brain that you it sinks a little bit slower but it helps us you know reason and make sense of things and come up with strategy isn't that type of thing so we've got these two parts of our brain that are working with so we're out in the wilderness we come across a bear and the very first thing that happens rather than this part of our brain taking some time and saying okay that's an interesting bear is he a black bear or a duck or a bear we don't have time for that instead the kind of stimulus comes into our brain right here right - this amygdala and they make the web besides nope not so this is not a good idea we want to be here we don't want to be in danger and it immediately starts sending out adrenaline and cortisol throughout our entire bodies to be able to help us respond to that danger as quickly as possible so when people say you know suddenly something happened I don't even know what the trigger was it happened before I can even have a chance to think about it that's what's happening so when we talk about flipping our lid essentially what's happening is the you know stimulus is coming in here it's letting our while order okay brain no this is not a safe situation it quickly reacts sends the cortisol and adrenaline throughout our bodies so what that looks like then is that the adrenaline and the cortisol go all throughout our bodies and helps to pump our heart faster it causes our breathing to become more shallow but what ends up happening with that is that we're able to be more aerobic and move faster sometimes we'll end up feeling you know that same energy feeling going throughout our whole limbs and really what's happening is all of our blood is coming from our extremities and going into our core so if in the horrible scenario that we end up getting a limb chopped off that we don't end up bleeding to death it also makes us think a lot faster and we also get kind of like at the peripheral vision of a view shrinks so that we're focusing dead center so when we think about this reaction that we're having within our body it actually is really good and really smart of our bodies this is just built in it as all of these things would either allow us to you know really quickly fight and jump into fight mode or to get the heck out of there and won which is all well and good if you're facing a dangerous bear it was challenging about this and this is really for the general population even including those that experience anxiety is that we're not often facing bears and our daily environments instead we're doing things like sitting in our desks at work and we're getting a pile of work put on us we're having really challenging conversations with our co-workers friends family members we're maybe sitting in a desk at school we're expected to be writing a test and we're feeling overwhelmed by it there's a lot of things that are happening which are you know in our modern lives considered dangerous or threatening but were not capable of running and moving we're not capable of fleeing the situation or exerting energy in a way that you know would allow us to burn off a lot of that adrenaline and cortisol so what ends up happening is that it stays within our bodies and we experience it as anxiety because we're still having all of the same physical sensations without the ability to really act on it so going back to Dan Siegel slip your lib brain what ends up happening is you you know the task gets put down on your desk you feel the anxiety about it oh wow I don't want to do poorly on this test I really want to do well what if I do badly although you know the anxious thoughts start pouring in and they go directly to your medulla the same way they what if you saw a bear and similar to what would happen with the bear is this cognitive you know thought processing ability of others goes offline and we're just functioning with this part of our brain here so where is it would be really nice to be able to say it's just a test I can do this I've done this before I know I've studied well I can get through this and use this parts of this part of our brain that would be able to do that rational thinking and to help us problem-solve when we flip our lid and all of the cortisol and adrenaline of our you started pumping through our bodies we're kind of about the mercy of this part of our brain and so today I'm going to be talking about some strategies that you can use to turn off the eight flight freeze response because it's normal it's going to happen it's part of anxiety is part of kind of both the daily stress that we experience as human beings in this modern world so it's natural that this is going to happen but what we want to do is we want to be able to give you the strategies that you can use to be able to bring this part of your brain back online and use it for all its its wonder and what it can do now beyond what the typical person experiences with you know the daily stresses and they challenges of living in this modern society where we're not as mobile as we used to be and we're not able to you know fight our boss when they do something that makes us really feel stressed out or to you know get up and punch the teacher because you didn't want to write the test I'm trying to compare this to if you're you know fighting up there is that people with anxiety you know we talked about this alarm system the experience of someone with anxiety is almost like an oversensitive alarm system so let's imagine a smoke detector and you want that smoke detector to be able to tell you when there's a fire when there's danger when it's you know necessary to flee the situation and get out of there and now with some of the things I need their alarm system or their smoke detectors even more sensitive so maybe that alarm system goes off when you're making popcorn or you've just made some toast and you don't want it to be going off that often it's not a real indicator of what's dangerous but instead is telling us you're in danger we just need popcorn and that's not what's really happening first strategy you can use is deep belly breaths now we've talked about some of the ways that your body responds when it feels anxiety right you've got that waist and heart rate the racing thoughts the tingly feelings throughout your extremities having this on your chest and you might also feel like the shortness of your breath right and out of all of those symptoms there's really not much we can do about them it you know the adrenaline the cortisol are going through our bodies because the amygdala has sent that message out however the one thing that we do have control over is our ability to manage our breath what we can do is we can take deeper slower and more full breaths and what that does is it starts switching off that whole process of keeping the sympathetic nervous system going and switches us in to the opposite which we call the parasympathetic and so you might have heard of something called and digest so as opposed to fleeing and fighting we want to rest and digest so what we're going to do is we're going to do a quick breathing exercise right here and you can do this right away as well I even like to do it different times throughout the day especially if I'm not noticing that I'm experiencing some stress really good to just take a couple of moments to take some deep breaths and it really helps to recenter your body or a really common and popular helpful one is box breathing and what that includes is just think about it like four four four all around a box okay so what we do and I'm not going to do it with you only because I just tried doing that and it's really hard to explain and breathe at the same time but we're going to breathe in four four one two three four hold for four two three four breathe out four four two three four and hold for four two three four and you keep doing that over and over again breathing for four sometimes what I like to do is to take a piece of paper and draw a square on the paper and as I'm breathing in I will breathe in four four one two three four all the way along that edge of the paper hold for four along the bottom breathe out four four two three four and then hold for four as I draw across the top and what I find is that by drawing this out for myself not only am i helping to regulate my breath as I'm doing it but it also provides that extra visual that's a bit of a mindfulness exercise as I'm doing it as well another strategy you can use is working to D tense your tense muscles so if you remember from the video I did last week I talked about how common it is to kind of carry the weight of your anxiety on your back or in your shoulders and that we tend to tense up our muscles we can even you know tense up our buttocks muscles or a pelvic floor muscles and it's just it's a really common symptom of anxiety so what we want to do and again this is kind of on that biofeedback side of things again is to work on progressively relaxing those muscles and so progressive relaxation is actually a really good strategy for this you know what progressive muscle relaxation looks like is you know starting in one spot sometimes from your feet up to the top and progressively clenching and holding that area of your body really tight so maybe it's squeezing your toes together really really tightly and into a ball and then letting them go and feeling the the relaxation and feeling the kind of like that feeling of letting go as you do it going through each different part of your body as you do this and now if you'd really like to have a script to go along with it check in the link below and I have linked Ashley green Smith's one of our therapists linked below and she has a really good blog article on this that could be helpful for you you know as you start to you know bring the cognitive part of your brain back into play a strategy that can be really helpful with this is just knowing that you are safe knowing and having a good awareness and kind of relationship with your anxiety just anxiety to say I know what you are this is what my anxiety feels like this is what it feels like in my body and I know I am okay I know that this racing heart rate right now is not a heart attack I know that it mean does not mean that I'm unhealthy this is my racing heart rate from my anxiety and I can deal with that I'm kind of going through each of those symptoms that you're experiencing your body and reminding yourself that they are anxiety symptoms it's not at all to downplay what it is that you're experiencing or to invalidate what you're experiencing but if anything is just kind of creating a better relationship with your anxiety so that it doesn't control you and instead you're able to recognize you know this is exactly what my body is meant to do when I'm in flight or fight flight freeze response it's supposed to react like this it's reacting the way it's supposed to which means that I'm I'm okay it means that I am ready to take on anything stressful and then once you kind of have that out of the way it allows you to start thinking about what the trigger might be and then you know working on a solution for managing that because you're not so worried about all those anxious feelings that you're having mindfulness is another you can use to manage your anxiety and I know mindfulness is a bit of a buzzword now and everybody's kind of talking about it and I just want to clear it up that it's not as simple as just clearing your mind and trying to put all thoughts out of your mind if anything it's a practice of noticing observing and really being attuned to what it is that's happening within your body and within your thoughts so a lot of people who do practice mindfulness they do it on a consistent basis and they either do something like body scan exercises or you know watching their thought exercises are different things like that mindfulness has actually been shown to actually rewire the neural pathways within your brain so that rather than going down that very familiar route where anxiety likes to go into this is danger zone this is not okay I'm gonna start panicking about everything by using mindfulness you're actually able to reroute those paths into a different area which I find incredibly fascinating and why I really encourage people to practice mindfulness even if it's something that initially they're like I don't know if this is the thing for me I say try different types of mindfulness and I'd really like to do a video in the future on how to do mindfulness because it's something that's really difficult to read about and know what to do and I think because it is such like a buzzword in our society these days it's helpful to have some more information so if you're interested in learning more about mindfulness comment in the comment section down below let me know what you already know about it if you have any questions about it and I'd love to do a video just explaining mindfulness and maybe giving some walkthroughs on different mindfulness strategies and scripts I also want to add just on the end of that too is that some people will say when I try to do mindfulness or I try to focus on my physical sensations within my body I get more anxious I don't like that feeling so for anyone who does say that they may experience an increase in anxious feelings when they do that inward focusing or trying to do mindfulness on their body I definitely recommend you to do some more outward or external mindfulness activities and the next strategy we're going to talk about is exercise now the fight flight freeze response is intended to be followed by a burst of energy that's why everything is you know that's though the purpose of this whole function of the flight freeze response so by giving it what it wants it actually goes a long way so whether that looks like going for a walk you know getting out of the situation and letting yourself kind of burn off some of that anxious energy can really be helpful this can also be a really good preventative strategy for if you're experiencing anxiety throughout your day maybe you're really accumulating the stresses as the day goes on you're able to set aside some time in your day to exercise it really goes a long way in helping your body to metabolize and break down some of those stress hormones and the other great thing about eggs exercise is that it releases endorphins so endorphins you know counteract that stressful feeling as well and can make you feel a lot better and just calmer and you know turn off that anxiety response that you're feeling this one is more dependent on the person and if you think this would be helpful for you definitely give it a try but a lot of people will say that spending time with loved ones is a really helpful way to help them manage their anxiety when we're alone when we're not distracted and we're able to you know thoroughly immerse ourselves and our anxious thoughts anxiety can overcome us and so when we're with other people that love us and care about us and see you know the good things in us it can really be helpful in you know taming some of that anxiety as well as putting our focus on others rather than being so consumed by the thoughts that we're having research has actually found that when we spend time with people that we love and care about that our bodies actually release endorphins and our brains release dopamine which is one of those feel-good hormones so having close connection and time as people we care about does a lot to help manage anxiety and if you're with people that support you and love you and care about you that might also be a really excellent place to share some of the anxieties that you're experiencing to have people to you know lend an ear to listen to bright provide some helpful feedback and validation for you and so it's much better to share what you're experiencing in some cases then keep it all in the next one is scheduling time for your worry I know this might sound counterintuitive because you're like what you want me to worry want me to set aside some time in my day that I'm gonna worry about things and the answer is yes yes I do because you know if you're experiencing generalized anxiety disorder or anything that you notice that you're worrying about things consistently throughout your day that's incredibly time consuming and it has a real impact on your body and the way you're functioning every day so if you can try to carve out some time you know you might even say this is after dinner and spend 30 minutes I'm going to worry about all the things I could worry about one I find that it does help you to kind of like let your sub go all that other time in the day so that you can kind of say to yourself no this is not my worrying time I'm going to let that fat go for now and I'm gonna focus on whatever it is that I have in front of me right now but - the only thing that it helps with if I'm on the corner of the street or if I'm driving in my car and I start worrying about I don't know this bill that I have to find a solution to or something like that I can't be effective when I'm stuck in my car and so I end up really ruminating over it and thinking about it without actually having a solution whereas if I schedule 30 minutes of worry time I can sit down and really focus on what it is that's worrying me and I'm much more capable of being able to come up with a solution at that point because my mind is free I'm only focusing on this worry at that time and now I can actually make a plan that it's gonna help me you know find a solution in the end so scheduling worry time that's really helpful you might want to even you know take a notebook and put your worries in it so that you know that you'll come back to them I find that the strategy really helps a lot with being able to let yourself say now is not the time I'm saving this for my worry time so give it a try and the final strategy I'm going to talk about today is medication now I always have this conversation really cautiously with clients and especially in a video like this as a therapist I am not in any way qualified to assess for someone's fit for medication or to prescribe medication so I think that's a really important thing to know at the same time I do think it's an important conversation to be able to have with clients and just to help them to you know come to the decision of whether or not they think it would be a good fit for them to even ask their doctor about so definitely there are many variables involved and each individual person you know comes with their own set of variables that's going to make them either a good candidate or not such a great candidate for medication so I definitely encourage you to speak with your medical professional if you're thinking of looking into medication for treating anxiety a common recommendation and I'm on board with this as well is to try this other list of the other things that we've talked about to manage our anxiety before you resort to medication right there's often strategies that you can use to help make your anxiety much more manageable without the need for medication and I think ways that are probably going to be a lot more sustainable and maintainable to help ward off future experiences of anxiety as well so definitely try everything in this list before you resort to medication there are situations however and I've experienced this with clients as well where the affects of anxiety and the inability to concentrate and the real kind of intrusive intensity of anxiety really poses challenges for even being able to use these other skills or being able to engage in therapy and really do the work that's necessary to overcome anxiety and in those cases it has been found to be effective to you know start with some medication so that the anxiety symptoms are able to be you know dialed down a little bit so that you're more capable of attending and being present in your therapy sessions and when you're trying to use these skills at home but I would say that those are rare cases and definitely speak with your medical professional before you make that decision are you interested in knowing about how medication for anxiety works I'd like to make a video about this and about my perspective and working with clients and the types of things that I talk about in sessions about medication the the preparation I give them for speaking with their medical professional about the possibility of beginning medication so if you're interested in this topic or if you have any questions for me about medication and that type of thing I'll leave me a comment in the comment section below and I'd love to have a conversation with this and potentially make a video in the future anxiety is a beast and it can be so overwhelming and you're not alone at all if you're feeling like the the symptoms that you're experiencing with the fight flight freeze response and your anxiety or are sometimes too much to bear I really encourage you to make friends with your anxiety as weird as that sounds and to really develop a good sense of how anxiety impacts you what your triggers are and getting to know kind of yourself in relation to your anxiety it really goes a long way and I think that it sounds strange to say but finding a way to accept that this is what my anxiety is and this is what it looks like and this is how it impacts me is definitely something that will help you be able to you know have that foundation that you're able to make the next step to you know try some of these other strategies and for those of us who have anxiety knowing that there are gonna be you know high days where you're not experiencing a lot of symptoms and then there's also going to be really challenging days where your anxiety symptoms are really intense and that's kind of the game of getting to know your anxiety and helping yourself manage it better on a day to day basis so like I said I'm gonna be including some links for resources down below one is the article by our very own Ashley Greene Smith that parallel wellness on progressive muscle relaxation and I'm also providing a link to the mind shift app in BC it has become incredibly popular and it's a really helpful app for you monitoring and you know picking up strategies when you need them so I definitely recommend that you download that and give it a try if

really seems to be no trigger at all you're not gonna want to miss it see you in the next video bye plate freeze response watch this video from my explanation of the fight flight freeze response and multiple strategies strategies increase and anxiousness a little I can't talk [Music]", "6Wr09K4toc8": "[Music] hello today I'm going to talk about Cisco terpenes SSP tokens are a chemical family that I'm very fond of with an aromatherapy one of my main reasons for liking them is of two reasons one is that they're quite they tend to be non sensitizing to the skin and non-toxic which makes them want to save her families to blend with but the other reason I really like them is that they're my go-to chemical family when I'm trying to deal with three things feel relief tissue repair or information so in this plan today I am going to make a post injury tissue repair blend so it's quite an Pacific and but what I want to do is I want to work with be carefully which is one of the components of Cisco terpenes and I want to use the balsam copia as my oil so baltham Copiah is very high and be carefully it tends to be about 30% or above so I'm gonna make a blend with four different essential oils and I'm gonna make a bomb so as you probably know for me before I like to use bombs whenever I want to treat something long-term so when I want to get a slow constant steady release of essential oils into an injury or a site of concern I'll use a bomb or a butter as opposed to a carrier oil because I want it to be longer and consistent as opposed to a rapid treatment so I'm gonna use coconut oil because I want a soft bound the reason I'm not going to use a butter or beeswax in this is because they tend to be harder I'm their site the area of injury is either going to be a wound or it's going to be very tender to touch so in order to apply something directly onto it you're going to want to use something that's quite soft and pliable so this is a really soft butter I'm sorry I really soft bomb I'm gonna make ive put 25 mils of melted coconut on here and I'm going to use 25 mils of hemp so I love hemp seed oil when I'm dealing with pain and I know that I can stop this up when I wanna be 25 but obviously you can measure it out so the reason I love hemp is because it for other reasons but hampers brilliant for pain relief it's brilliant for common anxiety so you can imagine post injury anxiety it's gonna be a factor that you want to treat as well as the actual site of the injury so it's brilliant for hanging tissue repair as well happen to rebuild tissue so ham soul was my goal tree for this I'm just going to give them next to make sure that there are blended so this will harden but it will be a very soft bomb don't expect it to be like a butter it won't be and it'll be a beautiful and mossy green color like that which is lovely so like na ng ng repair or anything very medicinal I'm going to use quite a high essential oil concentration here I'm going to use 3% 3% it's going to give me a brief 40 drops of essential oil so I'm going to start with my balsam copia and I want to use 12 drops of it it's beautiful it smells very earthy and woody but also it's got this citrus top note as well not citrus sorry more like like a citrus is the wrong word it's more of a refreshing like a fern like top note I'm gonna use 12 drops you can see already that this the base is quite transparent so you know this is not going to become it's not going to solidify to a hard wax or a hard butter that's my 12 it's a beautiful essential oil then I'm going to use peppermint and I'm going to use 12 drops of peppermint as well no sorry not peppermint black pepper the reason I'm using black pepper and it feels like a natural choice here but one of the reasons I'm using black pepper is or its warming and stimulating effect so it's brilliant to deal with tissue repair brilliant for anti-inflammatory and really helps to warm up that area and help it to heal so you need 12 drops of black pepper and then my next two essential oils are going to be yarrow & helichrysum rectally so yarrow is going to go in here at it so both days are gonna go under the ear crops which is gonna be slightly smaller so I'm gonna it up your own su yarrow is brilliant obviously for tissue repair very medicinal and I'm brilliant for relieving that the peel with an injury and then the helichrysum it's gonna go in here and it drops as well so it's gonna do exactly what I wanted through and that is daily with tissue repair after an J so you can see it'll turn slightly blue now because of the Yarra which is lovely so it's quite a lovely color so try it on after an injury site to help rebuild the tissue repair let me know what you think [Music]", "RheFxC7UEaI": "it is particularly common in the head body and joints pain but where does pain come from and how do pain relievers work in response to a trauma a person only feels pain once the affected cells have reacted to it and have started transmitting pain messages like this the cell membranes immediately release fatty acids shown here as long red chains the fatty acids enter an enzyme cyclooxygenase anchored in the cell membrane this enzyme now functions as a kind of catalyst the fatty acids arriving at the enzyme are transformed and come out again as pain messenger substances shown here as a yellow cone these messenger substances are an exact fit for pain receptors on the nerve endings there they die and the stimulation thus caused is set on as an electrical signal to the brain via the nerve fibers the brain receives the information and evaluates it only then does the person feel pain ouch the entire complex process takes place in a split-second now we come to pain relievers they interrupt the transfer of information the active ingredient in aspirin acetyl salicylic acid affects an important interface in the process specifically the point where the pain messenger substances are created in the cyclooxygenase the active ingredient simply blocks access to this enzyme as a result fatty acids can neither find their way into the catalyst nor are they transformed into the pain messenger substance less and less pain messenger substance is transmitted when fewer and fewer pain messenger substances dock the nerve endings send correspondingly fewer impulses to the brain the result the pain abates a simple principle with a great effect the active ingredient in aspirin acetyl salicylic acid eases pain quickly and effectively whether in the head body or joints", "Nb6BpLyc4eI": "[Music] thank you so what i'd like to do is kind of turn to neuroscience although neuroscience um or i guess the aging brain initially would be really good to talk about um so you talked about cognitive ability declining as we get older and in fact from our 20s early 20s which is a bit frightening can you can you talk about so in what way like which components of it and and do we have any idea what's happening at the kind of the molecular level i mean why is the brain slower yeah good question you know it's a disturbing topic it's something you know we we don't like to think about but it's sort of all around us and you know we can see it every day when you you know you have that tip of the tongue or you can't remember you know your friend from college's name or something like that um i think so so your first question what which parts of cognition are declining yeah based on sort of the meta studies that have been done unfortunately almost all cognitive capabilities and faculties decline with age start some of them starting mid late 20s except basically for um things like vocabulary so i think it's i think the term is world knowledge things that are sort of factual um pieces of information that you've learned over your life right so you can imagine as you get older your vocab and your knowledge of geography and things like that increases but all other faculties mostly decline in terms of processing speed learning speed memory sort of executive function most of these things all decline in which is pretty frightening i think for sure it varies of course but person by person um but on average uh almost everything starts declining it's pretty scary um in terms of why that might be um short answer is is we don't really know unfortunately right and so i think part of that is we accept it as a natural course of aging um and also right we by our behavior develop ways to compensate for it and actually your brain does things to compensate for sort of the failing aspects as well so you know you might find that as you get older you i know i have make more lists right to remember what to do you know when you're younger maybe you didn't need lists as much now you you think you know i have a lot more to do at work or i have much more complicated life i have a family i need lists to keep track of everything right it makes sense but in in a way that those kinds of behaviors are compensating perhaps for you know a slightly worse memory than you had 10 years ago right so i think by our behavior and you know especially with all technology we have available to us now with reminders and calendars and everything right we can overcome a lot of these issues so it's not so noticeable um but i think unfortunately right this is on if you really do side-by-side tests right and when clinicians do these studies and um have people take the exact same tests in the exact same ways etc the the actual um very average decline it becomes very apparent um but in terms of why that might be so we don't really know but there are definitely physical changes in the brain that have been found to be associated with aging and likely to contribute to sort of these declining processes right so there's sort of a decrease in gray matter over time with age there's physical change some some reports of loss of neurons but a lot of reports of changes in the actual neurons themselves over time right so the structure and how connected they are to other neurons decreases in the activity of specific cells and specific brain regions and also their connectivity to each other changes over time as well and so in aging and diseases like alzheimer's and things like that so there's these physical changes in the brain that makes sense and are likely to be responsible for these sort of declining cognitive abilities um but why exactly those physical changes happen right we don't really know and now there's been work right and you find specific cellular or molecular mechanisms that might be contributing to them right reactive oxygen species dna damage the traditional kind of things that we think about with aging and so those definitely could be contributing you know to this to this changing structure of the brain but again you can always keep going back why does that happen to begin with right we don't really know you know recently there's been a lot of exciting work done on sort of the support cells in the brain the glial cells um microglia and sort of inflammation and the role that they play in sort of maintaining a healthy brain in the neurons and their structures and connections and so i think that's a very active area of research and you know a lot of promising results so far but again to summarize we don't really know why overall any of this is happening right um it's very unfortunate but we're working on it you know okay yeah that's good um so do you have any suggestions uh for so if i want to keep my brain better um is there any particular suggestions as to yeah how do how to maintain a healthy brain i i guess in terms of like diet or exercise yeah so i think um you know i know there's in the media and i have friends or family occasionally asking about these supplements and things and people come out or these fasting regimes and stuff like that um you know that couple papers come out and gets in the media and people are excited i think there are definitely um there some of these new things are promising in at some point maybe be pinned down enough that we know exactly what to do and what the benefits are and what potential side effects but for me actually i think you know the the the things that i myself do and recommend to other people are the safest and sort of most traditional things you can imagine right so i think exercise is something that's been pro you know broadly and profoundly found to have anti-aging effects across species across tissues you know in in it's like the best thing you can do for yourself is to exercise and be healthy you know specifically aerobic exercise sort of you know somewhat strenuous aerobic exercise swimming running so that's something i try to do and recommend people recommend for people to do um i think of course you know using your brain you know the idea of use or lose it i think that actually carries some weight you know i think it makes sense again from sort of an evolutionary standpoint but also sort of in in a neuroscience standpoint that using your brain and being stimulated helps it become or stay rather younger and healthier than if you know you don't do much in sort of static all day so you can imagine you know i like to think about you know in the old days when humans or pre-humans were living in tribes right if you're an old elder and you're wise and you have a lot of experience and you're helping solve these problems for your tribe right like oh there's an invading tribe coming or this animal is giving us problems or you know the farming is not working if you're a wise elder and you're helping actively think and solve problems you're you're giving value to your tribe and helping them survive helping your kids and your grandkids to survive right so that intrinsically is giving value um to your to your existence and into your genetic pool um but if you're just sitting you know in your heart to your tent by yourself all day you know doing nothing um and you get bored and you're not stimulating your brain you're not being active you can imagine that you know it's not so necessary that elder is not so necessary for the tribe and the brain isn't you know being exercised just like your muscles just like doing weight lifting you know it's not being used and utilized um and so it can sort of go stagnant so i think doing things to stimulate your brain sort of in with animal models and things we call um you know environmental enrichment right so that's like if you give a mouse a wheel or a toy or you give it extra new types of food and things like that you know it's been shown to have these beneficial effects um on sort of learning and memory and brain aging and so i think for humans it's the same idea right you travel you go to new places you learn a new game um you know you meet new people these things i think really do help people sort of stay and feel younger and keep your brain healthier um and of course you know a good diet you know eating healthy as you can always you know has as has great benefits and i think you know in a lot of different things a lot of different tissues a lot of different diseases you know of course that's beneficial um last thing i say is sleep good quality sleep so actually there's been a good amount of work showing a pretty strong link between sleep and sort of brain health and learning and memory and aging right and so and actually as we age generally people have worse quality sleep and less sleep um but sleep is very important for your brain's health and keeping it nice and clean and healthy and also for sort of the memory and learning and memory processes and as they sort of move around your brain and become stored and so i think having a lot of good quality sleep as much as you can manage is also um one of the best things you can do if we're trying to you know stay keep our brains young and healthy as long as we can until we have you know that magic pill that that can solve all our problems so we don't have to exercise and don't have to sleep but until then yeah all right so just one kind of detail on it so in terms of exercising the brain uh so there's games like jewel and so there's learning new things like languages or instruments what but there are games specifically like jewel and back do you know duel and back so i did i didn't i didn't know it specifically um but i know of it generally yeah yeah so i just wondered do you see any is that a good way of exercising the brain these kind of brain training games yeah so i think you know there's i think there's been more work on this and it's i think it's exciting it's very powerful especially with technology these days right you can give everyone an ipad and have them you know play these games or what have you but i think absolutely there's a value and you know it can't hurt right so there's been varying reports on these types of studies um where if you take some elderly people and you have them train on some some sort of some type of video game you're learning memory exercises does that improve various aspects of their cognition and learning and memory right but the some people some scientists claim that it it trains them to be better at that specific game right but not general life responsibilities and tasks so you know if you if you learn to remember the sequence order for colors or numbers or something they may get better with that game with more training but that might not help them remember what they need to buy for groceries or you know how to drive down the street to get to this grocery store other people other studies and actually for this duel and back you know they have found that certain types of games and training do indeed have effects on other aspects outside of the game right and a lot of these games now from what i know are gearing and sort of designed to be geared towards more life everyday kind of tasks that or are more applicable and may be more helpful for those everyday kinds of things right and so you can imagine those would be even more important and helpful for those people um so i think i think there's it doesn't hurt right to do whatever you can to help your brain and you know having a better memory even in that game isn't a bad thing and i think absolutely some of them have this ability and potential to be broader and more applicable to sort of cognitive functions executive functions things that you need in your everyday life you know you know i can say for sure my grandmother we try to get her to you know play as many games on her ipad as she will my grandfather used to do a sudoku multiple sudokus every day you know and i can't i can't tell you clinically that it had an effect but to me i think it makes a lot of sense um it's a healthy thing to do it keeps your brain active um but again i think more so than just those specific games is sort of environmental enrichment right seeing talking interacting with people new people i think that really helps people are much healthier when they're interacting with other people and they're doing new things and so i think those things besides the games themselves are also important i hope that you found the video informative please do hit the thumbs up button subscribe to our channel and hit the

and I'm also going to show you how to use it with an immobilizer brace if you need one we give you some paperwork this will be in your folder upon discharge and then this pamphlet it goes over everything I'm explaining to you and on the side of your machine also has how to use it in case you need to reference it at home the first thing you do is you're going to take your pad and it's all velcroed and it's the breg ice pad you're going to have either a pair of thinner type pants or a t-shirt type material between the skin and the pad that protects your skin from getting any kind of redness or ice burn disconnects and I usually tell my patients to keep this at the top so you can connect and disconnect on your own these are velcro and all you have to do is velcro lift your leg up and bring it around not too snug but enough to keep it in place and then the lower part okay when you get up and connect and disconnect you can keep this pad on rather than having to put it on and off all day long then you bring the ice cooler and this opens you put this push the handle down and let's lift this top off and put it to the side inside of here it shows you fill the to top with ice in the low aligned with water you want to make sure that you keep the levels correct so that the machine performs correctly you're going to get ice and it fill it and then and again fill it right to the top line the Lowell line is a little bit below it and you get water and fill it to that second line okay then you're going to keep the Kodiak ice machine close to where the knee is you don't want it on a high bureau on the floor because it helps the pump work more efficiently take the cover and you're always going to put the blue cord away from where it lifts off hold it down firmly and seal it in it's going to go to a two prong plug you're going to plug it in and you're going to bring this and connect to the back there is no power on/off switch you just put the plug in here and that gives it the electric just of your needs to run the pump system these two silver discs prior to putting it on need to be engaged from grip and opposites connect you're going to make sure that the tubing is placed so that it's not kinked or anything because icy water pumps through the system and then that nice cold icy water gives you good pain relief and helps with swelling when you go to disconnect you're going to and again go to the power source power down I usually tell patients a good idea is to use a face cloth underneath because when you disengage it I see water drips out so depress these disconnect and shake it out and then you can get up and about and do your business and not worry about having to put that on and off now the second part of this is if you have an immobilizer brace this is the immobilizer brace you can use this underneath it and all you would do is put it underneath you would put it on pry with your pants then the ice pad then lift your leg up and you can then just put this underneath over the ice pad do you just want to make sure that sometimes because it's a little bulkier than if you didn't have it on that you reject your straps and just make it fit firmly but not too snug and you just go all the way down and if you do need to make it a little bit more roomy you just go like that okay and then you have your ice machine and then you connect as I showed you before and it works the other thing is a lot of people that have these immobilizer braces if you're in a CPM machine you can when you're in bed obviously you can come out of your immobilized brace but you can keep this ice pad on just lift your leg up and connect when you're in the CPM machine you're going to get periodic breaks from this ice cooler but it is again regulated between 47 to 52 so if you have a thickness of like a t-shirt material between the skin and the pad that's usually okay but periodically just check your skin to make sure it doesn't get too red but it isn't like ice packs", "C8fGatN64MM": "this is the 66 fit cold compression therapy range there's eight products in the range going from top to bottom over here we've got the elbow then we've got the shoulder down towards the wrist in the middle we've got the back then we've got the thigh over here we've got the knee moving down towards the calf and finally the ankle each one of these supports is designed to provide you with maximum rehabilitation and incorporates the latest in coal compression therapy technology now let's show you in a little bit more detail one of these supports this is the 66 fit cold compression knee support it comes with inside this blue gel lining that's the bit that you would take out and put in the fridge or the freezer prior to use also if you want to wash it at any point that's the bit that you would take out before putting in the washing machine it's really simple and straightforward to put on very comfortable as well and it's fantastic for rehabbing any knee injuries that you may have had basically you can see here on the front we've got this opening that's where your kneecaps going to go lay it on your leg pull one of the straps around underneath tuck it up there and stick it in place same with the top one pull that round stick that in place now when that's on your knee that's going to be providing plenty of cold for the affected area around the sides once you've got that on though you can increase the compression and the pressure on it using the hand pump make sure that the valve is in the on position you just going to gradually pump it up to increase the pressure on the affected joint don't pump it up too much so as it's uncomfortable and stops the circulation in your leg but you need to make sure that the compression is enough it doesn't move about and then it provides adequate pressure on your knee once you've done that turn the valve to the off position unscrew the little pipe move it out of the way now a few bits and pieces about the support itself it's a unisex product suitable for both men and women it is a one size fits all product so you'll need to play around with the straps to make sure that it's to the right size and it can be used on both legs so you don't need to buy one for your left and one for your right", "OjAwZQALdSM": "we want to do is explain protocol for using thera-band kinesiology tape and Biofreeze at the same time first thing is that you want to prepare the skin as you normally would for kinesiology taping once that's been done we can then apply the kinesiology tape just as you normally would for example what we'll do is we'll apply one end of the kinesiology tape with no tension and then we'll remove the paper backing and apply the tape as we normally would we can apply as much tension as we need to using the thera-band stretch thera-band kinesiology tape stretch indicators and then what we'll do is place our tape and remove the paper for the last part of the anchor and then what we'll do is we'll rub the paper backing on the tape itself to activate the adhesive once we've properly applied the kinesiology tape then we want to do is come with Biofreeze we want to spray not just on the tape but around the area as well so what we'll do is just do a general spring on the tape as well as around it the key here when you're using kinesiology tape with Biofreeze at the same time is always apply the tape first and then apply Biofreeze after that never apply or use before you apply the tape that doesn't allow the menthol debris we want to do is to apply the tape first and then spray it Biofreeze and that can be reapplied up to four times a day", "7EDCofzAEE4": "hi there I'm Lucy McDonald physiotherapist and I have been asked to do a video blog on patellar tendinopathy following my video blog on tendinopathy sore tendon pain in general so important things to note about tendinopathy of the patellar tendon so what on earth am I talking about if anyone was watching this and wondering what a patellar tendon is so your patella is your kneecap and the tendon I'm talking about goes from the bottom of your kneecap and inserts into the the bony bits at the front of on top of your your tibia called your tibial tubercle and it's a super common tendon to have pain in as I mentioned in my last video it tendinopathy not a tendonitis because we now know that it's not inflammatory I just just means an inflammation of so by the time your patellar tendon is painful we know that actually there's been structural changes inside the tendon itself both the collagen fibers the nerves blood vessels are all all affected and first thing before launching into specific stuff for tendon patellar tendons one of the things I think is really important with this particular tendon is to make sure that other structures aren't involved and in fact let me reword that almost always other structures are involved so normally there's some irritation of the fat pads that sit underneath that the tendon around the tendon and also the patella femoral joint itself so you can often get pain kind of shifting around and the good thing is is that most of the problems that are involved with a patella turns off they are treatable with the same rehab approach and hands-on approach but with the exception of the fat pad so the fat pad is particularly irritated by fully extending so fully straightening the knee and so if this is the case with you you might need a period of time where you're avoiding that full extension full straightening and then building up to strengthening within that that's what we call outer range so from a very slight knee bend to fully straighten position so that's if there's fat pad involvement so super important obviously to get all injuries checked out so that you can have your your treatments specifically targeted at the at the structures that are involved so presume you've got that classic tender spot that you can poke right over the tendon and that you haven't had any trauma then the most common reason that I see for patellar tendons not getting better is incorrect loading so quite often people are not loading the tendon enough so as you'll know from my last video tendons love being loaded but they only enjoy or respond well to graduated small incremental increases in load a sudden increase in in loaders is going to cause a tendon to flare up so treatments all about gradually increasing the the load through the tendon in small amounts and quite often because it can be an uncomfortable place process people hold back on unloading the tendon so it's okay well like what I tend to say and is that it's okay to have pain at around about three or maybe even a four out of ten ten being the worst pain you can imagine not being nothing so around those kind of low levels of discomfort rather than intense pain it's okay to feel that during the exercises and for up to say three to four hours after but then the pain should fully resolve and you certainly shouldn't be noticing an increase in pain over sort of 24 48 hour process if that's the case then you're doing too much and you just need to tone it down a bit all your physio should tone it down a bit for you but it's fine to feel some discomfort during the exercises and in fact from my experience actually feeling that discomfort is an important part because if you're not feeling that discomfort you often don't get the same results so loading the tendon enough is really important and also through the range of motion that you you need for that tendon so if your pain is mostly when you're walking on the flats then you're only going to need to work the tendon through a relatively small range of motion normally though tendons are also painful going up and down stairs and in which case you need exercises that that that load that tender through the range of the larger ranges of motions that you need going up and down stairs likewise sitting and getting out of a chair now the third thing is to make sure that you're loading the the tendon the first one is making sure you're loading it enough second one is making sure you're loading it through the range third one is making sure that you're loading it with the speed and the requirements necessary for your activities so it might be for example that your your a trail runner for example if you're a trail runner you're going to need to train that that larger range of knee bend and straight straightening at a much higher speed than someone who only requires that range of movement movement for going nice and steadily up and down stairs as an example likewise if you're doing sports that involve changing direction you're going to need to do a lot more changing change of direction work for for the tendon so those the most common things oh and another big area so first of all you've got that that loading component and then the second equally important component is getting your biomechanics and your alignment sorted so often the tendon might be taking the load incorrectly more one side than the other and that's down to the technique that you're doing your your squats or going up and down stairs or running or walking or wearing heels that's another one that can aggravate it so all of those things need to be looked at and there might be that your physio needs to look at things like your foot addition strengthen the muscles in your foot give you appropriate Footwear or maybe even some some basic insoles likewise if the feet are affected then almost definitely you're also going to need some exercises too to work the stability muscles of your hips and your pelvis so make sure you're doing make sure you check out the alternative or other structures that could be involved with the tendon number one number two make sure you get your loading program right number three make sure you're looking at your biomechanics number four hands on can be really helpful especially while you're loading the tens and the muscles might get a bit sore so hands on can be really nice for just loosening everything up and enabling you to push on towards with your exercises and finally last but not least making sure that you're doing everything you can to help recovery of the tendon and the muscles involved so things like nutrition sleep rest we know that tendons are particularly affected by things like hormones and other systemic factors so other factors in the blood system so you doing everything you can to help those things looking after your mental health looking after your your nutrition all those things can make a huge difference to tendon recovery I hope that's helpful if you have any other questions about patellar tendons or any other if you'd like me to do any other video blogs about tendons or any other topics please let me know my contact details are Lucy McDonald physio at hotmail code UK or you can contact me through our website wwlp.com I

staining and shadowing techniques is that they involve dehydrating the sample and of course living cells are hydrated so there's no guarantee that the molecules inside will maintain their structure through the dehydration process the next two techniques involve freezing cells in their hydrated environments the first one we'll talk about is high pressure freezing in the first step a block of tissue is placed in a high pressure freezer and this device starts by applying tremendous pressure on the block of tissue and then rapidly cooling it by applying liquid nitrogen all around it the purpose of the pressure is to decelerate ice crystal formation now we know that if you take liquid water and you slowly cool it the water molecules will bounce around until they find hydrogen bonding partners to form an extended ice crystal and the ice crystal is less dense than the liquid water and so the water expands as it crystallizes and this of course would destroy the cell however if you apply very high pressure to a block of tissue so that it can't expand and then you cool it the water can't expand in an ice crystal and it stays more nearly in a liquid like state there still may be lots of little micro crystals but they don't grow and rip the cells apart as they would if you very slowly cooled the cells at atmospheric pressure and so the pressure prevents ice crystal formation in the next step the freeze substitution while the block of tissue is still held below freezing temperature it can be dehydrated and infiltrated with an organic solvent and finally with a a plastic resin that will polymerize even at below freezing temperatures and this is what's called low-temperature embedding and so starting with a high pressure frozen block of material it can be plastic imbedded all before it really thaws completely and this preserves the native structure of the cells once it's plastic imbedded it can be warm to room temperature sectioned as before typically stained and then it can be imaged in the electron microscope now of course if it's plastic embedded and sectioned and stained with metals again the actual biological macromolecules will not be seen it will be the stains that delineate them but nevertheless by high pressure freezing free substituting and low-temperature embedding the basic structure of the cell is better preserved these two images show an extreme example of how high-pressure freezing and low-temperature embedding can better preserve cellular structure than chemical fixation alone so these are images of multi vesicular bodies courtesy of Mark Loddon ski and so the image on the right here is of a multi vesicular body that was preserved with ultra rapid freezing and free substitution or high pressure freezing and low temperature embedding free substitution so what you see is a series of membranes concentric vesicles each one you can see the two leaflets of the bilayer so this is one membrane forming a vesicle and inside is another vesicle with its two leaflets of its membrane here inside and they're just concentric Li arranged in probably 15 vesicles all within each other here in this multi vesicular body and they're next to two other membranes of the nuclear compartment and these two membranes you can also see the two leaflets of the bilayer so these are nicely preserved the membranes are smooth and clear in a different example of a multiple SiC Euler body shown on the left this is a tissue that was fixed by traditional chemical fixation at room temperature and then it was plastic imbedded etc and in this case you can see that there were a lot of membranes on top of each other stacked membranes but the membranes are wavy there seems to be large gaps in-between sometimes in traditional chemical fixation there's material lost it's extracted away and so clearly in cases like these the high-pressure freezing better preserves the native structure now of course it would be better if we could take the frozen material and image it directly in the electron microscope but we run into another fundamental problem which is that the imaging electrons are so strongly scattered by biological materials that the mean free path length of for instance a three hundred kilovolts electron in a Cell is only about 260 nanometers meaning that your average electron with three hundred kilovolts of energy only passes through 260 nanometers of material before it's scattered and if it scattered multiple times or if it's in elastically scattered then it doesn't contribute usefully to the image anymore and because of this there's a fundamental limit that we cannot image samples that are thicker than about a half a micron so in any sample preparation technique it has to end with a sample that's about 500 nanometers thick or less nevertheless if we want to image a frozen cell within the electron microscope it is possible to first high pressure freeze a block of tissue and then section it in the frozen state a process that we call cryo sectioning this is a movie that was recorded by my colleague al dear McDowell and his colleagues and what we see is a high pressure frozen block of tissue at the end of a microtome arm and this here is a diamond knife and as the microtome arm is brought back and forth across the sharp edge of the diamond knife very thin sections of that high-pressure frozen material are being cut off and they stick to one another so that they emerge as a ribbon of sections and then down here we see an eyelash that's being used to catch that ribbon of sections and draw it forward and so it is possible to cryo section high-pressure frozen material and take that ribbon of cryo sections and then lay them down on an e/m grid and when that ribbon of cryo sections is laid across an e/m grid and it can look like this this is an SEM image of a ribbon of cryo sections laid down across an electron microscope grid now one of the challenges of this technique is that the cryo sections themselves are often crumpled and crinkled and so here we see in the SEM image of the the cryo section laying on the grid that the section isn't even nearly flat and there's also a lot of contamination on this particular cryo section so one of the challenges is to get the cryo section to lay down flat on the e/m grid sometimes people will take a blunt instrument cooled by liquid nitrogen and simply try to press and crush the section down onto the e/m grid but it's only partially successful in addition when such cryo sections have been imaged it's been observed that there's a lot of compression that occurs during the sectioning process so these are images of bacterial cells that were high pressure frozen cryo sectioned and then imaged on an e/m grid these are rod shaped bacteria so they normally look cylindrical but in this case after their cryo sectioned they're compressed by twenty or thirty percent in the direction of the cutting blade on the diamond knife and so they're compressed and this introduces artifacts into the image in addition to being compressed as the high-pressure frozen material scrapes across the diamond knife there are knife marks and the knife marks in these images are represented by the black arrows where you see streaks that are streaking down across the image those are from imperfections in the diamond knife a final problem arises because of the geometry of the cutting situation imagine that this is the diamond knife and the material to be cut is above that knife mounted into the Chuck of the microtome and this microtome arm is swimming up and down and up and down in front of the diamond knife and so this is going to be swinging down against the diamond knife and as it swings down into say this position you can see that it will be cut by the diamond ninth however the geometry of the situation creates stresses right here at the junction and these stresses force material to erupt up out of the surface creating a series of ridges and crevices on the side of the material away from the diamond knife blade so cryo sections suffer from crossing on the surface opposite of the diamond knife they suffer from compression as they slide into the blade it compresses the material in this direction and finally there are knife marks that arise as the knife scrapes through and cuts the frozen block so you see these shadows that appear going across the section these are crevices that were caused by the outside surface being crushed on top of itself nevertheless this allows us to obtain images of frozen material without chemical fixative or stains or any plastic embedding the last sample preparation technique that we'll talk about is plunge freezing in plunging a very small amount of sample is placed on an e/m grid suspended above a reservoir of liquid ethane typically and the liquid ethane is cooled by being surrounded by liquid nitrogen so the ethane is at approximately 80 Kelvin and then the sample is rapidly plunged into the liquid ethane and if the sample is thin enough heat comes out of the sample so quickly and into the ethane that the water molecules don't have time to bounce around and find partners to hydrogen bond with so that they can't form an extended crystal instead the kinetic energy comes out so quickly that the water molecules and all the other molecules in present simply stop moving wherever they are before they have a chance to crystallize and all molecular rearrangements are frozen now I'll show a movie that we recorded for the Journal of visualized experiments showing this process of plunge freezing first individual e/m grids are loaded into an automatic freezing device and so here the sample is being applied a couple microliters of the sample is applied to the e/m grid and then it's lifted up in between two pads of filter paper those pads press against the grid absorbing most of the material and then the grid is plunged into a reservoir of liquid ethane there it is in the middle and the ethane is surrounded by liquid nitrogen once it's plunged frozen it needs to be held in that frozen state so this is an example image of two bacterial cells that have been plunged frozen across an e/m grid in this case we use the e/m grid type called quanta foils that have circular holes in the carbon film surrounding them so that that's a circular hole in the grid surface itself the rest of us this is a carbon film and we simply took a growing bacterial culture and spread it into a very thin film across that grid and then plunged it into liquid ethane and then by keeping it frozen constantly from the time it was plunge frozen until it's in the column of the electron microscope we can then take an image through it and so here's what you see the great advantage is that we've preserved the cells in a near native state in fact it's been shown that if you take a grid like this and thaw it out in growth media many of the cells will recover life and they'll begin to replicate and so we're looking here at a cell in a native state and all the molecules are where they were when we dropped it into the liquid ethane there's no chemical fixative x' altering the structure there was no dehydration because they're still surrounded by the water there's no plastic embedding there's no sectioning or staining it is a mere native state that we can inspect now with an electron microscope now this can be done with any thin object for instance this suspension of cells is quite thin also you can take any solution of a protein for instance and spread it into a thin film and plunge freeze it so here again is the picture of the 20s proteasome x' over here was the negative stained image that I showed you before showing how you can see its barrel shape but now on the right I show a picture of similarly purified 20s proteasome z-- but in this case they were spread into a thin film across an e/m grid and plunge frozen and imaged in this frozen hydrated state and so again you can see the details of the barrel shaped protein being a stack of four rings and so here's a side view and then here for instance is a top view showing the view down the barrel and you can even see there's a hole in the center of the barrel as we know from x-ray crystallography and so in this cryo e/m image there is the possibility of eventually visualizing the secondary structure or even atomic structure of the proteins because the proteins are in their native hydrated state we still have the problem though that we can't resolve those details from a single protein because the number of electrons that it would take to resolve those structures would destroy a single protein and we'll talk more about that problem in a second so plunge freezing is a powerful strategy to preserve biological structures in a native state and it works most easily for samples that are already thin enough that they can be placed directly into the microscope remember that means thinner than about 500 nanometers or less plunge freezing can also be used to give us views of parts of cells or other objects that are larger than 500 nanometers for instance even large cells can be grown on the surface of an e/m grid in this image this is an SEM image recorded by Jurgen plaits Co we see a large mammalian cell growing on the surface of the e/m grid you can see the quantify holes of the e/m grid over here and the basic structure the large grid bars of the e/m grid here and so over these quanta foil holes a mammalian cell has grown and the lump in the middle is the nucleus but we can see that this cell type flattens out so its periphery is very thin and in these regions it can be directly plunged frozen and imaged but what if we want to view something inside the thicker regions of the cell that here appear is a lump we can't do it directly because the electrons will all be scattered away if we try to image directly through that thick material this is a figure from a paper from Alex Riegert and his colleagues that was published in PNAS showing this process so here you see a cell this is the main body of the cell growing on an e/m grid see the quantify holes in the e/m grid here so this is the main body of the cell growing on top of the grid and the goal is to isolate a very thin layer of material through the middle of the cell and so they mark using software in the dual beam theb sem they can mark a region of the sample that should be ablated by the ion beam and so they mark that region in this region here and then they use the ion beam to just a blade away all of this material and all of this material and as a result you get something that looks like this where you have quite a bit of cellular material material over there and quite a bit of cellular material over here and then you just have a very thin what's called a lamella of cellular material through the middle and if you were to rotate that 90 degrees it would look like this here's the cellular material on the right and here's the cellular material on the left and here's that very thin lamella of material right through the middle this is looking at it essentially from the top and then this is thin enough to record images through with a transmission electron microscope these are two images that illustrate the advantages that fit milled lamella exhibit over cryo sections both images are of dividing yeast cells and so for instance in the FIB milled section this is the yeast cell wall over here and so the yeast cell goes you know covers this entire area and it's dividing and so here's the nuclear compartment of one of the daughter cells and here's the nuclear compartment of another one of the daughter cells and they're connected by a thin neck of nucleus here and coursing through this thin neck of nucleus are microtubules that are part of the mitotic spindle that segregate the chromosomes and so in this fib mill voix melam you can clearly see the two membranes of the nucleus these are nuclear pore complexes that exist in that nuclear membrane there's others on the other side the microtubules are very smooth and clean in addition you can see tubular vesicles as well as spherical vesicles and many other details about the cell now we compare that to a similar dividing yeast cell that was cryo sections and then imaged so here is the cell wall material and the edge of the yeast cell goes like this around this region and here's that thin neck of nuclear compartment that goes between the nuclear compartment of one of the daughter cells in the nuclear compartment of another one of the daughter cells and here you can see microtubules extending through the neck just like in the FIB milled region however here you see that the membranes are rippled and they're slightly discontinuous and so that looks a little unnatural you can see that the microtubules are not nearly as continuous and cleanly visible this is a granule and you can see that it looks somewhat compressed in this direction it was probably spherical but got compressed by the cutting here again this is another probably spherical liposome that looks like it was compressed and if you look carefully you see evidence that the the cutting blade was going in this direction for one thing here are the crevices on the top surface of the section they're not visible throughout because it's a slice through a 3d tomogram of this cryo section but on the edge you do see the crevasses here that also tell us that this was the cutting direction then you see compression in that direction and you see artifacts in the membrane structure so clearly the Fed milled lamella better preserve the structure than cryo sections so as you can see there's a myriad of ways that biological material can be prepared for transmission electron microscopy the key is always to stabilize the material so that it can be inserted into the ultra-high vacuum of the electron microscope but in addition if stains are used they can enhance the contrast of the objects inside and a higher dose can be used to image them but some resolution is lost because then your imaging stains that simply decorate or coat or form a replica of a structure rather than imaging the structure itself this is a flow chart that summarizes many of those techniques and let's start with a sample at the beginning and at the end of the chart we see there's two basic kinds of electron microscopy there's conventional room-temperature electron microscopy where the sample is at room temperature when we stick it into the microscope then there's also cryo-em where the sample is going to need to stay frozen as we insert it into the electron microscope then we further classify the techniques as whether they happen here these are processes that occur at room temperature so this is room temperature processing steps and these steps are all steps that happen at very cold temperatures so we'll call those cryo processing so perhaps the simplest path is to start with a sample and simply add a drop of negative stain and let it dry this produces a room-temperature sample ready for microscopy traditional thin section ium proceeds by taking a sample and chemically fixing it and then dehydrating it plastic embedding thin sectioning staining and then you can stick it in the electron microscope the cryo methods begin with the sample and then there's some kind of cryo fixation that is used there's a lot of different kinds of cryo fixation we talked about high pressure freezing where pressure is applied to prevent ice crystallization there's also slam and other freezing techniques which I didn't bring up and finally there's plunge freezing which we did describe samples that have been high pressure frozen slam frozen or plunge frozen again there's a variety of next steps that can be taken following the high pressure freezing samples can be free substituted dehydrated and fixed low temperature plastic imbedded and then once they're embedded they can be warmed to room temperature sectioned stained and then inserted as a room temperature eeehm sample so this is the high pressure freezing low temperature embed route to a room temperature sample these kinds of samples can also be freeze fractured freeze edged and other techniques we haven't described yet and eventually these also lead to a room-temperature sample ready for insertion in the electron microscope these samples can also be sectioned at low temperature while they're frozen they can be cryo sectioned and then they are thin and frozen and as long as they're maintained in freezing temperatures they can be inserted into a cryo IAM and imaged in a frozen hydrated state finally plunge frozen samples see if they're thin enough can be immediately inserted into the cryo e/m and imaged and finally a plunge frozen sample that's too thick to be imaged through can be fit milled and then imaged in the cryo iam you", "urNNA17TSTE": "hi everybody be Meister 22 here hey today we're gonna look at the Iceman clear three cold-therapy unit I have been using this for my knee after knee surgery and I'm quite impressed with it this thing is very simple to use get put ice in there add ice up to the fill line put cold water in there add that up to the fill line put the lid on it attach the pad to the hose put it on plug it in BAM it's that simple and it really is that simple the hose coming off the unit it connects to the pad with these quick releases and they have Oren's in there I guess because they do not leak I was worried about that they don't leak I would imagine after a certain period of time they might but I have not had any leaking problems with it there are a wide variety of pads you can hook on to this but I'm just using the standard pad for the knee now what is this for some of you already know what this is for if you don't know what this is for this takes the place of having to put ice or a cold pack on your knee or your elbow or whatever sore part of your body that you were gonna ice it head really quick let me give you this disclaimer I am NOT an expert in these I am just sharing my experience in using this how I used it in my thoughts and opinions on it you can purchase these online if you don't get one from your doctor from the hospital they're selling these online there's versions or different kinds of people make I've been impressed with this one if you want to learn more about this go to the website check it out and then maybe you can see if it's right for you ask your doctor if you've already been given one of these make sure you follow the instructions and really I have been very impressed with this and I intend to use this in the future not just you know for this one injury because like I said this replaces the idea of having to use an ice pack or like I said a gel pad which doesn't last as long all right what do you think did you ever know something like this existed I didn't I kinda did because several months ago a friend of mine said I'll advise machine I could loan it to you it was really expensive the way he was describing it as he might have liked a refrigeration unit one said it cost him $1,500 and I know I don't want to use I had no idea what that was but so I had an inkling of it but that was the first I never heard of it and then when I woke up with this attached to me after surgery oh that's what it is it's kind of cool this is me I like it so yes I should've borrowed that other weird one from a friend right all right so leave your comments in the comment section check out the website for this if you have any questions you can leave questions in the comment section but I may not have

Thanks so much for tuning into my channel I wanted to come to you all today to share with you how I am able to keep my son's ice therapy machine Ice cold without breaking the bank buying all this ice Alright, so without further ado, let's get started, but first things first if you are new here Welcome and thank you so much for stopping by and and if this is your first video that you have ever watched and you like what you've seen and heard today go ahead and thumbs it up after watching it and I hope that it helps you and If you like you have my permission to share it if you know someone that is in need of this Information. So without further ado, we're gonna go ahead and get started But this is the machine that I am speaking up y'all I'm gonna try to turn the camera to it Okay, you might see some weird things in the back, please. Excuse me. That's just my house is just you know Alright, so this is the machine right here Let me try to move this thing out the way so you can be able to see exactly what it is This is the Iceman machine It is a water therapy machine and it is used it was given to my son after he had his knee surgery Okay Now anyone I guess who have knee surgery you might know something about this machine and you know How costly how very expensive it can be? Um? Keeping ice for this thing. Okay, so I was not able to store ice. Okay? So all this thing I have is a refrigerators freezer I didn't have a deep freezer where I could just buy the bags of ice and just throw them in the freezer I wasn't  I didn't have that So I had to come up with an idea and I went online Searching searching searching like something gots to give for this So when my son got this machine here is the little thing that they had wrapped You cannot put it where you can see it. They had this thing. It was wrapped inside of his bandages after they did his surgery and this is the thing where the water goes through and keeps the area nice and cold I think I see this the water will come inside of these tubing's right here and we'll go fill this thing up and it'd be Cold. Okay, so I sat down and I real had to really figure this out like something gots to give You know, I kept I'm not able to keep purchasing this ice so I will try to insert a picture As well if I still have that picture of how his name look and you will be able to see these little things right here because the machine Connects see right here. It connects this way. He will put this on this is inside of his His bandages where his need was operated on and these things sticks out and he connects to this alright, so all this thing you have to do is snap and open and shut then once you one used to put these little Rubber of things over this so that way water wasn't dripping out all over his bed or him and all that type of stuff I'm moving right along while I still got some ice here to show you guys, okay? So the first thing I started off with was using ice like this You know how we just get hunks of ice out of them you know and put them inside of cups and cans and whatever and would throw them inside of here cuz I'm like Okay, something has to give so I would do this type of thing to you know Keep ice going in here until I said, let me just go and try to search online just to see you What others is saying about this machine how they are able to? Keep ice in here without worn bankrupt buying ice. You know what I'm saying? That ice a big bag of ice It's Costin when a big bag of ice is costing like three ninety-nine at least where I am So you looking at I'm running through ice like I would get two of them at a time So you're looking at about eight dollars? Okay, so I'm running through them like every every other day I had to keep going back to the store buying ice and I'm like, oh, no something has to give so I did I thought of an ice maker But I wasn't able to get that so something had to give so I went online But like I said, I started out with these things right here. Okay, then I said I kept noticing that they would melt fast I'm like, okay, something has to give something has to give so then when I went online That's when I discovered people was using water bottles of water for ice They will take these throw them in the freezer that these freeze up and that would be the ice. Okay, but time around the time my son got his Surgery done. It was reaching almost close to like 100 degrees here. Okay, and The ice is so of course the water that's coming from the outside You know that I'm using to fill this up with was kind of a warm side So, of course it's gonna make that ice melt even faster so I'm like, okay something else has to give so I had a what they call that a Oh my god, they call it a in other word a bright idea moment. I'm gonna say it that way So I start taking the water that I was gonna put inside this machine and I put this in the refrigerator And let it get cold. Let it get cold y'all Okay cuz as I kept sitting here thinking and I'm pondering a pondering now I go back to this and I start looking at how this works Inside of it. Like I said, the water comes through these things here from the machine Okay, it comes inside of this and this is what has to stay cold is the water The ice doesn't go in here just the water. Okay, so I'm like, okay, I got it. I got it. I got it umm idea Why don't I just take this water what I'm gonna use inside of here in the first place and make it cold! And then I could just use this to keep it cold Okay, which means that this right here is gonna keep this cold much longer, okay with it already being cold, so That was a bright idea. So guys I wanted to share with you so what I would do take this cold water pour it in there and wish this picture you have to point up to I Don't think you can see it. It's like a certain mark area of women I tilt it over if you can see see right there You have to put ice right there and you have to put the water right there right there where my finger is See that little line. So what I do I would just feel to put the water there. So this picture didn't hold enough water so Of course I had to end up putting like a whole juice jug and I fill this thing up and I put it in so whatever This leaves wherever this left off. Then I have water outside of this that's already cold to put inside of it and it works Perfect. Now my son said that it don't get ice-cold at all the Is cold but it's not the type of cold that he would be looking for so, I don't know He said that even with the ice, I mean when I had the ice cubes, it didn't get real real cold, but it's cold So I'm thinking that maybe it's not something that's gonna give you that real real real real real cold that you would think it would give when you just say then took some water and you know poured it out the refrigerator Into there, he looked like to me it would be really cold But he said that he don't but my thing is as long as you get that cold therapy And at the time he was needing to when he first had got this machine first had his surgery This machine would have to run at least six times a day Because the main thing was was to keep down the swelling and that's the only way they could do it was through this machine With this wrapped around his weight his own, you know his surgery area Okay, so this thing would get cold and that's what they wanted but buying that ice I could not do it and it was like ah so know how he be I like to keep things simple and easy nice and breezy Okay up in here because that's the only way we can function around here. So I had to come up with this idea So guys I wanted to share this with you guys. So if you know somebody who's using this machine Anybody that's having knee surgery or whatever You might can just hip them onto this because the doctor will give them this and this is what they're gonna be using Far as to keep down the swelling. Okay, so you might want to go ahead and share this information with them Okay, as far as how many ice bottles you would need as far as these big ones For inside of here, you only need four. So what the main thing you would do you would get you a whole case of the Tall bottles of these the ones that you want and you will just freeze eight because you will have a backup so when you use these then and when these Thaws out then you can put the other four that you got in the freezer So you wanna freeze all eight of them at the same time? Okay, and then that way you can always have you back up. All right now even with the smaller bottles if you want to use these Then this machine will take five of these so you would have to freeze ten because you want to have that backup So it's up to you how and what you want to freeze? And how do you want to do it now? if you want to continue to do this you can because you could take this little ice and just pour it down inside of there and Hey, it's good to go. You know if you still want to use like cans of ice and stuff like that but on this thing, I would suggest if it's hot in your area now some places some some areas where you know, You might not have to even do this Where's coke makes this water right here cold, but I would suggest because it would make your ice last longer But that's totally up to you. But I just wanted to drop this off to you guys. And yes, this is ahh Okay, yeah, this is a 72-ounce pitcher, okay, and I had to end up using maybe half of this Okay, so I don't know if you can find something. That's big enough to really pour You know to be able to hold every all the water, but just you know break it up in high every way you want to do it because this is how I did it and I Use this picture to keep to make water cold as well as this Because whatever this leaves off I can get it out of here. Okay? So yeah So I hope that this really do help it's been it's been a long time coming y'all I've been wanting to get this video out you guys but yes, I've been busy trying, you know Make sure my son is comfortable. Like I said, I did do a update for log on his condition But now he did go I can give you a quick update He went to his orthopedic surgeon yesterday and the surgeon say everything's looking great This is a video I did want to bring to you guys was about how to keep this thing cold because I know somebody somewhere else is going through the same thing and then it's besides that you know, what if you don't even want to buy the ice you're not I'm saying this just as a quicker way to Where you can just have this done and you don't have to even go through that So if there's any questions comments post them in the comment section of this video I'd like to thank all y'all so very much for watching And yeah, so I hope that this do help and if you do know someone who can benefit from this information of this video Please go ahead you have my permission to share it but please thumbs up the video first So others can be able to share it as well. So with that being said, thank you all so So very much for watching wish you a blessed day.

Vernon Williams offered her a way to freeze away the pain it's called focused cold therapy that focused cold therapy allows us to reduce the temperature of a peripheral nerve to a very precise zone doctor's locate the nerve that's responsible for the pain they then numb the area and insert a cold probe with liquid nitrous oxide to freeze the nerve and that results in just turning that nerve off temporarily so it is unable to send pain signals the cold therapy reaches negative 120 degrees it doesn't damage surrounding tissues and doesn't kill the nerve the relief lasts a few months Abby noticed a difference right away I ran the day after and it was already significantly better now she's setting her goals high with no pain holding her back I'm looking forward to going to state and we're even hoping to make nationals the cold therapy procedure can be used for any kind of pain where a peripheral nerve is involved doctor Williams says he even uses it to relieve headaches in some of his patients stay with us", "3XMQjqM-PdA": "it's product spotlight day and I'm here at Parker seminars in Las Vegas and it's great to come to these vendor groups because I get to see what's out there and I've come across something which is in my opinion extremely unique and something that to keep your eye out for it's called fight assault it's a topical but guess what this topical has an agent that carries the active ingredient through the skin that's right it carries it through the skin it just doesn't lay on the skin this is the only topical I know that has that the active ingredient happens to be a CBD to isolate you don't happen to know that but what you do need to know it's great for anti-inflammation and pain great stuff no odor no menthol no icy hot no counter irritants the only thing that works is the active ingredient that's bound to something that penetrates through the skin that's my product spotlight for today have a great day", "v6OMQ-EsnUQ": "thank

"1xyA8Cfe_no": "hello and welcome everyone to pxe internationals webinar today I'm Christine Vokey director of participant engagement at phc international and we are the title of our webinar today is tissue injury and essential ingredient for calcification where you don't want it today's webinar is a follow-up or a sequel to a webinar that our presenter presented in December called nature's stone how the body balances calcification to bones while projecting soft tissue our speaker today is again dr. Jonathan schoenecker he is assistant professor of orthopedics Pediatrics pathology and pharmacology at Vanderbilt University in Nashville Tennessee he's recently come into the pxe world with his interest in pyrophosphate and calcification of soft tissues and he's becoming a very involved in PhD research we are taking questions and dr. shawn Achor will answer those questions at the end of the presentation we invite you to write your questions to us anytime there's on the right side of your screen there is a question panel and you can type your question into that panel and I will be collating them all and asking them to dr. schoenecker at the end of the presentation so with that I will hand it over to you great you for being here thank you very much welcome everybody and thanks for the opportunity to talk with you again today the goal of this presentation is to continue our discussion as to what is known regarding the ingredients that cause soft tissue calcification the hope is is that if we list out all of the ingredients we can find the best ways to prevent calcification where you don't want it remember in our last webinar we discussed the balance of calcium and phosphate and how they are controlled in our bodies the element calcium and the molecule phosphate are essential for most biological processes they power our cells and are essential for cell communication additionally calcium and phosphate can combine to make bigger structures forming big big crystals most notably one called hydroxyapatite that composes bone in certain diseases such as pxe these crystals are apparently deposited into the soft tissues causing calcification of those soft tissues thus maintaining the balance of calcium and phosphate is absolutely critical for life and balance is maintained through multi organ systems allowing continuous monitoring and balancing of the flow of calcium and phosphate throughout the body in health the goal of balance is to provide adequate calcium and phosphate for cell function and to maintain bone integrity however remember that to optimize bone and cell function calcium and phosphate circulate at near saturation meaning they're ready to form crystal this is again great for bone but it's terrible for soft tissues meaning that the soft tissue should have spontaneous calcification within as we covered in the last webinar the body has mechanisms designed to prevent soft tissue calcification the one mechanism that has become a big focus recently is very important in pxe this is referred to as the pyrophosphate pump for more information regarding this pump please go back and watch our last webinar for all of the little bits and pieces that make up this pump this pump provides pyrophosphate in the circulation which enters those soft tissue compartments which effectively prevents hydroxyapatite formation in those compartments so to expand upon or conversation in the last webinar and to help direct future treatments and research to battle these devastating diseases let's look at the list of ingredients first and foremost we have our systems designed to balance calcium and phosphate namely dietary intake gut absorption kidney clearance hormonal control by the endocrine system to help balance this we have the pyrophosphate pump on the other side of this equation is calcification of soft tissues in health as long as we have good diet good functioning gut healthy kidneys a good endocrine system and a functioning pyrophosphate pump the balance of the equation favors no soft tissue calcification we are now learning that imbalances of this equation change the output for example the most recent evidence suggests that in diseases such as pxe in which we have a dysfunctional pyrophosphate pump the balance of the equation favors soft tissue calcification leading to calcified soft tissues the research is exciting as it helps direct potential prevention and possible therapeutics such as the use of bisphosphonates to replace the missing pyrophosphate this is changing the balance back in the favor of preventing soft tissue calcification in general it would therefore seem that this equation is quite straightforward and therefore could be applied to diseases such as athletic locis as seen here by this calcified blood vessel Alzheimer's disease as seen by these calcific nodules in a patient with neural degeneration cancer such as these calcific nodules on a mammogram in a patient with breast cancer heterotopic ossification as seen in this patient who has suffered muscle injury and of course diseases such as pxe the purpose of this discussion is to highlight a very critical element that is often left out of the research and the clinical equation specifically tissue injury injury appears to be an absolutely essential part of this overall equation for example patients with calcific atherosclerosis most commonly have an underlying condition either genetic dietary or environmental or hypertension for example that first causes tissue injury to the blood vessel and it then forms these calcific nodules this is known to be the case for Alzheimer's disease as neural degeneration always precedes calcification and cancer which is considered to be an ever healing wound or a chronic tissue injury also precedes the calcification within the cancerous tissue and heterotopic ossification is one of the most clear examples of injury preceding the heterotopic ossification in that the muscle that turns into bone is first injured or goes under hypoxia essentially like having a heart attack this is incredibly important when we consider all the ways to modify risk in diseases of soft tissue calcification to highlight the importance of soft tissue injury I will present you a very simple experiment that we and others have performed using mice specifically what we do is is we alter the diet in these mice in a manner that by this equation should drive soft tissue calcification specifically we provide these mice with a very high phosphate diet which makes the circulating calcium and phosphate go way above saturation and a good again should cause these calcific nodules everywhere however surprisingly when we look at the soft tissues in particular in this case using a CT in which the muscle if it has calcification shows up what's odd is is that in normal mice we don't find any soft tissue calcification but when we go back to these experiments and consider tissue injury and we modify it we have a very significant different result one way to do this in mice is to perform these experiments in a mouse that has do Shane's muscular dystrophy the best way to think of these mice is is that they that every time they contract a muscle they injure their injured that muscle essentially they have continuous skeletal muscle injury so when we take these mice and we put them on that same diet as you can see these mice very rapidly develop calcification of the injured tissues in their body importantly the only soft tissues that become calcified are the muscle in then that's the spot that the deschenes muscular dystrophy causes that tissue injury we have the same results if we just take normal mice and we injure tissues is as we can do it to a point that we drive calcification of that tissue so going back towards the ingredients realize that tissue injury is an essential part of these diseases this therefore suggest that the most common way to develop soft tissue calcification is to have a problem on one side of the equation in combination with a tissue injury it also suggests that one potential way to prevent soft tissue calcification even an injured tissue is to use therapeutics which improve the protective side such as bisphosphonates using that theory this is exactly what you see these are the deschenes mice without bisphosphonates and a high phosphate diet compared to deschenes mice with bisphosphonates and the same high phosphate diet showing protection of soft tissue calcification despite the continuous muscle injury thus one way to balance the equation is to supplement one side of the equation additionally understanding that tissue injury is an important ingredient allows for the development of even more ways of preventing soft tissue calcification for example what if we were to either prevent injury or as often injury is not preventable provide ways of improving the healing tissue we recently conducted these experiments using the same model I presented before and found that if we gave drugs or pharmaceuticals that improve muscle healing we are able to also prevent soft tissue calcification essentially this means that we are taking the tissue injury out of the equation so in summary of these two webinars I propose that the main ingredients that we should focus on in regards to coming up with a comprehensive means of preventing soft tissue calcification in patients with pseudos in San doma elastic um is to balance diet regarding calcium phosphate and potentially magnesium optimize gut function assure proper kidney function assure proper endocrine function optimize the pyrophosphate pump and supplement it if needed and to avoid tissue injury to best understand what I mean by this realize that tissue injury comes in many many forms the most obvious is direct injury but tissue injury also comes most commonly from chronic diseases such as diabetes environmental exposures such as smoking infection cancer and the unfortunate inevitable aging these principles are already being used in other diseases of soft tissue calcification such as athletic A's in which we optimize cardiovascular health treating with statins lowering cholesterol treating hypertension all of which function to reduce vascular injury same as Alzheimer's disease in which we provide medications to slow the tissue injury within the brain and cancer in which we use surgery chemotherapy radiation therapy etc to treat the cancer and in heterotopic ossification in which we give drugs to try to improve muscle regeneration this brings up a point that I would like to challenge the other researchers and the community of pxe to consider that is why is there a tropism of calcification to the areas of the body that we see in these patients such as the skin the eyes and the blood vessels the question comes up about this is what is that tissue injury and how do we optimize treatments to make it so that we could potentially improve healing of that tissue or prevent injury of that tissue to make it so that we do not develop calcification within that tissue so again in summary I would propose that list listing off the ingredients i have here provides a great rationale for dell developing protocols that shift the balance of this soft tissue calcification equation towards prevention finally and one very important point i would like to make is is that many of the diseases that cause chronic tissue injury we now understand are genetic mutations examples of this are genetic problems with management of cholesterol for example we know that these patients have increased vascular disease which predisposes them to atlas chlorosis for example from this logic it would only make sense that patients with pseudo xanthoma elastic um who also have a genetic mutation of cholesterol synthesis for example would more likely rapidly develop calcific atlas grossest to this extent it may be beneficial to screen patients with pseudo xanthoma elastic um for other diseases known to be associated with chronic tissue injury so with this and the other webinar I hope that this presents a global way of looking at how we can manage calcium and phosphate in these patients and more importantly from these examples I gave today is understanding that I do believe we need to come up with the theories as to why patients with pxe have a tropism for calcification within the areas that they do how we could prevent that and how we could also potentially give medications to improve the regeneration of this tissue so this does not happen I really look forward to this discussion and thank you very much again for this opportunity Thank You Jonathan that that was a wonderful ending to the whole series and lots lots more to think about I want to ask you a question about soft tissue that usually we don't associate with pxe but I'm hearing it every once in a while and we have a question about it one attendee asks says that she's working with a physical therapist on her painful hips and she's been told she has adhesions around the hip flexors and they need to be broken down with a foam roller which is very painful and she's wondering if you have any opinions on whether that would be good or bad to actually break those down and I'm assuming they are calcific right so that is a that is a fantastic question and the best way to think through this is that tissue injury is in this situation is balanced by how good you are at regenerating that tissue which is why presented for example in the mice when we give a medication to improve the muscle regeneration were able to prevent further calcification from developing so the thing is is that if you're under a physical therapy protocol in which you are breaking up scar tissue which essentially was a failure of the tissue regeneration in the first place and you are able to optimize the healing process after that we do find that patients tend to get their range of motion back and they can do well with it but it absolutely must be the the full extent you have to do everything you have to make sure that you do the therapy afterwards make sure you have a good diet during that time to absolutely optimize that tissue of healing back to what it should be the problem is is if you do that physical therapy and break up the adhesions and you don't continue to move the hip it will come back and come back worse because you added more tissue injury on top of it so that that brings up the question how would what how would you want optimize the healing process to to be able to achieve the goal of of not causing more calcification at this point what we do know in our models and this is all all of this I have to say is in mice I can't jump and say what we're doing in humans what we have found is is that in animal models that tend to develop soft tissue calcification is is that if we either limit phosphate or give bisphosphonates at the time of the injury is is we can prevent the calcification of occurring during the healing process in addition if we give medications or a diet and the best diet always is a good cardiovascular diet that is low in red meats etc is is that it optimizes the tissue healing and then of course avoiding smoking if you have diabetes having it under control etc thank you so um you said that optimizing a diet would be the one of the best ways to enhance tissue healing and the precedent then for that you mentioned it in the context of the balance of calcium and phosphorus it is the best it you just said now the best is the heart-healthy diet is that the one that you would recommend absolutely so the I mean we have these animal studies that we do with that and and we're not the only ones if you look through the literature there's not a medication that comes close to adding to longevity for example than a quote good diet most of those diets what it boils down to is this unfortunately for many of us eating is actually an injury and I know that sounds funny but when you eat red meat that feeling that you get afterwards where you feel lethargic etc is giving your whole entire body essentially what we call an acute phase response that is much like being in a car accident going running etc whereas other foods in particular the more white meats but then more importantly more of a vegetarian diet are no not to cause this and so what we're learning is is that if you're on a heart unhealthy diet or you smoke for example is every time that you eat you get a bolus of inflammation through your body that essentially causes injury to all of your tissues and really can confuse a healing prom Jonathan am I still there now I hear you yeah okay for my orthopedic patients for example we talked about this a lot for elective surgeries in particular zyzz trying to get to a very good diet low in red meats on with our mice we know what makes a huge difference and i would say that just that you know for life in general is that's the way to go it's not as fun but so do I understand correctly that you are saying eating at all is an injury creating an injury that's absolutely right so it eating it all is but the thing is is that the injury is is incredibly variable so if you go and eat a burger for example and you measure what happens when you go for a great examples you go for a run not only do you have endorphins that circulate but you also have a little of what's called interleukin 6 or I'll six with circulates in your body that signifies to your body that you had an injury being you ran and you need to optimize blood vessels and the best thing about exercise is if you do that cyclically if you do that for an hour a day as that goes up and comes back down it promotes your body to stay healthy the problem is is that when you eat or when you smoke you get a continuous release of that interleukin-6 and it really gets in the way of the normal cycle of tissue being injured and healing and so the problem is with meat in particular is you get a much much bigger bolus of that what's interesting is is that if you add certain other things to it for example avocado it actually cuts that reaction down to about half as I give talks about this it's been fun so many people will send me pictures of the big burger with avocado all over it but it their you really can and and most of you already know this if you go have a huge steak for the next two to three hours you feel awful well what that is is the interleukin 6 traveling around your body and it's equivalent of going for like a 10-mile run but you're not getting the benefit of the run you are not it's not directed and fish and chicken and pork activate that system much less and you know if you look on one of my favorite things is looking on TED Talks I love those talks there's a talk on there and how to live to a hundred and they really go into this on theirs is that they discussed that all of the areas in the world where people live the longest it's all vegetarian food all of them thank you we've got a long question from someone she says you set the challenge to other researchers to answer the question why is there tropism to the specific area seen in pxe this seems to be assuming that it is a tissue injury is that the only explanation for soft tissue calcification to be triggered that it's an injury no and that's why I'm bringing this up is that you know I come into this whole entire field from a completely different way and that is is that I'm an orthopedic surgeon and everything that my patients come to me with and everything I do to my patients is a tissue injury and so my initial interest in soft tissue calcification was that however as you get into this field what you realize is that the body is so well protected when tissue is not injured even in cases of like it you know pseudo xanthoma elastic um for example and the research that we're about to perform is taking those animals and showing that if you injure their tissue the rate of soft tissue calcification goes sky-high a great example of this is what the researchers are finding in regards to a flow sclerosis in those mice if you notice what they tend to have to do to drive athos chlorosis and those mice is given additional injury now I'm not talking about going and squeezing a blood vessel what I'm referring to is is they put them on a genetic background that's susceptible to Atlas chlorosis being the apoe background which causes a problem a fatty deposition and injury to the vessel wall and the parts in which I find very interesting is if you really look at skin for example it would appear that the areas that patients get calcification are in the areas of where there's the greatest motion around the shoulders the neck etc this uh what we all have to remember is gravity is an injury is is that every time that we take a step we put Michael micro fractures in our bones which actually is good that we remodel them very fast same is true with skin when you stretch skin it causes an injury and that process continually remodels and my best guess is is that is probably why those areas have a tropism the same can be you know said in regards to the whiskers on mice for examples as movement causes chronic injury hair follicles or an injury and so I think that there's many ways that we can test this but overall my feeling is is is that that that is absolutely part of this equation and that if we do figure out that part or we do have medicines that help improve skin healing for example is is that we will have a way to at least slow the process of the calcification thanks someone asked a follow-up question in that this vein she said she developed a painful not on her knee and went to an orthopedic surgeon an orthopedist and was told that she had bursitis and somehow it had calcified and this person has pxe so do you think that you know that is not normally sort of a problem that we associate with pxe but this could be because could this be that because this person has pxe and that was an injury yes I mean I the the research were about to do as soon as we we've been waiting to get a hold of the mice from the widow group if they're on here I can tease them a little bit there they're mice have mites and so they're mice are dirty and so we're ready to do you know the orthopedic lab here we have set up as we do all these tissue injuries from every type of musculoskeletal tissue and that's the exciting part of what we're about to do is we're going to take all the principles that we've done before for example we're going to take these mice and put them on the deschenes background and our best guess is what we're going to see is is that any musculoskeletal tissue that we injure will end up developing at least micro calcification if not complete h/o like what you see in the mice that I showed here this question sounds way out there but i'm going to ask it is there any connection between pxe calcification and losing having problems or trouble losing weight pxe calcifications and losing weight can you can you be a little more specific um she just says her metabolism is four percent more efficient than the average American but she's unable to lose weight she eats a completely vegetarian diet just wondering if there's any connection that you could see um not right off the bat I would have to really think about that one the question would be whether or not they're all she also has an endocrine dysfunction and I bring that up because you know we often the with the screen I have up there we often try to jump to the you know tree and not look at the forest what I would suggest to anybody who is doing all the right things in terms of diet exercise etc who can't lose weight is to have their endocrine system evaluated I can tell you from a personal experience not in terms of necessarily weight but my wife went through something similar and right away we found it fixed it and everything healed up that's why I really think when you look at what I have up here on the screen is there are really easy ways to evaluate all the things I have up there especially endocrine kidney gut and diet and that's what i would suggest especially if you're having a hard time losing weight when you don't think you should that's a that's a great answer in a gives a you know credence to the idea of the whole the whole system being important here um we have another question about kidney stone since gut and kidney are key in the formation of calcium oxalate kidney stones due to the failure of oxalate and calcium to bind in the gut and instead binding in the calcium forming the stones is there any correlation between this and got kidney portions of soft tissue calcification in regards to the kidney stones related to other soft tissue house implications yeah and particularly could it be caused or enhanced by P exceed at that point I would think so I can't say whether or not that has been tested yet the thing is is that what I want to highlight here is this I spent years studying a calcification and what I'll tell you is is that and this is true in the pxe community in terms of the research the output that you get in these mice the microcalcifications there did difficult to measure their difficult to quantify one of the best advice that I ever had when I was doing my graduate work was anytime you study anything always try to study it more out of control and when you say more out of control really what it comes down to is adding more tissue injury so in order to answer these questions what I would propose to anybody studying these is to take the model that you're studying and make it more out of control a good example of that is what we did with the do Shane's originally we were just crushing muscle and we saw a micro calcification but in order to increase the signal on what we saw we went to the deschenes model similar is true with all these other diseases such as the vascular disease in pxe is again researchers have done really well by adding the apoe on top of it the same would be true at looking at calcification within the renal aspect of this for calcium phosphate depositions or calcium oxalate within kidney is is to make sure that that studied on a model that doesn't necessarily give the stones but puts it just to the point of going over the top to see if a pxe mutation would end up being the thing that would push it over I think that's going to be the main way we'll be able to figure that out fast otherwise we just have to study the Natural History in patients I'm glad you mentioned that because I'm going to give a big push for filling out our new survey at the end of your presentation at the end of this other questions here that's where we're going to learn all about the natural history and about all the different things and conditions that people with pxe have I've heard of people saying my muscles someone some doctor told me my muscles are like cement that isn't something we hear all the time but right in the context of what you're saying it could very well be due to the fact is this correct that they have pxe and had an injury yes I I am I believe the problem is is when most people look for heterotopic ossification they're looking for extreme cases like I showed however just like the reason why we do mammogram is that they're most of the heterotopic ossification is actually micro calcification and so the thing is is that a typical x-ray more likely would not pick up that necessarily there have to be a little bit more specific tools used to look for it but we should be able to answer this pretty soon as soon as we're able to get rid of the mites from the mice speaking of the micro castle calcifications you had a slide of a mammogram of someone with cancer who had microcalcifications in her breast and we have studied that in pxe and found that most women with PFC have those microcalcifications and for the most part they're not cancer from so that's uh just to let people listening to the weather that's that's important and I want to make a point about that that's very important to understand this is like what I have listed on this slide tissue injury comes in all forms and so the thing is again just living is a tissue injury and so I used the cancer as a another way of saying tissue injury out of control like we do with our mice but the thing is is that all of your tissue and crit including the interstitial tissue of breast is injured all the time and so the thing is is that what that more than likely represents is just continuous injury to the normal tissue that's their cancer puts it over the top because it's a continuous injury but i agree with you as i want to make sure that that is emphasized here just because you have calcification with in breast tissue does not mean that you have cancer it means that they're likely is an injury in that area but it doesn't have to be from cancer and again maybe PFC is the is somehow providing that injury process men's testicles pretty much across the board according to our small study have microcalcifications as well and it's not testicular cancer right one more question about diet and you mentioned meat and it's still you know it's a injurious effect what about dairy in terms of the amount of calcium and phosphate that you get from it or you you were you were saying red meat in particular give him I see great great question so um what I can tell you about the area's is it definitely does not have the same bolus of of the aisle six that that's produced that meat does there are two reasons and we don't know which one it is as to why meet in particular is worse one of the first is the easiest except for it hasn't been proven and that is that the greatest source in your body of il-6 is muscle it's a way that the body communicates to the rest of the body that they need you need more oxygen so what happens is when you go get a good workout and you quote feel the burn you just gave your entire body a huge bolus of interleukin-6 or il-6 what it effectively does is go to your liver and release all kinds of wonderful factors that are important for tissue regeneration and to promote new blood vessels and so the thing is is that that's how you get in shape is that system mice that don't have il-6 have a hard time getting in shape and so the thing is is that if you eat meat what we don't know is that if the il-6 from the meat that you ate is what's giving you that bolus or whether or not the actual construction of the muscle itself within your gut is injuring your gut and your gut muscle is releasing the aisle six that is not known that's the main reason so far that we know as to why a meat diet seems to cause more of an inflammatory response than other foods I think that's all of our questions someone commented there's been really great to get a different sense of what is meant by injury you've really expanded our outlook on that we really appreciate the insight you give them the new insight you give to pxe and PFC research I am going to put up a final slide if there's no more questions we have a 20th anniversary meeting coming up it's in October and since I can't see the slide I can't exactly tell the date it's but I would like you to think about coming and joining us it will be partially a research meeting as well with researchers there to tell you about the latest knowledge on all the things we're learning with pxe the this webinar and Jonathan's previous webinar are already previous webinars all they're already up to the to view and we carry sent everyone in the audience a link to view the previous webinar and this one will probably be up to view within a week so you can see that from our website and I wanted to plug the pxe help survey it's you can start it right on the homepage of our website it is a very extensive questionnaire asking you about your pxe and all about the rest of your health too we're trying to get a bigger picture of all the manifestations that people with pxe have to find out you know just anything we can find out everything you can tell us will be important there in understanding the natural history of the disease and helping us be ready for clinical trials of treatments that it sounds like are not too far away so dr. shawn Achor with that I want to thank you for again presenting with us you are very understandable a great teacher and what I've enjoyed listening to your presentation so thank you for being with us and thank you all the guests for your great questions and for being with us as well thank you for the opportunity you're welcome with that I will end the webinar thank you everyone for coming",

H a which is a primary component of the synovial fluid in healthy joints can help reduce pain and increase joint function in patients with osteoarthritis a che is a large polymer composed of repeating disaccharide units the average AJ chain contains 10,000 disaccharide repeats and has a molecular mass between 200,000 and 10,000,000 dolls the network of a che that surrounds cells provides a molecular scaffold for many components of the extracellular matrix a che has unique biomechanical properties it acts as both a lubricant and a shock absorber within the joint in addition to its biomechanical properties a che has many biochemical activities including regulation of pain tissue homeostasis and inflammation binding of a che to nerve cells reduces their sensitivity and ability to respond to pain stimuli a che helps maintain normal joint structure and promotes healing by regulating chondrocyte growth and viability and by stimulating synthesis of articular cartilage components such as collagen proteoglycans and AJ the biochemical activities of a che are regulated by H a binding to the cd44 receptor which is expressed by many cell types including chondrocytes synovial sites and inflammatory cells importantly the cellular responses to H a binding varied depending on its molecular mass in osteoarthritis affected joints the concentration and molecular weight of h a is reduced as a result of decreased synthesis and increased activity of matrix degrading enzymes which occur in response to chronic inflammation these low molecular weight H a fragments cannot maintain the mechanical integrity of the joint leading to increase friction reduced function and pain in addition small AJ fragments promote inflammation by stimulating production of inflammatory cytokines and matrix degrading enzymes research suggests that the differently sized AJ molecules may affect receptor organization and the ability to activate specific signaling pathways by cells longer AJ fragments like those found in healthy tissues block receptor activation whereas shorter AJ fragments allow receptors to cluster together and initiate a cellular response H a suppresses production and activity of matrix degrading enzymes that cause tissue damage inhibits inflammatory cytokines that cause swelling and pain and blocks movement of inflammatory cells that perpetuate the immune response the unique combination of biomechanical and biochemical properties makes H a an important molecule for maintaining joint health you you", "DsgAUMB3lZ0": "(lively, bouncy music) - Frozen shoulder, or its other\nterm, adhesive capsulitis, is a relatively common condition affecting typically women between ages of 40 and 60, that comes on for no good reason. Frozen shoulder is classically\ndescribed in three phases. The first phase is known\nas the freezing phase. Clinically patients\ncomplain primarily of pain at that point, and not so much stiffness. The second phase is the frozen phase, and at that point, pain\nactually often diminishes, but the shoulder can be markedly stiff. Patients will eventually\nenter the thawing phase, and in many cases, frozen\nshoulder or adhesive capsulitis is a self-limiting condition,\nmeaning that eventually it does get better, sometimes\ncompletely on its own. But that process can take\nsometimes up to two years or more, but if you can make that diagnosis early, which can be tough, you may be able to avoid that process of stiffness. I would recommend as a first step seeing your primary care doctor\nand discussing the problem, and at that point, the\nnext step may be referral to physical therapy or even\nevaluation by an orthopedist. (soft, bouncy music) At the first visit, a patient\ncan expect, first of all, and perhaps most importantly,\na thorough history. That's critical to making\nan accurate diagnosis. Secondly is a thorough physical\nexamination of the shoulder. And generally between the\nhistory and the physical examination, you should have a good sense of what's going on. (soft, bouncy music) So in terms of treatment,\nfor patients who are in that initial freezing phase,\ninflammatory phase, or having a lot of pain, anti-inflammatory\nmedication can be helpful. Gentle, and I think the key\nis gentle physical therapy, either under the direction of\na skilled physical therapist or sometimes even just\nself-directed at home, can be beneficial to help\nmaintain range of motion. We also routinely employ\nthe use of intra-articular corticosteroid injections,\nwhich is an injection of corticosteroid that's done\ndirectly into the shoulder joint, so if the patient\nis not getting better over a certain period of time, they may be a candidate for\nsome type of intervention. A surgical procedure\nis actually performed, it's called an arthroscopic\ncapsular release, so the procedure's done arthroscopically through small incisions,\nand what's actually done is under arthroscopic visualization,\nthe stiff and fibrotic capsule is actually cut and released. Bottom line is you have shoulder pain, and it's affecting your daily living, I think it's time to get checked out, initially, perhaps by your\nprimary care physician, but certainly if the pain's\npersisting and it seems like something is going\non and it's not just getting better on its own, it may be time to get checked out by orthopedics.

rub it in like that as you can see it does disappear pretty well I still have a lot more product on my hand which I'm not going to waste if it rubber them pretty well and it gives a really soothing feeling my waffles are relaxed also again there's an aloe in this which is great aloe is soothing it's moisturizing it's really really great for your skin it's a natural ingredient I appreciate say natural ingredients and all things that I use so that's good to know also there is no odor it's odorless so people without breasts are a little bit older it's probably best that a pod like this does not have any strong fragrances it can cause them to be sensitive to the fragrance it can be like a little bit overbearing so it doesn't have any of that if the pouch is the size of a small toothpaste pouch I'm gonna just measure for you again so you can see is it's about the length of a pin and you can set it up like that on your countertop or wherever it's definitely portable I would say it's small enough to put it in a bag but you're not gonna want to take this with you maybe less you're going to gym or vacation it's not meant to be put you know rub University doctor hands so that's it's just not that kind of a product but again it's really great temporary relief which means that if you still feel pain your pencil krisis you can use a little bit more again this is not going to substitute you having to see a doctor if there's really something wrong it's for minor aches and pains small sprays a little bit of a neck ache so there's that so it's the pain care on writers cramp all righty and thank you for ever listening I hope that you found this information really helpful [Music]", "ou-rS_e8Hrc": "and I did not want to be cut up I wanted to have some alternate treatment and still get well and I would say that my knees before I could not walk up and down stairs because i would get swollen i do not have any school now and this after about three and a half months after my first treatment i'm back for a little booster shot I could wake up about four times a night because my knees would just ate terribly at night and now i wake up at all and i just had a wonderful experience i would say my knee function is probably about eighty percent of what it was when i was a young chick today I'm having a little extra point in so I can just get a little maybe good maybe up to 85 or 90 percent and today i also had lombard treatment because i am a pencil to let you know how that goes but i am totally pleased dr.

"x32R55wpd2k": "how's it going today I want to talk about Mary's medicinals transdermal patches I have tried two of them this THC indica 20 milligram and also a THC a I don't have a little packaging for it I didn't get the packaging for it I was able to try these as samples so I did not pay through these but it's also not sponsored from the company it's just because I work at a dispensary and they wanted me to be able to try this out so I could see how I felt slash helped decide if we want to get them in so this is completely an honest review not at all biased by the fact that I got it for free the THC indica one is the one I'm going to start off with it's the one that I tried first I applied it on my wrist so you're supposed to you know wash your skin and put it on an area with a lot of veins whether that be the top of your foot or the inside of your wrist I noticed that I had like an easier area on my wrist I was gonna try one on my foot but I wanted to make sure I got the best possible result from it and I want I figured doing it in the same spot would give me you know a good idea on the day that I tried the THC 20 milligram indica patch I just gotten dry needling trigger point therapy so my back and my jaw were just really really agitated and PS if you haven't tried trigger point therapy and you had back spasms really amazing and I stress out in my jaw so he would do them in my jaw too and it was awesome anyway back to the patch so on that day I was feeling really really beaten up because we had done more needles than we ever had before so I got home and washed my wrist applied the patch my manager told me that the 20 milligram patch is basically like 200 milligrams it's just slow release so ah the effects from it 2030 minutes in when I was just like sitting I think I might have been on my computer like right here and I just noticed that I wasn't really feeling anything I was like oh that's awesome and then I started to move and I still did feel some pain when I was moving in spotlight I mean I'm not necessarily pain it was just like agitation you know like soreness so I still felt some of it but it was significantly dulled so and I had heard that my general manager he had tried a patch and really didn't like it he didn't notice anything so I feel like if you have pre moderate to severe pain it's really a great way of reducing it significantly if you need to move around I mean it you don't have to be high you don't have to be eating edibles like it's just something you put on your skin and you can move around and significantly significantly dull the pain it doesn't eliminate it when you're moving but I like I said when I was just like sitting there I was like oh I'm not really feeling anything and when I laid down you know it was just my body was at peace I didn't feel soreness I didn't feel tension in my jaw I'm actually feeling that right now um I really like the idea of these patches and I think they did a good job the 200 milligram I definitely felt more it and it's extended release so it's like 12 hours and I would say the first few hours were definitely like more obvious as far as the dullness so the pain I guess did kind of increase throughout the day or like come back to normal throughout the day or rare was but it it didn't go back to before I had the patch on 20 milligram I believe worked better than the 10 gram but that is I feel like potentially biased because I tried the 20 milligram before the 10 milligram so I would suggest trying the 10 before going to the 20 why not just test out the 10 and if the 10 works have the 20 for the days that you really really need it as far as just like the experience of it one thing I don't like is I wore the patch a couple of days ago and I've showered a few times I've used I've used a so you can really see it there a um loofah no not loofah stone like a foot scrubbing stone whatever that is I can't think of it right now I've used it lightly on my skin to try to get the adhesive off a couple of times and it's it looks like it comes off and then it doesn't so that's one thing that's kind of a bummer as it does leave adhesive if I had some living in a central oil or I really really cared to get it off I'm sure I could I just not into agitating my skin super bad I was one thing that I was kind of like oh but when he's I mean it's a patch and you're sticking on your skin and this this is the edges like where all the dirt and stuff gets under so I don't think that's anything they can really there's anything they can really do about that unless you want it to stick not as good which I would prefer it to stay on first patch I felt like I felt more but I definitely did feel the second patch dull my pain I think it was also because I placed it better the second time then the first time the first time I had it like overlapping farther over here which there's not you know a vein over there but the second time I got it really well on it and actually the first time I was noted I was like worried about getting it in the creases of my wrist this time I was more focused on getting it over the veins and it I mean it was clearly over the creases of my wrist I don't at first that would be like not a good thing but it didn't seem to matter because again I mean I definitely felt the 10 milligram which I wasn't sure that I would so that's how I fear about feel about mary's medicinals the moderate to severe pain I definitely think they're an excellent way of reducing pain not necessarily completely eliminating it during movement or necessarily the whole time but I mean it's it's still really really incredible for what it is and what it can do it's a plus I really like it okay", "dt2zPOQNNWw": "the use of topical or creams in the

Vernon Williams offered her away to freeze away the pain it's called focused cold therapy that focused cold therapy allows us to reduce the temperature of a peripheral nerve to a very precise own doctors locate the nerve that's responsible for the pain they then numb the area and insert a cold probe with liquid nitrous oxide to freeze the nerve and that results in just turning that nerve off temporarily so it is unable to send pain signals the cold therapy reaches negative 120 degrees it doesn't damage surrounding tissues and doesn't kill the nerve the relief lasts a few months Abby

biosciences and today in our session we are going to talk about how can we develop a robust and scalable culture platform either for expansion and neural induction of human piripotent stem cells in suspension culture so human pluripotent stem cells have been thoroughly studied in the past few years so they are very special because they for once for for one they can self-renewal and on the other the on the other side they can also differentiate into any type of cell of the human body so we have two main sources of human purpose stem cells the first ones are the embryonic stem cells which are derived from the inner cell mass of the embryo and the other ones are the induced pluripotent stem cells or ips cells so these cells are derived from somatic cells that are reprogrammed back to a an embryonic state like so this cell can be cultured either as pluripotent stem cells in the in the in the lab or they can be differentiated so and especially ips cells have great advantages because they can be used towards a myriad of applications so since we can derive the cell from a patient with a specific disease we can use the cells to study the disease in vitro they also can be used for drug efficacy and safety testing or even in the in the future for organ replacement therapy however in order to use these cells for any of these applications we still need to do something which is we need to obtain large numbers of cells and also we need to be able to differentiate them into pure poor populations so for that we can use three main culture systems in the lab so the most classical one is the monolayer which is basically when we have cells attached to a substrate that is used for cellular attachment so in this system we have a uniform replication of the stimuli so all of the cells are sensing the same stimuli at the same time but we have a small problem which is achieving high cell yields because we do have a limit to surface area available for cells to grow so to surpass this micro carriers were introduced so these are small particles that can be coated with the same substrates to promote cellular attachment and that allows us to scale up the production of the cells by increasing the surface area still we are we need we need to be concerned about the low addition percentages that we may have using this cell and to use them in in another applications we still need to remove the micro carriers which will add additional um steps on the downstream processing so and at the same time we have more steps and we have increased costs to obtain the cells so to surpass this spheroids have emerged in the last few years so here we basically have cells attached to each other which uh gives the the cells 3d confirmations so uh in in here we are able to better mimic the in vivo environment so and as we are not depending on the surface area available we also can achieve high cell yields at a more cost efficient uh manner since we do not have to to add uh further steps on the downstream processing or we do not do not have to to to buy the substrates or the micro carriers still in the system our limitation is related with the transport which arises from size limitations so in here when we have aggregates that are bigger than 300 to 400 micrometers in diameter we may start to observe some necrotic centers as the oxygen and nutrients failed to reach the center of the the aggregate and the metabolites and um and other gases fail to exit the aggregate so there's one thing that we need to be concerned about so and in this session the first part of the work is to be able to achieve large numbers of pluripotent stem cells in suspension culture in a robust and scalable way so for that we use two we use two um platforms so the first one is the orbital shaker so we have a culture plate inside a on top of the shaker and the agitation will promote uh homogeneity in the culture medium and at the same time in the average diameter of the of the aggregates so also by using the the six well culture plates we are working with smaller working volumes which allows us to screen a large number of conditions at the same time but still we wanted to scale up this up to a bioreactor so for that we use the pbs biotech by reactors which has a rotation uh controlled by magnetic coupling that exists between the vertical wheel impeller that it's like an amster wheel impeller and the base unit so the shear stress produced by this bioreactor will be lower than the ones produced by for example a spinner flask and another advantage is that we are working with single-use vessels so uh it's easier to do the process over and over again uh also for this the two systems we used stem skills so stem scale is a newly developed culture media especially designed for the expansion of human purputen stem cells as suspension culture so we wanted to prove that this medium would be robust enough to allow us to culture the cells under these conditions so to start we use the article shaker this shaker the culture plates in the shaker had working volumes between 2 and 4 ml per well and we used the sitting density of 150 cells per ml so to do this testing what we did is that we seated the cells as a single cell suspension we let the cells let the cells grow for up to five days to ensure that they do not pass the 400 micrometer limit and we do this for the first passage and then we dissociate the cells and replace them again as a single cell suspension and we do this for over for three passages so we analyze the results at each passage and at the end of the three passages so the first thing that we were able to observe and the most important in this type of culture is that there were no uh aggregate agglomeration so this uh occurs most times when the culture media isn't uh robust enough to to be able to to keep the aggregate separated so we want to to ensure that we have a population of aggregates as homogeneous as possible uh and in this case we were able to to to to have them so we took several photos we also used two different cell lines so we used the gibco episomal ips cells and we used the tc lab which is our in-house ips cell line so we analyzed the the photos that we took at each passage and we we studied the behavior of the aggregate diameter so as we can see we have narrow populations of of aggregates either between the deep collapse and the tc lab and we can see that we have an increase in the aggregate diameter at the last passage at p3 but that's mainly because that's the only day that that's the only passage that we let cells grow for five days instead of four so nevertheless uh it's very important that we didn't have any aggregate agglomeration but besides the homogeneity of the population we also wanted to assess if the cells were growing so for that we counted the cell that each passage and we can see that there's an increase in fall change at each passage that goes up to 8.2 fold in only 5 days so this would lead after 3 passages which were 14 days to a community full change up to 140 fold which is pretty good but we we do not want only the cells to be there we want them to be healthy so we tested if the cells were remained viable and we were able to to have high percentages of cell viability for both cell lines for every passage that we tested also we wanted to observe if the cells were still pluripotent so one analysis that we performed was to replace the cells at the end of passage three and assess the pluripotency via immunophytochemistry by staining them for the pluripotency marker opt for and as you can see almost all of the cells if not all of the cells are still positive for oct4 so even then uh one important thing when we are trying some long-term uh culture of pluripotent stem cells especially is to verify if the the cells are stable so for that we use the karyostat essay which um which allows us to assess the genomic stability of purpose and stem cell lines and so we tested samples after three passages for both cell lines and as you can see there is no chromosomal aberrations found so the the cells remain stable so we verified that we could use the stem scale as a great culture media to expand the cells in the orbital shaker and next we wanted to verify if we were able to use this for a scalable platform such as the pbs by reactor so for that we use the pdf 0.1 mac which has a working volume of 100 ml and we use the same sitting density and the same protocols the only difference here is that for each passage we establish the limit of five days for for every passage um dissociating the cells and seeing them again so at the first glance we can see that the population appears to be even more homogeneous than the ones that we obtain in the orbital shaker and we were able to verify that by doing the aggregate diameter distribution so we can see that the distribution is very narrow and it's pretty similar between each passage and between each cell line so and we also observed that average diameter did not surpass the 400 limits which uh it was our goal uh and that diameters that we obtained were pretty similar for both conditions and for each passage and again importantly we did not observe any aggregate agglomeration again we also wanted to assess if the cells were able to grow efficiently and in this case in the pbs bioreactor we were able to obtain a full change up to 9.3 fold in only 5 days which would lead at the end of three passages or in this case 15 days to a cumulative full change that goes up to 664 fold also when checking cell viability there was high cell viability with more than 92 percent of viable cells in every passage for both cell lines and in this case we also wanted to assess as we are are working with aggregates if the aggregates were indeed viable so what we did uh was a live debt essay where we we could see that the majority of cells within the aggregates are alive and the the cell death that we observe is not significant so and at the end of three passages we also assessed if the cells were still pluripotent first via flow cytometry by standing for oct4 and there was still a high percentage of octfor's positive cells after the three passages which was further confirmed by replating the cells and staining them for up for and analyzing them via immunophytochemistry so after the three passages this replated cells still express oct4 and again as we do in long-term culture of cell we also analyze the karyotype and there like in the orbital shaker there was also no chromosomal aberrations found just to finish up we also wanted to to compare our samples from the orbital shaker and bbs by reactor uh with ipscs control to verify to confirm that the cells were still pluripotent so we use the pluri test which compares the transcriptional profile of a sample to a reference set that has more than 450 cell types and tissues so as you can see for both cell lines and for both uh orbital shaker and pbs bioreactor the cells uh passed the pluri test which means that they are still pluripotent so by gathering all this data we confirm that the stem scale is not only suitable for suspension culture of human purpose and stem cells but it's also one of the greatest options that we currently have even for scalable conditions such as spinner flash for example or in this case the pbs by reactor since it's capable of achieving high cell yields while maintaining uh the cells in a pluripotent state and with a stable karyotype so this was the first part of our work and next we wanted to verify not if the cells were able to expand as pluripotent stem cells but if we could create a scalable process that will allow us to induce the pluripotent stem cells into the neural lineage so to do that we first start with an endurance pluripotent stem cell culture we incubate them with acutase to obtain a suspen uh suspension uh with of single cells and then we generate the uh the pluripotent stem cell aggregates so and from then uh we go to the neural precursor cells but there's only one small thing about this is that the initial diameter of the pluripotent stem cells will be crucial towards the efficiency of derivation especially for the the neural induction so we have previously determined that optimal conditions to induce cells towards the neural lineage was to use uh hypotenuse stem cell aggregates with an average diameter of 150 micrometers so with those aggregates and in only five seven days we would be able to to generate pure populations of neural precursor cells so we wanted to do this not only um at a culture plate level but at a spinner flask level so for that we use the selfster witson a hundred ml spinner flasks with a working volume of html and to induce the cells towards the neural lineage we used the gib cochlear protein stem cell neural induction medium so this is a serum free culture medium that provides high efficiency neural induction so it's a rapid induction it's scalable and allows us to generate high quality neural precursor cells so this was designed for 2d culture but we were able to adapt it to to 3d culture in the spinner class so i have here some of the the photos that we took during the neural induction and the first thing that we can observe is that by day zero we have the pluripotent aggregates which are around uh and have a homogeneous limit but uh at day one we do have some some structures arising so the aggregate starts to to blep and then uh smaller aggregates are released from the the larger ones and by days six and seven we almost can't can see any of the original aggregates but instead we have smaller structures smaller aggregates spread it all over the spinner flask and one curious thing about this medium is that when we use for example the mb27 which is the culture medium that we classically used um for the dual smart inhibition protocol at day six of induction we still have the round shaped aggregates with a denser center but we what we see after the six seven days of induction using the the name the neural induction medium is that we do have some differentiation structures that resemble a picobasilly polarized tissue characteristic of the neural cells and another great thing of using this uh this medium the denim is that uh using the mb27 b227 we usually obtain after six days a 3.5 full change in the cell number so with the nim we were able to increase this by 10 volts so we were able to obtain around 35 full change after seven days of induction which would lead us to have more than 300 million neuroprogenitors in only one atml spinner flasks so okay we do obtain large numbers of cells but how are the the the aggregates so we also did a liven dead essay and as you can see most of the cells are alive and we almost have no cell death within the aggregates which is pretty good so also we further maturate the cells and at day 34 of maturation we are already able to observe the j1 positive neurons also at day 34 of differentiation we are also analyzed the calcium tracings in order to evaluate the response to potassium chlorides and histamine to to allow us to functionally identificate identify uh the neural progenitors the neurons astrocytes and even immature cells so from here we can see that our population has around 62 of responding cells and from that 62 percent we have 20 percent uh of the cells that are already neurons and 80 percent that are still on the progenitor phase so this neural induction medium is allows us to to have large numbers of neural precursor cells that are able to differentiate into fully functionally neurons but still we wanted to check if we if we could be able not only to derive the pluripotent stem cells into neural precursors in general but if we could direct them into a specific neural lineage so for that we use the pluripotent stem cell dopaminergic neuron differentiation kit so this kit was especially designed to differentiate the pluripotent stem cells to functional midbrain dopaminergic neurons so again this sculpture medium was designed for 2d culture and we were able to adapt it to 3d conditions so we we adapted it and the first six plus five days which are the floor plate specification and expansion we did it on the celster wheaton uh that we use the same one that we use for the neural induction medium but in here we had to consider that we for this specific lineage the initial aggregate size uh would have to be around 200 micrometers so we initiated the differentiation with that diameter and a curious thing is that during the the induction for floor plate progenitors we can see that we also experience some membrane blebbing like in the the first days but by day six and seven we also have the structures that we observed with the nin but instead of the cells starting to to divide into smaller aggregates they remain in the original aggregate as more denser [Music] centers so after the floor plate specification we replated the cells and we stained them for the fox a2 floor plate marker and as you can see the almost all of the cells are expressing fox a2 we also analyze the aggregates that we obtain by date 11 uh doing a live debt essay and again we have negligible cell death within the aggregates and the curious thing is that we compared by real-time pcr uh samples from pluripotent stem cells from cells recovered at day 11 using the dopaminergic neuron differentiation kit and cells from day 7 using the neural induction median and as you can see in here we have upregulation of pax2 and en2 which are mid-brain markers when we use the dopaminergic neuron kit and when we use the neural induction medium we have an upregulation of fox 2 and pac-6 so this proves that the sculpture media can be scalable and still generate mid-brain progenitors using 3d suspension culture instead of using the the regular uh 2d approach so just to do a quick sum up of what we have been talking about so stem skill is a promising new culture medium uh specially designed for pluripotent stem cells scalable suspension culture so we can yield up up up to 664 fold in only 15 days so at the same time this culture medium stem scale can also maintain high levels of pluripotency markers and at the same time maintain a normal karyotype on the other hand the neural induction medium also allows to have up to a 32 fold increase in cell number and the cells that we obtain are are able to further maturate and stain positive for touch one and also response respond to potassium chloride and histamine treatments also the pluripotent stem cell dopaminergic neuron differentiation kit was able to be used in a scalable platform using 3d cultures and we were able to obtain pure populations of midbrain progenitors we are finishing here i just want to acknowledge first professor jack fernandez and professor joaquin cabral from our lab at ibb in lisbon and i would like to have to to do a special thanks to all of the team of thermofishes scientific especially to michael eckenhead and michael derr who have been uh working uh with us for the past few years so thank you all so much and please continue to enjoy the five days of stem cells", "D1p8mZghBjg": "hi today I am going to introduce our cold therapy knee wrap with compression it's one of our most popular products right now because let's face it everyone experiences knee pain at some point or another not only is it comfortable to wear but it also has built in compression using this black Erica combining cold therapy with compression ensures that there is better contact between the ice gel pack and the underneath which means deeper and longer cold penetration and faster pain relief if you don't need the compression you can simply remove the air tube as an added bonus we also include an extra ice gel pack for free in case you need longer treatment sessions now let's move on to how we use the rep when you are ready to use the wrap take one of the gel packs out of the freezer and insert it into the wrap although make sure you have some sort of fabric covering your knee for example a towel or a pair of pants to protect the skin a nice chill pack should never be in contact with the skin once that's done place the wrap over your knee with the opening facing downwards and attach the top strap to secure the top part of the wrap next you'll notice a short strap at the front just attach it to the other side then attach the bottom strap of the wrap once all the straps have been secured you can adjust them if needed to make the wrap tighter or looser depending on your preferences the opening should be about the size of your kneecap when you're done adjusting the wrap turn the valve to the on position and pump air into the wrap using the black air compression tube like this when you're done humping the air turn the valve to the off position to prevent air from leaking out and then attach the tube to the wrap so it doesn't get in the way it's that easy now you can leave the wrap on for 15 to 20 minutes and enjoy some much-needed pain relief please know that we do not recommend that you use it for longer than 20 minutes unless your doctor recommends it for your situation when you are done with the wrap turn the belt back on to the on position and then press the delete button to remove the air from the wrap this takes about five to six seconds then you can remove the wrap if you notice that there is still some air in the wraps just press and hold the deflate button and then squeeze the wrap to remove the excess air that's it", "tK4Nl76sch0": "whether it's the dull throb of an overworked muscle or the grating soreness of joint discomfort pain affects millions of Americans every day managing minor aches and pains is a crucial element in helping maintain an active lifestyle in the pain management community there is a shift toward the use of topical analgesics and away from systemic pain relievers topical pain relievers deliver targeted pain relief with low levels of systemic absorption this may result in less risk for systemic toxicity or drug interaction Biofreeze is the number one used and recommended topical pain reliever by hands-on health care professionals in the US for over 20 years Biofreeze has been helping people manage pain associated with therapy exercise arthritis and everyday life using menthol as the active ingredient Biofreeze products penetrate quickly providing relief through cold therapy to understand how cold therapy works let's first look at the process of pain transmission for minor foot pain the perception of pain is regulated by different types of nerve cells or neurons peripheral nerves carry information from special receptors in the skin into the spinal cord these signals are eventually sent to the brain where sensations such as pain are perceived these pain sensations are transmitted through small nerve fibers called C fibers another type of nerve fiber called a delta fibers are thicker than C fibers and carry sensory information from the skin to the spinal cord when a pain signal reaches the spinal cord from the C fiber the signal stimulates another neuron which carries the signal up the spinal cord to the brain where it is perceived as pain however when a topical analgesic such as Biofreeze is applied over a painful area another sensation is sent along the a delta fiber nerve the a delta fiber then stimulates an inhibitory nerve that blocks the painful C fiber signal from reaching the brain as a result the perception of pain is blocked this process has become known as the gate control theory of pain which is thought to be one of the pain control mechanisms of counter irritants such as Biofreeze recent laboratory research suggests a second theory for menthols mechanism of action this ingredient has been shown to bind with temperature sensitive receptors called TRP and eight receptors when menthol binds with these receptors they release calcium ions which are believed to help modulate pain signals through the body's opioid system these trpm8 receptors also cause the brain to perceive cold sensations such as those caused by ice ice is the time-honored way of reducing pain when apply to the skin and works very similarly to Biofreeze pain reliever for example both reduce blood flow to the applied area while ice is effective at reducing pain it does have disadvantages such as stiffness skin irritation temporary pain and numbness and it generally requires the patient to remain stationary Biofreeze reduces pain like ice without these disadvantages in a study on the effects of Biofreeze versus ice on acute non-complicated neck pain it was found that following a 10-minute treatment Biofreeze decreased pain nearly two times as much as ice additionally it was rated as substantially more comfortable users preferred it and it lasted longer in nine out of ten patients Biofreeze pain reliever comes in a variety of formats especially designed for users needs each delivering pain relief utilizing the cooling effect of menthol the active ingredient in Biofreeze pain leader", "LDxnQQbZH9M": "hi guys today I'm gonna be reviewing Mary's Nutritionals and if you guys don't know what that is it's a place where you can buy lots of different kinds of CBD CBD products and if CBD is a natural occurring chemical that's in cannabis and you know me I am for cannabis freedom and this is the first time I tried CBD and let me tell you my mind is blown I will rely on CBD because you know what actually we're supposed to you're supposed to have CBB naturally like that's why we are supposed to smoke cannabis and even though smoking cannabis isn't not about this company they just want to let you know that I believe in that you know but let's get on to the products so I tried their transdermal patch and this this this is the elite CBD patch with cannabinoid oil cannabinoid I'm sorry I can't I'm sorry I can't pronounce tried but it's a 10 milligram transdermal patch with pure American hemp and don't mind me if I tap things because I like tapping things and hearing their sounds so basically you should you're gonna put this on the vainest part of your body such as it inside the ankle or wrist and you should cleaning the area with alcohol and let it dry now this can be worn out for 12 hours and it can be you CBD can be used for anxiety sleep and lots of other benefits as well like it helps your body so this is what don't mind it got stuck to my phone cause it's a little still sticky but this is what it looks like I did he's it a couple nights ago and let me tell him and I got my hair on it great and yeah it just comes like that you can also just cut these as well because I've seen people do it cut him in at four so you don't use the whole patch but I did and I used that and I got the best night's sleep ever because I do stand on my feet all day at work and I work pretty much almost every day of the week and I get anxiety my back hurts and this helped so much you guys and I am saving another one for my best friend because she is like me and she's into CBD and campus freedom so I wanted her to try it and then I also got the muscle freeze which is a cooling action which is like for its kind of like the Swan pause or like the hot and cold stuff but like I think it's like LeBron James or something was that the dude that played in those commercials but anyways this is going to work well I can't wait to use it I'm gonna be saving a total about like Wednesday or Thursday because I'm gonna be working some overnight shifts that's on another suite but yeah I really really enjoyed using this company and I also came with a cannabis primer just telling you about cannabis and CBD itself which is really interesting like even in here it says that some dude let me get to that page he Joe 62 it said that he had been using this DVD and his diabetes is not under controlled but it's actually testing negative for it so I'm gonna see if I can actually start taking CBD on the regular because I feel like it would help my body a lot and I recommend you guys especially if you're going through pain you can't get sleep you have anxiety try CBD you know it's a natural you guys natural it's nothing like taking pharmaceuticals you guys this is a whole new ballgame that I'm so glad that people have finally realized that the cannabis plant is actually healthy you know and we are actually designed to ingest and take and our bringing in your eyes we have cannabinoid in our brain so we're actually supposed to be taking in all the time all the chemicals of the cannabis plant you know and which is it's the most amazing plant ever you guys I loved it so much you know hippie but and it even comes with a little chart that says like CBD helps the circulatory system whole body pain in like relief muscular and skeletal digestive system the nervous system immune response and endocrine system you guys Stevie B is amazing and you guys it is legal guys don't have to worry about taking it and getting in trouble I hit that whole like thing about it but CVD is legal and I really recommend it so I will leave their link down below so you guys can check them out and yeah you guys have a wonderful day",

Engineering Research Center at Binghamton University electro suta khals rely on various forms of electrical stimulation to modify and improve functions of the body for the past thirty years my research has focused on developing electro suitable technologies and performing clinical tests on the efficacy and effectiveness of electro suitable devices intended for the healthcare and the wellness markets about 1/3 of the adult population suffers from some form of chronic pain and drug therapies have limited effectiveness for these individuals chronic pain perception is a result of sensory amplification by the central nervous system so we refer to this as central sensitization central sensitization serves to maintain pain even after the initial injury has healed therefore chronic pain is often poorly correlated to the degree of peripheral tissue injury acta patch is a specific sub sensory electro suitable device which utilizes electromagnetic fields to allow non-invasive penetration of the stimulus into the tissue and produce the desired pain relief active patches electromagnetic signal pulses 1,000 times per second to modulate a ferrant nerve activity dampening the brains perception of pain the pulsing action of the active pad prevents the brain from adapting to the stimulus active patch therapy has been shown to reduce pain levels and help restore normal function such as improving nighttime sleep there's no sensation from active patch sub sensory therapy unlike a TENS device you'll feel no tingling nor heat or vibration a 5000 user survey showed that pain levels were reduced by more than 50% in two-thirds of users and this relief was sustained for over three months with regular usage long-term active patch use has also been shown to have the use of pain medications while improving overall quality of life two-thirds including opioid users reported moderate to complete elimination of pain medications two-thirds reported improved sleep three-quarters reported increased physical activity and four-fifths of substantial improvement in overall quality of life acta patch can help treat chronic pain arising from conditions such as osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis shingles with the sports injuries fibromyalgia as well as post surgical procedures additional double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials provide evidence for the effectiveness of active patch and reducing both chronic and acute pain active patch is small lightweight and non-invasive and is the only neuromodulation electro suitable currently available over-the-counter from managing chronic pain active patch is easy to activate and use simply press the button on the back of the module to turn the device on an LED light will be activated now place the active patch directly over the source of the pain there are a number of ways to secure the active patch over the treatment site specifically designed attachments are included in the knee and back packages or the user can simply use medical or kinesiology tape to attach the device directly onto their skin or over bandages or clothing recommended use time is initially 24 hours a day thereafter used for 6 to 24 hours as needed overnight therapy is an effective option for many active patch users active patch provides an affordable option with up to 720 hours of usage has on/off capability no

my name is Ellie hey craft and I'm a massage and sports therapist at my physio sa North Adelaide today we're going to be talking about patellar tendinopathy also known as jumpers knee patellar tendonitis is an overuse injury of the knee it's often caused by excessive amounts of jumping or it's very common in sports so the patellar tendon comes up here it joins to the quadricep muscle comes down into patella and if you have quite a few symptoms you'll get a bit of an acre around the knee through here it's often worse when we play sports so it'll it'll get worse as you're starting to move it a bit more and some of the signs and symptoms are a thickening of the tendon in relation to the other side so the normal side or the side not affected and it will be worth in the morning sometimes getting up it can feel a bit stiff a bit creaky and pain in general just on moving today we're going to show you a little bit of cryotherapy or ice massage for the patella tendon cryotherapy is really good because it reduces inflammation in the patella tendon as well as providing massage or reducing of scar tissue so today we're going to use a polystyrene cup and what I've done is I have filled with water and frozen it overnight so these are really good because you can just peel a little bit off the round the outside just like so coming around trying not to make too much of a mess and once you've got about a centimeter away from the top what we're going to do then is apply it to the knee so patellar tendon runs in a cross here and we're going to start just by doing some general massage this will numb the area as well then do this for a couple of minutes and you'll also find that it will make the ice a little bit smoother so that when you're doing across frictional fibers it won't be as sore as what it would be I'm just doing little round circles right over the top of that patellar tendon okay now that I've done that for a while and the edge of the ice is worn down a little bit what I'm going to do is apply that soft part to the knee and we're going to do cross friction fibers so the direction of the fibers run down and we're going to go against those so running across now when we're doing this at home we're not going to apply it for too long we don't want to cause any ice burn or anything like that so I'm going to do it for a couple of minutes working across those fibers getting a little bit deeper as you go up and down to work down the bottom of the fiber and then all the way up cryotherapy or ice massage is a really good technique in reducing information in a patellar tendon however this is not the only technique that needs to be used for acute patellar tendonitis so this is a really good technique to use within the first 72 hours of you getting your pain or discomfort it's also a good technique to use if you have had the condition for a while post sport if you're doing it you want to do it three to four times a day and this will help reduce the inflammation as well as break up some of that scar tissue that's laid itself down there are many different causes of patellar tendonitis these can be anything from a weakness in the quadriceps muscle tightness in the quadriceps muscle or poor biomechanics um in the foot leg or knee so it's important to seek further medical advice for patella tendonitis if you're suffering from this condition this is just simply a good way to treat it and reduce the inflammation between your sessions with your therapist or your physiotherapist", "nNg0qQl1q5U": "advanced physical therapy education institute tissue distraction release with movement in the past number of decades soft tissue release techniques have gained popularity for example ischemic compression and deep tissue massage release techniques have also used various tools such as metal rods prickly balls foam rollers you name it soft tissue compression techniques have been a benefit to some individuals to some degree and some say the pain feels good however the simple fact is that not all patients respond to compression sometimes instead of just aggressively pressing down on tissues that are already tight restricted or had heard it may be more effective to actually lift up or distract then glide the restricted tissues relative to their surrounding structures tissue distraction with movement may help release the interfaces between the fashio muscles and tendons tissue distraction is not a novel concept it's been done for centuries using various cupping techniques some theorize that as evil spirits and toxins are pulled or sucked out of the body pain relief occurs another theory is that tissue destruction releases movement simply helps mechanically release adhesions that bound down the soft tissues watch the short videos for sample demonstrations and explanation of the concept tissued distraction released with movement may be performed on practically any soft tissue region where normally massage and release

a really innovative product it is called that the CBD gel pen it's from a company called the green pet shop and if you're not familiar with the use of cannabis in the pet industry I really highly encourage you to look at that do some research and I know it's a controversial subject a topic of my personal opinion on anything right now but it certainly is controversial some people do not like the idea of based products being used for in the pet industry particularly for the purposes of medicinal their medicinal properties so it's something to really take into consideration if you're watching this on youtube go down to the description below there's a link to an article on our website it's a very informative it's a very in-depth extensive article on the use of cannabis in the pet industry and this new business for using CBD for medicinal purposes we focus on pets obviously it's becoming popular for humans as well for its medicinal purposes so it's something to look into and I do encourage you to do that and then make your decision speak with your veterinarian maybe or a specialist in the field a holistic that might be if there's one in your area might be a good opportunity so this is this is again from the green PET SHOP it's the CBD gel pen and what this isn't is just that there's a substance in here it's kind of a it's it's not an oil but it's almost like a cream that is infused with the parts they extract the cannabidiol from that have which is what does the healing it's the element in the hemp that does the that has a medicinal properties so you don't get the hallucinogens you don't get any of that stuff it's strictly be the piece that heals so they extract that and they put it into this they put this same stuff there is CBD infused on treats there are a lot of edibles for dogs coming out right now that use the same thing but this is a cream that you use that you grow on your dog now this it has a lot of benefits again deuteron research but CBD has been proven to help dogs with issues nervous issues like separation anxiety and it has also been associated with it has high antioxidant properties so it's been associated with the treatment of oxidation diseases the diseases that are associated with oxidation is related diseases inflammatory diseases autoimmune diseases so a lot of potential health benefits if it's something that you're interested in in this is by far of course the treats are very easy to use but as far as anything else that are is TB infused this is an extremely easy product to use I would compare it to being as easy as a treat where you just hand it to your dog if you did this you're just going to rub on your dog so the problem of the treats is that a lot of the benefits of the CBD are lost in the digestive process so what you got with this is you're gonna rub this directly onto your dog's skin what you want to do is rub it in there in here now you can rub it anywhere that there's exposed skin for example some dogs their bellies have a lot of exposed skin so you want to rub it somewhere where it's exposed and some are aware it's a veiny area so that the CBD the cream can be absorbed and put into the bloodstream very quickly so I recommend doing it on the inner ear and the reason that I say that is because I've tried it on multiple places on my dog and she licks it off if I put it anywhere I'll spit inside over here so if you put it on their belly or anywhere energy we're gonna be able to lick that off so if you do the intern ear they can't get to that which is is really me when I put it on her inner ear doesn't seem to bother her at all she doesn't scratch sometimes I've used some medicated creams and stuff in the past with her on different wounds and things that she's had and a lot of times you can tell that maybe it might stain a little bit she'll laugh at it or you know shake her head if it's interviews or anything like that and this doesn't seem to bother her at all she won't even seem to notice that it's there so what you do is there are you take off the cap and there are 50 pumps in this pen each pump is one milligram so there are let me just make sure I'm going to get this correctly for the dosage it's right over here so for pets that are 5 to 20 pounds know that this is not recommended for dogs under 5 pounds so if you have a toy breed or a small a very small dog under 5 pounds is not recommended so keep that in mind dogs under 5 to 20 pounds mean 1 to 2 milligrams I've needed about 4 times a day pets that are 20 to 50 pounds 2 to 5 milligrams as needed and that's over 50 pounds one milligram per 10 pounds of additional weight over about 50 pounds as again as needed so you can see that there 50 as I said pumps for 1 milligrams are should be 15 milligrams here's each pump as a milligram so you get 50 pumps of this and for jobs like my dog is 55 pounds so she's going to need let's say at the most it's 2 to 5 milligrams so let's say the motion needs 5 milliner's day so this is going to be a 10 day use so that part of it stinks but it is something that you don't need all the time so that's something to to remember it is a bit expensive it's $40 for one pen so if you're only getting 10 DS use out of that for $40 it is $4 a day for your pets and relief if you think about it that way it doesn't sound as expensive but it is it is definitely something to consider price-wise so what you do is you turn the pen clockwise and that unlocks it and then you just push in on it and a little bit of the cream it's like a yellowish cream comes out the top and then you just turn it counterclockwise and that locks it so that you can't push any more out so again this is from the green PET SHOP this is the CBD gel pen it's made from Colorado chrome 100% organic and natural industrial hemp cannabis plants the website says that they're growing on a family farm one of the differences between this and other our CBD products is got a lot of those the CVE that they're using comes from plants that are grown in Europe and China and a lot of those plants are grown into Australia which means they might have pesticides and that kind of stuff that you need to be wary of so the fact that this has grown with 100% organic and natural plants is great that it's made with those plants so that's great again it's $40 per pen so it is a bit on the pricey side it's certainly from anything you want to talk to your veterinarian about before you use it once you get that little bit of cream oh you just rubbed up on the inner ear of your dog whether they have floppy ears or ears that stick off you just rub it right there on the inside of the year it doesn't seem to bother our dog so if it would benefit our dogs that they needed it for any and time and like I use it on our boxer for anti-anxiety it does seem to help her it seems to work about as well as we do have some of the CBD treats that we use as well and it doesn't seem to work about as well as those but those oxidation associated diseases like the inflammatory autoimmune diseases things like that I know a lot of people that if you do the research they use it for dogs with cancer that are going through chemo treatments that helps with the nausea and things like that so there are really a lot of uses for CBD that they're fighting in the pet industry do your research speak with your about certainly before you try anything even something as simple as this it is all natural if you try it without the right so the veterinarian it's not going to harm your dog in any way but you do just want to make sure if your dogs on say like on their medications other treatment plan is to just really want to touch base with your vet and make sure this is something that you can try a lot of us right now are on the fence with the CBD for pets because their research is being done right now and they're looking into that so your vet may not necessarily recommend it but they can tell you that it's going to be safe and effective safe and not effective but at least safe for your pets so how about out with you about if you're thinking about it again this is from the green pet

is there slowly to hear and today we're going to do a product review on Mary's medicinals transdermal patches [Music] so Mary medicinals is a brand and they have various products out there and today we're going to talk about these transdermal patches this specific transdermal patch is a CBD to THC one-to-one ratio so that means it has the equal amounts of THC to CBD okay I've already cut this open but normally it would be closed and you will have to cut it open it this type of material is not a material that you can tear because it's childproof and safety proof so you want to make sure that you have scissors and you cut them open on the back here it has some instructions at the top it has some the ingredient list and then it has the very important lab testing that I always say make sure every product that you use has been lab tested and if it has been lab tested it will have a label on the product okay so let's just review what this says so it gives instructions about it says that the patch is most effective on a Venus part of the body such as the top of the foot or inside the wrist and that the patch is is effective for up to 12 hours when worn continually which is pretty much any transdermal patch so how do you transform of Hatch's work so here is the patch it's like a second skin and it's sticky you simply apply the patch to where you want it to go and then it sticks there until you pull it off it's very simple this one has already been used so it's not sticking to me but that's where you can apply this effect pretty much anywhere and it's very discreet you can put it in places underneath your clothes no one can see it if you were in a place that's more open people may think it's just a band-aid because it's it's so discreet looking which I love about that the other cool thing about patches is that patches can be cut right so if you want to decrease the amount of cannabinoids that is located in the patch you can simply cut it in half and you'll get half the dose right and the reverse is true also if you want to increase the amount of cannabinoids you can wear multiple patches instead of just wearing one so the cool thing about transdermal patches are super discreet you can customize your dosage by decrease by cutting the patches to decrease the dose or by having multiple patches on to increase the dose so let's read more about Mary medicinal patch that I have here according to the lab testing this was manufactured September 4th 2018 and it expires September 4th 2019 that's always great when they have an expiration date on the lab testing in addition it says CBD is seven point two one milligrams per patch THC is eight point one three milligrams per patch and this also has CBC which is one point oh five milligrams per patch as we saw in the beginning this was supposed to be a one to one but like I've told you in my previous videos is that's what they want it to be what you see on the actual product label is what they desire the product to be but when they send the product in for lab testing the lab tests will give you very specifics of what the product actually is and that's why this label is so important so you would think that you would get seven milligrams and seven milligrams or nine milligrams and nine milligrams or whatever but now we see that we have a little bit more THC in this product than CBD okay so it's not truly truly truly exactly once one because we have eight point one three milligrams of THC and we have seven point two one milligrams of CB d okay but for all intents and purposes this is a one to one ratio and the other thing we want to pay attention to is the ingredients on the back okay those are always very important because you want to make sure that you're not applying anything to your skin that may irritate it or that you will be allergic to so for instance this has acrylic glycol lettuce in oleic acid cannabis extract eucalyptus and terpenes on the front here at the bottom it says that this is terpene and rich it enlists the the terpene that's in it so that's important to know because we know that terpenes do add to the entourage effect in terpenes do provide medicinal value so we love products that have terpenes in them and when they outline the terpenes better in them so those are important but overall the Mary medicinal patch is so simple to use it's so easy to use if you use continuous relief or effect for up to 12 hours I know personally when I use it it lasts for about 10 hours and then I have to replace it but still 10 hours and you don't have to do anything there's nothing to take there's nothing to smoke there's nothing as swallows nothing to eat you simply just put it on and go about your business transdermal patches are pretty cool if you have any questions just let me know talk to you later [Music]", "ooSGDNQRCY8": "this is polar products theratemp moist heat knee wrap it provides deep penetrating moist heat to help relieve pain from arthritis

brief review as you can see a nerve consists of thousands of axons encased in myelin sheath within Anton oriole tubes these tubes are bundled in the paranormal is encased in the epineurium if we were to isolate a single nerve cell we'd observe an axon conducting signals from the sensory receptors however once we apply focused cold therapy conduction is interrupted all signals stop and we'll Larian degeneration begins it's important to note that this degeneration includes the axon in the myelin sheath but not the end own aureum which is unaffected by focused cold therapy Schwann cells then activate macrophages to engulf and digest the debris and secrete signaling factors to create a growth cone once the debris is cleared and the growth cone is formed the axon begins to regenerate at a rate of one to two millimeters per day and once the axon reconnects with the sensory receptors conduction resumes", "3HCR8w8LBQM": "in the United States it's just assumed you'll get high blood pressure my blood pressure is in high yet my position keeps remarking on that I keep see but I'm in the area you know I this is what I work it I I lived this diet so I'm hoping my never goes high your blood levels of glucose and insulin typically we think of these from the standpoint of type 2 diabetes adult onset diabetes but they have a role in heart disease and cancers that I'll talk about you know content is is reported as milligrams per kilogram if you look at the types of olive oil basically we find out olive oil and if you look at it and studies have somewhere less than 20 is fair to say 20 milligrams per kilogram this study when they looked at this that LDL oxidation decreased only for the oil that had 366 milligrams per kilogram so it was the truly the extra virgin olive oil with the moderate high phenyl content as opposed to the retail one so also retail in this one this is a high content of phenols but compared it to again a retail type level but this showed a decrease in DNA oxidation so this is where I think that work needs to be done this is where I think we need to educate our patients that you're using specific extra virgin olive oils and you're using specific levels of phenols and this is this is something that's going to come about I think more and more people are going to in the air in the market and do this because I think this is where we'll see much more health benefits so the some evidence that are behind vanilla content may lower the LDL more than refined this is an area that's open I think for research what is definitely is very clear in the literature that the HDL particle the level will increase with extra virgin olive oil and it increases higher compared with the higher phenolic content and this is the only thing I know that will increase HDL I remember when I worked in the area in the 80s people were trying to come out of the drug because they were trying to you know how do you change the particle nothing works it's no drug that will increase your HDL every division olive oil is the only food and I think this is a really interesting thing to look at there's been blood pressure standpoint compared to sunflower oil 2 to 3 tablespoons of olive oil this study tested them after 6 months so it's not clear how soon it happened but 2 to 3 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil led to a significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure most dietary interventions you may know will it more likely to change systolic diastolic sal it'll more resistant to change in this particular study almost half of the participants actually went walk their blood pressure medicines which is very exciting I think that look when food works better in the medicines I'm always very excited when I see those studies this next study used four tablespoons of olive oil a day for just a four-week period these were older people these were older people with blood pressure for a number of years in a three-week period you saw a lowering of systolic blood pressure this next study looked at women and when the higher on one of the higher phenolic content over 500 and they gave them 60 milliliters a day which is about four tablespoons and an eight-week period I lowered ball systolic and diastolic and I put the numbers here because if you're if you're familiar with the literature different studies looking at changes in blood pressure two or three points is big it's usually significant these are huge decreases huge average decreases I didn't put the standard deviation because that has to look on Willie but these are huge decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure so I think there's something to be said for the higher phenyl content being able to lower blood pressure which I don't know about here in the United States it's just assumed to get high blood pressure my blood pressure is in high yet my physician keeps reminding that I can see but I'm in the area you know I this is what I work it I lived this diet so I'm hoping my never goes hi you", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea", "fnr3hImDnbQ": "[Music] with cologne everyone just wanted to cut this quick video and this is a great way to you know if you have our problems we're moving a bankruptcies you know judgments tax liens and stuff like that this is a great way to pay to get the wrong move a lot faster so if you know the credit bureaus do not verify your public records through the courthouses what they do is they use third-party websites so in this video I'm giving you a list of the websites this is not freezing your actual credit report this is freezing your public records they're the difference so what you need to do is I would prefer that you call them I have the numbers here for you and get the freeze put on because it would go a lot faster but I also have provided the websites but you can do it online but I would suggest calling them and putting a freeze on your public records so what happens is they're gonna send you a letter in the middle it's important that you keep these letters you know keep everything organized keep everything in your folders because you will need to unfreeze these eventually you know if you're trying to get a house or anything like that so some of these letters would come with a specific pen cater to you to get it frozen so you definitely need to keep all this paperwork and like I said that the credit bureaus use third-party websites to to verify your public records so that's how they claim to verify the information so if you put a freeze on them how can you verify it but um majority of the time the user takes about thirty days to the freeze to really go active so yeah it might take another extra thirty days to be able to get it removed or it could take longer but at least you have this freeze in place the credit bureaus don't have proof of verified information then they have to remove it otherwise if they can't provide you with that information you can sue them so this is another way to get like your public records remove is by placing a freeze on these third website that he used to verify you public records so hopefully you take this information and wrong with it but this is a great way to remove you public records there would be a link under hair or probably being a download section but on just use this use this information to your advantage and I'll see you in the next video", "5sRAdrcwHO8": "what's up y'all so I'm coming to you from the Walmart two parking lots I just dropped the kids off I have some stuff left to get done today and I wanted to share with you our experience last night with Charlotte's Web CBD oil to smile I am hopefully optimistic I have never really been this hopeful about something that we've tried and we have tried a lot of things over the past several years but this this feels good this feels like a light at the end of the tunnel and it's not a train this feels like for the first time and I don't know when then I am able to parent him not that he was perfect or an angel or that we didn't have mistakes or hiccups but that he was able to control himself not that I felt like I had to control him and I think that's the biggest difference I've felt for so long like I'm holding him back constantly like if he were on a leash and I was one of those parents y'all I had my kid on a leash literally when he was like you know two and three years old because I just couldn't control him but yesterday he was able to control himself he was able to play and have fun and then when it was time to bring it down a notch he was able to bring it down a notch I maybe had to remind him or you know help him but it wasn't a fight it wasn't a struggle my kid my kid didn't struggle yesterday and I can't tell you what that means so I'm hopefully optimistic like it's really hard because you want it to work so bad but she don't want to be let down again so we had a good day and when we started to struggle I was able to help him with tools I was able to do belly breathing with him and meditation and the things that there's no way I would have been able to accomplish had he not had some help you know and that's the thing like I'm I'm thinking long term y'all I know what amphetamines do to adult males and I don't want him to struggle in that way in his life you know I don't have to go through details with you guys and it's weird to even talk about that being that we're talking about my eight year old kid but that's legit that's serious and I'm his mother and I want him to be healthy and happy for his whole life not just right now you know I heard someone say that medication doesn't give you tools and that's what I want for him as I want him to have tools I want him to be able to help himself because God knows I won't always be there you know this is summertime and you know we got school in a couple months I want it to work so now I'll let you know I'm excited we had a good day he had a good day so Charlotte's Web CBD oil is it the miracle drug I don't know maybe hopefully maybe I shouldn't call it a drug they probably wouldn't like that anyway thanks y'all and I'll let you know", "nEEErakb4QY": "Hey everybody it's Doctor Jo, and today\nI'm going to show you the top five ways to relieve knee pain. So let's get\nstarted. Number one, calf stretches. For the first\nstretch, is going to be a calf stretch. You can take a dog leash, you can take a\nstretch strap, you can take a towel, or even a belt if you don't have any of\nthose. Take the loop and put it around the ball of your foot. You don't want it\nto be low, you don't want it to be high on the toes because then it might slip\noff and hit you. Make sure your leg is straight, and make\nsure that your foot is relaxed, and then just take the strap and pull towards you\nuntil you feel a little stretch underneath your leg, and hold that for 30\nseconds. If you need to pull a little bit more, you can, but you don't want it to be\npainful, you just want it to be a little bit uncomfortable. After 30 seconds, relax\nand then do that a total of three times, just really pulling towards you getting\nthat stretch. Number two, far infrared heat. So far infrared heat is another\ngreat way to help relieve pain. We partnered up with the folks at Thermotex and they sent us their Thermotex Platinum. This one is so cool because\nit's super versatile, you can use it for almost any part of the body and it's\nreally nice because as you can see here, there's three different plates, so that\nhelps kind of mold around parts of your body, and it works really well for the\nknee. The great thing about far infrared heat is it goes much deeper than just a\nregular heating pad. Normal heating pads maybe only get about 0.25 centimeters\ndeep. Far infrared heat goes all the way up to six centimeters or 2.36 inches, so\nthat really gets deep down in there those deeper muscles where there's that\ninflammation and that pain, and it can really help relax everything, increase that\ncirculation, and get that inflammation out of there. So what I like about this\nis you can do it several different ways around the knee. You can put the middle\nplate down at the bottom and then just curl up the sides, almost\nlike a \"C\" pattern, and then wrap it around like this, so you see it can get\nthe sides and the bottom. If you're having like some hamstring issues or things\nlike that. You can also do it if you want the top and the bottom, and so you've got\na plate on top, plate on the side, plate on the bottom, and you can also do it on\ntop if the top of your leg's hurting, and then wrap it around so you have the top\nand then the sides. You can check out my full review of the platinum by clicking\nthe box in the top right hand corner, or you can check it out in the description\nbelow, there will be a link down there as well. They also have an knee version which is really cool. It's slightly different just to kind of help mold around the\nknee a little bit better, and so you can see here it works like this. So again you\ncan still kind of put the plates where you want to, you have this plate here, and\nthis plate here, so if you want to have one on the bottom and kind of the one on\nthe top, you can do that like this, and then let it sit there, or you can do on\neach kind of side around the edges right there, and so you got here and here. So\nit's really nice way just to kind of get it around the knee, and if you're at work\nor doing something you can have it on you can still be kind of doing your work\nand just go about the rest of your day. So that's really nice as well. So if you\nare interested in checking out more about Thermotex, there it is, you can go\nto Thermotex.com, and if you're interested in purchasing the product, you\ncan go down to the link in the description down there.\nNumber three, hamstring stretches. For a hamstring stretch, you can stretch it a\nlot of different ways, but I like stretching it with a strap again. So this\ntime put the strap just a little bit lower so you've got a little extra pull\nto it, and then lay down on your back. You want to keep your leg straight, and you\ncan bend this knee or relax it whatever is more comfortable for you, but try and\nkeep the leg that you're pulling up straight. You don't really want to lift\nthe leg actively, you're using that strap to pull it up\nand stretch, but try not to bend that knee. If that knee bends, then you're not\nreally stretching those hamstrings very well, so even if you have to come back\ndown a little bit to keep that leg straight, that's what I want you to do, so\nthen you're going to hold that stretch for 30 seconds, come back down, shake it\nout a little bit, and then do that three times so just get that nice stretch in\nthere. Number four, IT band stretch. For the IT\nband stretch, there's again several ways that you can stretch it, but I like just\nto keep using the stretch strap because it's already there, and then you don't have\nto really change positions. It's very similar where you're going to keep that\nleg straight, and you're going to come up, but don't bring it up quite as high this\ntime, and once you start feeling a little bit of a stretch, drop it over across\nyour body and you should really feel that stretch kind of in the hip booty\narea, and then again hold that stretch for thirty Seconds. You come back, take a\nlittle break, and then do that again three times. So coming up and then\ndropping it over, and the further over you can go, the more stretch you'll get,\nbut try and keep the back flat on the ground because then that'll really\nstretch that IT band. Number five, quad stretch. For a quad stretch, you're still\ngoing to use the strap. Again there's a whole lot of ways you can stretch it, but\nI'm just going to keep using the strap because it's already there. This time, put\nthe strap around your ankle and what you're going to bring this strap up and\nyou're going to roll over onto your stomach, and as you roll over kind of\nbring this strap up around your shoulders. So it's going to be kind of\nthis movement. So now with the strap, just take it and gently pull, trying to bring\nyour heel towards your bottom. As you can see right there, and so again you want it\nyou want to be comfortable, you don't want to be painful, but you want to get a\nnice stretch in there and hold that for about thirty seconds, and then come back.\nYou can give it a little break. If you want to go all the way down, you can, and\nthen do that three times. So there you have it, those were your top five ways to\nrelieve knee pain.

felt at the skin's surface the patch is novel in as much as it contains a compound of chili pepper called capsaicin and it's applied topically on to the skin in in a controlled environment for half an hour to an hour and it will often result in improvements in pain symptoms for anything up to three months um there are many people who can benefit from this particular treatment it's a treatment for people who have him particularly painful areas of skin normally and that's called painful neuropathic skin and typically that might affect people who've had shingles it could also affect people who have got hiv-associated neuropathy which is painful often the hands and feet of pain in the skin areas it can also be used on people who have had surgical procedures who've got a lot of scar related pain so it has a wide number of applications I think for for a long time people have known that Chili Peppers have a slightly pain-killing effect prior to the development of this patch we have had a product called capsaicin which is the active ingredient of the chili pepper which has been applied manually by hand but handling Chili Peppers as you knows can be quite challenging particularly if you have to rub it in it stays in your fingers and can affect your eyes so it can be quite painful and difficult to use so the advantage of this new patch is that it comes as a pre medicated patch and it can be applied by a particular individual in a special circumstance the patch itself is a medicated patch that contains 8% capsaicin and this is the active ingredient in chili peppers this 8% is very concentrated and as such it has to be applied in a controlled manner so it can't it can't be bought over the counter and applied at home it is a very specialized product the good thing about the application is it's a single application and it normally asks last for up to three months there are times that after several treatments has been reported that sometimes this can be every six months or every nine months and I have heard of patients who only require the treatment every year during treatment because this is a chili pepper patch it's important that the skin area is prepared beforehand typically what happens is patient will come in and have the area marked it's then a soothing and anaesthetic gel is applied to the area that we are to treat that's left on for a period of half an hour to an hour then the patch is applied under controlled conditions and applied to just the area in question the patch is left in place for either 30 minutes or an hour depending on where the patch is placed and there after another soothing gel is applied and patients are now to go home so it is quite an involved procedure and would entail at least two to two and a half hours of time during which time the skin was prepared and the PAP the plaster was applied during the procedure no because the area is pre treated with local anesthetic so it at the time of application not unfortunately afterwards dependent on some individuals there is often an associated pain it's often likened to a sunburn type of pain and responds well to cooling afterwards cool cool packs cool clothes cool cool cool one can use cooling cloths afterwards to actually just control the pain afterwards but just like someone will tend to last for 24 hours or so so the the burning effect may be short-lived in some patients they don't experience any burning sensation at all so it's not it's not in very it's not inevitable that everybody will experience burning if it goes really red it's important to come back or contact the clinician or contact the center where the patch was applied in the event that it starts to blister which is extremely uncommon then it's suggested that you take yourself to an A&E department where again a certain sort of of of cream or specific treatment may be necessary it's very very rare that anyone should actually blister as a result of it but that would that would again entail medical intervention to be seen again extremely rare there are some other side effects associated with patch application one would be a very small increase in blood pressure is not the increase in blood pressure is very transient which means it's very short-lived and it's a very very modest to small amount so if that clinically this does not equate into anything it's just that we have during studies notice that while people have in the patch applied their blood pressure goes up slightly but then that's the same for many patients who are coming in to have treatments in a hospital or clinic environment blood pressure does often increase and that's just due to anxiety that depends on whether your local hospital has been approved this is a relatively new treatment and because there is a cost implication there are a few centers at the moment on the NHS where this is available so it is important that both the hospital and the clinician are approved centers so what you would have to investigate as to whether that was available locally to you the treatment has the product has now been licensed for useful well over two years it has been proved to work both in scientific studies and through anecdotal feedback of clients who used this product before treatment should not be used in patients who have sent extreme skin sensitivity skin conditions purpose some rare skin conditions where skin blisters easily all subject to burning very easily it shouldn't be given in patients who have diabetes and there's not licensed the patients who have diabetes particularly diabetic foot pain because it is a single application and where effective will reduce or eliminate the pain for a period of up to three months and sometimes beyond three months there is nothing that we have in terms of treating this sort of pain be they through medications or other patches that are as effective as this so it is a very useful adjunct in terms of our armamentarium of drugs that we use in the treatment on your pelvic pain", "9jSceO-HgE4": "imagine having knee pain for decades and then having it all disappear with a quick trip to the doctor's office CBS 2's Emily Smith has more on how doctors are freezing away the pain within the last year I've been doing more falling and more is really in excruciating pain now Leslie Griffin's suffered from knee pain since she was 20 years old rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune disease that causes joints to deteriorate prompted the need for knee replacements 15 years ago that procedure helped until she slipped and fell now needing canes and walkers to do anything now and I'm focusing on myself I realize orthopedic surgeon dr. vino dasa will perform another knee replacement on Leslie but for now he's using something new to take away her pain once we freeze a nerve it stops transmitting the pain and you're and you're feeling much better the technique called aya vera uses nitrous oxide canisters to freeze tiny needles to negative 126 degrees once injected into the skin it freezes the pain nerves creating instant relief I've had some patients that can last for a few weeks I've had other patients six eight months of pain relief Griffin has one mission to be able to proudly step down the aisle at her daughter's wedding without a cane or walker Emily Smith cbs2 news well so far i Avera is fda-approved for pain but some doctors are also using it for headaches and in Europe in the UK doctors are even using it like Botox but without the chemical", "-NjxXjn2W58": "Hi this video is going to be on what\u00a0\nother tips you should be aware of\u00a0\u00a0 when you're standing last video we talked\u00a0\nabout slumping and there's other things that\u00a0\u00a0 we need to be aware of and why other things can be\u00a0\ncausing pain so we're going to talk about the WHY\u00a0\u00a0 and then WHAT you can do and I know\u00a0\nthat I just want to share a story of how\u00a0\u00a0 when I was treating someone that had was\u00a0\nher main complaint was having a lot of pain\u00a0\u00a0 when she was standing and she was pregnant\u00a0\nand so she worked as a cashier and she was\u00a0\u00a0 actually able to get a chair and she was able to\u00a0\nalternate so sometimes the answers are are simple\u00a0\u00a0 simple yeah and sometimes they're not but we\u00a0\nkind of have to think outside of the box yeah\u00a0\u00a0 okay so we're gonna start with the why so so\u00a0\nwhy constant why can standing cause us pain and\u00a0\u00a0 that's because we for one if our muscles and and\u00a0\njoints if we're standing not in a good alignment\u00a0\u00a0 if we're standing kind of discombobulated we're\u00a0\nputting stress on the muscles and the joints\u00a0\u00a0 and we can be even stretching things out more\u00a0\non one side or strengthening them on one side\u00a0\u00a0 and causing stress on the joints right and so\u00a0\nthat stress can actually feed into inflammation\u00a0\u00a0 that we already have because maybe we've had an\u00a0\ninjury or something or it can set up a perfect\u00a0\u00a0 storm of problems that maybe you also have a knee\u00a0\nproblem and it can just kind of get all jumbled up\u00a0\u00a0 together okay so that's kind of the why and then\u00a0\nof course if we're standing too long our muscles\u00a0\u00a0 aren't working like we talked about in the other\u00a0\nvideos and the muscles help pump our blood around\u00a0\u00a0 so that's that's why any position for too long\u00a0\nis kind of not that great okay so that's the why\u00a0\u00a0 what can we do about it dr dev so what we can do\u00a0\nabout it first we need to be aware of our pelvis\u00a0\u00a0 in space okay so our pelvis moves like a a bowl\u00a0\nthis way and this way and so it's like this is\u00a0\u00a0 called an anterior tilt and then backwards tucking\u00a0\nit under is called a posterior tilt so you're kind\u00a0\u00a0 of doing this and then you're doing that and what\u00a0\nso that's normal and then our pelvis also moves\u00a0\u00a0 side to side and that's a lateral tilt so being\u00a0\naware of what's going on because that's like home\u00a0\u00a0 base and everything else is stacked on top of it\u00a0\nso if you are standing just think about try it\u00a0\u00a0 if you're standing really excessively arched like\u00a0\nthat it seems it's putting a lot of stress right\u00a0\u00a0 here right and that happens a lot you know if if\u00a0\nyou have a lot of weakness in your stomach muscles\u00a0\u00a0 because that the stomach muscles was\u00a0\nhelped like that so if you're pregnant\u00a0\u00a0 you have weakness in your stomach muscles it goes\u00a0\nwithout saying and then after you have a baby\u00a0\u00a0 you have weakness for sure so those are areas\u00a0\nwhere we have to kind of work during the day to\u00a0\u00a0 try to make sure where is our pelvis in space\u00a0\nyeah and that actually helps strengthen right\u00a0\u00a0 that makes so much sense and then you're actually\u00a0\nworking on strengthened during the day but you're\u00a0\u00a0 not if you're not aware of that piece and\u00a0\nyour your pelvis is actually in outer space\u00a0\u00a0 okay so what happens when you stand like this with\u00a0\nyour hips really tucked like that what what are\u00a0\u00a0 you feeling i feel a stretch in my abs and then\u00a0\ni feel like a stretch back here right and then\u00a0\u00a0 do you feel anything at your knees I would say an\u00a0\nadded pressure in the back right in my back and a\u00a0\u00a0 lot of people have what we call hyper extended\u00a0\nknees they stand like this all the time and\u00a0\u00a0 they're snapped back and they're hyper extended\u00a0\nright and so that is not a good thing over time\u00a0\u00a0 for your knees and so it's all kind of like\u00a0\ndominoes so if you're aware of where your pelvis\u00a0\u00a0 is it'll help with your knees now you might not be\u00a0\nable to move your pelvis very much if your knees\u00a0\u00a0 are snapped back so you got to soften the knees in\u00a0\norder to let your pelvis move so they shouldn't be\u00a0\u00a0 completely locked your knees when they are locked\u00a0\nyou're not using your quads and then your quads\u00a0\u00a0 become weak and then you can develop knee problems\u00a0\nwe could become a mess real quick and probably\u00a0\u00a0 over time so that's looking at our pelvis this\u00a0\nway now looking at our pelvis this way you know\u00a0\u00a0 what do you think the problem is there but I'm\u00a0\nnot a good dancer that you could lean too much\u00a0\u00a0 on one side what about with the baby oh the baby\u00a0\nand she doesn't I do how much and I have a 40-\u00a0\u00a0 45 pound baby I'm always telling you- I'm always\u00a0\ncarrying her on the right side and so she doesn't\u00a0\u00a0 have any pain now but she's setting up a sequelae\u00a0\nof things that can actually not be a good thing\u00a0\u00a0 when it all comes said and done for\u00a0\nwhatever reason i'm getting in trouble again\u00a0\u00a0 so she's developing weakness into this hip joint\u00a0\nand tightness on this side so if that's you try to\u00a0\u00a0 be aware of that so then moving down so we talked\u00a0\nabout our hips so and where our hips are can also\u00a0\u00a0 affect our head and we know we want our head over\u00a0\nthe shoulder so moving down we talked about the\u00a0\u00a0 knees and the last thing is your feet okay so what\u00a0\nyou have on your feet also affects your posture so\u00a0\u00a0 you know high heels you're just putting\u00a0\nyourself forward and that just completely\u00a0\u00a0 changes things now we all like our high heels\u00a0\nright but you have to be smart and choose when\u00a0\u00a0 you're going to wear them and if you're going\u00a0\nto be on your feet a lot right so wearing a good\u00a0\u00a0 supportive shoe is very helpful for your\u00a0\nposture especially if you are having pain\u00a0\u00a0 I can't tell you how many conversations I've\u00a0\nhad with patients who don't wear shoes in the\u00a0\u00a0 house and that is really important especially\u00a0\nif you're trying to get out of some type of pain\u00a0\u00a0 and I noticed that I've been telling you that\u00a0\nbecause I have a lot of hardwood floors and then\u00a0\u00a0 after my baby was born I was carrying her around\u00a0\nwith that added weight on hardwood floor and like\u00a0\u00a0 my feet yeah and barefoot because that's what I\u00a0\nbut I noticed the pain or socks same thing yeah\u00a0\u00a0 so having like some good foam slippers or tennis\u00a0\nshoes is what you'd recommend well foam slippers\u00a0\u00a0 isn't going to help cut it because what we\u00a0\nwant to do is we want to support the arch\u00a0\u00a0 because the arch you know your feet have\u00a0\na lot of muscles and ligaments in it but\u00a0\u00a0 when during pregnancy and and after the baby\u00a0\nyou still have those hormones circulating in you\u00a0\u00a0 and you probably have extra weight on you too and\u00a0\nall that kind of flattens that arch many women\u00a0\u00a0 feel that and we're going to actually talk about\u00a0\nthat in the next video i'm getting ahead of myself\u00a0\u00a0 so we're we're gonna rewind we\u00a0\ndon't want to keep you too long\u00a0\u00a0 so anyway in our next video with a video we're\u00a0\ngonna be talking about feet more about feet", "PDt_1OlxX5Y": "Hi this video is on how feet and what you\u00a0\nwear on your feet can contribute to your\u00a0\u00a0 pain when you're standing or it can actually\u00a0\ncause you pain so we are going to talk about\u00a0\u00a0 why this is so and then what you can do about it\u00a0\nokay now I know I for sure have had my problems\u00a0\u00a0 of pain in my feet over the years and I haven't\u00a0\nhad it for a long time because I finally figured\u00a0\u00a0 figured out that I needed to wear orthotics\u00a0\nand I always wear my shoes in the house and\u00a0\u00a0 so I've been good and I know you've been having\u00a0\nhad some foot pain in the past in the past but\u00a0\u00a0 you actually made the orthotics well that was a\u00a0\nlong time ago I was having some pretty serious\u00a0\u00a0 pain when I was like a child and that helped a\u00a0\nlot and I did have some pain when I was pregnant\u00a0\u00a0 because of all that weight you're carrying\u00a0\naround yes everything changes when you're\u00a0\u00a0 when you're pregnant and after you have that baby\u00a0\nthat's for sure so why we're gonna talk about why\u00a0\u00a0 and then what we can do so so why are our feet\u00a0\nso important we have 26 muscles and 30 bones\u00a0\u00a0 in each foot my god and so you know it's\u00a0\nvery intricate and it's there's a lot going\u00a0\u00a0 on down there at our feet and you know you\u00a0\nthink about it that's the base right so if\u00a0\u00a0 you have pain in your feet you're obviously\u00a0\ngoing to be walking differently but even if you\u00a0\u00a0 even if you don't your feet are what's helping\u00a0\nsupport you so you want to have good alignment\u00a0\u00a0 and when your feet are like turned in if you\u00a0\nhave flat feet that affects going up the chain\u00a0\u00a0 and that's been proven by research so that's\u00a0\na good reason why having good control or good\u00a0\u00a0 support on our feet can actually affect our back\u00a0\npain especially if we already have back pain\u00a0\u00a0 or hip pain or leg pain what is going on at the\u00a0\nfoot is very important and even more so during\u00a0\u00a0 pregnancy and postpartum because we have\u00a0\na lot of hormones circulating in our body\u00a0\u00a0 that makes all those ligaments a little bit looser\u00a0\nstretch out right plus we have more weight on\u00a0\u00a0 those feet a lot more weight so what can we do so\u00a0\nwe talked about the why so now what can we do so\u00a0\u00a0 awareness okay right we need to be aware of what's\u00a0\ngoing on at our feet and the biggest thing that I\u00a0\u00a0 can tell you and this is from experience treating\u00a0\nyou know hundreds of people really is that it's so\u00a0\u00a0 important to have something on your feet when\u00a0\nyou're walking on hardwood you know because\u00a0\u00a0 of the impact and a lot of people just take\u00a0\ntheir shoes off when they come in the house right\u00a0\u00a0 so that's fine that's good you know but i\u00a0\nwould also recommend that you have a pair\u00a0\u00a0 of shoes that you wear in the house I know I do\u00a0\nand you know if you're sitting around watching\u00a0\u00a0 tv you can take them off for sure but just have\u00a0\na good supportive shoe are your indoor shoes yeah\u00a0\u00a0 I know that we have had this conversation more\u00a0\nthan once flip-flops do not count yeah they do not\u00a0\u00a0 count as shoes I mean because even though there\u00a0\nis a little bit of cushion you don't have that\u00a0\u00a0 arch support no it does make a difference I know\u00a0\nI like to walk barefoot outside and everything\u00a0\u00a0 but I feel the difference especially so when\u00a0\nyou're outside if you're on the grass it's\u00a0\u00a0 a lot more forgiving and that's why you know\u00a0\nif you think about people back in in the cave\u00a0\u00a0 days they didn't have shoes right but they\u00a0\nwere on the ground and the ground gave some\u00a0\u00a0 you know it's not a hard surface right you have\u00a0\nthat impact right so that makes a difference\u00a0\u00a0 or if you're on the sand in the beach which is\u00a0\nthe one where I would wish I was right now but\u00a0\u00a0 so shoes on the feet good supportive shoes\u00a0\nin the house or when you're on hard surfaces\u00a0\u00a0 save the high heels for when you are not going\u00a0\nto be on your feet very long we all love them\u00a0\u00a0 yeah and I can't even tell you with the pandemic\u00a0\nwhen the last time I had a pair of heels right and\u00a0\u00a0 that maybe maybe bring a pair bring a pair of\u00a0\nwalking shoes or something to work to have right\u00a0\u00a0 and you do see that you do see people you do\u00a0\nsee women being smarter about that and not\u00a0\u00a0 walking you know as much in the airports with\u00a0\nhigh heeled shoes although every once in a\u00a0\u00a0 while you do see some young person doing that\u00a0\nanyway so that's that's that's my tip for you\u00a0\u00a0 on your feet and how it affects your posture\u00a0\nand how it can actually affect your pain our\u00a0\u00a0 next video is going to be on sitting we're taking\u00a0\nit down okay yes we'll see you in our next video", "ds0zxBkrr3E": "what you're about to see is a video animation describing the circumstances that caused the condition known as frozen shoulder syndrome recent research and patient outcome studies point to a different cause for frozen shoulder syndrome than once thought the shoulder joint is a complex structure that employs the use of many other joints and muscles to conduct the full range of movements realized in a healthy shoulder joint normally the upper arm bone known as the humerus can move freely in abduction 180 degrees frozen shoulder syndrome sufferers have a severe loss of abduction usually accompanied by considerable pain the first 120 degrees of abduction occurs freely without obstruction at 120 degrees the humerus runs directly into the a crow Mian process of the scapular bone and the soft tissues which lie just inferior to the a crow Mian process upon normal abduction of the upper arm at 120 degrees the serratus anterior and trapezius muscle engage the scapular bone and rotate it upwards this action allows the humerus to abduct the remaining 60 degrees so that the full 180 degrees of abduction can be expressed the problem in frozen shoulder syndrome occurs in the malfunction of the trapezius muscle to fully understand the malfunction of the trapezius muscle we must travel to the skull and the cervical spine the trapezius muscle receives its vital information from the spinal accessory nerve cranial nerve 11 which emanates in the brainstem and upper cervical spine the scenario of events the triggers frozen shoulder syndrome begins with the skull becoming locked in a single position and is guided there by a series of biomechanical movements these movements are headaches tension looking upward lateral flexion ear toward the shoulder and rotation to the opposite side of the lateral flexion this condition locks the head in an upward gaze the writing mechanism of the nervous system drives the lower cervical spine into forward flexion this position allows the head to face forward and the eyes to find the horizon line this position also gives the subject a visibly head forward posture the combination of the head being locked in extension and the lower cervical spine forced into flexion creates a tethering of the brainstem and upper cervical spine if the tethering force is great enough any nerve aligned in the tethered area will undergo a state of neuropraxia or motor paralysis ischemia or reduced blood flow and inflammation the affected nerve cannot function normally when the nerve involvement includes the spinal accessory nerve impaired function of the trapezius muscle occurs and consequently the shoulder movement is affected when this biomechanical relationship of the skull on the spine is corrected and normal tension and blood flow are restored to the brainstem the nervous system usually returns to normal the frozen shoulders syndrome is broken and the process of rehabilitation can begin", "7Eq2hy8BT4E": "[Music] japanese everything is japanese but assemble in indonesia malaysia vietnam is assembled um [Music] first

pain\u00a0\u00a0 or even possibly cause your pain we're going to\u00a0\ntalk about why and what you can do about it okay\u00a0\u00a0 so I know that I actually had pain with sitting\u00a0\nafter when I was working on my doctorate I was\u00a0\u00a0 sitting all the time and it was that chair it was\u00a0\nthe chair that I was in it was an old chair and it\u00a0\u00a0 had cushion but it didn't have enough cushion and\u00a0\nit was causing me pain so sometimes it can be as\u00a0\u00a0 simple as you know what you're sitting in right I\u00a0\ndon't know have you had any problems with sitting\u00a0\u00a0 well I did have problems I sometimes I narrate\u00a0\naudio books and so I was sitting but it wasn't the\u00a0\u00a0 chair it was actually the way that I was sitting\u00a0\nand I was leaning forward into the microphone and\u00a0\u00a0 that was kind of causing all kinds of problems\u00a0\nyeah so you can have a great chair like this\u00a0\u00a0 but if you're not using the back support it's\u00a0\nnot going to do a whole lot so now why we'll go\u00a0\u00a0 we'll start at the beginning why does that cause\u00a0\npain well our bodies are held together by our\u00a0\u00a0 muscles ligaments and joints and if we hang\u00a0\nout too far one way or the other from where\u00a0\u00a0 what we call neutral we can put a lot of\u00a0\nstress and strain on those uh structures\u00a0\u00a0 and then just by sitting too much or\u00a0\njust not getting that blood circulating\u00a0\u00a0 enough so any posture that you're in for too long\u00a0\nis just not going to feel that great especially\u00a0\u00a0 if you're dealing with any kind of pain or if uh\u00a0\nyou're you know pregnant or postpartum that you\u00a0\u00a0 are going to be sitting a lot eating that baby\u00a0\npostpartum right we're going to talk about that\u00a0\u00a0 in in a few minutes but you have a lot of changes\u00a0\ngoing on in your body already so to be aware of\u00a0\u00a0 what what's going on when you're sitting is really\u00a0\nimportant okay so what can we do about it so\u00a0\u00a0 the what can you do so this is a theme I\u00a0\ndon't know if you noticed it is awareness We have to be aware of how we're sitting so I'm\u00a0\nsitting here not even you know in a chair with\u00a0\u00a0 the back support but I mean I if I'm not aware of\u00a0\nmy posture I can be sitting with that whole slump\u00a0\u00a0 thing that we were talking about a few videos back\u00a0\nwe want to be aware of our pelvis so the awareness\u00a0\u00a0 comes in what is our pelvis doing because if we\u00a0\ncan get this correct then or better then it's\u00a0\u00a0 going to be better because our body follows\u00a0\nthe pelvis so if our pelvis is tipped back\u00a0\u00a0 our head tends to go forward and\u00a0\nif our pelvises that tip forward\u00a0\u00a0 we tend to have a nice arch in our back so it's\u00a0\npretty much that whole anterior posterior tilt\u00a0\u00a0 that we talked about in standing and that actually\u00a0\nfeeds into the slump so being aware of how we're\u00a0\u00a0 sitting we want to sit on our sit bones so our\u00a0\nsit bones you know are the bones right at the\u00a0\u00a0 bottom okay so you want to lean forward in your\u00a0\nchair and scoot your hips back so scoot them back\u00a0\u00a0 and then you're going to think about pulling\u00a0\nyour cheeks out actually and sitting wide\u00a0\u00a0 so that you're not sitting tucked in especially\u00a0\nif you're having any tailbone pain or pain at\u00a0\u00a0 the bottom yeah so you're sitting and you then\u00a0\nyou come back up and you're actually perched\u00a0\u00a0 on your pelvis and that's kind of where you\u00a0\nare you're meant to be okay does that feel\u00a0\u00a0 it's different no it definitely feels good\u00a0\nand it makes sense that you don't want to sit\u00a0\u00a0 narrow that you want to use the entirety of your\u00a0\npelvis too and the entirety of your back yeah\u00a0\u00a0 entire buttock so what therapists call sacral\u00a0\nsitting you want to avoid this is your sacrum\u00a0\u00a0 and if you sit like this you call it's called\u00a0\nsacral a therapist called sacral sitting\u00a0\u00a0 and that's you know you can do it once in a while\u00a0\nyou can do it if you're whatever but if it's a\u00a0\u00a0 habit it's these habits that we want to avoid so\u00a0\nthinking about your pelvis and where it is using\u00a0\u00a0 a back support if you have one if it's a straight\u00a0\nstraighter back chair you know that's going to be\u00a0\u00a0 different than having a chair like this yeah you\u00a0\ncan use a towel roll if you need to put a little\u00a0\u00a0 bit of support in your back I know on my couch I\u00a0\nfeel more comfortable if I have a pillow behind\u00a0\u00a0 my back and you can just use the towel to\u00a0\ndo that one thing that I really found that\u00a0\u00a0 one thing I yeah because it depends on your chair\u00a0\nwhether or not you need support yeah it depends\u00a0\u00a0 on your back too so one thing I have found that\u00a0\npeople that are sitting at the computer a lot\u00a0\u00a0 they tend to lean forward to see the screen\u00a0\nand then they're not using their back support\u00a0\u00a0 and then it's causing them pain if they're\u00a0\nalready having hip pain or groin pain that\u00a0\u00a0 it's causing more so being aware of how you're\u00a0\nsitting the chair you're sitting in and whether\u00a0\u00a0 you're using a back support feet on the ground I\u00a0\njust treated somebody that was short and her feet\u00a0\u00a0 didn't hit the ground right and I realized I mean\nI'm tall and you're tall so we never have that\u00a0\u00a0 problem but if you are short putting a foot rest\u00a0\non the body on the floor so that your feet can be\u00a0\u00a0 up so that you're you you're not having all\u00a0\nthat pressure in the back of your knee yeah\u00a0\u00a0 and it really it makes it much more comfortable\u00a0\ndo not sit too long that is a big thing get up\u00a0\u00a0 move around if you can breastfeeding I think\u00a0\nwe're going to just do a whole another video\u00a0\u00a0 on bottle feeding and breastfeeding because it's\u00a0\nnot going to pertain to everybody but I've got\u00a0\u00a0 some tips for you on that too so stay tuned and\u00a0\nwe'll do that on our next video sit well sit well", "v2tovS6X9G8": "hi guys is know slowly than here and today I'm going to do a product review on Mary's medicinal CBD capsules so Mary's medicinals makes capsules in various cannabinoid ratios but today we're going to talk specifically about the CBD ones that I have my hands they actually could come in one or two type of containers I don't know why that sometimes they come in two smaller ones and sometimes the bigger one this specifically contains five capsules each so five capsules five capsules but just different containers so don't be thrown off by that at all let's look at the labels because that's the most important right before we dive in or do anything so it's um this label is very basic it just says Mary's Mary's medicinal CBD capsules and this is five capsules in there okay and then over here it has some instructions it says take one to two capsules as needed do not take on an empty stomach it has the ingredient list which we love because we always want to make sure that we're not using products with ingredients that don't agree with us okay so I always check out the ingredient list and if it doesn't have the ingredient listing don't take the product so with this product we have passed powdered cellulose vegan capsules cannabis extract cumulus and beta Kara Filene and Lila not all so those last two things are terpene so now we know that this is enriched with terpenes which are important because turkeys provide medicinal value and then it has some nutritional facts over here which is pretty much zero zero calories zero fat no sugar zero everything there's nothing about that when you open it the capsules are inside and here's an example of a capsule it looks just like a capsule it's actually kind of a big capsule so if you don't like taking pills you might not think in this one because it's not like a little tiny one it's kind of big and it's filled with the with the cannabis that's what it's filled with okay now the other important thing if you've been watching my videos you should know that we always look for lab testing if your cannabis product has not been lab tested do not take it okay so this one has been and usually it's always a white label somewhere on it or on the back okay with this one it tells us that the total THC is 0.15 milligrams total CBD is 4.8 milligrams and then our total CP in is point zero one milligrams so this is interesting right because this was supposed to be a hundred percent CBD but through lab testing we see that it has 0.15 milligrams of THC which really isn't isn't much at all is 0.15 but at least you know there's a tiny bit TC in there in case you want it absolutely zero TC now the THC content is so minimal that it's not going to provide a psychoactive effects you're not gonna feel the high because primarily this product is all CBD it's just that this is whole plant medicine and what whole plant medicine is means is that this product came from a true marijuana plant that they instructed it from and when it does that whole plant cannabis even though you do extract the CBD from the different other cannabinoids within the whole plant they're still going to be traces of THC they're simply because it was part of the plant which is a good thing because there is the thing called the entourage effect and we need a little THC to help our CBD work a little bit better so it's okay even though it's just a small amount and it really won't affect it but that's important and then this says that it was manufactured prior to 2018 okay that I don't like because on other products that I've reviewed they actually tell you the manufacturing dates and they tell you the expiration date this does not give me an expiration date it just and it doesn't even really tell me when it was manufactured so I think Mary's medicinals should work on providing more accurate information regarding the dates but as far as everything else I think that it's a great product I'm easy to use you simply um swallow the capsule like I said any time that you swallow something it turns into an edible so the effects are dependent upon how fast your metabolism is for it to kick in for some people the effects can start within 30 minutes for other people it can take up to two hours so you want to be very careful and plan accordingly when you're taking any type of capsule overall I give Mary's medicinal CBD capsules a thumb up if you have any questions just let me know [Music]", "iCA2XEaRZRA": "hi there i'm lucy mcdonald physiotherapist welcome back to my virtual clinic today i'm super excited to introduce you to a special guest mr nick faran who is a consultant shoulder and elbow surgeon and we're going to be talking about frozen shoulder so nick is there anything else that you would like to add before we get uh stuck into the frozen shoulder uh firstly lucy i'd say thanks for having me it's good to collaborate and uh learn from each other and discuss topics like frozen shoulders that are common but still challenging um i'm a consultant shoulder and album surgeon in london uh sort of northwest and central london and i do both nhs and private practice if patients want to get in touch and ask questions they can get in touch via my website which is www.shoulderandelbolondon.com and i also have a youtube channel with other videos and patient information and advice really helpful thank you so let's crack on i mean probably the uh the best way to start is just to ask the question what is a frozen shoulder sure um so frozen shoulders is a common condition in the uk uh that affects patients usually in that term that we all hate middle age from about 40 to 65. it's more common in women than in men and diabetics get a more aggressive form of the disease but most of my patients who have frozen shoulder are not diabetic we don't fully understand the cause but in most cases frozen shoulder wouldn't have an obvious cause or injury um but some shoulder conditions pre-existing shoulder conditions can trigger it and it's thoughts that it's an inflammatory process that happens within the joints and that's why it's got another name which is adhesive capsulitis and we think that there is inflammation in the joint lining that inflammation causes pain that pain causes muscle spasm which restricts a bit of movement and then as the disease progresses that joint lining becomes thickened and scarred and that causes the sort of global stiffness that can happen uh later on um so in a nutshell that's what it is an inflammatory disease that eventually leads to thickening and scarring of the joint capsule that starts off as a painful condition and then becomes a condition that's predominated by stiffness interesting and um i guess if people are watching this perhaps they've got shoulder pain themselves how do they know if it's a frozen shoulder that's causing their pain or perhaps something else well as i say early on it's a little bit difficult um because the first sort of symptoms are usually pain without a history of injury and it's something that will gradually come on and i think patients initially might ignore the symptoms at first and then as they progressively become more intrusive they become aware of it early on the pain can be very non-descript usually in the shoulder region patients point to their sort of deltoid region can sometimes go down to the arm and in frozen shoulder the pain is usually more common at night and patients find it uncomfortable to lay on the affected side but it's only when the stiffness starts that patients start to become aware and it makes it easier for us as clinicians to pick this out as a frozen shoulder when it's when the stiffness isn't yet present it's very difficult to tell it from other conditions that can cause shoulder pain and some of the common uh stiffness um that patients notice especially early on would be things like difficulty putting their arm into a jacket reaching a seat belt from behind and then eventually reaching up to high objects etc but it's usually reaching out to the side external rotation movements that first start to be affected and then as the condition gets worse they can they can struggle with all movements absolutely and and if someone is watching this and um suspects they're kind of listening to what you're saying and they're thinking oh gosh that that sounds like me what are the um treatment options um available and i guess within the similar sort of uh categories what what's likely to be the outcome of of the condition because obviously it and they're probably thinking oh gosh that all sounds terribly um scary although that physiological process but but what are the treatment options and and what's the outcome likely to be sure okay well i guess it's probably helpful for us to try and talk about natural history how the disease normally progresses if you do nothing and full condition it then progresses to having issues with pain and stiffness then the pain settles and the stiff phase can stay for quite a long time and we used to tell patients that if you leave frozen shoulder alone for uh it would get better on its own in about two years but we now know from some scandinavian studies that up to seven years patients still have symptoms in their shoulder and the treatment options you might use depend on how they present so if they present early on in the disease where there isn't much stiffness but it's predominantly pain then things like anti-inflammatory drugs physiotherapy to try and uh help address some of the triggers and some of the adaptations in movement that develop and prevent stiffness can be quite useful and if you can nip the the condition early in the bud they may not get to that stiffness phase as a surgeon most the patients that come to me are really stiff and then the the options for management vary so first line of treatment in my hands would be a steroid injection into the shoulder joint and that's something that can be done straight away in clinic once we confirm the diagnosis and i would expect that patients would get back to normal activity in about 50 percent of cases other options for management uh include hydro dilatation that's a more complex injection it's usually done under ultrasound guidance and uh uses high volume of fluid but also steroid so it is like a large steroid injection and the current evidence base shows the hydro dilatation and injection patients end up being the same at about a year if you fail these interventions physiotherapy steroid injections anti-inflammatories and the shoulder is predominantly stiff then you have two options really wait it out and see if it'll you know improve on its own or if that stiffness is actually limited limiting work recreation etc then the next step is some form of surgical intervention and with surgery we have two options uh the less favored option is something called the manipulation under anesthetic where we put patients to sleep and we crank on their arm and it tears that that thickened scarred capsule and freeze up movement but that's quite a brutal process it's a short operation but quite brutal and is uncontrolled and so a more finessed approach is an arthroscopic capsular release which is a keyhole operation where we look inside the joint and we use instruments to take away the scar tissue from inside the joint and that frees up the movement in the joint both manipulation under anaesthetic and arthroscopic capsular release which is my preference require about three months of physiotherapy afterwards to maintain that movement and then get the shoulders strong again and if patients weren't going to be compliant with physiotherapy i wouldn't do surgery yeah yeah it's really interesting um hearing you talk through all those three because obviously as a physio i've seen um patients throughout those three stages and and um i know that we were talking about it uh earlier that in private practice sometimes we see patients a bit earlier so actually the ability um as physios to get in there and try and prevent that stiffness phase and therefore um the results the the how long they end up having it for um actually can be less than two years if as you say you can get in there really quite quickly and you can get that the mechanics of the shoulder working you can um really reduce the pain uh using hands-on techniques and and exercises and as i say specifically working on that biomechanics that can be really helpful but i've also seen um patients who've come to me having had steroid injections and again that can be so helpful again to reduce the pain and and and get the movement back and then even in that last stage as well so i think what's interesting is that people sometimes and i'm sure you can and you can vouch for this is that people want a quick fix and and physio isn't a quick fix but un unfortunately in this condition you are going to need to do some physio at some point along the line so irrespective of the intervention it's unfortunately not just a a quick fix but yeah i totally agree i think that there is a role for physiotherapy in some cases if the patient's in a very painful inflammatory phase if the physio focus is mostly repetitive exercise that can flare up that painful phase and i think that if the patient gets significantly stiff then the amount of adaptive movement they've got to do is going to be you know difficult physio to totally address but even if physio didn't work pre-surgery for instance you're not getting away from physio if you have an operation so so we do work closely with physiotherapists and as surgeons we are a bit biased because there will be a lot of frozen shoulder that physios have sorted out in the community and we only get to see the ones where the physios have sent to us because they're not progressing so [Music] as a surgeon it's easy to then think oh maybe there's no rule for physio preoperatively in in frozen shoulder but i don't think that's correct i think that especially if they're caught early then physio is very effective obviously if the stiffness progresses to a point where the patient can't be functional then they're going to struggle and i think the same thing with a steroid injection i think the steroid injection patients that i have who've had their injection earlier on have made a quick response and a good recovery versus the ones who i see where they come to me six months to a year on i think a steroid injection then is going to be less likely and then we have to talk about that one group the diabetics because if you're diabetic and have frozen shoulder no matter which treatment option they have a more aggressive more resistant form of the disease they're more likely to fail a steroid injection more likely to to have uh problems with even recovering after surgery and unfortunately for diabetics as well they can have they're more likely to have bilateral frozen shoulder at the same time so have it in both shoulders at the same time which is really unfortunate to have two painful stiff shoulders all in one go hugely restricting yeah um and i i um i really appreciate what you said about the that um physio and i think this is really important for our viewers to understand is that if you're doing physio and physio exercises and they're excruciatingly painful it is not the right uh way to go about things because if you're trying to do exercises and and they're causing a lot of pain all that happens is everything goes into spasm and then you're trying to um you're trying to move uh contracted muscles which just isn't gonna work and so yeah i think that's really key is if people are watching this and they're thinking oh i've had physio and i've been doing loads and loads of as you say repetitive painful exercise it's just just not gonna it needs to be a little bit more i liked your word finesse earlier it needs to be a little bit more um tailored to their uh to the individual yeah i i do think that that and that is a problem that we see where some patients with frozen shoulder have tried physiotherapy and it could be because of the stage or it could be because of the technique but they find that it's made the symptoms worse it's become more painful um and and then we try to intervene usually with just a steroid injection we almost never um would use surgery as a first line um there are a couple instances where surgery as a first line is appropriate but they're very very finite yeah yeah absolutely um so um i think probably you and i could talk about this topic for a very very long time um just to let our viewers know that i will be producing a video about the physio side of things so i'm not going to cover that um now but i will be producing um videos about how you can uh look after yourself the exercises that are good those that are not that sort of thing so um please do um subscribe and tune in and uh and do um do watch that um is there anything that you would like to add um nick before we wrap up today uh well also that uh their resources as well on my website and my youtube channel around frozen shoulder um i've got some videos um talking about the surgery itself and the risks i've got uh content on my website about steroid injections etc so if a patient wanted you know that to understand what happens to them if they've been referred to me for frozen shoulder the kind of processes we do investigations etc uh the frozen shoulder page on my on my um on my website is is pretty useful yeah and i'll put in the link underneath this video to your website because there's very few surgeons that i know who um who create as much content and try to empower their patients um as much as you it's really really um fantastic and i know that our viewers will be incredibly grateful for not just your time today but for all the work that you put in to to um to empower people with the with the knowledge that they need so thank you on on their behalf and also on my behalf because it's been an absolute pleasure talking to you today yeah no problem saying it's been a pleasure i'm happy to collaborate if you want to cover the topics and also if any of your viewers have questions from a surgical point of view that i haven't covered on my youtube channel i'm always creating content you know i try to do a batch of videos a couple times a year and release content as much as i can so if they leave comments in the comments section with any questions they want answered that maybe weren't covered then i can try and do that cover that in a future video amazing thank you thank you well thank you very much indeed um mr nick faran who is a shoulder and elbow consultant in london and as i say i will leave his contact details um in the video below so that's all from us today please do subscribe to please do check out uh the playlist on uh this channel um and in until the next time let me know what you would like me to do a video on next thanks everyone bye", "8KSfNzPpW18": "glucosamine is a popular dietary supplement usually marketed for arthritis but is it possible it may have other effects in the body such as helping the skin look better so that's going to the topic of this video hey guys it's Joe Cannon from supplement clarity calm and Joe - Canada come and today's video is going to be a best about that the research on glucosamine perhaps noting that it can help wrinkles and age spots and maybe help the skin appear more youthful there is research in this and as always I want to focus on the human studies so give you that'll give you a better idea this is right for you let's jump right into it and see what we can get so what the heck is glucosamine well it is a type of sugar and I usually we extract this stuff from the exoskeletons of lobsters and crayfish and stuff like that you know it best as an arthritis supplement yeah there's some various studies over the years noting that perhaps glucosamine may help arthritis but that's not going to be the topic for today we're gonna talk about the skin effects of glucosamine and before we go any further I want you to realize that there's three different types of glucosamine out there and I'm telling you this in case you're doing your own research there is glucosamine sulfate glucosamine HCl and the last one is n/a G and acetyl glucosamine now all these have essentially very similar chemical structures I'm highlighting the number three in the list n AG because that is the version of glucosamine that seems to get the most attention when it involves skin health okay and and again that's something that you should be maybe perhaps looking for in various products I've never got a good reason why companies are choosing n AG over say glucosamine sulfate or HCl but that's what the research is showing okay now how might glucosamine help the skin well it's thought that there may be a variety different ways such as we know that glucosamine helps us make hyaluronic acid hyaluronic acid acts kind of like a glue between cells it holds them together and in doing so it improves the moisture content the hydration if you will of the skin and that can plump up wrinkles and improve the texture the skin that makes sense glucosamine can also approve seems to help wound healing it may inhibit an enzyme involved in melanin production production and that's why many people may promote it for age spot reduction and and then there may be an anti inflammation component to glucosamine as well okay all this sounds good what's the research say again what's the human research say well we've got this investigation which is kind of interesting we've got efficacy of glucosamine sulfate and skin aging results of an ex-vivo anti aging model and clinical trial so we've got eight women over the age of 50 their Caucasian women and they're given glucosamine sulfate 250 milligrams a day for two months these researchers noted that when they took biopsies of the skin they saw improvements in the production of various types of collagen and there were there appear to be some genetic changes that favored the reduction again of collagen and other compounds like hyaluronic acid which can help support skin health now this study did not look at wrinkles didn't show that we know people got less wrinkles or wrinkles went away or anything like that rather this study basically said the writing's on the wall seems to say that taking glucosamine maybe in this dosage seems to help support healthy skin okay that's interesting what else we got so here's another investigation this study again involved women there was 22 women they were given either a placebo or they're given a thousand milligrams of n-acetyl glucosamine for two months the women ranged in age from about 25 to about 35 years of age the and these researchers noted that after 2 months of taking this product as nsl glucosamine supplement and that the moisture in the area below the left eye had increased significantly that's their words why the left eye only I have no idea no no idea about that and then other research others other studies they did on the on the skin seem to show that the n-acetyl glucosamine improved the roughness of these women's skin so the skin appeared less ruff now all this is interesting one thing I did notice with this investigation because I when I looked at it was that I didn't see any before-and-after pictures and normally when you're talking skin and improvements you know I it's my observation that people will you know post before-and-after pictures and I didn't see any hair which makes me think that you know while the effects may have been significant they may not have been significant to the naked eye looking at it again that's just my own observation take that for what it is now I've got some other pictures I am gonna show you in some other studies so let's move on from here so I mentioned a little while ago glucosamine seems to play a role in inhibiting an enzyme involved in the production of melanin too much melanin is responsible for age spots so we've got this interesting study it's a 10-week investigation involving a topical cream that is essentially a 2% n-acetyl glucosamine cream plus a 4% niacinamide component as well niacinamide is niacin nice and it's quite popular in anti-aging creams it has an anti-inflammatory effect and on another note niacin is actually quite popular in the world of anti-aging because it appears to increase the production of nad and I'll post links to my other videos on how to raise nad levels naturally niacin is quite popular there are some supplements that can raise nad levels but I linked it at the video so you can see more about that if you're curious essentially here they find that when the women took the combination of NAC energy and anise no glucose I mean that there was less age spots on the face and the skin appeared better okay what's this looking like so here's some before and after pictures that were in the study we've got the before well on the Left we've got before on the right we've got the after and as you can see on the top of the screen here this is what it was before the cream use and here it is after I see a difference I mean it looks different than me this said you know so I think that's I to me that's significant I don't see a difference with this spot here but I don't see anything up here anymore I don't see anything here anymore if I look down at the other other individual it depicted in this picture I see some age spots here I see a little less here but I also do see less redness in the skin I maybe that's just my eyes playing shook something you tell me what you see I would say the top picture is a little more dramatic than the bottom picture so again I'll leave that to your your your good judgement of whether this is a significant effect for you okay now in terms of skin firming research I left that what I think might be the best for last this is interesting this is an investigation of a cream involved 16 weeks again of people we've got women were taken these were Caucasian women by the way 42 women were given this cream it was actually called NeoStrata I'll link to that in the description so you could check it out it contained n-acetyl glucosamine and other ingredients as well and they took before-and-after pictures and they noted that the this NeoStrata cream appeared to in crew improve the texture of the neck and reduce wrinkles and fine lines and and as in their in their words provided a more youthful firm appearance of the skin what the pictures look like well you judge for yourself so here's one picture of one individuals neck looks significantly different to me I got before over here on the left you got the after over here on the right I do see a big difference over here compared to over here I see less redness down here okay compared to after 12 weeks of use okay so that's one picture here's another one again much less redness around the top of the clavicle area here before versus after this whole area looks much much less red and and and pitted if you will from age spots again this big line right here in the neck I looks much less noticeable over here again I've got some lines over here on the right I don't see them as much over here at all so this looks pretty dramatic to me and I got one more to show you here we go again less redness less pitted marks if you will from age spots here's before weeks zero after s a week 816 I see much less this line over here on the left much less noticeable okay the same thing over here I see a line over here much less noticeable here again this whole area looks much better to me very interesting this whole whatever this thing is I don't know what this but it's going this might actually just be a pimple so maybe don't take that too signatu significantly I think that might be a pimple to me but I could be wrong this is an interesting investigation again involving product called NeoStrata one thing I did notice about this study when I looked at it it was listed as a poster presentation it does appear in a journal but again I wonder if it went through the peer reviewed process again I couldn't tell from the study when I read it it's just something maybe to keep in the back of your mind so a couple thoughts I have after looking over the various studies now the first thing I'd point out to you is that most of the studies involve small numbers of women they're usually Caucasian women and there and overall there's not a lot of studies to date there's probably more gonna be in the pipeline most of the investigations appear to be done by Procter & Gamble I also saw L'Oreal in a couple of the studies as well makes sense they've got anti-aging products and skin firming products so it makes sense they would support some of this research and conducted themselves and then my other point of takeaway might would be that do significant difference in differences mean real meaningful differences as you can see in some of the studies I mentioned you know I didn't see before and after pictures and some of the studies which makes me think that maybe the naked eye might be it may not be able to tell the difference and in some of the other studies I did see a difference so I leave that to everybody's own discretion to decide for themselves whether significant differences clinically mean real meaningful differences to you okay so does glucosamine work does it help the skin well I'm intrigued by some of the research I've seen I'm pretty intrigued by that NeoStrata study I'd like to see a few more studies and again I think do result think results are gonna vary from person to person very about on say how bad skin damage is but on the plus side you know glucosamine is not too expensive and some of the products I saw weren't too expensive either so you tell me if you've tried any of these products let me know what happens I'll be interested to hear your take on things again I'll put links to some of my other relevant videos in the description so you could check out some other products which may help the skin as well until next time guys I am Joe Cannon go out make a difference and have a great day take care bye bye", "-gKyTzHxbMM": "[Music] hello everybody thank you for attending our webinar my name is rebecca hart and i'm the marketing manager and account manager at nanocomposix today we're very excited to host our long-time collaborators from the university of minnesota uh dr john bischoff and dr kanov they are leading experts in choir preservation and nanowarming technology the work dr bischoff and his team and unit at university of minnesota are doing currently is truly exceptional and they're working on groundbreaking technology in crier preserve prior require preservation of tissue and cell models for critical research i also have dr aaron saunders our chief scientist and all around nanotechnology expert at nanocomposix as well as sage olsen our digital communications coordinator who is running our technical support in the background during the webinar you may ask us any questions you have by using the q a feature if you don't already have the q a panel popped up on your screen please look for the q a button at the bottom portion of your zoom window we'll try to answer as many questions as we have time for at the end of today's presentation as for native composix we are currently partnering with university of minnesota by supplying materials for their research and development if you're unfamiliar with nanocomposix for over 15 years we've been providing customers with nanoparticles that are precisely engineered and highly characterized some of the attributes that are vital for work such as this additionally our diverse team of scientists work hand-in-hand with academia and businesses to help integrate nanotechnology into their solutions one of those scientists dr saunders today will start us off by providing a brief introduction on our nanoparticles and describe how photofoam real properties of this material play a large role in nanoworming research underway at university of minnesota without further ado i'd like to introduce dr saunders thanks for the introduction rebecca to start with today i'd like to give you a quick overview of some of the nanomaterials and nanomaterial properties that are useful for designing photothermal therapies and other applications at nanocomposix we use a wide variety of nanoparticles in molecular and biomolecule building blocks to help develop and enable new technologies today we'll focus primarily on the use of golden silver particles of different sizes and shapes the reason for that is that these materials among others have unique optical properties that depend on their size shape and environment the bottom left image shows transmission electron microscope images of different sizes of gold spheres solutions of those colloidal gold particles of different sizes are shown at the top left and you can see how the visible appearance changes with size we can quantify the change in size of the solution extinction by measuring the solution extinction by uv visible spectroscopy and the optical density as a function of wavelength is shown at the right here you see a peak that shifts with particle size due to a surface plasmon resonance a response that's unique to particles in this native scale size range these unique optical properties arise due to the collective movement of free electrons in the metal particles in response to applied light waves previously we saw that the wavelength where this plasma resonance occurs for gold nanospheres is in the green portion of the spectrum but by controlling the particle composition and morphology the wavelength where this resonance occurs can be tuned across the spectrum one of the benefits of the clonal synthesis routes that we use at nanocomposix is that by controlling the chemistry during the synthesis we can tune the size and shape of different materials in order to tune their properties and here you see some examples of shape control using different gold and silver based materials by controlling that particle size and shape instead of having just a red appearing solution we can shift that optical response to different portions of the spectrum giving rise to the very vividly colored solutions that you see here and then looking at different classes of these gold and silver particles you can see how by tuning the size and shape and aspect ratio of this materials we can tune that resonance across the visible spectrum and throughout the near infrared for use in different applications one of the other unique properties of these nanoparticles in addition to be able in addition to being able to tune where that resonance occurs is that their optical response can involve both the scattering and absorption of light and that can take part in different portions of the spectrum shown here is a glass cup dating from the roman times that that has gold nanoparticles embedded into the glass and these are two different images of the same cup which you see on the left hand side if you shine white light directly onto the front of the cup is that it selectively reflects green light back to us if you shine light through the cup as you see on the right hand side here the particles in the glass either absorb or scatter the blue and the green light and only selectively transmit red light through the glass the balance between this absorption and scattering depends on all those factors that we mentioned earlier and selecting a material with a particular split between absorption and scattering is important in a variety of technologies including photothermal applications and in order to understand that scattering and absorption split we use a variety of techniques ranging from modeling to more complicated optical measurements in order to selectively measure either the scattering response or that absorption response that absorption in particular is critical for photothermal heating and the absorption of light and that transfer to heat is a key aspect of the different particles that we use this transfer occurs when light excites the electrons in our nanoparticle those electrons from their excited state they can transfer that energy to the atoms in the particle causing them to vibrate and heat up and then that heat from the particles can be transferred to the surrounding environment and when it does so depending on our use we can selectively damage surrounding cells produce a heat signature for detection drive different types of reactions using that heat or depending on the particle design it could release a molecular cargo for a particular application we can measure and quantify this photothermal response for different materials in a variety of ways one way is by showing laser light on the solution of nanoparticles we can measure the energy that's delivered from the laser we can measure the energy that's absorbed by the particles and then we can measure the temperature change in the solution as a function of time as the nanoparticles heat their surrounding and if we do so we see temperature profiles that look like what's shown on the left whereas we apply laser light to the material we see a gradual heating of the solution and then as we turn off the laser at a set time point we see the heat further dissipated to the surroundings and the overall solution temperature drops go back and i'll say that we can use this measured temperature change along with our understanding of the particle optical properties in order to understand how we would choose a particle for a particular photothermal application and to understand how its efficiency compares across different materials or types of materials there are a number of photothermal base applications that are different stages in development some of the early applications in this area using nanoparticles were dermatology related using nanoparticle formulations for hair removal and acne treatments for example and there are several examples of products that have gone through clinical trials and been used commercially in clinical settings there are a number of other in-vivo treatments or applications using nanoparticles for photothermal cancer treatments or therapeutics for example that are moving through clinical trials and at various points in the regulatory process and for these materials in addition to their optical properties it's critical that the particles are also designed to ensure biocompatibility and to make sure that both the particles and the surface chemistry is tuned in non-toxic to people or other environments where they're being used and as part of that those nanoparticles need to be manufactured in a way that meets all the regulatory requirements that the fda or other bodies would require for their use in addition there are a wide variety of other photo thermal enabled applications ranging from diagnostics to tissue preservation that are now in development and on that note i'm very happy to now hand the presentation over to our collaborators at the university of minnesota to talk more about these applications and their exciting work about using these nanoparticles to develop new technologies so i wanted to thank nanocomposix and dr saunders and also rebecca for inviting us to present some of the work that we've been doing at the university of minnesota in collaboration with a number of other institutions i will also thank dr koslow who's going to share with you some particularly exciting work on aquatic species crowd preservation after i give you a general overview of some of the work that we're doing at the bioheat and mass transfer lab at the university of minnesota and also in a new nsf engineering research center called the atp bio which stands for advanced technologies for the preservation of biological systems so the the erc is really focused on societal benefits that can be realized through the banking transportation and storage of biological systems so you see uh initially cell therapies there on the upper left these are really the drugs of tomorrow and so if we can bank them and store them with high viability so they can be easily used they will increase patient access and outcomes we're also working on transplantable tissues and organs which can allow the right organ and tissue to get to the right person at the right time in terms of transplantation we're also working on drug discovery through off-the-shelf banking of tissues and cells and this will actually shrink the cost of the greater than two billion dollars a drug that you can see in biopharma in terms of their development costs we're also banking transgenic lines and also genetic models and uh uh conoff we'll be talking to you about some of that in just a moment uh some of that technology is also being applied to banking whole ecosystems like coral reefs and actually there's a conversation underway in terms of creating a fauna bank something like what exists in norway for seeds which is called svalbard we also can use these technologies towards aquaculture creating cryo seed so these are embryos that can be brought out of cryogenic storage at any time of the year instead of just when the fish or the aquatic species might seasonally procreate and this will increase aquaculture production we can also bank tissues and bio dressing for mass casualty events such as the volcano eruption in new zealand there would be skin available and perhaps some of those people could have been saved and also studying trauma uh rather stabilization in torpor that could improve trauma and battlefield injury so these are the very big ideas that govern uh our erc and i just want to say this is a the one of the largest maybe it's the largest nsf uh national science foundation centra grant and so this has been 26 million dollar five-year investment 33 faculty across five institutions uh it is renewable for another five years so it's a very big undertaking so it really focuses on increasing as i said uh storage and banking and then giving uh the opportunity for transportation and really increasing increasing accessibility to these uh biological systems and so if we take organs as an example today we can hypothermic restore them basically putting them on ice for a couple of hours and with these new technologies that are coming online for instance supercooling at massachusetts general hospital we can extend liver preservation to days now which is really exciting and may change the way we do organ allocation in the united states and perhaps even the world and there are newer technologies like partial freezing where we can learn from nature there's a frog that can survive in the frozen state with 65 percent of its water actually in the frozen state rana silvatica and if we can harness some of that potential then we could do that to organs as well and that might give us weeks or even months of storage and then the real focus that you'll hear about in the rest of this talk is trying to get to indefinite storage through a process called vitrification and as an engineer this is really focused on modification of temperature pressure and concentration in these systems to actually get a an organ into a glass-like state instead of a frozen state and you can see an example of that on the bottom left and so as we go to these lower temperatures you can obviously see the storage duration increases the metabolic suppression also goes uh goes up as you as you drop the temperature and that is really the goal so if we could go to the next slide so the problem that we're addressing one of the problems that we're addressing is of course getting to those preserved states and there are these multiple example technologies that i just talked to you about but one of the bigger problems that we've had is getting rapid and uniform recovery or warming from the cryogenic state and that's what we have had this longer term collaboration with nanocomposix on so we're actually using both magnetic as well as photothermal nanoparticles to rapidly and uniformly reform these systems and that's what you'll you'll hear about for the rest of this talk and also uh conops talk to follow so we can do this at multiple scales if you look in the upper left you can see examples of droplets these are millimeter scale droplets in which you can have embryos or cells or a variety of systems if you cool them rapidly enough they will vitrify if you can't they will crystallize and the same thing exists on the way back up as you're trying to warm you want to keep it vitrified until it actually goes into liquid state or you will crystallize and and destroy the sample that then can be scaled up to the next level in tissues which you see in the middle a vitrified versus a crystallized example those large white areas of crystals have been destructive to this to the tissues and then on the far right it's the same organ system i just showed you where you are vitrified or in a glassy state on the far right and you're frozen which is essentially destroying the vasculature in the cells on the left and in order to come back from these successfully vitrified states if you haven't actually destroyed them on the way down we need speed to avoid de-vitrification which you see in the middle there and you also need uniformity so like when you drop an ice cube in a glass of water it always cracks and the reason for that is that you're bringing up the temperature very rapidly on the sides but not in the center and so we want to distribute the heating throughout the system and we want the heating to be fast and so those are the two things to focus on and we're going to tell you how nanoparticles can help us do that next slide please so this is an example in a larger system this was uh something we published a couple of uh years ago in science translational medicine and then followed it up with another publication in advanced science uh actually this year and it's showing magnetic nanoparticles that have been perfused into a whole rat kidney and you can see the distribution uh not an optimal formulation on the far left and a far better formulation uh one over that's circling in the in the left upper uh quadrant and we basically perfuse in both cryoprotective agents which are like biological antifreeze molecules as well as these iron oxide nanoparticles we can then look at that with both microct which is on the left or we can look at it with a type of mri pulse sequencing on the right and we can actually quantify where the iron is within the organ and the benefit of this you can see below on cooling you know we've been able to actually create vitrified kidneys for some time but if you look at and that's what you see in a there if you look at c convective warming is how people have traditionally done it and you can see the center and the edge of your container in terms of the thermal behavior they are quite different and that is actually what can drive cracks and that's what you see in the in d is basically large temperature variation across the sample whereas if you have distributed iron oxide throughout the system you're able to bring up both the center and the edge together and so that brings very little thermal gradient in your system and avoids cracks and it also goes fast enough that we can avoid crystals next slide please so what we're doing now with many collaborators across atb bio is we're looking for better formulations including also with nano composites better formulation of these nanoparticles how we coat them and how they remain stable in cryoprotective solutions and also making sure that they continue to heat well despite being in cryoprotective solutions which you see there on the bottom left we can also consider new embodiments of nanoparticles like nanowires or cubes or uh different elliptical uh or different shapes of magnetic nanoparticles and all of that increases the magnetic anisotropy that can lead to higher heating so there's a huge opening area of exploration in these magnetic nano materials to make their heating more efficient and then we're also scaling up so we're building rf coils at the university of minnesota where we already can do rat and rabbit kidneys but we're trying to get to all human kidneys and human liver lobes and so we have a device that's going into installation this spring in uh at the university of minnesota that will get up to human size organs for this next slide please well this is where i will take over um and thank you dr bishop for the wonderful overview and thank you all for being here um i just want to talk a little bit about why we use laser-based nano-warming technology and then i will obviously go into depth about how it's applied to the cry preservation of all these different systems that we work on and then our deep collaborative work with nano composites on the crab preservation of zebrafish embryos but first why do we need such fast laser warming as you guys can see here when we uh for different types of concentrations of cryoprotectants uh we have different kinds of cooling critical cooling rates and that essentially means for us cryobiologists you have to essentially cool and rewarm at these specific rates in order to avoid ice crystallization and for you know these droplet-based systems that we initially touched on which is you know they can be these embryos the shrimp larvae or coral larvae they cannot take very high concentrations of cryoprotectant so we have to work in this regime over here and that makes us work with very fast cooling and warming rates so there was a path-baking study that came out in 2011 that told us cryobiologists essentially is something to focus on is more the warming because on the warming side you already have nuclei of ice present in so the the likelihood of devitrification and cracking exists more on the warming side and that's also the reason why warming rates have been much higher so dr peter mazer a world renowned cryobiologist in this area started developing a laser-based technique where he showed that you could essentially use one-third of the optimal craft protectants in my source sites uh and are still able to get very high viabilities as long as you use very fast uh cooling rates uh and warming rates sorry uh not necessarily the cooling rates and this is what you kind of see here you know the difference between 95 c per minute all the way to 69 000 it's really the viabilities are pretty high as long as the warming rate is fairly high so we've been able to use laser-based warming uh specifically because you know compared to india ink which is what it was used in the original study these nanoparticles can be easily generated manufactured they can be made biocompatible and we can essentially tune the absorption of those nanoparticles on what kind of wavelength we use so we've been able to find that uh it's not necessarily just the absorption of the nanoparticle that generates heat but it's also about how you spread the heat uniformly so it's it's both uh you know the design parameters have to be have to be evaluated based on what the ratios of absorption and scattering we have so as you can see over here from our recent study in nanoscale we were able to show that you need to have an optimal ratio of both scattering and absorbing agents in your droplets in order to achieve uniform warming and now we're essentially working with different groups at the university of minnesota and university of california riverside to help us generate those nanoparticles that can help us do that so we've been we're currently working and we have been able to apply this technology to multiple different systems certain kinds of mammalian systems obviously doctors have talked about coral larvae this is our brief restoration project with the smithsonian down in hawaii aquaculture models such as you know pacific white shrimp which is 80 of the aquaculture market and obviously zebrafish which is a big biomedical model and lots of transgenic lines are created and there are other systems we also would like to work on and you'll notice that these are all systems that um are mostly marine systems or systems that are terrestrial but not essentially looked at as you know the models of you know biomedical research but this technology should be able to help us get there because what it does is it allows us to re-warm larger volumes get to a higher throughput and also allow us the use of less cpu so you will obviously get higher viability and you can bank these large amounts of uh gametes from all these different kinds of organisms so some of the unique challenges to crab preserving fish embryos which is slightly different than some of these droplet based systems it's a lot larger as you can see than compared to you know a salmon embryo human osi which is you know relatively easy to cry observe now uh zebrafish embryos are about a thousand times bigger than that and obviously salmon embryos which is the fish that everybody likes to consume is a lot larger than that so the surface area to volume ratio is really really high that makes the the biological transport of cpa and water in and out of the system fairly hard there are also these multiple compartments as you guys can see we have a developing blaster norm a corion we have the yolk and all of these in this also dynamic system so as you know the embryo develops uh into later developmental stages you will see these membranes change thicken their permeabilities will also change so there is something here that i'm showing you guys it's called the yolks and social layer and it develops between the cells and the yolk and as the cells move around the yolk and the description people use is like a ski cap over being pulled over your head you will see that this yolks and social layer will continue develop and thicken and this prevents almost any transport of cpa inside the inside the yoke and that's actually the region where majority ice forms and destruction happens and so we've been working with different ways people have been trying to study you know how to get cpa inside the yoke and you can see here that uh it's very difficult to get a cpa inside and very hypotonic solutions and also you know we cannot use i would say slow based freezing because the longer the uh the exposure to the sub-zero temperatures the likely damage to happen so this is a very unique system and it requires maybe a different way of thinking about this so we've been able to show that you can use micro injections so any zebrafish researcher will tell you that micro injection is fairly used in their lab to do all sorts of transgenic based experiments uh and so we you you know use that approach in order to load uh both cryoprotectants as well as nanoparticles inside and outside in different compartments of the embryo so you see here we have two different modes we could have a single injection where we deliver nanoparticles directly into the yoke and those nanoparticles then get taken up by the cells we can surround the droplet by the embryo by a droplet of gold and you can also have the ability to inject into the outer compartments as well using the double injection system and what we try to do is after any treatment we try to see how the development is hampered by any treatment that we give whether that's injection of nanoparticles cpa whether it's freezing laser warming so we able to we we essentially track the development of the zebrafish over five days and here we in this study we were able to find that you know propylene glycol and methanol which are fairly common uh cryoprotectants for marine systems are fairly suitable the pegulated gold nanorods that were developed by nanocomposix are fairly biocompatible and they can be easily spread inside the embryo and also the developmental factor are the the embryos developmental stage is a huge factor in how the the nanoparticles spread and get taken up so we've done some studies with fluorescent nanoparticles again from nanocomposix and we were able to show that these nanoparticles can be spread throughout the different compartments of the embryos however you know there's still a big challenge as to how to prevent the leakage of these nanoparticles from the yolk you know if you make a hole into any membrane you know there is some matter that comes out so that leads to certain inconsistencies and using some of the modeling based and property characterization that we've done on these nanoparticles we're able to generate you know what are the kind of rates uh we can get from radiating a zebrafish embryo that contains these nanoparticles so this is our general methodology we begin with the micro injection at a high at the high cell stage so this is just before the ysl starts to form so that we can quickly get the nanoparticles into the cell then we perform something known as a pre-freezing path essentially what that does is it allows the outer compartments to lose water and maybe gain some cp it's a very short exposure to these cryoprotectants almost no cpa enters the the yolk in this case then we begin after a certain waiting period to let the embryo heal we begin our rapid cooling and cryo storage stage so what we try to do is we put these embryos onto a very thin plastic strip which is called a cryotop and then we just immerse them plunge freeze them and liquid nitrogen and what we're trying to see here is do we actually get vitrification and vitrification or we get cracking and then those embryos could be stored in any kind of liquid nitrogen dewar and stabilized and then we essentially could laser nano warm these by radiating them under our millisecond laser and then we perform something known as a post warming bath to just remove the toxic cryoprotectants from the outer chambers and re-inflate its corian and then our idea is to essentially develop the the embryos as long as they can so the five-day developmental period is pretty crucial to us um most of the embryos are lost during that period but once they get to day five we should be able to grow them to sexual maturity and then have them mate with a partner to produce more and more embryos for let's say xyz application whether that's to regenerate a new line transgenic line mutant line of fish or whether it's for aquaculture purposes so in this latest paper that we that we just published we were able to show that we get pretty consistent survival after both these laser warming uh both double injected and single injected modes and uh we were also able to show that some of the fish that made it to day five are able to be housed reach sexual maturity and then spawn effectively and all the uh the children of these laser worm crabserved fish are also able to live you know up to day five without many developmental abnormalities so you know we just talked a little bit about that these aquatic species such as zebrafish you know they get huge amounts of funding from the nih to you know study all sorts of disease whether that's cancer whether that's embryology and all of these transgenic lines really require banking but at the same time you know we are going through a very big mass extinction uh we are losing indigenous species at a very rapid rate so we need to come up with a way to sustainably bank them hopefully someday if we repair those ecosystems we can reintroduce them and this has already been done for different kinds of species whether that's the rhino whether that's the cheetah black ferret the panda and then i think the biggest thing would be as we have seen that due to climate change we're losing the ability to grow fish in our oceans there's also over fishing and many of these coastal economies essentially develop depend on these fisheries um like think about a country like phil uh philippines you know 60 of their protein actually comes from fish and i would say that you know with ocean you know acidification it would be increasingly hard for that kind of population to depend on wild catch production so agriculture will have to come in these countries will have to develop aquaculture and one thing that we can help them do is the ability to have circ annual aquaculture essentially grow fish at any time of the year regardless on what the spawning conditions are and that can be made possible through cryobanking well thank you very much for uh giving us the time to present our research i'd like to thank and recognize all of these different collaborators that we have here um you know obviously the zebrafish core the smithsonian group nanocomposix for all the grants that we've been able to write with them cryoside our partner that is helping us come into the aquaculture space and also different funders from different agencies thank you yeah excellent that was a great presentation and so i'm just going to start uh we have a couple questions coming in um all right let's come in through the duration of the talk so uh we'll go ahead and uh start answering them with uh yeah answering them so um the question um comes from earlier um in the presentation about the nano materials why are the gold nano rods the ones that reach the highest temperature that's a good question actually uh we've scaled this and the way you know i maybe i should can i share my screen again uh the the temperature on the nanoparticles is never more than i would say 10 to 20 degrees because what happens is these nanoparticles are essentially at the macro scale they are they are thermally uh relaxed so what happens is because of the long pulse width the millisecond pulse width that gives them enough time to dissipate the heat from themselves so the nanoparticles never really get overheated and then there was another question um from that was referred to on slide from slide six did the nanoparticles act as a nucleation center for cryo-freezing that's a good question i think uh we've not really seen that though i can see why you would think that they are they could ask us as nucleators as well we have to study that i think definitely more this question comes from nicole um i think it was 14 what are the concentration of nanoparticles needed per cell uh volume uh that depends on what kind of system you're in and again it will also depend on what kind of nanoparticle you're using so you know let's say we are trying to use some nanoshells for some of our droplet based systems that is a different concentration versus the nanorods that are injected into the uh into the zebrafish that's a different concentration so i would refer you to the papers you know i have uh you know published almost two papers in this on the zebra fish so if you can you know get those papers you should find what the exact concentrations are i i put the link in the chat okay perfect thank you um and then this question comes from joyce nunn do the organisms lose the nanoparticles as they grow and at what stage do they retain the nanoparticles yeah so i've actually done this study i haven't published on it but uh within about seven days almost all the nanoparticles are cleared out of the system and one thing we've noticed is uh the nanoparticles are fairly non-toxic it's mostly the injury occurs from damaging the you know there's the yolk from the injection and also from the crab protectants being injected the thing is that the yolk is not developing you know it's just being consumed as like a small droplet of energy for the cells as they grow and develop so the cells are only exposed to very short and very low concentrations of cpa throughout the development and as these organisms grow these membranes also get thicker and more and less and less permeable so the cpa will not leak out of those membranes also so the zebrafish embryo is fairly robust to taking these kind of injections of toxic you know chemicals i would say because we inject what 13 molars directly in which you know dilutes down because of all the water that's present inside the yolk to about two to three molars um this next question a few questions that are tied together but the from young park injecting the right power of the incident light is probably important to achieve enough photo thermal effects i'm wondering whether the photo thermal effect is literally increased as a function of power of the incident light huh okay so i you know i can see why you would think that increasing the power would really help but i think it's also the absorption scattering the but you know the optical photothermal properties of your system as well so it's both i would say you know finding the correct power that can generate the heat but also making sure that that heat can be spread uniformly because you know you could have essentially bears you know absorption you can essentially keep losing power as you go from the top of the embryo to the bottom of the embryo so i would say it's both it's developing you know these nanoparticles that can also scatter and absorb heat the right way then after warming the samples based on the photothermal effect what kinds of methods are used to separate particles from the sample that's a good question so in the zebrafish we honestly really don't do anything as i said we should do more studies on this um and probably will we would probably do it in the for the next publication but about seven days it takes and these particles are naturally passed through their system also i don't i don't think the nanoparticle the you know we're not injecting that many nanoparticles you know i think that if you look at it in a micro liter system it's probably maybe a million nanoparticles are in there so they should be getting cleared out very quickly and then i see the final question is what is the biggest challenge for commercialization of this technology and that's a very good question i think that uh obviously the demand is going to be out there if we talk about just laser-based uh photonic technology uh to you know you know re-warm these samples i think that each specific fish system or marine system has its own unique challenges so making it a platform technology is going to you know have its own problems and also making sure that we can you know get these nanoparticles into the hand of experts you know who can also work with these nanoparticles characterize them and then also you know well worse than cryobiology and also developmental biology of the xyz system so i think that would be some of the biggest challenges i would say i think there's also some other practical considerations too for commercialization related to scale up and so there's um certainly a number of interesting materials that have been demonstrated at small scales and then one of the challenges associated with making nato materials is understanding all of those nuances associated with producing it at much larger reaction sizes in order to bring down costs and to make sure that you have large batches for for ensuring consistency across multiple patients or for a wide variety of of uses so i think there's there's scale-up issues that are critical to commercialization it touched briefly on some of the regulatory requirements so depending on if materials are going to be used for animals versus human topically versus in vivo there's all sorts of different regulatory requirements that need to be met and so in addition to just the control of the optical properties and the science then there's also a wide range of engineering and regulatory issues that also need to be addressed as part of the commercialization process yeah and i would also like to add this is actually come up during our erc uh meetings and uh there's also a big ethical challenge um you know should we be bringing back should we be banking some of these species that are going extinct should we actually be bringing them back you know those are the same challenges with organ banking could they be misused by certain amounts of people gene editing and gene um based uh models are being crap preserved here and do we want them in our food system as you know people don't really like to eat gmo based products and you know so fish farmers also go through huge amounts of stigma you know for their products that they generate so there are also huge ethical concerns also that come up yeah there were also uh i think uh nicole had some questions kind of and other questions i saw and tried to answer uh while you were speaking kind of but uh i think there are questions related to how these nanoparticles clear from these systems and those are really good questions that uh haven't been completely answered and the zebrafish system conop has looked at this pretty in detail and he can uh you know give you a much more detailed response in a moment but um we we basically couldn't measure it with analytical techniques like icp mass effect but we we believe that you know there probably are some gold nanoparticles left in the case of those uh organs that i showed you earlier we know that some iron oxide remains in the system so it's actually an interesting overlap with some of the work that's been done in the uh the society of thermal medicine where people are using iron oxide to try and treat cancer and they're doing uh you know interstitial injection and leaving iron in the body you sort of have similar questions you know how much iron is it okay to leave in the body clearly if you're dying of cancer and you have some iron in your body it's probably acceptable but how much is acceptable to have an organ that you might be putting back in right now the amounts are below what would be fda approved for different types of iron that goes into the body but you know work is ongoing to uh answer that in a more clear way i don't know if you wanted to add to that kind of with your experience yeah um i would say that in the zebrafish what we do is silver stain histology and we need to do more studies in order to see that and also i think maybe we also need to see how the nanoparticles get distributed into the as the embryo moves on from day one which is a very different looking embryo to like a fully grown not fully grown but a larval embryo larval fish and how uh you know nanoparticles are getting distributed and its vasculature is also i think something we have to work on and figure out i see another question come up on the zebrafish and it says it's by abhishek and it says do the treatment of nanoparticles affect the basic rest and activity patterns of the zebrafish and actually they do what happens you know with these some of these systems is you disrupt small things like the temperature at which they're being cultured or the you know the water salt concentration that's in them i see that happen a lot with some of our shrimp-based systems and that can completely change your experimental you know you will get all sorts of varied uh results you know you would not be able to get the same kind of viabilities you expect from your system so we have to be very cognizant of that and make sure that at each specific stage we're measuring you know what is what's really happening to the embryos and what we do is uh if we see any developmental malformation after every treatment we give them we remove those embryos and call them not survive even though they might be an embryo that you know was looking like it's developing but if it's behind schedule if it doesn't hatch by day three those embryos are then removed and then those are considered to be dead embryos essentially in our study but kana can you say for sure do you i mean those those some of those effects happen even in the absence of nanoparticles right that that is true they as i just said they can happen if you you know don't keep them at 28c or you know for you know if you there is disruption by an hour sometimes you know when you're looking at these embryos under the microscope and you forget you put them on a cold table that can add hours worth of delay sometimes so we just have to be cognizant of that and but sometimes there are natural also problems and this happens more in marine fish it doesn't happen in such a well-studied aquaculture sorry an aquarium fish like zebrafish but it happens a lot more in marine fish where uh we've had also in our lab that some of these fish we make they make it to day five but then when we put them in the husbandry systems then they die off and we still do not know why that happens so about 80 90 percent of the fish will of you know in zebrafish we'll just make it to this adulthood phase whereas in other kinds of systems and shrimp and marine fish which are you know the husbandry has not been developed yet you may only get 30 to 40 percent uh in corals i know only one percent of the corals actually make it to you know fully grown coral animal or fragment i would say out of the larvae that we haven't so that's why we also have to look at you know big high throughput work you know how do we bank a whole coral reef or billions of larvae if we need to or tons of different kinds of fragments from these you know specific samples and con up you kind of uh again this is a question i was typing up while you were talking so maybe you can just answer it too like in the zebrafish that did survive that grew did you see any evidence you know that obviously they procreated and so on but can you talk about any differences you saw between them in control not really so they have the same kind of swim pattern they have a heartbeat we have also measured how long they are um and they are very similar i would say to controls in that way uh once the fish make it to i would say once the fish make it to the hatching stage i am fairly confident that the fish should make it to day five and should be able to you know be put in the husbandry system so most of the the the i would say the the the i would say the error bars mostly happen at you know hour one three day one day two and so what do you what what are the challenges uh con up to scaling all this up uh we did not discuss it in these slides but i think to get to a bigger embryo we have to first off completely redesign maybe the laser uh pulse so we may have to come up with a way to split up the laser pulse in order to minimize the the scattering that happens because all of these fish embryos have large amounts of lipid in its yoke and that lipid is heavily scattering so in order to get penetration through the yolk and as you guys just said the yolk is the biggest site of ice formation we have to come up with maybe a different laser strategy where we split up the beam heat from multiple different size so that you know we can still get enough penetration and warming throughout the embryo so it's uniform warming that's occurring and this work will probably happen under the erc with our collaborators at you know uc riverside and i think we have time for um for one more question this was uh do the treatment with the nanoparticles affect basic rest activity and patterns of zebrafish uh do you observe any behavior in the developed fish yeah so um i i think i answered this question and yes we do see that happen uh not just from the treatments we give them but also from basic things that are you know maybe sometimes not under control just noise into our samples whereas that could be you know not using the right amount of salt concentration in their media if that's off um you know osmolality is a big thing as well in these numbers specifically at the earlier stage so if the salt concentration is slightly off that can really you know completely mess up your system and we also see there are natural uh things that also happen we've seen a seasonality in some of these fish um so sometimes in the spring and even in winter time we don't get the best quality embryos and that's a very difficult question to answer because sometimes there is lack of fertilization success or just embryos don't make it to a particular developmental stage so there is a lot of variability that can happen and in the zebrafish we usually see that variability between day one and day three and not necessarily after uh the hatch period which is after day three i would say but in marine systems which is also systems we want to work on and some of them are we working on we see variability all throughout the developmental cycle wonderful i think personally learned a lot myself probably have uh plenty more questions uh to carry us through uh but we'll uh we'll wrap up um our discussion today thank you um all to all of our panelists so much um for sharing uh your research and the involvement that you've had on the different projects that we've discussed today um so we'll thank everybody for their attendance today and uh appreciate you joining in with us and uh make you have a wonderful uh afternoon or uh morning thank you everyone bye thanks everybody thank you you", "amIKlqIJvGk": "hey guys it's Alex and you're watching elevate presents today we're doing something very special for you we are gonna review Mary's medicinals THC transdermal patches Mary's medicinals transdermal patches also come in CBD but for the sake of making a solid review I'm only gonna do the THC one first and by itself this patch alone has 17 milligrams of THC and a half a milligram of CBD it says it lasts up to about 12 hours and it takes about 45 minutes for it to kick in the manufacturer recommends that you place it in a very veinous area for example on the wrist the ankle or maybe right underneath the arm right here it also recommends that you wipe down the area with a nice little alcohol to remove any oils so that the glue can stick better to your skin [Music] well for the final review of Mary's medicinal transdermal THC patch for functionality we gave it a 7.4 it was super easy to use just tear up in a package take off the cover and slap it on to your wrists your ankle or anywhere else where it's super veinous and really thin skip for quality we gave it a 7 great packaging the materials are super easy malleable they definitely been with the skin which is great it's almost like I didn't feel it on there at first and I want that because one of the big things they say is that this patch is super discreet for practicality we gave it a 7.1 it didn't come with a warranty but it definitely did have a two-year expiration date the instructions on it were really easy to read and to understand and it didn't confuse me at all which is great for someone who is just using this to get higher maybe not your thing maybe you should just stick with distillate edibles but for someone who is suffering from chronic pain I do find that this enhance my experience it was super easy to use if I was going somewhere maybe to a baseball game I could slap that on there I don't have little kids staring at me and the moms wondering why I'm getting super duper sconed right in front of them for looks we gave it a 6.5 it was just a simple package there wasn't too flashy there wasn't said anything over-the-top about the packaging itself it does come in this really nice skin tone but maybe a recommendation for the manufacturer and offering the patients different skin tones for different people now under affordability for affordability we factor in many different options functionality price practicality and quality it was a 5.5 I love the product itself but when you break it down per milligram it definitely isn't the best bang for your buck I can get the same dosage for about half the price and any other type of form of edible for the final review of Mary's medicinals transdermal THC patches we gave a six point seven they were what they are intended for after putting on one patch I wasn't really getting the effect that I thought I was supposed to get so I called the manufacturer and they'd affirm me to the realm of caring which helped me out with the dosing information she said start off with a half patch but I already had one on so I threw on the second one and within 15 minutes the back pain that I wanted to go away with the first immediately was relieved so leads me to believe I would need about three of these to feel a full effect because I'm a little bit larger individual well I'm Alex and you're watching elevate presents thanks for

in the market [Music] so [Music] you", "1mkoGN5oJfA": "[Music] hi in this video we're going to be talking about slumping and how it affects your body uh in standing and in sitting and how that can be contributing to your pain okay so do you have any um experience with that happening to you well i'm a slumper i think some people are just naturally slumpers right and it's like from their personality and maybe some of their confidence and just habit and maybe their parents walked that way right but i think i tend to be a slumper not if i recall you had some problems with your neck yeah because you were slumping a lot over your computer yeah so i'm just reminding her so it happens with all of us we all all had that problem but some of us have that problem more than others yeah so in this video we're going to talk about why slumping is not good for you because i think knowledge is power and what you can do about it so first of all the wise the wise uh if we start from the head from the head down the why's of slumping is that it puts your head forward and causes a lot more stress on your neck which could lead to headaches and neck pain even upper trap and shoulder pain so that's number one number two what happens in this area when we slump is that we compress our breathing mechanism our diaphragm and if our diaphragm isn't moving well then it doesn't massage our intestines and so this can lead to shortness of breath upper back pain because of the slumping as well as problems with digestion even constipation different pressures on our pelvic floor i mean this a whole system that is it that is so fascinating to me that we could have pain that starts back here from maybe how you work or how you carry your baby and then it affects your intestines and if you're constipated or not right because you know after you had a baby or and before even your breasts are bringing you forward too and then if you are you know carrying the baby all the time after the baby uh your abdominals are weak so it's hard to actually stand a lot of women have like what we call a stretch weakness in the upper back from being in this posture because you're over stretching the bowels so and pressures on the pelvic floor and we know that we have a lot of pelvic floor issues uh during the childbearing year and so that this can accentuate all of those things and if you're having pain it can actually make that pain worse as and we know constipation can make your pain worse in your back or in your pelvic floor so there's a lot tied up into how we hold ourselves uh and so that's the whole effects of slumping so now what what we do about what can we do about that we do about this so awareness being aware of how you're holding yourself and like i said i love teaching this because it makes me brings it to the awareness to my mind and awareness because i have to cue myself i have to think about it myself and so being aware and uh bringing yourself back up straight and because as you do that you're actually exercising your muscles you're making them do what they're supposed to do that they may have been lazy about right using the wall for practice as we talked about in the last video so if you're coming up against the wall and having your arms out and this may feel really really unusual or tight for you so you know there's all kinds of stuff we'll do another video on different things you can do with the wall and you can do three other exercises and you do a lot more exercises but three come to my mind to address the neck and i have already done a separate video on this one but the chin tuck so you're just bringing your head back and feeling that you are stretching the muscles in the back of your neck this is like the most self-fat this is the most unattractive exercise you can do so this is called a chin tuck you don't want your head down you just want it to come back okay and being in a good posture when you're doing it so that's number one and number two would be doing to muscle to stretch your pectoralis muscle which gets really tight in a lot of us just from everything we do in front of us so that's just bringing your hands back okay and clasping them together and then just stretching all of this out and especially like if you're breastfeeding and you're always forward or even just bottle feeding you're going to get tight here and this one combined with a really nice deep breath will really help get everything stretched out and then we want to do more than just stretching we want to strengthen so if you hit that theraband here we go okay this mysteriously appears here so just taking this band and bringing it out okay i'll face this way and then you're squeezing your shoulder blades together and then coming out so then uh breathe out and if i have alexa turn and then you can see turn this all the way and then you can see that when she comes out she's bringing her shoulder blades together and then relax and then you're going to relax your shoulders down because you don't want them to be coming up and you're going to breathe out and pull so those are three simple exercises the chin tuck the pec stretch and the strengthening for your upper back back muscles that are really basic simple things that you can do today to get started and in our next video we're going to talk about more standing tips for you [Music] you",
