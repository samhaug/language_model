getting ever more popular these days and getting a basic four-wheel-drive truck and the used truck camper is an affordable and easy way to get you to your next adventure the truck I have here is a 2002 Chevy Silverado 2500 heavy duty it's a crew cab it's got a diesel under the hood and it's got a short or regular bed six and a half foot bed option and this episode of the fast lane truck is all about matching your truck to your truck camper the first thing to know when matching a camper to your truck is you need to know how much the camper waves and whether your truck and carry it if the payload allows it so before I actually put the camper on my truck this is 2002 Chevy Silverado HD 2500 I need to figure out exactly how much the truck weighs the truck weighs 7,000 and 60 pounds so I'll weigh the truck with the camper and find out exactly what the camper weighs if you're buying a new camper of course the manufacturer will give you the specifications for that camper but you have to keep in mind that some optional equipment may raise the weight of the particular unit so it's always a good idea just to wear it and see exactly what you have next you actually have to figure out whether the camper will fit into the bed of your particular truck and you might think there are standard sizes yes there are there are mid-size campers there's half-ton campers and there's also of course heavy duty truck campers but for an older truck the bed is actually shallower from my 2002 Silverado the bed depth is actually 19 and a half inches floor of it is basically a 4 by 8 piece of plywood so 4 feet wide and 8 feet long but here's a crucial measurement it's from the floor of the camper to the rail the top portion of the bed rail on the camper is actually 20 and a half inches so it will clear the bed rail on my truck but not on the new one and yes you could put something underneath the camper but then you're raising your center of gravity not a great thing I never pass up an opportunity to use a power tool and in this case the height of my truck bed is about 3 feet so I got to raise the camper three feet in the air [Music] tend to back up to the camper and I've owned this camper for a few years so I have some practice but nonetheless there's not a lot of clearance on each side of it so I have to lie anything up perfectly I will first put the sheet of plywood inside my bed [Music] not bad I think I'm lined up pretty good I didn't snag anything I didn't bend anything it fits with the tailgate down perfectly eight feet in length so now I just have to lower it secure it to the tie downs and I can go weigh it again I wanted to show you the clearances so between the bed rail and the camper just maybe two fingers so maybe in but an inch a couple of fingers here between the bed rail in the front almost three inches between the cab and the top of the camper here okay so I just secured these legs to the camper now I have to secure the camper to the truck tie-downs here on the bumper and then in the front [Music] now I can go on my next vacation adventure over landing trip you name it skiing get some shelter from the cold ouch [Music] relax it's nice nice to have something like this where you have a four-wheel-drive truck and a little camper in the back [Music] and the truck camper here is in 91 Hallmark's Victor hallmark actually builds them here in Colorado so that's really cool but it's an eight-foot-long camper with a pop-up section on the top [Music] of course there are many different truck camper sizes and styles there are midsize truck campers that fit like a tear at the coma or Chevy Colorado they're also half-ton campers silent sided or pop ups there is heavy-duty truck campers and there are different lengths you can also get really gigantic campers that actually hang over the back of your truck and are very heavy and they have a bathroom and they have a lot of other things and you need the dually truck basically to carry one of those so there's a lot of different options but I'm back at the scale to figure out exactly how much this camper weighs and the final number is eight thousand four hundred and sixty so if I'm doing some quick math 8460 - seven thousand sixty that's 1,400 pounds exactly that's a nice round number and for 3/4 ton light truck like this even an older one with a payload of over 2,000 pounds this is a good size camper and that allows me to carry one of two people or tow a small boat in addition to the camper so that's a lot of good stuff a lot of new trucks have your payload rating in the door jamb of the driver side door on the yellow tire pressure sticker so it will tell you precisely what the payload capacity of your truck is and less than 1400 pounds you cannot carry a camper and put people and gear in your truck so matching your truck to a camper or you can put it to a truck is not very difficult you just need to know your weights your sizes your dimensions and you're good to go I hope this answers a lot of your questions and go back to TfL truck comm for news views and real world truck reviews thank you", "ByBSNg5cYDA": "am I the only high one here yeah you're nuts what's a comma he's the only thing I don't do and I'm stoned has come the only thing I don't do when I am stoned see it again the only thing I don't only thing guys do are you smoking something I don't you saying you're always coming when you're when I'm sober I can't stop coming indica or sativa sativa indica sativa indica 60 million Americans suffer from insomnia and indica helps reduce that what are you gonna say to those Americans life is short why the would you sleep through any of it maybe if we had fewer lazy people in this country they can actually enjoy a decent strain I think sativa is for the productive mind I don't believe that you smoke weed oh I I do very much smoke weed but I don't smoke that it would in the couch  no in the car no no that's how you remember in the car you're in the car become the couch in it why are you defending this so you guys smoke that young Republican sativa weed I smoke this stuff that keeps me awake and paranoid and paranoia is a survival trick you you guys need to calm down you need to perk up well that's kind of sexist no it is sexist so you guys smoke weed to keep you prepared for a win they say whenever someone's behind you and that's often the case no one was there ok back to basics if you ask me do I want to chill out or do I want my brain to be running running running through a field I'm gonna say I want to chill out and I think most of us probably late to chill if we get a choice what's the point of school then school tells us to think sativa does the job for us the construction of a school day is crazy year you have to do your homework well I think we all agree school sucks that's not what's on the table right now school doesn't suck it sucks when you're not on sativa so you were high throughout school how are you not how did you make it through school sativa and if I smoked indica I would be in on the floor like a stupid jackass in the floor you smoke weed and then you think about every relationship that you ever had in your life and all the people that you've touched and all the people that you've heard and also how all everyone doesn't really like you that much and that you're a burden and then you work on that and you journal about that and it sounds like your problems are um are a little bigger than wheat and it's a downward spiral sure you think real dark thoughts it's a piece of time to go through but at least you're thinking smoke in the cut you go in in the prison see there's also just a sexier word sativa you get into I don't know if you want to do that what were you doing touching my nipples and by the way I'm only wearing a shirt on this show because I have to do the again now don't do it for Jordan Jordan loves this he loves nipples he wants you to love sativa you don't have to he will have to do the things that he says name another thing the two of you agree on is this it is that all you have we love you both rock a small pause oh yeah that's neither here nor there we enjoy we have big joints and that's the point you think a penis is a joint wait no no we have big joints your big elbows and a small dick you have an elbow on him it isn't a joint it has a joint your penis has been and yours doesn't like a Bionicle yeah like a Bionicle so your dick is like a bent leg oh wait okay do you worry that maybe there's been so much sativa in your life that your dicks are now right angles my penis doesn't necessarily have bad posture it's just like always in downward dog don't word Bulldog give yourself some credit our Bulldog that's a smaller they're smaller but they're thick he's got like a can of Pepsi down there the dimensions on this are honestly a nightmare and I think we should move but am I the only High one here yeah you're not with a comma Jay's the only thing I don't do when I'm stoned has come the only thing I don't do when I'm stoned say it again the only thing I don't only thing I do I thing I don't know you smoke a lot thing I don't do it scum what does that mean I come when I was you saying you're always coming when you're not stoned but just always coming no it's just that the only thing he doesn't do when these fires come when I'm sober I can't stop coming and why you're high you can't start that's why I had the confidence to wear shorts today cuz you know you're not gonna come dry as a whistle the shape of the sativa leaf finger like leaves yeah I think we can all agree that's creepy as fingers are terrifying so if you have to choose between a freaky finger II kind of spooky warming leaf and sort of a cool not gonna freak you out leave I think you're gonna go for the one that's not spidering gonna wake you up in it what's wrong with spooky woman okay listen to this you wake up in the middle of the night Jordan okay it's dark it's darkest and it's earring there's no sound usually there's a car outside your house yeah what's you wish you can't see anything and behind your head Oh God you feel like a tinkling tinkling spindle II finger come behind your ear and trace the outline of your ear with her spindle II finger mom where why are you here are you scared it's a woman spooky or is she fine where are you scared that she's gonna grab your neck so the idea is that that spooky finger is more like sativa and indica sort of like someone just kissing your cheek and falling asleep next to you like a soft hug mom why are you in the couch now that has nothing to do with marijuana I'm touching your nipples here I'm touching a lot more touching the nipple stop it like how was your shirt loose but your nipples so prominent well because I had the sound guy on me putting the wire through here you can't not get excited if you got soft nipples then you're all soulless people just how long are they do you know much whatever bullies and the internet will judge them essa like guys sound off in the comments if you guys think that these guys are bullies I think we're very nice why do you like him because so much what is so great about being a lazy ass sometimes being lazy is nice you get to be on the bottom during sex you don't have to do anything you get to sit there and barely move a muscle and you don't care because you're lazy that doesn't sound like like your partner is probably mad that they're into screwing dead people lazy I would like to be chilled out kind of days not the weeds notice what's the smoke why

showed that I was serious about what I was doing and I was really looking for this dream got strain and it was 97 or 98 I got it from my buddy and I think it was maybe my second crop just screws enough to keep me going for me went to work one day and the buddy tells me I haven't smoked that smell and you haven't smelled that smell in years one day at work I was like smelt Jim and I was like hey I was like you know you kind of smell right and you run around the office and it it kind of smells I didn't want you get in trouble but you smelling pretty good man he goes do you have anything I said yeah so we smoked some and he goes you know what you got I says yeah and he goes has been missing for a long time it's been gone you know he was just like me a closet grower and I was like I know that plant I was like I know that exact smell in that the way it was growing and it had eight leaves on it because it would just grows a different way than anything I've ever seen in my life and I knew right there that it was what it was I had a friend who knew a man from the truck the valet that name they called him different things tiny they called him trapper Creek different freakin nicknames and stuff but uh you know it's nothing it was legal then so we you know we passed clones around to people somebody would grow up start up a little grow and and one guy had a girl going for years and years and then all this one day he went off the deep end in 88 and I had to go rescue the plants and I went and gave them to four other guys and kept the you know to care barb strain that we loved so much so getting the MTF though the MTF stream how I ran until it was kind of a unique story I had the jet boat out at a desk and landing fishing and at the end of the day we're heading back to the landing you know we're on the river and I see a boat with a top up and that usually means hey I'm in trouble I went over there met this guy i towed him back to the landing hooked on my boat towed him back you know him and his cronies I think there was one lady with him anyway I told him back they said how much do I owe ya and I said well nothing you know it might be meaning me next time that needs to tow and you told me how about that so the guy thought that was really cool and I can't say his name but he thought it was really cool we smoked some cannabis and stuff like that and then he proceeds to tell me that it's just MTF stuff I don't like what what the heck is that and then he explained it to me and we started popping questions and stuff and he flat-out told me well it's really called trapper Creek hash but you know and I go oh well okay and I'm trying to figure out where MTF came from all that I still don't know where that name came from but the old guy there he's dead now but he was a great guy I had the MTF for about a year and a half I lost the strain due to some spider mites infested my growing area and I just killed everything off and restarted and then one of my friends actually had the strain of it and he gave it to me back in like 97 or 98 and I've had it ever since okay so then I was reading the paper I'd heard about Ron before I've read in the paper and I got his phone number and I gave him a call his big article in paper I was looking for the real old MTF gave him a call and talked to his wife I said alright I will do this I gave him the plan and that's how we met I seen this article about MTF that Ron bass had these people come over and he had the real MTF and I was sitting at home and I'm looking at the story and I'm going [ __ ] that ain't through Realty MTF I have the real MTF right me and my couple buddies I knew right so I was like he ain't got it he ain't got it so that's what kind of got us together a little bit to was you know I had to make some calls and go how did you get this and how do you know you have to strain and Ron was honest goes well these guys think it's it or whatever and I said no I really have the real strength so one of my buddy sold Ron bass a clone for good money I was madder than hell I was starting my own girl operation and one of the monopolies on the MTF you know what I mean I don't want it to get out there right but then meeting Ron and he had the same marketing strategy that I have it's going to work out really good together and we're gonna do fine and hopefully the MTF last way past my lifetime [Music] then I got all these stories everybody saying nope I don't have it but I'll tell you this whole long story about it oh I might have some seeds open Oh blossom oh my god let me check with this guy oh no it's gone I already did all these stories Jim's like hey and then he talks to me and then he won't tell me if he has it or not he just wants to talk to me for a minute but so honest and so crisp and so deep and so emotional about this train I knew it was something real so I went to talk to the guy man and and he was really upset you know he's like I'm about to die everybody I gave this Tran to is pretty much dead and you know he has a group of friends I have it now which is a you know but it's further personal he said Ron I know you're all about medical and I know you're all about carrying diseases and trying your best and I want you to make the legend live you know so I'm here right now [ __ ] going all in saying [ __ ] it this is the real deal you know I'm putting my whole name on this the scariest [ __ ] everything I've worked for I'm telling you this is the real deal it's scaring the [ __ ] out of me but uh I'm gonna represent the Matanuska Valley to the world if there's some sort of doubt or whatever like there was in my mind in the first place I understand why don't you come out to Houston and try it and then we'll talk about it if you want some more history you want to know more about it come on out come talk to me", "b_FNcQQJt6Y": "what's going on guys how the hell you dealing out there you're taking good care of yourself you're doing a good job of that I hope so back with another first listen every sunday sunday sunday yes i put up the first listens this is the first of a few or a couple of requests this is from the dear boy Sean and he had one for a band that I've a glee know the name but I've never heard anything from they are called the atomic [ __ ] wax and that sounds like a surf product to me some kind of a surfing product but alas no it is not it is a band the atomic [ __ ] wax so we're going to learn about the ban and he wanted to do Alaskan thunder [ __ ] so this should be very interesting whatever we're in for here I'll absolutely love that image there of the space Eve whatever it is space naked space lady with out in outer space I think it's fantastic but we'll learn about the atomic [ __ ] wax we listen to the song we see what we think does that sound like a fun idea for you it sounds fun to me so let's learn about them the atomic [ __ ] wax have sixty one thousand four hundred and twenty six monthly listeners to the Spotify account the top five songs so come on has 2 point 1 million place then the song we're doing today alaskan thunder podcast five hundred and sixty five thousand and thirty five plays number three is ice age hey baby and that's got three three hundred eighty seven thousand then you got this executioner and that has four hundred and seventy eight thousand place then you've got hippie speedball so these guys probably have a sense of humor I almost kind of want to say that they're going to be kind of a a slaw jerk or doom or stoner metal of some sort yeah because I just get this vibe that image there gives me the vibe that they they smoke a doob or two and have it have a have a gay old time with it let's look into albums from the atomic [ __ ] wax and see what they have done over the years and it looks like the song we're doing today comes album call force field and that came out in 2017 but they started with the album three it looks like in 2005 then they got Box riff 2006 you got tab for 2009 graviton 2015 so they're really slow with the foot in the album's out and then of course you've got force field let's see when that album came out 2017 and it came out December 2017 12 songs 34 minutes long so relatively quick play time maybe they're not stoner stoner gloom gloom doom let's look into relate an artist that gives us a hint to what they're all about you have nebula yeah you have hermano you got cowboys and Aliens yeah you got Foo Manchu and I know who fu-manchu's dozer that sounds like a band I've heard of before the truck fighters Alabama [ __ ] I've heard that name before fatso Jetson sounds vaguely familiar to me karma de burns spiritual beggars masters of reality they couldn't have named herself after Black Sabbath good day and a mondo generator and I have heard a mondo generator because I do believe the Olivera or the the the the base plan fella that that was in Queens of the Stone Age I believe that's his band mondo generator so let's look into the bio and see what these guys are all about and you have three gents here a perfect amount of people to be in some kind of a stoner sludge stone rock band you've got one day he's got the kinky curly hair the black t-shirt he's going what's up man and then you've got the guy probably the drummer short hair blonde in the middle and he's going yeah I'm gonna look straight into the camera and then you've got the other guy over on the side he's got kind of a he's got a bob haircut and a red t-shirt it looks like it's got a skull on it and it's and he's saying hey I'm here brother the atomic [ __ ] wax originated as a side project of Monster Magnet lead guitarist Edmund L okay that's that's interesting X Godspeed basis vocalist Chris cosmic and drummer Keith Ackerman all all three of them were by then veterans of the thriving New Jersey stoner rock scene and after almost seven years of jamming in their spare time the trio finally found time to record and release their self-titled debut album in the summer of 1999 specializing in the high-octane 70s bass hardrock confused with stabs of space rock and psychedelia characterized by Mundel explosive Tommy Bolin inspired guitar heroics yeah so there you go so I think that answered the question didn't it I think they're going to be stoner rock so without further ado Shawn time to get the nipple time to give you a taste of the old magic milk the the mother's milk the tasty good stuff I give you guys a taste I take a bigger taste we listen to Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] by atomic [ __ ] wack so I'm gonna make sure this volume is up so I don't do anything goofy here and I think I found the microphone on this on this camera here so it's time to get a taste of Alaska Thunder [ __ ] and here we go I'll put it under [Music] I thought it would be a slower beat then that base [Music] well they've got some dust Oprah sandstone rockers huh [Music] anyway [Music] yeah it's got a groove to it love that face [Music] devil a hot team [Music] wanna think it's everything I need yeah he's got some pretty good [Music] [Music] this up Thanks [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

down now [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] yeah you got the double bass going now [Music] kind of a double bass pedal this guy plays a four piece kit I bet my life on it I love that get more of that I love that give the drummer some [ __ ] [Music] I love the high logic give the jumper gonna face [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] boy that was that was up-tempo high-energy good

what was it called force field I'm gonna go listen to that whole thing I like me some doom some glooms some stoner rocks and some stoner metal and stuff like I think the swords one of them and Foo Manchu and and stuff like that I thought that was pretty good what did you think of a good great fantastic yeah yeah I want some more of that please Shane thank you not a fan don't want it don't need it don't like it not don't not a big fan of the stoner kind of 70s Groo style hard rock and metal stuff I thought it was good Sean's always delivering up the goodies I'll tell you that it's always a

"welcome to another episode of the highway everyone I'm Fred and today we are checking out some Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] from skunk skunk masters that I ordered a couple days ago alaskan thunder [ __ ] ATF also known as Matanuska Tundra Magnus Cavalli Thunder [ __ ] Thunder all kinds of names it's named that obviously because it's grown in it comes from the men let's go Valley uh in the Alaskan Northlands well that's what they say but there's also that from sega master seeds and it comes from in holland in 94 and that it's a original haze crossed with Northern Lights cross what's gone cross with Highland Oaxacan so there's also those saying that it is Russian ruderalis cross with I forgot what it is and Afghani so I'm not exactly sure but you can see it has a nice dark green color to it some purple hues it has that more conical sativa shape to it but there's a chunkiness to it that does kind of fly possibly some afghan or some indicate genetics but and I just dropped the bud but you could see I has some purple leaves on there but definitely time to got like a pungent earthy sweet smell some might I'd almost want to cook with honestly but I've already got so ground up here so why don't we go ahead and have a bowl I got the za burger with me assisting me today like it's pretty much become my regular piece since I got it so cheers everyone it was almost minty taste at first but then it gave way to like kind of like a white earth with maybe a pungent or like a white punch and sweet note I mean that was really interesting I'm gonna go ahead and have another bowl of that but this is a strain that um it is known to onset pretty quickly but it's also known to creep and intensify the onset for me is usually kind of euphoric um but they're just kind of building from there and then going down my body into a nice kind of relaxed mm-hmm you know just a relaxed body still not really your body still no but not quite a melt it's just a flow and it take mmm it's more like a warm vibrancy and it uh it definitely takes the pain out but cheers everyone it was a bigger hit so he kinda tickled the back of my throat more on the top of my my pep my palate with the kind like a tingle but it was more of a earthy pungent with a sweet note taste um didn't really detect like it's definitely good though and I am feeling it I mean this is strain we're in smaller doses you know moderate doses uh it can be very social very relaxing and can lead to a productive day but higher doses it's gonna kind of be incapacitating um it can get you a bit selected kind and it can space you out and if you're talking it can lead a discussion into rambling and your thoughts can kind of just kind of flow on you pretty quickly it it does release the creative juices if you will but cheers everyone sorry about that folks I had a pack that one a little bit bigger than I expected and well it got me hmm so I just had to pause for a second there and huh all right so yeah smaller doses can lead to a really awesome productive day and a very relaxed day too because it's a very chill mellow body stone it's not like one of those crazy get up and go ones its relaxed um but too much and it can just lead to rambling and just you know distraction but that's all the time I've got here on the highway thank you for joining me and I'll see you next time", "OaH-H8D7WJw": "there is a kv-2 pushing

"what up good morning guys well it's morning for me because this is gonna be awaken bake I'm clouded up welcome back to my channel and we're gonna be getting stoned so hopefully you guys are following along with me and you guys are getting baked with me I'm so sad today because I'm really really coming to the end of my Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] butter I've been dabbing it with the nectar collector and this is about what I have left it's still a pretty good amount but there was gram in here and it lasted a long time like this wax lasted the longest like out of all any wax I've ever had and owned this [ __ ] last like week it like it's been a week now and I still have some and also had another gram of some other stuff some crumble and that stuff went quicker but this [ __ ] is so [ __ ] strong I freaking love it some good stuff maybe I can but yeah that's it and then this little torch has been going out so let's see if it even goes it's gonna go out soon there it goes all right now and sometimes I can't hold it all the way down with this bum like I'm too weak and look that's too [ __ ] hard to press down this Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] is some good stuff though you guys I think it's definitely up there one of my favourite strains like it's in my top three for sure and it's actually a sativa dominant hybrid so that's kind of interesting I have a sativa strain in my favorites of course I forgot a drink Oh [ __ ] there's hair on here on there was a q-tips like I heard it sizzling I usually only happens when like [ __ ] water or spit or something gets in there I hate it once paired rule gets in here my boyfriend rolls bad cuz it [ __ ] ruins your reclaim doesn't look like there's anything in there seriously it does how did the nectar collector guess it's not that bad but it's just like gross if you think about it and everything bus crash in Hong Kong kills 19 people oh [ __ ] oh yeah I was gonna put some freaking music on those lier brought this in here usually I have my echo dot but she's not in here right now she's inside funny how we call inanimate objects she and he now because they give them names I'm talking about Alexa just gonna play my regular frickin playlist because that's what I usually listen to so but sometimes a song I don't like list comes on let's see [Music] the first time I get blazed today andrew is asleep in bed right now whenever I try to like if he asks me to wake him up for any reason or anything like that like I tried to and he's just like he will not get up like do not even attempt to wake him up because waste of time he just says he's tired and like sleep and that's okay like I don't even like waking people up but he always tells me to wake him up and then he doesn't get off really little torches today the [ __ ] day you're gonna go out area I have another big torch but I don't use it it's not it's a huge torches on the loop it's not little as my ideal for nectar collector but I have to use it I walk [Music] [Music] [Music] my house so much not this money what I do and I always get hot when I smoked you feeling dude where are the songs I don't want to listen to Creole okay I like this song a lot listen to it with me there's [Music] Carroll achoo Isis [Music] [Music] Visine my eyes this is Excel a dream [Music] I always say gorillas blue memories whenever if she says that looks like the screen I'd sneak most in my life [Music] [Applause] [Music] tab number three and I just got a freaking drink I should go get one I guess I'm gonna need one that bad I'm feeling okay but I remember last night when I stopped smoking like my [ __ ] torch I mean my throat was torched last night after smoking so much you even teaching like so many dabbas in a row because I came back inside from here because this is where we smoke this is the garage and I came back inside and I tried to and I stuck a dab inside and it [ __ ] push my throat I was like oh [ __ ] I shouldn't just stopped right there like it [ __ ] hurt and I was like okay that's it I'm not too good for me mm-hmm nose of this stuff Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] by dabble extracts some good ship they followed me on Instagram by the list double extra yeah there is fluid in here just this torch cuz I just filled this up like when this thing was started breaking I just filled it up I just filled it up with like a little tiny container of the team that I had and I was so pissed off because I was like I woulda known this [ __ ] thing was breaking I wouldn't have just filled it up with a brand new [ __ ] container of butane I would have saved it this videos gonna be so copyrighted I don't care though cuz I really [ __ ] YouTube because my old channel I used to have I be able to put ads on my video and I can't videos and I can't anymore because they changed the rules and not that it really matters anyways [ __ ] you to you I can upload whatever I want [Music] [Music] [Music] whoo I still have some what like some of you guys I might be one-dab for me for certain boxes out how to take it down maybe not this month and that's a least - dad [Applause] ah had a good run with this stuff there's some good stuff and Vanessa put your [ __

moisture anyway oh sorry I'm done smoking now so I think I'm gonna go but uh I hope you guys had a good time and tune in for more videos and [ __ ] if you want and yeah peace out everybody [Music]", "RREF-etjeiI": "you see that sleep inducement part that's why it's nighttime right now i've done the right thing i weighed it upon getting an examination myself i've got some differing opinions i don't really get a fruity note at all from giving this a sniff however i didn't get to sniff it right when the container got opened there's certainly almost a hyper burst of terpenes when you're the one to get the true first sniff um we'll see once we grind that up what i get but god damn it's still summertime outside but there's some [ __ ] christmas trees in here man uh the bottoms of a few of these nuggets are seriously seriously frosty um i'm really really excited not only to see if maybe a higher testing thc percentage flower can yield really any difference in potency than some of the other ones we've tried but this lineage come on man alaskan thunder [ __ ] with a strain name like that i'm looking to get messed up son come on that's that's that's what i'm here to do i'm here to get [ __ ] up man so honestly i'm really hoping that sleep inducement come on i don't think we've seen that on a revolution uh strain properties before so kind of looking for that narcotic just zombie feeling as i'm getting ready to go to bed it's difficult to describe so i had to just go get my camera but man there's just these like these hairs that protrude from such a bulbous flower like it's it's really something to look at it's intimidating allah just gotta point out some of the finer details on these guys [ __ ] man hairy protruding just overall exotic is all hell man wow look at that nice man revolution as always with the [ __ ] gas a completely different nose upon breaking down this thunder cookies a a stinky just a stinky sharpness has absolutely emerged from this that was nowhere close to being in that first or secondary sniff that i got great news the buds weren't dry at all in fact they felt very very fresh and i just had to there we go really when this much keefe is already left behind at the tops of those it's really just the intro signs that we just have an absolute trichome dump occurring god damn that's exactly the shot i was hoping to get look at this y'all we've really got almost an entirely different color emerging from these and it's literally because of the trichomes i damn near say come on look at that snow baby sounds like a horror movie the last trains coming into town oh wow there's a wonderful aftertaste that is i'm sorry the only way i could describe it right now is like watermelon candy i i literally i know that sounds kind of outlandish it's the only thing that can come to mind it was so smooth like almost unnaturally so that was a very very voluminous cloud and i must say the effects are very fast acting my face feels uh actually a lot of me feels pretty fuzzy and numb so really really great first impression like the first thing we did when we came in was like literally not saying anything and just munch out dude like i ate some ice cream i might get the pretzels back out i had some chocolate earlier holy [ __ ] dude make no mistake about it thunder cookies is bringing the appetite to the table i just got back home from work and you know it's really something to realize about last night every one of those stream properties listed on the container really came through i cannot tell you how intense my munchies were last night now i gotta point something specifically out i consume cannabis like 24 7. man that ain't no [ __ ] flex it's a [ __ ] reality of my life but i say that to say like i don't really get the munchies man obviously i smoke and i am motivated to consume food but it is rare for me to get hit with that like that just i need it like spongebob meme like i'm on the snacks you know what i'm saying that absolutely happened last night me and kate ate every [ __ ] ice cream treat we had i ate the majority of the pretzels i had and i'm pretty sure i'd already brushed my teeth literally the munchies were so strong that i didn't give a [ __ ] so that's uh that's my initial impression of these thunder cookies holy [ __ ] man you better have ubereats bro d look at that keith on top of this bowl of thunder cookies now i just got told we are going to dinner bro we have not been to a dinner really since all this [ __ ] happened so we going to a patio to get a bite to eat and um [Music] come on now you know i got to put that munchies to the test the wind always picks up the wind always picks up [Music] ah [Music] [Music] [Music] uh so the majority of revolution strains i smoke they really grab a hold of me smoking them generally isn't something um to multi-task about this thunder cookies is no different man it just straight changes me it simply medicates me the onset of like the need to sit down to eat to relax like let's be real man i really need to be doing more of that in my own life outside of cannabis i just find it hard to damn near impossible so to have medicine like this it's some [ __ ] bro i feel myself becoming stoned i'll make it short and sweet man i'm so [ __ ] high off this thunder cookies like i know i probably look sick but i feel anything but dude seriously seriously intoxicating holy [ __ ] because i got the last three i got those last three nuggets of thunder cookies y'all holy [ __ ] man i got alaskan thunder [ __ ] i can't even lie man these smacked me up in ways that i didn't think i could before i've really never had something so what's the word so representative of an indica before like just i'm so hungry so tired so [ __ ] up when i smoke this it's simply something special y'all it's simply something special probably gonna smoke about half of this tonight and we'll see where the rest of it takes us oh man probably looks like [ __ ] [ __ ] uh that cookies made that sounded good man hell no hell no bro this [ __ ] i think i'm [ __ ] dead i'm not playing i haven't come sit down i'm so high dude look at my eyelids they're so swollen [Music] dude thunder cookies man i was praying i was hoping and praying actual thunder actual rain for the last rip of thunder cookies cheer i said cheer i'm so excited cheers [Music] oh oh my god i'm soaked yo let's talk about that thunder cookies real quick really i've got one big takeaway it's been several months since those video clips my god i don't know if since that time i've smoked a rev strain or really any cultivator strain that's had the intoxicating power that that thunder cookies had y'all saw me laying down there i look drugged look like i'm on pills i love that i think the alaskan thunder [ __ ] in that lineage i don't know if i gave it enough credit we've never seen it before but i do hope to see it again because i think it just added this [ __ ] you to the [ __ ] thunder cookies that i felt that i felt every single pull so needless to say i'm sad i haven't come across thunder cookies uh since recording those clips and you can bet your ass the next time it's available at my dispensary and i'm really trying to get plastered yeah yeah thunder cookies by rev is the answer uh thank you guys so much for all the comments and hitting me up i really appreciate it and uh i'll see you soon kushner ketchup out", "Vgk6PjnuvyI": "[Music] welcome to weed entertainment and today we're going to talk about something from three sea farms called high jump and look at this beautiful bud and i think likely this is going to be the stash bud and i just hate when the butt is so big it's so funny how people love the giant bud but then i have to destroy it and this is one beauty i love this thing so today we're gonna check it out let me load up my vapor cup straw i've already got two scoops in there i'm gonna put a third it's about the same amount as a bong hit when we tamper do the same thing every day i'm going to stick this down into the vapor cup and in about a minute and a half it's going to release the oil vapor the water vapor the terpenes and the kind of voice there's no burn and it's an unbelievable flavorful experience and just that little amount will stone you to the bone it's crazy and you can make this thing last 10 minutes just that little amount it's crazy so high jump by 3c farms comes in this jar and it's dead smack they have a a sativa to indica scale on the bottom and this flower is dead smack in the middle hybrid and you know what's notable about three sea farms is they try they cultivated the tahoe og that's the number one couch lock flower of all the flowers is from 3c farms tahoe g so when i was down at the lemonade orlita i asked what do you recommend and they say oh how about three seed farms i said i like three seed farms and they said well which one do you recommend and they said well did you try high jump so this was a bud dender recommended pick and so today we're going to check it out and it also says that this is a mix of sour diesel and norcal kush and so i don't know if i believe any of these things it's all a batch business you just don't know if it says sativa indica hybrid is there a test to say that's a sativa it's just people get a feeling so they name it that i you know they say uh indicas have fatter leaves right and that's how they know but i'm telling you there's a lot of marijuana lore that's not really based in fact right anyway so let's check it out high jump by 3c farms at a vapor cup at 330 degrees this flower has 24 thc and it's super smooth look how much vape i can make crazy so this flower starts out og and then goes to sweet crazy really cool nice this flower is a medium heavy weight it's got some focus you had a good feeling and i thought this was a good daytime flower so how do i rate high jump from 3c farms i'm giving this flower range i'm going to give it a heavyweight 865 and a lightweight 875 but this is a good flower if you like 3c farms high jumps a try it's a good one i liked it i really think this is a better daytime flower if you're a super heavy hitter maybe this doesn't give you the satisfaction you're looking for but i like weed during the day so it's a good one for me high jump from uh 3c farms is good and like i said i got it at the lemonade arlida and if you want to try it it's down there thanks for joining in if you want to get a vapor cup you can get it at vaporcup.com and i'm telling you there's no disappointment in this item you get this you're like oh my god and yes it is awesome i'll take your weed twice as far it'll stone you to the bone you don't really stink up the place and that's one of the things i really like i don't really like to stink up the place i like for no one to know actually if you want to see my favorite strains they're all on wheat entertainment.com thanks for joining in if you have

of those one of those things but there is a delay I apologize I had to I had to reconfigure this to go to a different page again it's all about analytics and statistics do my friends I mean - I apologize and I hope that they got what I like about YouTube is a chance really been lighting up underneath this phone Keith if you are watching I can't see if you are but if you are watching please feel free to admin accordingly as with any other show if you see something like half the time I can't see what's being said in the chat so but that being said we are looking for questions and alike to be honest I don't see myself broadcasting stills that holder channel yes don't Vicky all right listen to you okay in my on my public channel [Music] [Music] where is it going to the other line all right at this point I'm not gonna stop the show twice you know guys you just get out sir yeah can you please show it over to my public page oh there's no way to notify everybody I haven't figured I'd oh yeah but either way so be it it's frustrating as hell because that restarted the show but it's not letting me don't let me pick what I want to do should go even on the fly this is professional broadcasting software and he literally on the fly I should literally be able to yeah I literally should be able to set it to what I wanted to go but profile is not what it's on right now and that's really weird so anyway I was gonna keep chatting as we go through this and and with confusion I'm just going to create a new line for Facebook so to my friends on YouTube just enjoy we are going to be harvesting these ladies we got to go five different strains and and or six different strains and five different plots and they're all just test strange so you can see if they're not being grown very big for a reason um really it's just testing and seeing what their general yield is and by the formation etc and of course phenotype smell whole stuff that matters to to the grower when you're looking for a strain that you might want to use there no it's good huh all right well you know what I'm just gonna keep going where we're going here guys I'm just gonna simply go over to the other one I apologize but it is really as I thought I can't excited on a school that I was able to actually shut it off and turn it back on on the fly that's kind of neat with the no it's gonna it's gonna shut off and it's gonna turn back on here in a sec for you physically because they can't get off this profile page for some reason [Applause] yeah okay so we're about anyway to my friends on Facebook please please if there was ever a time share this around and if you have any questions after only no I'm gonna finish stirring this out on various platforms such as Google and other places it's interesting what the Internet can do with the right software and it's just you know for the for the poor man it takes a little longer to try to get the right equipment but once you get and get a hang of it then it's work pretty good most important is getting out the information I think and right now there's a lot of people that want to know how do I grow how do I harvest what do I need to know and this is where there's no right or wrong answer I always say this because I don't want anybody thinking I think on some big king master grower I'm not there's no right or wrong answer sometimes interpretations or things get lost in interpretation so we need to remember that as well as police runs into chat or a lot of us are growers the more people realize that we start harvesting plants that we're talking about this the more people might want to join into that conversation back in the day when we did nothing but grow shows here on campus in Canada that would be the one thing that I'd be worried about was growers arguing with each other and starting to drop the f-bomb on each other over over really interpretation oh really they were both saying the same thing it's just there it was an interpretation thing anyway here or there the one stream that I have out here this is as you can see this is sativa hybrid I wish the camera focuses in it's either going forward Mira's gonna focus on the plants all right now it's focusing on the on the planet not much I can do about that most importantly this is for patients a lot of this testing I like dragon got part really for me and I'd love to grow the plant in this case my daughter gluten this particular crop you know again realization on horizon I want to make sure that no matter what if anything she always had a skill to be able to grow a really good cannabis but because there's always going to be somebody that wants to buy a conscience or that old cannabis by the Bursar's a real corporation cannabis buddy just saying just the way it is who doesn't love the neighborhood grower so on also on today's show most wordly on today's show what was cutting these down and and if there's any questions that anybody has they were growing under a 600 in a tent and 600 full-spectrum so both in veg and flour the light number not changed oh so it wasn't a full HPS and or was it a full mhm it was a combination of the two and got most places that way now and you can turn them off or turn them down I didn't crank it up most people do this is simply people might have wildly talked at once down here and why I didn't manipulate it further every plant was equally talked one time and it was so I can see how they grow and I can get their expression while maximizing they'll put in the tent so this is important to understand the methodology and why why we use them if you choose you want to do a bonsai plant you have to understand those drastic tripping can take a long time take a lot of work in order to get that stuff done and in my case I can see like prisons in a big room there would be enough air movement and wind I think that I won't have as much problem with would mean to stake these down I mean honestly having to put stakes and knees to hold their weight you see them be just kind of drifting over and this is how they would look anyway it does the the outdoor boroughs I understand the same thing and my pride is in my daughter on learning pH keeping it balanced you can see the tips of the leaves aren't burnt this is again when you see somebody that is attentive to detail I can see a big grower from the back door just by going in the room it's not it's not hard to uh not so much good core from vibrato but more either they they may not know or they're just they're taking a shortcut or a lazier rope to doing it and yeah basically over these would be hung for four days and this one made me a bit longer because it's a little chunkier than the other ones but basically four days this will be hung and and then you don't win to the curing process and I'll show you guys going to come back after break in a mason jar what I mean how you can just put a small fewest at this big down inside and it will tell you what community is inside that airtight jar at all times so if you want to know if your broken your jar and if you're getting ready we'll get into that curing it one of the really the one with the topic separate from harvesting but also indicative and part of detail and of person so we'll touch on do everybody who's been invited to please enjoy yeah I don't want people partisan why they just sat there and talk about it but I'm open to talk I'm just going to make sure I can see the chart here now on youtube there so anybody on you - how many questions feel free to chime oh I'm almost positive that this strange alarm until I matched it up if it's not easy out then it's gonna be the one that I've learned actually for my way and it's it's there's two strangers very far the ones West Coast Wilcox what you guys will see it's an auto flower that finishes on its own head above this height so it's great for outdoors baseline it's on its own on the way that it cycles it's just it's a great outdoor short planet it hasn't been tested yet cuz again it just farmed it this year so what your fun I find to strange meaning for CP and this might be one of them but also the end of the day when you take your plants down usually will take live streams now and I can tell you all that the same day usually it'll take them down systematically for a reason and that'll be usually because they're finished one strain might finish on day 67 the other straining might finish on day 70 for 90% of Grover's cut their plants on day 60 to 65 because they don't know any better they don't wait too little spinal burst and they all wait for that final part and it's it's younger than with a sativa I've made this mistake a few times I'm wondering if I'm eating it right now this one I'm harvesting is just not giving time to finish its final swell but at the same time when your buds I guess it should that that one and your buds start to finish today's can't really see that it doesn't doesn't focus in but when your buds start to spiral out on the very tip getting a little spirals your plants die then you have to make sure that again go like this when you're done watering collect some water under your cup take your ppm Reader electro conductivity meter and measure the water if the measuring now John Barry fellow said 200 was good to harvest I know you know I've always said aim for 100 unless you're using long water no city water is 100 coming out of the top it's always around 50 in that area 60 just depends on which city you live in which municipality supplies the water so keeping that in mind it's also why I highly suggest if you can investigating a reverse osmosis machine get a reverse osmosis machine that would be that would be what works best for this jeez we're getting killed on this on this UTP anyway um I'm gonna chop this one down here again tying them upside down if you're wondering what I'm gonna do with this normally I will go through this and I will once it's up and hanging and leaves like this they don't need to be on some people will say they fall down and they cover the bud and they protect the bud you know the tricolor yeah I know please keep off youtube soon find its Facebook for some reason we went live to a wrong platform we're not on my public page so they don't get that notification and I have no way to notify them so which is the only hope for the best but anyway these families here again if you want to take the time to draw a family whose thing and just I mean drawing time so people may not talk about this some guys will say that they take them off during flowering I don't suggest that the other thing I wanted to know it again I only taught these one time and I let it grow all natural because I wanted to see its phenotypes I want to see how to grow and each string you'll see they all grow different and that's all I'll be able to tell them is this a keeper do I want to keep this do I want to make me farm this in the future and make it ten thousand seeds so the whole world can try them that's a choice for me to make that's what's good about being a countess breeder and brewery so you know when you start breeding strains and again this one here I don't know what to do with yet till a small good but harvesting is harvesting it doesn't matter what strain is and because this is all going to be hand trimmed I'm just getting rid of the bigger leaves that I don't need I don't believe that they're gonna a lot of people say they come down they protect the trichomes so your trichomes don't get banged around and I'm thinking to myself nothing should be banging the plant around to begin with if the plasters hanging there perfectly still and there's minor air maybe you don't need a lot you know you just need a little bit and proper RH you'll end up getting a proper grog and you're looking at just dry in the first four days it's not part of the cure but getting water sources such as families is something you can do I'm not gonna waste your time on the whole show doing this of course I'm also going to try and keep up with your comments check or tricone Oh keep going smoke there good that I'm in the school I just wanted to kind of show it what we're talking about because that we do scope and and these happen scope so these are definitely uh they're definitely done again they're milky they're done I'd say they're ten percent Ambler versus the 20 percent a little thank you the 20 percent number that most of them would do but a senator and scale or scope for just basic tracking would be like this for the four-year two-year program and any game just going and just check right in tight and take a look and you can see it in there milkiness I mean for me I can take a picture of this with my camera and show you guys you know can I see the picture that we post you know recently on Instagram someone you can just see the trek on the ball with us Sarah for me it's trying not to touch it too much so I don't get trifle they stay all over my on my computer here that's the main thing and yeah so I'm just going to finish and then best editors in the world I wish I knew the company I'll talk my head but this is awesome you know this is one more thing so yeah Keith summer 3 again this would be honest I would even give a day so when you cut them and just chopping my best it's really not like there's a wrong expense to cut and technically you hang it upside down you let it dry at this point and Vickie and I I didn't do it but I think you might do it after with with one of the string it actually makes some fresh juice in our in our blender and show you guys how you can make canvas juice and it's really a very fast yes yeah it's very high in fiber where am I do that Oh future great for treating arthritis or not if disorders not as much difference I know I wanted to do it was that finding difference keys what you tell people three dark second just before harvest or you're talking about doing a black note oh man you definitely read someone's little bro books they're key things so you've been around no I'm with you brother actually I've tested all these theories I think the most important thing and the best thing that I've learned and is most importantly Stokely trichome and then also your temperature if you can drop the temperature in their room 221 during the last two weeks of harvest there is a lot of benefits to doing so and I'm not gonna continue or I didn't how I I'm talking to really debate it but it's something that people who used to do I often ran my very much money you know the whole way through respecting very cool 25 it is optimal for plants they really just need and the temperature basically room temperature of an average average home is 25 a bit so this will be hung and again all the way doctor and pick off a bunch of leaders and shows done this is game on optic nerve and I gotta find anyway but it hung up in there and then I don't you see you go out at least this is giving my wife of ok it's like okay yeah and then I just gotta get my my wife is okay but no you can give your wife a bouquet - but then you're doing good they're officially no yeah it's all cut that's wrong over there I'm gonna grab another punch but seriously a bouquet of flowers I wish I was out with I should have cut that down for a moment instead of big basket of flowers oh my god there she's gonna count down and show you guys [ __ ] forever me over top of roses fall over roses are not cheap on Valentine's Day those guys man we on the eyes of cannabis grower I'm considering becoming a a Rose grower at certain times in their make big money big [Music] they do is just sent it the triple from price on the Hawks a 100% anyway but again another thing that's important to look at is the color of your leaves and the Ottoman off like in this plant you'll see a little more lightening of it there's two different plants in here but in this case this is the one that has I believe with the same yeah they're the same so again the planets short planet you know I'm happy with genetics well worth it oh you know I didn't know I forgot to do that one thing I was good to you ok this was also there's another bigger cooler yeah you know none of these be done we had the stickiest [ __ ] this particular what string was this because again my daughter I give her credit this is my daughter grew this I'm not gonna let credit to something that I did she is my apprentice but she definitely did this on her own and when you look at some of the raging on these leaves and stuff you can see I wish you can we do the believe justice no it's just the cameras trying to focus on my face I've seen this is better than [ __ ] numb what saying that to John the other day we're having issues with the studies but anyway you can see how healthy these these are and you know we should be getting a lot of different pictures of stuff but again we go this particular one it grew a little weird you can see what I mean by the spiraling out these little Christmas tree pose they're done you can tell it's done just but you need to pick off the top there that's a finished planet so and the same thing because it's all in this case I thought there was two plants in here there's actually only one but same thing I'm gonna go through and I'm gonna go pick up my leaves and everything else I'm sure you guys would be doing the same but this one here is another CBD strain it's a subpoena but you can tell by the leaf it's another hybrid that's a dominant so this is why these have actually 167 days so or sorry 72 days these are all being cut on the same big day but it's been 72 days to get them to this point so a flower so from the day they put them in Flour on December 7 till today correct and please of Aram online but from December 7th till today I believe is so yeah and this is an end when you're thinking about a ten a lot of people ask me is it worth growing in the tent and and again this is just one plant the very little attention not a lot of work you know you got a couple tops bottom mr elections go all natural how do i and i let this grow all natural and just allow the natural terminal body how'd you know how big that would be because then you gotta cookies all together and that's that gives you an idea what the terminal but little look like how do i not manipulate it but again this is all why we why we do the testing that we do and then get a sticky [ __ ] from all this BAM okay then I'll pull ups over here now you can really see the purpling off you guys can't really see the top of the plant but Vicki's gonna get some pictures anyway before we Harbor eyes but you can definitely see the Ottoman off this is what I talked about you know you think of the autumn time anyway any questions at all guys i I'm gonna revenge a couple of them I should have revenged that one that was really girthy and I read I went and cut because I got busy tied up in this show and I made a mistake but oh well keep dryer Bell and after I'll cook another core or in this case this is the pro mix one the new one I used to make my own mix but the pro mates now has cocoa in it and you can get that combination and I want Tessa and so far this has been the results again I often say the results are in the plant and these are examples and this is done in the tent under a 600 these aren't thoughts on what but these are 600 watt lights so you just keep that in mind your average LED is this six hundred to a thousand watts so I've got an LED a kind LED and the King on TV sitting right over there actually so hopefully this is not boring you guys do too much with a little grub on YouTube here this is where I got my birth YouTube now 11 years really have been doing this teaching people growing we're talking about growing stuff like this for a while that's why I thought it can I've never done wide so I wanted to back in the day because we stopped such I mean I used to get 20,000 years in the weekend it was different back then there wasn't 200 shows up there and a bunch of people buying buying views and buying hits and and and quite frankly replicating what was what was already help there but at the same time the math of information is important I just hope that it's accurate the people giving you the information as long as it's accurate we did the growth show for free there's people out there charging consulting fees you know I've been doing this since 2007 never charged a single person for helping them with their plans just because I believe in sharing that well that's a wealth of kindness and compassion I think that's something that needs to be say so while I've walked to do a DAB here please share this around guys we got a few giveaways we want to do we're not sure if we're going to do if you have any questions on any of the strains yeah that's just for that of that other you know I can't wait to meet you guys right yeah that's why that purple off and why it's sister didn't this is an example where there is two planets when I pull it over I'll show you guys there is two plants actually in the soil or in the one geo pot and they feel pods to air pruning if you guys know who I am you see fabric pots I don't want you guys to think of the best farmers in the world easily coffee bean farmers and stuff guys to be doing this for millennia you know what are they used they use fabric pots because it air prints so just like when you talk and you get two heads because you cut the top instead it's the same thing when the crook or the root grows out the bag the route starts to come out through the geo pot hits the air guys and splits in two so you get a bigger badder ruger mass you get bigger badder but remember these are 600 watt not dozen what butts and that's important I say that because some people are saying oh yeah that's just a thousand wallets you know and under a tent that's no big deal in it well it could be it could be a big deal could not be hopefully I'm hoping I'd like a distraction to my coffee do my job wait for these numbers to climb up to our friends on YouTube thank you please share this around to your girlfriends let them know that we are back and we'll continue with different photo shows on we had missed it I apologize for the background noise again we did this from our living room so it's extremely hard Vicky and I it really is a mom and pop operation at this point but to any investors or anybody out there interested in joining us please let us know because the one thing we do need is a studio having a studio in your living room is kind of cool and it's kind of fun but at the same time it's not the same as as what we'd like to do because then we can bring more guests and more people to you Vicky and I just can't invite you know everybody to our house so what I'm showing you here I guess what you're looking at in the cloud and all start to pull same thing pull stakes out and let the natural compliance weather just pull the weight up or not we'll see but this one here the Ottoman office didn't I talked about why you guys think about your husband time renowned film Ontario in Ontario in the autumn norm square a drive down the road and that was to cool the [ __ ] you can go for a drive and do all these cool colors and unless you're [ __ ] I know I'm a naturalist nature lover an animal lover so when I see trees I've got changed and I never thought one day idea cannabis grower as a result but auditing off is exactly anything that's what you're seeing right up here just purpley that's not just when the me that was a stock that actually couldn't hold its weight fell over you know but anyway you can see there it's autumn right off so just like a tree that's gonna express its different female soul this most importantly when you harvest if you are down low by 100 ppm so I'm gonna say all your leaves are gonna be like green like you see here you're gonna see the light green leaves and you're gonna see the the different you hear this you guys be here down when I'm sure it's the rusty sound of a finished cross and you're not important so again I would like to right away me I'm thinking to myself I don't need these leaves covering my trichomes but most importantly they're just more water and if there's more water to dry out then the plants going to take if you go to a class River system so it's going to pull water from the leaves to try and survive it's an actual it's gonna be its natural instincts that's not broke that was the whole stock that broke so there's a little example of a golf-ball treatments so this one of those free but actually because this also for the future so they have each one has its own distinct Turkey and this is actually let's toast Wilcox yes we're different yeah two different strings so what I just cut off here was the less those will cause even though they look the same this is here a different planet altogether this is the auto fire in West Coast Wilcox they've got lots of seeds I farm this this year now outdoors you can see why this would be good if you can lay down all your seeds go through after 30 days call out your males go back after a week double-check you've called out on your males use your one male to get loose in your garden but this is going to be the height you know literally that's not a very big planet that's an auto flower so this is the genotype does this I didn't make it flower and make it look like this this is its natural look all I give is to top it down here just like every other plant all them the top one time that's why this two two splits otherwise it would just be a straight up hole so it's quite an interesting little little crossbreed and a shout-out to resin seeds because some of their genetics are actually in here inadvertently so yeah questions questions share share remember to like the public page these guys I'm only home only a few pages okay or a few likes away from the sweet house [Applause] all right so all right any questions at all please spit them out I can just start chopping the [ __ ] down you know when you're really comfortable running a class so you're going to get top-heavy like this and occasionally like this here as soon as this fell over I knew to stick it up and there's nothing wrong with it it's just falling over permits it's on some weight and again when I talk about the light color beads you want to know that you're one that's auditing off and this big family for instance which would be hard enough to but it's also there's no nitrogen in these leaves which means you're not going to have a black burn in here but nomads you didn't in the least means no nitrogen but it's how the system works it pulls it up through there and a lot of your area your offs you think you're at least but it's still fundamentally when you're looking at your flush and a beautiful beautiful deep this is why I'm kind of leaving this maybe I'm home do you get pictures of Asia dick you got pictures do you want if there's any other pictures I could stick it back up picture call I get some after its kind of be like well if that's the thing is broken so he ends up thinking but you can take a picture like that if you want it's your fault and it's just disarming but you guys hopefully you guys yeah you guys to see that arcing off I'm not really dying that's the awning off so if you think about going down in the winter time and you start to see the changing color that that's exactly what what is is it a pure line I'll make adjusting some pictures for Instagram URIs oh yeah sent back up not mistaken understand I always stood in my mistake I didn't actually reach take it Oh beautiful so we that work great so harvesting around your computer not wise if you don't mind yet and sticky stuff on there and that's okay too to each their own anyway I'm going to switch off with a quick commercial break here please share around we know where to remember to like and share and ensure that you care and and again more questions to better I will try and get it I'm going to scroll back through the comments here on this break and catch up grasper what on this particular part this particular distant acquitted of you guys did you want bring on this particular my wet wait I already know you know he's going to convert to about 1.4 that's it but I only get five plants and I only need them really short and I did them from seed so that's not about it's not a bad pole for a camp a lot of people out they were saying how you know we can't do my one leg off one I can pull up to three pounds with the red string and the red grower and the braid optimal climate control and right you know all enhancers and hormones and anything else you might use to make that happen I've seen plants that big you guys have seen me with plants that big but I am looking for any feedback guys so as we go over these can polish and our brakes first one I'm going to play is going to be the coalition it's basically a pass to present this is all done we want then with the government of you guys those that know the story and know it but we're working on documentary Silver's we're still trying to bring up the appropriate height that we go with with and hopefully you guys can appreciate that because if it weren't for the aller case nobody would be growing in Canada and nobody would be looking at it around the world and that's something we need to remember because if you look at what the other constitutional what sort of what the other opponent of all countries are doing you know home growing know why because you're a danger even though here in Canada we proved in federal law federal court that there's no danger to throwing and no danger keys and cannabis other countries are using the exact same narrative so that they can monopolize their people's to buy license produce your cannabis this has been going on for five years it's nothing new six years stuff that we can look out I care about teaching people how to continue to grow plants like we have so this year will just give you an idea of what we did in the past to raise one point while we raised three hundred twenty thousand and the judge awarded us seven hundred and forty years thirty thousand I can't really excited number but we were awarded a large amount of money leaving only about eighty thousand left and our legal team just let go of what they owe so and that was important to us so to us it's a fully paid fully funded and that's why we're doing the documentary challenge that changed the course in the history of this country how do they remove those gardens and the MMPR came in the marijuana for medical purposes regulations there would have been no home growing and that legalization proposal I would note and remind everybody Justin Trudeau never once in any of his speeches mentioned home growing was going to be allowed under his legalization plan it was forced on them by the chorus on that night when you have to break and he was a little touch to the people that made it possible for us all to enjoy what I'm doing here today which is growing again his plan [Music] the Canadian government's getting out of the marijuana business Canada's health minister announced changes to medicinal marijuana access they're aimed at reducing crime but many people think it will do the exact opposite he's one of 26,000 Canadians with a licence to grow medical marijuana starting to feel anxious again since the community and government announced the system is about to change soon there will be no more medical marijuana produced and distributed by the government and no more growing regulated marijuana from home [Music] Jason Wilcox has been organizing the coalition against the repeal of the medical marijuana access regulations particularly the personal production licenses and designated production licenses leaving the patient options you should be able to go and house somebody going for you if they have places around the ability or ordering a pharmacy or big business whatever you want to call the program is model and you should all saw the right fundamentally especially because to what we are online just like when you smoking you should have the right to grow Health Canada will if successful only licensed large-scale commercial operators who produce our medicine at up to four times the current cost government is simply hi Jackie because she was getting up 26,000 222 legal Brewers trying to get as many of them as possible to understand immunity and get on this file so that we can actually be prepared its own health Ken they choose us to make their move we're all prepared to take it on take it on a federal judge has approved an injunction allowing current licensed medical marijuana users to continue growing their own pot past April 1st of Corvinus Columbia ruled users can continue growing their own pot for now this decision comes less than two weeks before new laws for medical pot take effect in Canada this is huge it is you know and then if some of the patient's right now they're not suffering today so I think they're gonna get to sleep it's very hard to get angry and frustrated as I think about the 500-plus in fact save is a write up people paranoid and not just paranoid god-given fear of walking back on the pharmaceuticals because of what the government's doing out to medical patients it's unconstitutional it's not Canadian it's not right take my MRIs we wouldn't send my and the mayor our form and the three other things like that was really really having a tough time but it seems that that one major stressor removing that threat of losing my card and by the government even having the threat of armed guards coming into my home did it to make sure that it had shut down when we really hurt and injured my feeling they're not was the beginning I'm aware of people who by who don't have a medicinal license who buy vert marijuana for medicinal growers hybrid use the analogy though to that would love you definitely drunk drivers and people on pills are in are going out driving drunk and killing people we police the drunk drivers we don't throw all the cars off the road and that's what they were trying to do with the patients and I'm glad that justice stepped in and interfere and allowed the Constitution our chance to put the LMP are under constitutional scrutiny I just really hope that we all get what I think we deserve which is freedom and that's what this is all about the coordination of what's going on these are people that want to stand up to the government with their endless amounts of money in pockets and you know where we can get the streets if the boat canvas talk to people you know it's got their promote to one person at a time change perception and views by I mean articulating truth and you know I'm proud to be part of that movement now we're out 180,000 dollars raised what are we looking at over and above the quarter million now that we originally set out I have to estimate hi I'd have to say look let's shoot for a million bucks because who knows you've seen the attitude of the federal government they recently are putting ads on paid for by the taxpayers about the dangers of intimacy it's just another there's gonna be a lot going on in the next year it's our one big in-store coq10 either we make it happen if we don't it doesn't matter who you are or what you are if you have a belief in ensuring that people's rights should be taken care of you should be donating it's it's for the people we the people who want this and you know it's coming people need access to these products because it helped prolong and saved a lot of suffering this is going to end with a standpoint of whether we will or will not win our garden we will so yeah he likes these producers you better be worried I'm not going anywhere this is part of over I'm pretty confident you're gonna win I feel mean you can't guarantee yeah but I feel like that's gonna be a preserved thing they were the right to grow your own cannabis for medical purposes as it should be I think that we got a super strong case I'm really looking forward to what John can do in the court and I hope it's heard fairly and with an open mind I hope we legalized but again I hope we legalized with Gardens so that there isn't this fight that I worry about between the underground these growers that exist and I know them on the BC economy is almost run by these growers you know if that starts a gas war then security is going to go up because the gangs get involved or real organised crime gets involved I say one isn't the top down first recognize it as medicine take it out of the CDSA [Music] I love the fight against Canada with Jason Wilcox as a brief break we had there and we've got her from the we have a name yet but friendly gorilla dancing around pops often times time and from commercial to commercial the yeah what else was I'm talking about Europe may be true making the adaptation again if we go back through the entire Arctic we can do that and again my biggest concern is they have basically admitted everything medical everything that we see as medical they've emitted from from the Canada when it comes to medical distribution medical education medical libraries where patients can go to get this information aside from Health Canada this is stuff that we haven't seen in the cannabis out so it's like you're almost pushing the medical patients great completely aside aside from putting in Bac a a seein sort a CMP our into the cannabis act so when I think about this here to me I'll never worry about this because I'm happy I was growing illegally long before I was growing really so it's not going to change the difference in whether I'm going to continue to in my own good faith feel that I'm helping people and healing people I'm far from the dealer I'm far from a bad person I don't think my wife by people if we're able to help people I think that if your due diligence into is is where the the balance of convenience needs to be and the courts look at the balance of you need so you know it's unfortunate that the courts keep ruling in our favor and it's why we're doing what we're doing you know it's because of court people in our favor saying yes we have ready to do this but here we are our patients not getting their licenses anybody here not get their license and get that crap about they want pictures of the inside of your location to prove it's an individual structure or any pictures of the outside to prove that you're you have unit number or anything there's been a couple reports of these sorts of letters going out and my friend at the island I'm a very different his wife she was told that she was potentially under investigation for where they're growing so these are things that are very concerning because you start thinking to yourself or medical patients why did helmet how in hell did they first search investigators you know is there is a reward is there validation to what's being said or was it just an officer of Health Canada being held managed with their language and saying you're being investigated your the investigators do finishing finishing up your file it used to be the officers finishing up your file I think it's another fear mongering tactic language is very powerful it can scare people so a minute you say investigator it can scare you even if you doesn't matter nobody wants to be investigated you know especially I'm not doing anything wrong so in this case it's something where I'd like to know if this is happening on a larger scale please let you know I can't help John Conroy can halt lawyers can halt God knows John Connor and he's semi-retired already not getting around much longer to keep helping those guys they say don't joke I'm keeping it real my wife can tell ya I how do they keep this client I'll gonna keep his nasally love me I'm no drug doing everything I can not to curse not to swear no I'm sure to share this [ __ ] around trying to get some [ __ ] people I don't hear that actually give a [ __ ] about crony catus plan to go [ __ ] a book but you kicked the government sauce give a [ __ ] about [ __ ] Michael back to war with it again I'm kind of just feeling the waters in the water the kind of home right now towards a sort of option is it wouldn't make much sense to me to continue in any in any aspect looking at fundraising or anything else and and it's not just means it's like I said and I have friends who are dealing with problems and in almost to a degree I almost say that is because some of the coalition leadership it seems to me most are being messed with people that served in the coalition in the government knows who they are people think I'm joking about this [ __ ] but I'm not okay I did for instance I followed the Brad Smith master lawsuit multi-million dollar lawsuit for breaching our privacy with before me 41,000 letters that were sent out to medical patients across Canada 42,000 story that case has been certified the Privacy Commissioner of Canada has already said it's a great a gross gross violation of medical patients rights so I keep talking about this because I know soon we're gonna have our soon we're gonna have everything back the story of our I just lost track see this is probably trying to run a broadcast see I actually run the broadcast here when you see that gorilla dancing or things changed on the screen I'm actually doing that while trying to try to hold this conversation and losing it sometimes because it gets frustrating I wish the lawyers would take this a little more serious at this juncture I wish we could do a little bit more but I think they smart they hired Curt you saw the guys who saw basically getting away are our people when you start taking away our best lawyers how can we fight our social justice lawyers how many fight John Calipari was ready to come out of retirement I hosted online I'm those who've seen it I posted John's letter that he said to me to have posted publicly I had to do with the again real actually federal constitutional challenge for practical compassion clubs in Canada not the phony ones not to pretend Hawaiians not go fund me accounts no the one with the giant palm where a trust account and the realtor working on the case that would that charter challenge and I know I'm sounding a little facetious and a little cocky when I say that it's because I don't like people after being accused of so much stuff in the coalition it's really hard when you actually see somebody doing what you were accused to do and and just standing by idly and saying nothing so again you know if you're out there trying to defend yourself and you're trying to raise money then call it your defense fund unless your lawyer has filed a constitutional challenge then quotes the statement of claim and let people know and more people get behind it the difference is like with me Iraq my visa I can get charged like charged Canada I didn't need to wait to get charged so for me if I can go to court stick up for patients I get it because it was the right thing to do unlike the other people out there saying they got charter challenges that they don't have trying to collect money which is fraud off giving supporters because we actually care and we all have good hearts I'm just on that big bear in the room that's willing to [ __ ] call a spade a spade you know and that's just the facts so it's unfortunate that there's people out there just call yourself a defense fund because it's all you are and for those that are getting involved with John Connor a case thank God there is somebody because I believe the British Columbia compassion love society might be the lead plaintiff and they're the oldest of the first club here in British Columbia it's important to know as we talk about the future for us here with compassion post I care about the patients so Loeb I have my own access here this is one thing but as an activist and a social justice activist I got a lot of time on my hand to think where do I want to place my my skills how do I want to help patients I can help them at the hospital I can help them deal with the doctor so I can help them to throw a lieutenant cigar or I can help them learn how to grow cannabis we use it so I got to find where do I want to apply these skills and at one time I knew that the coalition was the place to apply it now I'm seeing there's so much more going on that Canada and we need to wake up as a country all these cries for unity and people talking about bringing groups together that keep failing is only serving to hurt the lawyers and people out there lying about the money you're raising and saying that it's for a constitutional challenge it's only gonna hurt more when people try to actually raise money for a real constitutional challenge followed by John W Connor a QC you know if he files that case he already has a trust fund for it so any money being raised and the only constitutional charter challenge for kakashi loves is being held and done and preceded by mr. John W Connor a QC along the committee mr. Jack Lew is my understanding we'll be working with him on the case and last starting changes and that could change easily money things could change that's why people out there online maybe I recognized Canada before legalized we're sort of in a quasi war between the underground between crisis patients are being screwed patients don't have access patients have to spend their whole disability check for Millhouse weed but they can't even if they wonder why they can't make butter with it I can tell you why it's because it's been radiated and then I'll ask you another question I'll beg anybody watching me here YouTube Facebook anybody please pull up the study that shows gamma radiation gamma processing use on a triponin now what does it do to the tracfone because if you look at what it does to certain fruits there's a reason they don't gamma process certain fruits that are available just like the other gamma process vegetables on the road at the grocery store not a word of a lie look this stuff up because I can never find that study I can never find a study that's supported and what it did to the trichome all I knew is that way back in the day you can you can google this [ __ ] I was in front of the Globe and Mail so we're gonna join saying that I will not pay the federal government just as I'm sitting here now saying I'm not gonna pay you and your son Ellen you've given up trying to make me paid because I was not gonna pay for a bunch of Millhouse radiated [ __ ] that I was told is gonna be my medicine I couldn't press it into hash I tried to make butter with it but a friggin weakest fire and the day if Ellen you got ripped off and it felt like the country Canada ripped off and this is happening again right now we're getting ripped off so if we choose to just say look at the scraps are giving us a week but microbreweries blue we got microbreweries I hear this all so much and I'm like yeah we got microbreweries great good thing you know big deal got Michael birdies but $25,000 to do the paperwork I don't know if the microbreweries are that important again I'm looking at this from a realistic I mean I'm keeping it real here microbreweries I remember when the licensed producers service consultants there was people that same thing 25,000 they'll process your paperwork and you were guaranteed a license because Health Canada guaranteed everybody was gonna get licensed I remember the whole [ __ ] just a lottery here in Vancouver for getting a dispensary that I'm sure all 90 plus remember because none of the marks in existence now or maybe one or two are still in existence from the 19th we originally had thought we'd go down memory lane all day long with with this particular issue because he's one that really sticks with me but yeah back to start harvesting the plants out oh I gotta see what's going on here on YouTube I would agree again to our friends line on YouTube like why should there be a limit on how much one can heal let me give you these silly limits here in this country right for me I again as a medical patient so I'm actually doubled down on I'm under a federal injunction which protects me it's a restraining order on the federal government Canada I put it on I'm licking my lawyer John gummy conrick you see along with 15,000 on my friends the coalition then we proceeded to kick its ass so bad that they had to throw the program and rewrite a constitutional program that included patients being able to grow the plant at home that's why I can grow very large lower plants my wife I'll give her numbers on my wife go 200 plants you know to herself no as a medical patient it should be between you and your doctor Paul Kevin as a processing center they didn't be getting involved in doses nor should the CMA this is all stuff that's between us now do I believe that all that's necessary there's a lot to be said about truth and there's a lot to be said about tolerance and what I mean by that is you're gonna build tolerance like me I probably fart 15:25 Kaname today you know every time I had a fire God knows I failed yes this is just it's ridiculous how much real estate I mean if we have to go piss in the door and get drug tested how much can I'm going to show up on my piss I mean how much I I consume them in a day it's insane absolutely insane when you put two of us together we were equally consuming exactly and that's important that's important to know and they are they already consuming oh that's on YouTube again you guys out there because you know what's beautiful YouTube is that we reached around the world when I did my grow show before I was able to reach around the world because also and to teach and uh I'm sorry now I can't eat fly now we can come to you live it's not about a pre-recording events and pre-recording how to do certain things now you can come get alive and we can discuss it in our open chance we've got to chat yes I'm sure they can I'm sure they heard of it on YouTube there - what the little bell rings notification ever even though she's saying and hit the bell there's a little notification option but again we still have a lot more reliably guy well not a lot more I'm gonna harvest a couple more here on the show as we talk about it but right now again this is all about tent like I want patients to understand you can grow with a tent and relatively easily supply yourself with cannabis at a reasonable price ten cents a gram to a dollar fifty grand depending your your your capabilities and what you're using either way the investment in the reason I suggest tense is because you do not want to alter your suite if you alter punch a hole in your wall you know for venting or whatever or punch out your window and put a board up and you can punch a hole in it you're still altering the suite and that's breaching your tenancy agreement it can get you evicted there's a fungus growing on your soil I would suggest using the rock side you can get a high end peroxide that you're actually at your local grocer or you can get high end peroxide and I would highly suggest looking at what you dyed them with water with that and run that down through and flush your soil and purge and sterilize your soil and then start all over with a new fresh beat again this is why I go back to I'm a high supporter of RO water or using reverse osmosis water because you don't get that chlorine and for mine in there that messes with the nutrients all this is growing my Green Planet nutrients as always they're my I've been promoting him for 11 years for free just to let you know that's how I do it you know that's this isn't a money thing it's because I love their product thing and I love what they did and it's because it was purchased this is done with many one I've done many one for now I've done about 300 show those counting them was crazy I've done 300 shows where I used a 1 this is many one and resen being used on this intent and a basic cheetah pod with your basic Chrome it's a new protocol and I'm really keeping it simple and and my daughter did this great she I'm very proud of her so this is once again another good planet I'm gonna growl that girl's a green thumb she doesn't love it she's like me either one of us are brothers she's good at it I don't think this is in the yard this isn't the Alaska part of the ATF on this ETF is basket on your phone it's a classic down there again hats off to resin seeds I can't remember that's hammer head or hammer sure every chart but the other thing that I would say is again I stand by this because year after year keep going another clamp and pull you in there they're not they shouldn't eat that heavy you know what I pull my back leave the windows last weekend's this one's the smallest one who probably although this is yeah this definitely the smallest one of all them and I guess this is I probably cut this one pretty quick because this is also a scab alone so this is by itself let's just get these over here this is again you know I gotta use it again my nose I gotta actually combine which strains are wage because adult my daughter did this crop she messed up on the market when we had to redo some reefs taking she forgot to change the flags so we didn't know what strain was what and because I haven't grown them before I can't really recognize and less than my home and and as I showed earlier the show West Coast Wilcox train now that all of our works great and it'd be great but I'd rather get rid of this planet I remember I'm different hurry brother from went down murder you're absolutely break I'm completely true making the Recreational in the act first is protected and politician spins when getting arrested I can't see the rest your comment but I'm assuming that's what it is I agree by placing the medicinal aspects of the program sliding that into you know the cannabis we use we use resin want resin and maybe not believes I totally kicks ass big-time I'm listening to myself right right yeah oh my god I can't get the second by second Cameron I'm out in the hell it didn't discourse with uh no I'm having a good day about anything look at my planets this is ATF this hasn't been seen since 1973 these are one of genetics you call yourself a grower or whatever or have access to genetics I love the bud structure this one won't be coming down right now but you can see the bud structure goes all the way down like you're try sticks but this is lasting Thunder [ __ ] look at the wiggle on that actually you know what you might be down to there's two of them in here I want to pin them down I'm just looking at them now I could bring them down just because I've seen how they they do no I don't forget popping the ATF for future reference for those out there that plan to grow it but these seeds these beans were from 1973 so if you can imagine or sorry nineteen eighty-something yeah but I had been popped so I had put you know that's number of seeds down but I only got like a sixty percent success rate so I'd barely buy any of it to come back to life so these are so these are genetics that are definitely not alter absolutely Mangiamo I can guarantee planet and care in Canada that happen [ __ ] in genetically modified or those beautiful seeds right there absolutely and again green eyeshadow degree plan you can spend a lot of people they get they contact me and they ask me about the nutrients I remind them that you know I'd love to get my own and tree company off the ground and going and we are working on West Coast Wilcox grows but that's a it's a lot of projects going on at one time most importantly is getting back to basics for me I got twenty five thousand subscribers on YouTube here because I taught people how to grow no because I was an activist not because they took on the government not because nobody cares about that they just care whether we come up with you you know we parties like number one on YouTube like you know what I agree I haven't seen ATF's is like ninety eight exactly none of us have seen the ship for like thirty years we had twenty thirty years but these are truly 1970-1980 genetics like this is a gift these are a gift and a blessing ya know my friend on the island here I want from what you see these better I'm trying to climb this a cat lady because it's it's a way they grow analogy there's only four of them that I ended up ended up keeping for the testing purposes anyway you know we got more decent stuff but for these four I was happy with and what I want to point out again these are now a weekend of flush and they got seven days left to go but you can see here that's why I considered doing want to cut it down you know I know that my electric conductivity about 150 with this point right now the last time I checked it that's why I said it watch for this one I'm not worried about it because ETS gonna go a little bit longer but now I'm looking at a I looked at the trikes there darling out that everybody would say yeah it's usable let it go and at same time I'm thinking this might just do its final burst I really want to study this one because this one is the one that we're going to farm because I've got balance and I've got females of this one I've got more seeds and most importantly when you save your males because you know a gorilla jumps on the screen I think he enjoys it as well so there you go gorilla says it's on we have to give this gorilla name anybody want to help us with a name no we haven't named yet but he pops on him from time to time and he will do is a CNC dance and you were saying and I wanted to bring the ATF over now the one that we showed you guys earlier with the big popcorn button stops really interesting but the reason this is interesting is again because it had such a low survival rate I'm proud of my ability to germinate seeds you know I've had to you for the past 25 years as a medical patient but to learn how to do it and do it right and and the optic and optimize it is important and when you're dealing with strings like this like I really use my best methodology and my closest intended this and I still only got 60 percent success rate so this is truly and unfeathered and if you look at the nice ridges in the leaves and stuff I mean just beautiful beautiful healthy strong dirty plant and it reminds me of why I love to grow and why I believe that there's land races and and there needs to be land races this has to happen we need to make this happen I always check John Denver our developer online yes I've taught this now again you can google this [ __ ] scope you go by Jason Wilcox there's nobody else don't they were talking before me I got a hundred videos on YouTube here if you go to youtube you can definitely see it there I'm not going to take the time out to go find it but if you google that [ __ ] you'll find it um we've done everything from Road treaties to you know there's 800 videos there's everything unfortunately a lot of them have been lately live so you don't have to go back to before they're before I have to funky monkeys a friggin gorilla Hoshi if anybody's looking a little bit what Bokashi is but apparently saying it like they teach you from my master controller does that's me DVD dad so Chris booming but you know what apparently you can find the products online and I'm going to look them up after the show and definitely will consider an ex-cop and the biggest thing to remember guys is while it gets you going to see that the gorillas des in there but also also guys it's important because patient after patient has contact to be understanding what my name is telling me I can't grow I'm reminding them that are you a medical patient with an AC MVR permit yes okay then it doesn't apply to you you're under the jurisdiction of the federal government Canada you are not under the jurisdiction of the provincial government nor your municipality your privacy rights and so forth we lost solely in the jurisdiction of the federal government and federal law what's your favorite flavor fruity floral or feet gassy covered it all I guess again you're asking a question I just you know I get that no essential central oils is what Terps are in they reside outside the drive motor so the essential oils of the plants so when I touch this and it gets sticky everybody says oh that's a trichomes it's not always just a tricone melting into your hand it's actually the oils it's the essential oils for me I'd be drawn to again or I would go to not necessarily any one strain I'm looking for everything okay there are lots of phenotype for instance the way the terpene development is the genotype has very similar thing sorry the Bloods predisposed in this any seed is what it's going to put out there so the by mice I might like the aroma and I might say oh man this is awesome or it might be all know and this is gonna stink the house up so bad you know we're gonna get in trouble like this mysteries like that my point is is that until you smoke it you just don't know it yeah true and I'm gonna keep it real root the fruit farmer Flay and it's all the same but you need to smoke it and once you smoke it you can then truly give a fair judgement that's just my opinion you know I mean everybody has a right to their own opinion but it's I've been tricked before with strains and I think that's the reason I'm saying it I've tricked myself before with strains and I don't wanna keep that that's not fun I'm switching up my sponsor board here these gentlemen please that are watching and a shout out to ATF as well honestly guys please not now I mean not ETF I mean planning yeah anyway I think it's very important but I think sure but we need to remember that there was one time where were England and everybody else was watching what was going on and though they thought that I lost my mind when I said that we were gonna restrain the government put them on trial I started sounding like I was going crazy I don't blame home for dropping off because people don't care to hear about politics and law and the boring stuff they want hear about how to smoke dad what do you have it on one side voltage made I won't tell you right now this high voltage is made of chaos my crumble if nice and you need to be an expert to smoke one yeah you do and one you're an expert you can smoke one I'm sweet sweet dab a lot daily Dobber that [ __ ] if your music and I could not bring someone you know no [ __ ] and then I mean that would rebel like you know the best of the best of the country it's a grumble - it's like it's a cover it's like honestly it reminds me of what I just I'm gonna be honest back in the day before there was closed loop systems any of this [ __ ] and I was growing 15 lights in my basement we were using crumble and crumble is nothing more than open blastin and left to sit until the point that powers and combo it becomes okay this is different Travis Finnegan is watching a brother I love you we got to get out for dinner I haven't seen you in a while and I want to definitely say ho you don't tune in that often a bro I'm back doing what I do best man and and I feel comfortable doing it I wanted to be able to helping more people and doing more but I'm kind of feeling handcuffed right now so I figured I just keep doing what we're doing and we're and today we're talking about this particular strain is is Alaskan Thunder far from the 1980s and and the clock father gave it to me so he he hooked me up its train and I raised it and I only had a 60 percent success rate first time ever my you know since I'm really in many years of mastering the cloning in the germination aspect of cannabis I was shocked that that I had such a low success rate however we managed again to pop Kelly wasn't sure if they would even pop because he has such old genetics he has original land races that everybody wants like he actually hasn't and yeah I can't say enough about that this is a good example I think you seeing a bud structure and everything else I kind of let it grow all natural again only one kind you can see the be breaking in here and you'll see one in this plant is getting ready here and not burn up sure you can see I wanted to fill out this area I didn't want a straight line coming up in wasting space in my tent I want my intent maximized so what we're going to be teaching in upcoming shows and now that we got the tent cam going the tent camps gonna allow us to be able to switch over and show you guys live and we've done that before show you guys live what's going on in the tent and what we're doing the deep water culture was a good example of one we had a lot of fun with because putting it down and setting it up it was a lot of work to make sure everything was done right but interesting in in its results and there's a lot of other things still to come and I've been contacted by numerous companies my problem is when you get 8 different like that it's saying you pass my life what company do you go it to test their might because they all were they're all one they're all want me to test it you know but it's a pretty light but at the same time it could cost me and in time and in effort trying to test that but you know if you guys are out there again and then the only words of encouragement I can give people ask me well how do you get sponsors and how did you go about that I quite frankly approached them and said look it I can reach but in the day you know I said I didn't 20,000 people I get hit in the weekend and that's because I was fundamentally focused just on growing and that's what I'm going to get back to because again you got to go back to what worked and for me clearly talking about law and politics has only served to hurt camps Canada versus um better even though it didn't save home growing in the country of Canada it's it's ironic that that I'm sitting here at same time saying it was uh was unfortunate but it is what it is and I also wanted to know got guerrilla tents now the reason I say this I had an experience to I'm not gonna name the other company because I'm not into brand bashing but the one tent that I grew it it stunk and it basically got busted I mean my landlord when I first of the Vancouver before I got into this place my first landlord this guy says to me hey you can't grow no and I kind of said to him I wasn't even though my tent was in my living room he was just like why I know what's going on man can be new in this year and and I was bad because I thought to myself man if I only had the gorilla tent that I have right now thanks to Pacific Northwest arts like here in British Columbia another longtime supporter of cannabis in Canada hooked me up with a nice ten and and you could sit in my living room and there's no how to smell the weed except for times like now when I bring a plant out but when it's in there I've got the little four-foot carbon filter or two and a half or whatever there's at least four foot carbon filter and then a big hyper fan and then a muffler on top of the fan so when I talk about being a good grower god it's just like it's a series I really need it be a grower cure your smell kill yourself be a good girl and you can really have a lot of fun like today after the show's down I'm probably gonna do a live Instagram video with Vicky just doing juicing because people don't always see that you can also just if you don't want to get haunting you just want to get your your fly myself into you people don't realize Vicky and I do a lot of R&D it but it's because we're not in this for the money as much as we're in this for sharing the world of the healing I'm now 25 years ninja my illness and I lost a lot of friends over the years I've seen a lot of turmoil and cannabis has opened my eyes worldwide to the and the potential benefits we had to be yielded from this plan just because we've shown CBD does certain things in THC does certain things and I've shown how they do different things for different patients there's 100 plus vital cannabinoids that haven't been fully explored let alone the entourage effect what happens when only these cannabinoids are put together what happens when these are it is a locking key for cancer in there I'm going to throw that out there because I want people to think about this I talked about the World Health Organization reclassifying cannabis I said this in 2013 it's on my show this digitally backed up predicted what in Roja or what did the little Health Organization recently do we've lost the light cannabis you know why because we legalized it around the world all they did was get rid of the treaties by Justin Trudeau bro oh the life the life the THC is kinda long it's Pleasant smoking experience um I don't see seeds to put it i don't send seeds to Brazil yeah if there's any seed companies out there are two guys if you're interested in talking and you want us to profile your genetics on our show Leslie that's something that we can make happen we have been approached by by several companies and and most recently it's been it's been presidencies and it's taken us a while grow no madman seeds of grovel paradise gardens or not Paris garden sort of paradise seeds if we can keep this going because sharing genetics with one another and and again this is where for me if you come to Vancouver come see me that's all I can say because I'm really is one of those things where I want to get as many if we can get seeds and we can get and we can get clones out to people and allow people to start growing and they can just recognize the difference before they close this loophole before they close the medical program we don't do something if you don't get your licenses if we don't flood that program called the ACM PR regardless of all their arbitrary barriers to access regardless of all their letters of denial and others of confirmation that they want we need to flood that program the medical program alive and if we allow the medical program to die you'll all be non-medical users and I'll go back to what you guys are going to see this in the newspapers and you're saying oh god yeah you're right it was they can't tax medical it's illegal to talk to me right now it's only because cannabis doesn't have a DIN number as soon as it has a drug identification number we're all hooked during your non-medical remember to read the cameras on I hate it because the fact that they want to classify you as non-medical just because they could touch you you're like a cow no you're a bigger County or this farm and you patients you go over there because we can't tax you and we can't tax your home Brooklyn when you tax upon your supplies but we can't tax you on your home growing so the government loses and loses and loses so it was never about compassion if we look at what the government saw what the government's weren't done it went past the point of compassion to the point of bringing down literally our today look what we are now where were to the point of a form of distraction and the only thing that I look forward to is I myself and our friends in the least ones working in our reduction are looking at how are we going to do this regardless because we already know in our hearts we already know that this planet can be miraculous things we have a few doctors that are working with us we have different people that are working with us I think it's important for Canada to recognize what's going on and to recognize that these changes these changes can happen real quick like next year and it's what Kelly and I have talked about he's a vice president at coalition we've talked about what if they do this what if they knock out all growing plant counts I walked and said if the doctor doesn't put down a plant count or put down a gram number then you don't have a plant count and platform relations based on your your plant counts based on your doctor's prescription or authorization not prescription so it's important to understand that and then understand the difference I gave you Dennis I want to say what happened with the LPS is you're getting they love doing they're going to stay we honored our in you're getting our mill tell us the oh crap we only said we were going to give compassion to pricing we didn't say we were going to give a concert we there's a big difference between that but I can tell you all help you with comps are we absolutely yes I'll give you two reasons to get a medical license versus stay recreational if your recreational you can go for class you can have three plant or 30 grams on you in public remember that's just over an ounce in public that's it and for travel so I want to think about that for class 30 grams get a medical license for only 5 grams which is what a start side sleeping cough reviews yet one of those gonna start out by midday obvious prescriptions 5 grams doctors given all all day long for free here in Vancouver so you get a 5 gram license now what do you get with a 5 gram license from the ACP are you get to carry a hundred and fifty grams in public I know it's not much but it's all he'll walk more than 30 and you know what the biggest kicker is you could to store an unlimited amount of cannabis in your home you have no story general but the recreational user I believe is is restricted to a thing is 150 or 175 for what they're allowed to store so should you become a medical user it's worth the 6 months [ __ ] that they're going to put you through they're gonna put you through this [ __ ] and they're gonna make you once you just [ __ ] you and go and go grow anyway that's what health care is very good at they're very good at creating barriers and creating barriers to access basically by virtue of making sending back you license say hey you missed a date they need fixed a date and you send your license back then they send it back to you again well we need more information and it's like they want to build now so since when did they need a bill the promis'd investigating so they want a bill for some reason to verify that your landlord signature wasn't good enough this time so basically Health Canada saying this guy is not good enough he must be a fraud so you got to go with this guy and this is this is this is what's wrong with the system right now is a health care law seemingly one has investigator officers and two wants to investigate patients who have large licenses and I think that in itself needs to be investigated and stopped if there's a crime being committed and then in this palette II it's the police's job to start that investigation and finish it there's some of the federal government's job to start trying to entrap patients by asking them to send pictures and I've got a piece of paper here so I know the answer I thought we were allowed eliminated yes that's what they said your love I'm going to wait like right now I'm sitting here without a care in the world about how much DVD there's a bunch of see video there I've got about friggin eight liters of oil over there highly infused oil this is what's sitting around my house at any given time because I love weed it's just like if you love plants you know thirty plants in your house all kinds of different plants maybe if you love pictures you have pictures all over your walls if you love posters maybe you got posters all over your walls with me I got plants to [ __ ] all over my walls I love that you like parties is so goddamn sticky you give it me the sticky but keeping it real that's just the way it is and my friends Canada is nothing more than a footprint and I've called this down the pipeline anybody want to come on the show challenge me I am open to debate I am open to discussion and I'm open to retraction if I'm wrong but I tell you now I predicted the monopoly from 2012 even while Reuters didn't want me calling them a monopoly because it looked bad in court I ain't give a [ __ ] so monopoly now a monopoly over sales and distribution both here in Canada and globally and we're all just sheep the only reason we get to grow this plant is because myself and John Connon soir\u00e9e and then 15,000 supporters took the federal government basically took them to trial put them under a restraining order beat their ass and made them Institute home growing now my concern is what comes next yes yes who'd you recommend something else somebody say you know what they're looking for a doctor the only doctor they willing to sign up somewhere it's a pretty see anyways because a small town who would you recommend oh the old freezer proudly the only doctor much time to shut down who do you recommend I'm in the Fraser Valley I would say home typing on CRC I do they do Skype I do yes I believe and contact NCRC i if you wish they might do Skype there are some people that do Skype but I tell you now if you came here on a day that the clinic is open I can take you to a clinic with a doctor anyway the the doctor the doctor that works at this clinic is part of the can of clinics of Canada when the CMA came out with the one two three gram I'm trying to watch my language bullcrap suggestion that doctors only prescribe one two three grams are only authorized one two three grams it was based on what will be Israelis oh [ __ ] what both did you to read these words their testimony got thrown out of court what the [ __ ] we listened to the Israelis for this is Canada none of the free [ __ ] and now this went back to this we talked to the question this goes back to a question that I want to point to you guys now and ask you what do you believe yeah should this plant be a health product for sure to be a drug of all i'm often asked myself what's the difference between a drug and what's the difference between a health product sometimes they cross lines and I get that but I couldn't understand what defines our drug then what put takes it away from the natural category because to me and this is still natural when it doesn't hurt anybody I can see where if it hurts somebody could get pulled over here if they've had an overdose rate it could be over here if it actually had a fatality rate it could be over here and you can say it's a drug but until then it's ten magic mushrooms I guess turned drug to and I question whether they really are abroad where are they are they more just a mushroom and that becomes a question of really for the courts to look at in the future to me this is still plant that should be in herbology and begin be given a proper a proper view I'm going to go as far as I I haven't got much time left here ago I actually did that little any time left but I got one other phone I know I've actually been doing fresh frozen for the first time so it's going to be interesting - for the first time ever freeze one of my plants fresh and then how they get forgive me okay it's important information for medical patients because if you don't if you don't understand how wrong if you don't understand how important it is that these clinics what they did is when the family did that they branched off a bunch of doctors 30% of the CMA or whatever said screw you we've seen we've seen patients get better in our in our care so screw you type thing and and we were surprised to be quite honest but anyway they're called the canna clinics of Canada and these doctors will prescribe for you or they'll authorize you if they understand they're only they're not prescribing anything because there's nothing in their books yet but there right now so here immediately we can get you authorized if you contact the MCR SBI they can get you authorized five grams I believe is free anything else um you have to work out with them I'm not sure how it works with working with their particular facility but I thought I would give a shout out to the person that runs that facility Terry where Croft because he's like one of our our coalition national representatives for a couple of years let's quickly change this up just in closing in the last little bit to CBD CBD CBD CBD CBD cos east for these strains aside from ETF which was again an 80s inaudible flower so it's another one where you need to look at and why don't you see it was supposed to auto flower and I'm not going to get into too much discussion about that but with any out with any auto flower it's one thing to remember camels control the licensing that regulation status maximum possession I couldn't like exactly and now would be sets of maximum position that's the regulation and that's not under medical that's recreational in BC under cannabis Control Act what I just said was that we don't apply to BC rules nor do we apply to Vancouver rules because we fall under the jurisdiction of Health Canada's regulations and those regulations alone they're family that's federal regulation federal jurisdiction understanding jurisdictional are just jurisdictional law and understanding what the powers and what's overreaching and what we have to actually answer to is very important and medical or recreational user if you think a thousand grams is a lot to store I would remind you that if you just take that time to get that a CMP our license you can store an unlimited amount I'll repeat an unlimited amount call John W comma Q C's office and say Jason Wilcox is we can store a pollutant tomorrow's I true you'll get pissed off at me for tonguing do so but you'll see for yourself that I'm telling you the truth now why they wrote this law I don't know it makes me question why they did it but hey do you want me to storage my head that makes me relax a little more Mike as much lead as I want part of me wants to make my whole will frigging my whole place into it but then I don't want to be a bad neighbor you don't want to stink up anything that's where tents and again shout out to gorilla tents because they truly kill the smell you scrub the air they actually you popping up in a bedroom and in a small room in a basement without ever punching any holes in anything and still be able to get an optimal growth and that's what I've been able to demonstrate to you guys just with here I'm sitting here in my condo right now demonstrating to you how it can be done at home and that's what Myers this is what it was all about and then also for the medical patients grow bigger Travis if you're still watching is example how larger licenses because they need them they have high high tolerance like Vicky and I this isn't my main location for my garden and so I just test my plants here you know I'm allowed to throw four plants on top of my license if you didn't know that legally speaking on top of your license of say 25 plants you can add another four because you're also legal I know it's [ __ ] up right well welcome to the separation of jurisdictional powers from the federal government the provincial just get it lends credence to what I was just saying we're losing viewers like crazy on Maurice freakeating a favor broke you just said it's shared this around some of your groups I know you could get a few people watching on Facebook let's light this up for the last half hour I'm going to cut off the commercial break so I can do and uh we're gonna grab the other plant that we're gonna cut we're here to talk about it was the smallest yielding of all the plants and I don't know why but we're going to talk about it and it's its own string so of course it could be just it's a really good strain so uh most importantly if everybody wants to know my guesstimate for my driveway is going to be about 1.4 and that was just all straight around with some plants and really not putting a lot of work and that's a 600 that's not a thousand if it was a thousand it would be more like 2.4 but it is what it is it just depends on how things go I'm going to switch off the commercial this is lift 2019 in Vancouver and sharp-eyed none other than my own daughter mr. or miss twin Adair Wilcox and she also did the editing for this particular one costing me a lot in your kid when your kid is 19 and realizes what money's worth and what trying to work it's like you don't want it you don't want to teach them for that reason but anyway here's the footage from left and maybe I'll play a little beard brother stuff hang on to your socks get with it I might even get Vicky guys over here to talk about because that is a CBD strain and it's gonna get straight little for her for her again I only make oils for her I don't really make CBD nothing for me I'm a guy I make it for her and I've read these strains for her and if that's not love I don't what is its love for my plan I'm combining the two I know my woman of my pointer so that's uh that's just straight goods that's what I did addressed the seeds I noticed was it was a lot of auto flowers and a lot of high CBD strains and had once of cups so that's why I wanted to serve with little strains so we're going to be talking about what you put for instance if you want to make a homemade batch how much CBD do you need how much THC should give me how do you make your base oils do you make base oils how do you use CBD how do you test CBD and I'm actually going to show it I show actually I posted on Instagram it's a test on how you can tell if your CBD is just Chinese buff crap but I'll sink to the bottom enough not do nothing or if it separates the molecules and floats like a bunch of nice little crystals on top of the glass like a film then you know you got 99 something percent pure see me need crystalline I was proud to bring that to you guys it's important but please on Facebook share this around if you can guys I want to see a few more people on if they have any questions especially when we bring over the next planet before we start harvesting again I started out to green plant nutrients Pacific Northwest garden supply beer Brothers concentrate home genius who else we got we got a gorilla tents tmv naturals for the enhancer you want co2 at 1200 parts per million calls only all you have to do is follow the instructions and be attentive to the enhancer and you will obtain your 1200 parts per million inside your tent and that's what these plants were grown with as well so that's important understand so with shout out to TBD naturals and any sponsors that we're not we're not mentioning right now there might be reason for that or it's just because of to stone you know I forgot but you know that we're there and you are on our spinning wheel and making sure that you're in our credits accordingly now we will be putting up our schedule and starting our show what we haven't decided on yet is because of the documentary the documentary is now up to nine terabytes of recording information so any others out there that are interested in working on the coalition documentary if you live in the Lower Mainland and you're interested in trying to help me finish what has been a very adventurous journey and filming people that would be awesome to help with the documentary part because it's really sitting down going over the footage I'll be narrating it but really going over the footage and just stitching it together what goes where and and turning it into an actual documentary versus a bunch of recorded footage so and remember that's open to anybody so it's very important and if what I'm gliding is a lot of people are asking well Jason we have no schedule for you and I'm sorry to all my subscribers I love you and I I love this plan as much as I love my subscribers because talking to people was how I learned when I made mistakes when I didn't I learned through the internet and through social activity and learning to empower other people to live better lives there's no better feeling in the world and when other people empower me to live a better life there's no better feeling than that either it works both ways so you know when I go out and I doing this show I feel good sometimes I go over like today whether there's 8 people on Facebook that's not a lot of people watching but on YouTube I've got almost 30 people children and and and kicking it in the child that's what I'm talking about one time we need to get around the world I wanted to do live shows when we are in the big you know 15 line show is where we should be we should be doing live shows from proper grows where we just show you big trees to show you all the methodologies to teach you different things you know what this is think we will be doing the Vicky was just saying on the barter so let's get into the CBD now again the CBD stuff I'm not going to do that the glass test here because to the camera's not going to prove it but you can check that on Instagram or on Facebook it is probably to scroll down my page a bit you know and you'll find it but it will show you that on the glass at the diner if it's purified water or easy just put a little touch of CBD it will float along the top because remember every single cannabinoid is made of oil in this water repellent so it will not sink now anything that sinks to the bottom has either gel stabilizers for the stabilizers or puffs or all the above that's the problem with CBD in Canada now the reason I talk about this with my wife when I met her people don't know this but when I met Vicky she was in a walker something listen don't I don't have maybe I'll pull her video down here actually and show you guys for a video that really sets forth how CBD changed her life if I do I do with my clipper there we go all right so I also I'll pull that down for you guys to see in a sec here but when I ordered when I go to break and the reason I say that is because this particular video there's this one on the Justin Lewis video too at the top grab you videos if you have it um you know really really touch your heart and make you understand it cannabis can really impact people's lives and quality of life is everything I often preach it empowerment empowerment empowerment empower each other to live a better life don't punch down always punch out shoot for the stars but don't punch down don't knock somebody when they're already down help them get back up it's the difference and I guess how we how we do how we treat people do you remember what I call that oh my god okay once I care down hold it I'm gonna load this into my broadcaster and then you guys will be able to see it and I'm going to grab the other plans in the meantime do a job and then when we come back we can go ahead and and continue actually sorry there's going to be a lift and then Vicky's video and then I'll come back with the last one that we're going to harvest as the smaller buds but they're tighter buds and we'll talk about that particular one and why it may or may not have turned out the way it has and right now this is the video that Vicky did just so you know for some reason they felt the need to age restrictive on YouTube they flagged it and then not allowing it in certain countries I want you to think about this when you watch this video I want you to see where she in any way suggest criminality and then for them to flag this video it's out 1496 years I if you feel this video hits you share it around share it with your family share with your friends because it's really what makes the difference oh there's even a dab off here and drone footage I got a couple of good ones I can play you guys since I'm killing time I got to let this finish now hmm alleged that malted milk that's definitely interesting that's right one just bear with me friends as I get into this because this will actually go back a little bit of ways to when Vicki and I first got together and as we saved this again I'm not quite sure why there we go okay so I've got to lift video first I'll do the kicking morphine one because this one is again we talk about kicking morphine stopping opiates addressing the opioid crisis and addressed in the fentanyl crisis if we were the one addresses let's address it head-on unless it dress it for real because there's people out there who have already done it including myself and I've watched Vicki do it if we remember this is filmed just prior to us traveling for her first time she didn't think she could travel for 120 minutes in a car when I first met her and we drove across the country together but lord knows she suffered in those first couple of days you know in first couple of I'd say first first four or five days she really she went through her ups and downs but you know what if it wasn't for this product and I'll give it to him the natural remedies again thank you for introducing us to CBD and thank you for helping to save my wife's life um you know her quality of life because I've been able to show her the world which if it wasn't for discovering CBD I don't think she would have she would have been able to see because she wouldn't believed it was possible and that that's a lot of credence to to CBE as we continue to talk so we'll see you guys in about about ten minutes we're gonna see you later guy here on my own 150 oh yeah we'll see you guys about five minutes welcome on cascara j-smoove us the real cameras in Canada we're celebrating a win in our hi this is a Vicki O'Brien medical we don't want a medical cannabis patient I would like to share a little bit about the journey that I am about to take with my partner Jason Wilcox as we travel coast-to-coast on some of you know we've been in Ontario for the month of June visiting family and prior to my leaving to come to British sorry to come to Ontario I had recently been put on morphine due to my hepatitis I had come off of all of pharmaceuticals a couple of years ago with cannabis oil and recently my liver acted up and I was first off can of oil my body couldn't process on high doses of oil anymore so I was forced back onto pharmaceuticals unfortunately that pharmaceutical was morphine because it's the only drug that does it it bypasses the liver I was in the hospital for a short stint anyways the long the short of it is I was put back on morphine and for anybody that's been a patient a cannabis patient and suffered withdrawals and done that to be put back on it was horrendous to say the least so that basically didn't allow me to take the journey back to British Columbia with Jason as some of you know Jay and Daniel made the trip out from BC on to Ontario in the car when I we all decided to make this trip I went to my doctor you know we talked about you know my you know I didn't want to be on the morphine forever but you know it was this was a situation that I was placed in anyways my doctor at that point decided that he wanted to taper me back off the morphine because my liver was doing better in his eyes I guess I'm not sure but unfortunately I still have a lot of chronic pain to deal with and he didn't want to deal with my chronic pain he only wanted to deal with the symptoms of my liver I'm assuming so he forced a taper on me and he also forced a taper on me when I was supposed to be on a vacation with my family so this has not really been the best vacation because the entire time I've been I've been withdrawals since the day an hour I got on the plane you know doctors play God in your life you know and for all that you know the Rona Ambrose's of the world think there's no value to marijuana well you know what I didn't feel very valued in my doctor's office when you decided to do a morphine tamper when it was supposed to be on vacation you know that's not our medical system you know so anyways the long and the short of it is I wanted to get off of the opiates anyway I didn't want to go back on them I just didn't have any other cannabis options I'd run out of oils um like I said I couldn't take them because my body couldn't process coconut oil anymore grapeseed oil or any oil um so I really was out of options and I don't know like a miracle of God Jason I got in some RSO and so thank God he shared one of the syringes with me last week and it was like a miracle you know it was relief came it was it was truly felt miraculous you know I wasn't run into the bathroom I wasn't not just I wasn't sick you know it alleviated the withdrawal symptoms the pain of withdrawal is so much a soul that I said to him if I can get my hands in this oil Jason not only do I feel that I can talk through withdrawals I truly believe in my heart I can make this trip home with you so I'm supposed to be on a plane tomorrow on a son winged flight and I've given up my flight I don't get my money back I believe in this oil so much that I gave up my $300 flight for no good reason other than to say you know what I believe this oil will get me off of morphine and it will get me home so you know what Rona Ambrose for this moment there's no there's no medical value you're insane you're insane woman you know any doctor that would send you home for four weeks on a taper first of all you're you how the hell is that health care you know that there's no caring in that you know I've suffered my family suffered it's been a heck of a month but anyways that oil last week I got my hands on this oil and I also did a tea with it and it was like life-changing and you know it brought me back to how I did my withdrawals the first time around and I did my withdrawals with our so this time is different because I'm not only doing withdrawals I'm taking a trip across the country so I'm taking you know probably the worst times of my life and extending it because I have serious back pain but I truly believe it's possible with this oil so I was able immuno and this stuff is very expensive and it shouldn't be this stuff should be the same damn price as my opiates you know it shouldn't cost hundreds of dollars for me to be in like no pain you know this is crazy this is hundreds of dollars and then go to the pharmaceutical I go up to shoppers Drug Mart and it only cost me twenty six dollars so there's like thirty six dollars for like a hundred morphine how can I even be right you know what I mean how can that even be right how can it cost so little for something that's killing me and so much for something that's saving me you know this is all on purpose man so you know this prohibition this reefer madness it has to end it has to end there you know they did I believe I firmly believe that if this were in the hands of every detox every withdrawal management Center and again I was an addictions counselor before I became sick I firmly believe it as a worker if I had this in my hands and I wasn't in detox nobody would suffer again no heroin or opiate addict would ever suffer again the pains of withdrawal would be a thing of the past they're running to the bathroom and it just taking over your life that would be a thing of the past and I don't think any human I should have to suffer that's my thing right I don't think suffering especially when we have access to medicine that allows us not to suffer and for me this has allowed me not to suffer so um today is my last day of I watch the last last night was my last morphine and today thank God is my first day of freedom so we're gonna open this up I have a day one and a night one from the natural remedy don't CA they're amazing people they have they're the only place that I've been able to locate um actually like high CBD and high THC the last time I did this I got a one oil it was a one purpose one thing did one you know and it didn't do everything there's no one thing for all people these guys are amazing they have it so much so that they have different oils for different issues like different strains for different pains like Jayla says and it only makes sense right it only makes sense to me so I have a high CBD one for the day which is going to allow me to stay in the car with Jay and get home but it's gonna keep my inflammation down my pain down not only does it do that the owners of the company explain to me what it does for your brain when you're in withdrawal isn't anybody that knows the withdrawals you are in a state of crisis your brain is in a state of crisis it doesn't matter what you do it is so stressed out and you're frustrated just not being there all the things that you don't want to be this oil here this one the CBD oil actually helps swelling almost that stress of the brain on swelling but it's stress it actually alleviates the stress of the brain CBD is an amazing an amazing medicine you know so this will not only you know assist the inflammation in my body and my back my hips but I'll also keep the inflammation in my brain which is where all those crazy withdrawals are happening it's gonna keep that at a calming state - and for anybody that's been wearing that right now you know that there's nothing common about withdrawals so anything that can keep the shakes and all that [ __ ] down at bay I mean it's it's this is a miracle this is a miracle I am an addictions counselor if I could have given this to one of my patients just one client you know what I mean they didn't have to suffer I mean it's amazing what we could do no addict needs suffer everich and if they don't want to you know I don't think that withdrawals anybody should ever have to suffer again so we are going to making this trip with this like I said the inflammation one and then for anybody that knows me knows I also suffer terribly with insomnia so I have this crazy THC one that's for nighttime so it's a 75% THC and 5% CBD I don't understand the science enough but I do know that the THC one kales me and it's amazing for pain and the CBD one I haven't tried so I'm pretty excited to see really how I'm gonna feel because really the only one I've ever had was like this the standard high THC oils right this is a whole new world for me and I'm really excited to see how I'm gonna be feeling physically and mentally because your mental your mental picture is a big part of who you are in and your day right so we're getting ready for this trip it's pretty exciting sorry about all the tears on its you know it is what it is and as much as I hate where I'm at I'm actually glad to be here because I didn't want to go back on morphine and without having access to these kind of oils my only other option was being forced back on coconut oil and they can't consume it so I'd run out of options and thank God for the natural remedy because they've given me options that I didn't think I had any more and this is this is a blessing right a huge blessing because I didn't want to be back home like a normal pizza anyway so anyways enough of that but boring stuff let's move on to the happy good stuff we are getting ready for this awesome trip I don't open up the tri-fold cuz these are for people's dispensaries and there lounges we're all set up Kelly Kay from the West Coast got us all ready out we got trifles here we got stickers I'm not going to put everything out but I would like to pull it out some of these t-shirts because they're pretty awesome I don't even

PMS and hopefully we can stop sesh educate and share information and you know the more cannabis the more of us get together the better we need we need power numbers at this point folks August is right around the corner and the more or less they get together the better they're really can't be enough of us at this point we need a can army so if we're passing by your town let us know hit us up we'd

eight industry having a great time once he Gateway Scotty we love Vancouver love this show love cannabis in Canada we're having a good time just hanging out and thrown out packs to everyone Cheers all right welcome ice Canada I am going through and I just sent out a bunch of invites I just learned this um my tech very kind of not only in I couldn't figure out how to how to invite people if you don't want to be invited I'm pretty sure there's an option to to not be invited to participate if you chose this more of a private you know yeah we're proud of doing that you have a public viewing but it's interesting to do this private one because you can actually literally invite here but that works there anyway uh wall I'll break I didn't get to it really get a chance now they're all scrapping this other straggling pond this is the lowest yielding flat out of all of them and we've all had a pot sorry wrong like this it doesn't matter you know who you are if you're growing from seed anyway it's you yet one subclass are just lowly guilders because their third genotype was weak to begin with no different some will turn hermaphrodite if they were properly stabilized to be away so will not be said this is certainly not a strength that I want to grow twice I might smoke them they still I don't know but want to see it has the books a little small tight popcorn that's like up here this is when this is dry this is maybe a wonder I'm not at best and you know maybe it wasn't one one or two long hair so it's it's not you're looking at a total of maybe [ __ ] maybe only announced on that off the plan in total you know by the time you remember it's 50% of experienced rink so it takes you know what weight by weight conversion that being said I don't know why I did that it's the same age just the same as the other ones and they all yield in much bigger but this is just a low yielding strain that being said it also might be one of the most potent strains I've ever smoked I don't know that's what I love about new strains that I have before so but once again if you're if you're going to be drying them and hanging them there's no need for the extra water in the leaves so you're just kind of killing your time you want some time just get rid of the get rid of the families just pick them off and and then hang your plants and of course what that'll be as long as there's nothing as long as if they're not they shouldn't be swinging around or moving or banging enough and your trichomes aren't going to get all knocked off or Nothing onto the floor now if you want you some people in their tent if they're gonna hang your plants that are tender then we'll put Polly basically a plastic cup not really called the plastic film they'll put that down to catch any trichomes that during the drying process some will naturally fall to the ground and they'll catch those for the purpose of making hash later or screening it later and we've taught that it's no different than scoping your trichomes all like all these pipes have been scope of course before we started picking or doing any of this I said the only ones that I want to keep going is that ATF I believe that it has more time left in it so not much more time but still has more time so again picking off the water is a long doing right now is to continue to just go on a little bit and water is some vegetarian pizza I'm proud of myself I'm now too much vegetarian and I don't let me sound funny to some people like [ __ ] souls no - seriously - my other car boyfriends in my the beer or drink beer and [ __ ] bar are working man I get it like if I go out and hunt with you I'd be down probably for eating not me but when it comes to eating after it some of the [ __ ] that I see into it this as a social justice activist you need to ask yourself some if you see that common sense logic and reason you know always have to meet and you try to look for that and then you think yourself ok there's all these people we're already overpopulated so then a lot of artists like that one we need are overpopulated our land is already overpopulated by human feces and by human emissions so then there's our cars there's all the [ __ ] that we're dealing with that in our construction and our warehouses and our other destructive behavior but then we got all these cows and we forget that there are also producing carbon emissions now that's the one thing I never thought about some people ask me like why would you stop eating meat I said for one reason is because there's going to be a hole in the ozone layer and if there is we're all dead and we're gonna burn and I don't want to I don't want that for my kids and some people are going to say well you know they sprayed the vegetables they crop dust and then you know I get it I get where everybody's going it was more about just my own choice it looking at that and saying you know if we're making just as much emissions only because of population and choice of food but we don't actually need me to live you know that we can actually live on on on regular plant-based proteins then it made a choice for me to not be part of the problem any longer what until they find a solution you know until I know what that solution is you know but I go it's a I'm gonna become some beginning and and destroy all my freaking food no I mean [ __ ] Jim Vicki see me a few times especially after a couple drinks it's extremely hard not to just want to order a rack of ribs you know it's just that's just mean I've always been that way but I am proud to say that when you if you're gonna try something at least do the persons around you that are doing it give them the honor and the respect of giving it an honest try and that's what I wanted to do would be being a vegetarian what I learned was that my blood pressure came down because I was on my mind a heart was going at over a hundred beats a minute and if I have had a few heart attacks before because of treatments I have to take the standpipe but anyway the well sort of my blood pressure came down from get from doing over 100 beats a minute down to what was reasonable which was the DA meats or or even better under slightly beat some people say well I Slover a blood pressure you don't want that it's late you know that's actually what I want I prefer to know that I'm in the 70 to 80 range 100 to 200 10 range which is like I would I would see the doctor and I would tell them go I didn't take it it's gonna be 110 they wouldn't believe me because that's normally and exercising full-blown exercise I hear you're a full load on the treadmill your gear your heart rank it up to 130 but that's it it's not getting gold like mine up to a hundred and fifty-five where the machine actually turns off and says your heart you know it's a concern that the Machine actually tells you if you're hooked up to them these new ones they have limits that the only match part I can over 55 or 65 but my heart hit a certain living told me beep-beep stop you gotta you gotta slow down and I guess your heart will explode at a certain level and if your training I'm taking that so serious is something to think about yeah is there any questions at all are there any questions at all because now we've got our private show going and we've got our own viewing in our own track it's only my friends it's only the people that I had known I trust that are in this room and they can talk cannabis we can talk whatever we talk dad's a most important thing we can talk about the stuff that normally we don't do I have to jump off soon I want to give at least a half hour and try this new thing out it's a new feature that Facebook has I didn't know how to use it so it's my first time just kind of playing with it unfortunately this is the end of a very long show the hottest part is some really big heavy yielding plants and people are able to see that and if you wonder what I'm doing now I'm simply getting rid of one or weight that I don't feel any you know it's just something that dries a little faster it's is having any uh any potential mold or anything else develop you know if you allow the levels needs to sit over top you know you better have the right air circulation in your room which I'm really not worried about this is just more about timing if you if you've harvested enough times you'll know it was leaves you want to keep in which ones you don't when it comes to making mole hash and you know whatever there's gonna be trim that I want to keep and then there's gonna be stuff that I don't in this case for this particular plant it's actually low yield er that I'm probably gonna oil this was just straight oil take it and once it's done if we might I think we're gonna try will I've always wanted to try the I've got the butane here and I know it's bad but I've got a friend down the street that's got a nice closed-loop system in his house and I think I can go stick this plant into his pipe and once I freeze it it should stay frozen because it's only a block away and we run it through that pipe and we'll hollow fresh frozen extraction and that I hadn't done before and apparently it's different you know we do you really pull the turf that way I don't know I'm not again I I left doing blasting and stuff so you asked Negro questions I can probably help you with growing I can't help you with a lot of others problem solving you know if you ask me about a fungus doing due to the fact that there's over a hundred thousand different funguses in the world why would I even attempt to diagnose that fungus instead just peroxide got shake and kill it it's that simple you can go buy peroxide in high concentrations at your hydroponics store and they'll tell you to go ahead and run it through a certain dilation to sterilize your soil and kill any microbes or anything living in there now if you're an organic grower it's like no because for me I rely on all those living microbes that are in there right now and this was all or anything wrong with many one you know there's live microbes living in here I don't want to kill them but if there was some fungus growing on top of my my soil I wouldn't be concerned and the only way that I thought for sure to kill a fungus is to go ahead with peroxide so that's the solution in that particular band-aid situation the other thing is to make sure you find out what was the source of of that fungus when I say is so easy to get rid of this is true I don't no just because I can't see that one black shirt with gold chains I know it's not you what you mean I'm sorry James I guess yesterday and one wearing my change today and for our friends on Facebook it's good to see they've got a few more people on here I like this private time I like this guys because we're able to actually be in here and there's not necessarily it's different because I don't know if this is still streaming to the regular channels is still streaming to the regular channel as well or is it just went into private I like this [Music] actually I think it's a neat thing to do because it makes it more personable and I'd like to be able to invite people I'm trying to learn this and most importantly people just need to understand that if you look up campus in Canada you'll see that the incorporation is owned by myself Jason Wilcox which is I keep saying this and it sounds funny because I had to I have to look you a lot to to keep the company and to to keep on those that are more wealthy away from my my own stuff my intellectual property what they do is they take the property and then they remind you a whole but you're the founder and it's like well thanks I'm the founder but you're the owner so the owner makes the money the founder is just the founder so it sucks that there's people out there taking each other's intellectual property and that's just the world we live in I've learned that that's part of business and I'm glad for those that have come to join the show that we can talk about that there's a lot of people out there oh people Barry Sean so he's not some reliable source I'm known buried way back in the days when I see the atmosphere please long before I did the coalition and long before today anything else Barry and I did a lot of advocacy work within the city of Oxford mostly this time off addiction to be quite frank we knew cannabis would help but we knew there is no way they don't don't hate appreciated [ __ ] let's sit there a [ __ ] hate [ __ ] boot your ass off this channel no in all seriousness yeah no I know and I at the same time I usually don't wear I usually don't wear in garden or or element level I was at a friend's Whitney and with a couple people that I'd like to borrow logs over so I put my and that's kind of how I got caught in this situation Kollek Alexander Morrison holy [ __ ] is awesome so look [ __ ] you better call me nose seriously call me man we got a we got a few over doing here I got it Carlo SS goes well we're gonna plot a crazy stuff I sent out the invites guys because this is now a private chat I guess I'm able to do this I'm not sure how this works on my shirt like it's a hundred percent private hey kiera here we'll just a long long - this is Brandon yeah because I sent you an invite but [ __ ] yo haters are gonna hate online is that normally we don't know we don't really wear our jewelry oh let's not see in this day and age it's not really you know was my ego no joke call 20 like our jewelleries come back round like 90s like circa 1990 music sir commander like a Snuggies I'm gonna say that we were the people we are with were much much younger than us and they chose to wear a lot of gold someone might call Alexandra Morrison it makes her wear a lot of gold but no in all seriousness just um that's the only reason you see me with any more than my my usual ring on but no you know what it is what it is and people can hate if they want to hate I really don't care it's a nice what it is I have friends are millionaires and I don't hate on now I'm happy for them and I've got friends that are extremely poor and I wish I could see them do better I see them trying to find that door to to happiness to do to aspect you area where they don't have to fear police yeah I don't want on YouTube but it's it's almost funny just to let it keep rolling at this point you should I play bigger though we're not having vegan pizza you [ __ ] you do all your vegan pizza that I mean something else they can't see you let me go boys you look beautiful as always now you do so whatever but anyway I wanna see how does it help you Jason back to see me back to see me DVD sure let's go to get sent out anyway we got a little bit here of the herbal passion CBD and this is the stuff that I was doing that they're testing with not showing you guys very heavy molecule something that very poor very proud like you're gonna see in here a lot more giving this even the smell and yet when you do it but you can see this is a very heavy molecule you'd be surprised that there's yeah you'd be surprised at the way that's here there's almost half ounce there and you wouldn't ever believe that you know if people you wouldn't believe it it's a very heavy molecule but this CBD will be able to keep one person going for again if I we haven't figured out is the intellectual property or should we actually do shows and teach people how to make their own city cops because that is it's so important that you're not wasted that you not undercut yourself either and in its we thought a lot about that about how best to do it and and realistically I mean if you go on studies on the air now anecdotal research will point always that there's only uh that there's only um sort of an angle that I'm losing my mind and a long show there's no you're trying to get off this book control alright seriously also in this in CPD crystalline I wanted to talk about the food great my friends if you take something like this and I've done this it's on Instagram it's on me it's on my Facebook page and you can check that out if you want you'll see where I put some in water and then let you guys see for yourselves that nothing falls through because it's 99.9% pure so there's nothing falling down to the bottom of the glass most importantly when I zoomed in with my camera I got nest 9 so it's got a nice little camera on it I can zoom in and show you guys to crystals and you can see all the CBD crystalline and that there was no byproducts or anything that shouldn't either it all looked like a bunch of little snow floating in water and that's this stuff so at the end of the day what I wanted to talk about was obviously about the getting real crystalline so check out with the herbal passion I believe it's Dodge net Nikki very herbal posh about that I'm pretty sure sorry no I'm just I'm going to ask you to pick if you do that's right or is it I was sure if we wanted I can go either way [Music] no I don't know I can't seem to get it up but our verbal question yeah okay I've done it yeah okay so I'm here will pass you're done oh gee I'm DMX 4:20 I totally agree on I like toxin CVD but into my daily so you went you know what I totally agree I'm not been on a lie no smoking on a flower you know well I'm not feeling well I will definitely Jason can attest to this proud son I could recruit us an amazing CBD dogs and you know see those dogs can take me from like plus ten to the runner for five really quick CP it's amazing when they're flower Iceland extracts whatever way you find in manage anxiety and if you're you know dealing with health issues most of us are dealing with anxiety you know health issues give you anxiety on and some people with my sister just deals with anxiety and she's doing with all that she's taking CV of all as a standalone product but she's a really loving so I totally agree wonderful CBD for anxiety is a wonderful product that's a great point you know we've talked a lot about health and health care and you know ailments pain this and that you know sometimes we don't focus enough on Nietzsche Cerner's and maternal health and you're absolutely right CVD is a wonderful thing for loops or anxiety depression it's a brilliant even and you know what they're finding out now through research that CBE is a neural protectant which means it actually protects our brain so like you know if you have an if a brain injury Parkinson's on alternate if you have been a brain disorder of n tight I would be taking CPP every day in fact I think we should take CP every day just because it's a little protected and it's actually our brains that's just working for the day at the same time with CBD we always suggest people not just CBD but th see the full entourage all hundred plus vital contaminants I believe we have an endogenous system for a reason and I believe it needs to be fed and feeding it however you do it is the best thing you can take like right now I chopped this throw it in the blender get my fiber get my omega-3 six and nine and get all my final cut and cannabinoids without getting high welcome it's mine you're curious can Minister it's your first time checking out the show there's a first time trigger the show welcomed so much of the show no no no this is joy and you've got some stuff from it and you know what hopefully we will see you back playing it yeah we've been on for a couple hours here so we're like at the end of a thing we'd almost do better to play pretty boring stuff than to keep just battling but honestly we wanted to do i to just stop in and we're still testing again for me i'm doing some testing so figure out what i have to apply has been going to this year and and at the same time to let people know that we're getting ready I mean we got we got four 22 start coming up but most important is this is this documentary it's good when you got three hours of John Cochran talking about this legal case because you've got you got so much history and so much information that I almost want to release the comma right Connor Chronicles I've talked about this and I think I might even do this separate from you know they what in essence is is the polish and documentary so it's something that I've definitely thought about this John Conroy story is quite the quick story of social justice but today's show is about the plants you guys have seen the various plants this is the lowest yielding these are the products that we actually use what is a good soil to use with many one when we get off I would always go on the pro mix or more sunshine mix any of the with the the promoted the one thing to remember and this is very very important please listen to what I'm saying about this part I love green plant a new trance but I'll always have the freedom to speak my mind about different products now I believe many one burning spot so there's two things to remember that if you're going to use chromates or sunshine mix like I'm suggesting understand they're preloaded with micronutrients and macronutrients that will last for the first two weeks so there's no need to add many one to your plant or you might burn in Friday roots and show your pot and then wonder what you did well and it wasn't anything you did wrong it was just that the things where I explained properly that's the biggest thing biggest mistake grower to make and and often it doesn't kill the plant it just burns the leaves but it makes the plants look ugly and it's the biggest mistake people make is remembering when you first transpired or when you first got transplant of a sore then you don't need to feed again you've got two weeks basically of food there and you can wait until the plants live the children that need food or into the pure comfortable with the food level but that's important and and then now on the issue of many one burning hot I have all aluminum ice sink right now but anyone burning hard the reason I say burning hot remember it's a one part organic so you don't have to worry about three parts you don't worry about all this measuring and all those chops and also they crop it's just one jug but that one jug can make or break a crop it's organic it's gonna make you killer terpenes even this goes killer terpenes it's nice thick sticky bugs I mean they're small but they're they're tight but anyway it's a it's a one part organic that work old strings great you know the way the migrating say I use the exam spoon every one of those strings and they all produce as they did my most important thing what they want is when input is hot you're not fleet is thi you gotta bring you up to six one six two whatever you're comfortable with I'm comfortable with six six one or six to buy anything other than that know if it's burning even harder than that which it will right out at the model just test it that'll probably burn in hydroponics range and and the problem with burning in the hydroponics writing decide you can't eat as many one in height opponents because it's it's organic and it'll plug up the emitters so you can't use it that way so it's important to understand i when i'm talking about burning hot it's solely about understanding they're going to need in or left you get organic pH are up credit your choice you can use a page up like any sort it's just it speaks your own idea up anyone just because I've got the best control the way we're supposed to get over the island are coming the island and we're supposed to go over there and foaming we're just waiting for a coffin on a couple things I'm not sure who's still watching and this thing's completely changed now that it's went to UM it's why I got all who's watching the news not watching that's that's what makes half are difficult but for for our friends on YouTube it's it's great I tried something new on Facebook so it's just kind of screwed look here right now I can't tell who's there who's not there but it's good to have them on it's at the end of a very long show and once they show that I'm liking I'm probably deleting because these shows want to say that you it's good it's more doing a live harvesting of any sort whether it's crappy little ones like this or like the ones we started with and at the beginning of the show that were the size of my coffee can you know when you're able to but when you're able to get a nice big thick but again of your plants so yeah I think about size plants I ain't healed this is a good example of something that I would not I would not do again however I'm so interested in smoking units are often some of the ones here just like Yammer which is a high-yield no more mass quantity they want to do it but yeah I got a lot of people in the chat without a lot of people talking you just ran into the oven but yeah that's all right what we'll probably do with this one here is that this one will get cut I'm just gonna finish picking off you know whatever families I can get kinda thrown into the freezer and and and basically once frozen when as fresh frozen extraction just to see what the difference is it'll be carboxylate one side butane you know in the system once that buting's or stuck back Oh dong goo Shane's gone it's going to be at that point yeah it's going to maintain the the turkeys I'm hoping but I haven't done it before so if there's any comments everybody has on fresh frozen please let me know if you have any suggestions but that's something that's definitely I haven't tried it understood but this makes you a good experimental plant to try it with I can see a plant good music there's some reason have no trace and after honestly 67 days these it should be these days undone so yeah it's kind of an interesting day and other people hope that some people might be happy with this for this or yield if you have five plants with it with this kind of yield and squeeze it together and understand it as I put it then you can look at a sort of like this because you can see how much blood you gosh yeah and it's gonna be about a half ounce three quarters of an ounce versus we also many other ones I had maybe an ounce again because they're so good buzzer so tight I think they're gonna be a little bit heavier but that's a big important thing I definitely gave a heaven at God 100% gaming you're right bubble hash is what I was thinking about but then I was thinking about the fresh frozen haven't done I haven't had syrup from fresh frozen and then tried died which is best basically a form of I present so at that point if you want to make diamonds that's supposed to be the best syrup to use to start to make diamonds so that's what I want to see if I can do and I figure it's it's nothing to waste the planet on Rd if that's going to help me make better diamonds faster then what anything else we do and that's what I'm trying to experiment already know I'm trying to catch up with the culture the culture is actually gardening got a little bit ahead of me I am with respect to extractions but with everything else you know I can pretty much like a pretty much to hold my own in conversation and and in practice but when it comes to extractions I'm still learning so I'm definitely open to any comment I'm watching bubble hash is one thing but I honestly think this planet I'm just going to trim off whatever I see that doesn't really have much much of anything trichomes and the rest of it I'm just going to stick in my freezer and until it can get lasted in a closed-loop system and and that's what I'm thinking further in there with the syrup from that I was gonna stick in a mason jar and put the lid on it and let it do its thing and see what happens based on what I've been taught and seen that but if I'm on the right track I would love somebody say Jason you're on the right track or no don't waste your time you're gonna you're gonna you're wasting it - bubble - I like that Kyle how's that working you freeze it you freeze it in the freezer like this here how long it taking this you've already been to my 10 using my 10 collar on this is gonna be frozen once it's okay and these lilies are picked off it's going to be stuck in the freezer frozen and then it's going to be blasted and with the syrup rather than letting it go into the oven to become shatter I want the syrup to go into a mason jar and be sealed tight and start to make diamonds my understanding is that's the process to making live resin and then diamonds in the most optimal way and I don't know where the decarboxylation happens because butanes frozen it's gonna be coming out of my freezer frozen it's going into the freezer fresh so it doesn't have time to decarboxylate at all if this doesn't dry so I don't know at what point in decarboxylase except for maybe when you got it I don't know I'm scientifically talking here I guess that's too old-school making bubble - way too easy I could do that I've actually got mark gave me a bunch of bytes years ago and I'm sitting in my back there and I could certainly make an Indian bubble higher so it wouldn't be a problem and it's so sticky I know we make a really good wash but I'm more interested in advancing my skills with with extractions so you know a friend of mine I get said down the street has an actual closed-loop system so I can get this stuff run Walt's frozen and with that syrup put that into a mason jar and seal it and allow it to do its thing and burping it occasionally you know we are at two hours of 47 minutes is lady freaking marathons total today and he's been a lot of use I also switched it over to the private thing two people have signed on in checked out game right thank you I want to see how that works so that as we program our shows we're going to now know how to better reach out to our audience I'm just waiting on a final help with streamlining streamlining so that everybody on Twitter everybody on a guy 8,000 contacts on Lincoln they're going to be doing my streams now so expect to see us war on Lincoln expect to see us more Instagram and at the same time here oh right now we're just we got somebody building us the script in the in in the program that's possible to funnel all these together so that when we make one policy that was to all the networks if we want it to and that's optimal so I hope everybody else has a wonderful wonderful day my wife and I are gonna shower on some food geez already looking at me like why the hell you got all this I still gotta go I say go hang plants and sick this in the freezer I guess is anybody else doing anything else able to say no problem Anthony thank you for supporting Canosa Canada honestly we always learn from each other I can tell you now there's people that are making posts on YouTube that I'm learning self and I'm also seeing stuff that I learned on Facebook and we learned together there's no one person you know and that's why that's what makes this show valuable my wife doesn't understand why get up and do it and the only reason I get up and do it is because when people say thank you because you learned something they're not made it all worth it yes that's exactly what made it all worth it you know my ROI is never money but it's definitely all about sharing that information ensuring that wealth and and that wealth is your health and remember that there's nothing more nothing more important than your health and then nothing more wealthy than your health and once you understand that you'll protect it cannabis protects it like a like wearing armor I think it's like you're wearing a shield we're done with it nothing nothing to protect you - you got cannabinoid all through you you know I just wish that the government can it wasn't restricting like for instance here in our country though I can grow weed and I can make oils that are extremely potent you know I can make you know how friends make 99 percent distillate we're still not allowed to sell it they're licensed producers they dull there's 90 corporations in this country none of them are allowed to selling anything stronger than ten milligrams of THC in a unit so I don't have a change to blow here what city this was a unit that I learned from them they wouldn't be allowed to have or depend on about for 30 milligrams OCD which is one dose for me was this is 99.9 I've read 99.5% I'm a 26 percent Sunni everybody does especially the Jason I researched a lot and so you know the average is with the average is why don't the cockroaches I usually start I do 25 to 30 milligrams three times a day and that keeps me off that's what I need and CBD I don't know what anybody else needs so I'm saying you know selling for 50 or 30 milligram bottles I would have to consume three of those a day my liver and my kidneys could withstand that good after watching that video you know I mean my liver disease is still here why just function better because I diet I'm a vegan or super [ __ ] the neurotic you know that about everything that consume now but if I went back to a normal person's diet I'd be hospitalized probably pretty quick collaborate and consuming three bottles of oil a day I assume who would about music pretty quick Wow is terribly when I think about that like you know I can't imagine being stuck on both sides you're never gonna go nope it is what it is I want to thank everybody does not dry out that today and I don't know how the Facebook thing's working but we're dying off slowly and that's to be expected but at the end of a show you can see there's a lot of leaves here for a reason is because we we've harvested a lot you know some nice purple ones and stuff and he never we talked about the autumn o'clock we've talked everything that that is canopy knees that is important today anyway hopefully everybody goes home with a little more our dictionary because the more we share that together the more we'll learn together and we'll look better the planet together failure to do so will allow all these aristocrats and all these the these real sharks these little gangsters if you have it that's why I see them anyway when you put a price tag on personal cancer then your debts are basically your not being your own right you know in the way that you're approaching making your money your ethical boundaries are our normal voice where those guys out there that working in the hundred I might have ten times the ethics that so many business sharks have coming in and say there's 90 companies or sort of over 100 companies now and under those hundred companies I'm hoping that the ones that are smaller they start to recognize how important a conduit to the community is and how important it is that you have somebody that can just pop up and get your information out there but at the same time make sure that their company is doing what was necessary for most importantly their medical patients first you know and to each their own different activists have different I mean there there's a lot of recreational activists and employed knowledge they've already they've already done their thing and you know they've been picked up and dropped down you know some are still working to who with big corporations again we medical patients are the ones that bought so we'll watch you're talking about medical so they want us coming it's quiet quiet that's why there's no compassion no she was just dispensaries and everybody's treated same and that's wrong I believe medical patients have to be treated different and if we don't if we don't do this together and we have to tell them but enough is enough you know anymore they tried during my third there's a province in our country one province yeah that word I wall - but cubics always been screwy they have their own medical system the last two different provinces that are that are just sites that in the cannabis Act so federal federal regulations that somehow you know a province can emit and only one province under the entire country emits and except for Quebec that's a problem you know I think that's something we have to look at and we have to look at what is a long term goal with this land or tenancy act and all the people also that they're doing there's people doing so all across this country from Clean Air Act's - no smoking in your in your building acts - you can be evicted if you grow a plant act that I don't know if they're constitutionally sound and I don't know if they're if they're necessarily evil I just know that they're there being imposed on people and maybe that's something that's better Sara same for another day but I'm gonna be jumping off here it's been a long straw I've had a good stability test and and that's really what matters to me for this show thank you carried away that tune game and the last one that we need to cut is this one here get into the freezer yeah see there it's just you know again you get these little ones out of the tent it's where I talk to they talk to I talk to you well what they want to grow in if that's the lowest yielding one you know out of the tent and that's just one planet and you can put well again what they're saying you killing people for it there but if you're medically you can put 25 in there so really these size pots geo pods you're gonna fit about 11 of them in there so if you want to grow appliance that baby Rove 11 up a minute in a five by five foot 10 and and and again it's not necessarily the number of clients that's gonna determine your yield it's also your the amount weight that you use and you have fun control factors that are a part of it anyway for everybody that came and joined out for the invite thank you and that was a test have a great weekend smoke them if you got a gun I know we're still around even though it's like 426 is like oh [ __ ] yeah anyway yeah happy hour 420 and it's Dillion 420 but what else is new with Karen lately would be gainfully however it is it is and it um come forward we got 420 coming up and and I think that's kind of kind of the next big event aside from these these these events that we're starting to see pop up at these clubs and there isn't they're good craft cannabis of events and other ones are not yeah that really it really does comes down to to that when I look at the island what's going on on the on Vancouver Island versus what's going on in Vancouver it's crazy the Vancouver Island's really late in ain't I born all right now and yeah well they're coming together as an island Iceman and United and if we can do that in every problems once again we can really make change but people are you ready for that but you need to be willing to plant your beat put your face in front of a camera and and ensure that information I mean you have to you have to literally do what I'm doing here I'm more talking about just in the general context of sharing the information make it table talk make it so that when you're at the table none of what you make it a point of educating someone new to the laws in this country and the global legalization efforts going on around the world that and it's being done in a compact in a fashion that monopolizing people and when you monopolize people it's one step from enslaving them well I know it's Jason Wilcox and thank you all for tuning in and with a to the next show", "O541oNDhIg8": "[Music] welcome to weed entertainment and we run for the right strains and today we're going to talk about one that i ran for but i didn't really have to because it's still in the store right now this flower this beautiful bud is something called z-runts and it's from seven leaves and we love the run strains you know what's funny i didn't know anything about runs i just was picking them as a blind pick and uh the first one i got was something called white runts from cookies and it really didn't do anything to me so i didn't get it so the next time i went down i got it at the doctor green thumbs next time i was down there uh they had cannot take runs and the bud tenders said no no no it's not the white ranch that's the good one try this one this one's the best one and i tried the can of tea crunch and it knocked my socks off i think that's the heaviest strongest flower that i've tried during legal marijuana that's a big statement right so we like to try the run strains but if i'm guessing i would say that it's probably a 50 50 split between good flowers and just average flowers but the good ones have something special disc discombobulation and what i mean by that is let's say you're in college and you try pot for the first time you're just completely discombobulated right you don't know anything and the runts some of the strains can do it even to a seasoned pro like myself and that's something so today we're gonna check out the z-wrench by seven leaves and i've got two scoops already in my vapor cup straw we're gonna add the third you know i'm really an old timer i am an expert on weed and other things too i am a professional person i live a very good life and we're looking for the best so let's check out z runs we're going to stick this down into the vapor cup see it went off we're going to stick it back on but this thing takes about a minute and a half to get going i like it to go a little bit longer at first when the cup is hot to the touch you're going to know it's really ready that's where it's optimal and so in about a minute and a half you're gonna see it's gonna get the terpenes the water vapor uh and the cannabinoids and it all condenses right on the straw and then we're gonna take 10 12 draws and enjoy this so z runs comes in this jar and this flower has 23 percent thc and as i said it's from seven leaves and run streams now are very notable so when they hit the stores especially if it's a good one if you don't run down there right away you can't even get it at all and it's crazy as someone can find flowers that have 22 23 24 why are these flowers so discombobulating nobody really knows just comes down you got the right seed you have the right cultivator and you've got to do this in the right way i'm telling you give the same plant they're brothers clones to two cultivators and you can't even imagine the difference you can even look at london pound cake number 75 versus london pound cake number 53. these are cookie strains one is a knockout punch and one is it has focus and is uh you can be very mobile and they came from the same plant it's crazy at least that's what they say you never really know what's going on with these weedy lore stories i hate to perpetrate lies i always try and make wheat entertainment 100 facts but bay cookies put out two flowers one was london pound cake 53 one was number 75 and i don't think these people would lie why would you do that if it's a different plant number you call it that right people can like two it's like a cousin one tall is one short right they're just cousins but they're different anyway today we're going to check out the z runs and you can see that's all the time it takes for a vapor cup to work you could see the vapor right on the glass straw so we're going to check it out z runs by seven leaves at a vapor cup at 330 degrees so that's what happens i call that the wolf and i try not to do it but this is a heavy gassy flower what i call the pungent pow or an og and it's pungent that's what i say you know it may be different if you smoke but with vapor cup this is a pungent flower it doesn't really even taste like weed but the ogs they mellow out and some of them can go to super sweet it's crazy as they start out pungent and they can go to sweet this one actually doesn't go to sweet it just mellows so this was a smooth enjoyable vape it was medium strong it gave me a hazy head high it had a little bit of focus but like the run strains i don't think any of the run strains are really known for focus but we like vaping them and we like trying them so what did i think of z runs by seven leaves i'm giving this flower an 865 i would say to me it was less strong less discombobulating and then other run strains but 865 means it's a good flower so if you like runs this may be a good one maybe it's a little less discombobulating a little bit more mellow and maybe it's a good flower for you and i got this flower at the dr green thumbs but it's around right now so if you want to get it run on down there i'm the doctor you want to get a vapor cup and i'm telling you especially for your old timers for all you people that are using glass for 20 years and you realize oh my god i've been smoking for 20 30 years it's gonna catch up with you right it's one of the reasons i switched and i'm telling you vapor cup is awesome sauce it's even better than that it's the best device i've ever used if you gave me a bong or gave me a vape up i'm picking this thing every day this is not a any baloney going on here if you're watching my reviews and you're looking at my picks and you've followed me for a long time you'll know that i'm in the know 100 in the know and we're looking for the best and i love vapor cup and you can see it at vaporcup.com if you're looking for my favorite streams they're on wheat entertainment.com that site will get updated to the new hundred strange list that we just did and i'm telling you try and find those strains you're going to see vapor plus those strains will stone you to the bone with just a little bit of flour and that's the game wheat is expensive don't spend up all

Alaska according to the legend it was originally in northern california sativa crossed with a russian ruderal but sometime in the late 70s it was crossed with Afghani genetics to make it a little more Hardy ATF usually presents itself large beautifully frosted buds with incredibly strong odors of pine lemon menthol and spunk known for possessing a relaxing yet intensely euphoric eye it is also described as having a creeper effect as well as a pronounced appetite enhancement okay now under the cherry bomb cherry bombs a popular strain thanks to its reputation as a great hybrid that provides mild to moderate effects that are appropriate for daytime consumption the bright green flowers do take off fast giving many consumers that telltale pressure behind the eyes that it's usually the

normal activity and may even help you to tackle that to-do list or the next creative project the genetics of the strain are dependent on which version you get but a popular variance is a cross between

while FCA and google officially announced their partnership to develop autonomous chrysler pacifica minivans yesterday and here's a few important things to know first off they will use the hybrid version of the pacifica so not only is Chrysler the first to have a hybrid minivan but it will be the first to have an autonomous hybrid minivan I find that to be fairly significant secondly both companies will move part of their engineering teams to a facility in southeastern Michigan to design test and manufacture the vehicles with the first applications of autonomous vehicles likely to be transport vehicles used in geo fenced areas a people holler that can travel 20 to 30 miles on battery power sure makes a lot of sense to me Ford is offering a new powertrain set up for the 2017 f150 it's now available with a reworked three and a half liter v6 EcoBoost engine that's made it to an all-new 10 speed transmission the updated engine cranks out 450 pound-feet of torque which is 30 more compared to the first gen three and a half liter and it's the first Ford engine to feature a dual direct and port fuel injection system fuel-economy ratings were not revealed because it still doesn't have BPA ratings the 2017 f-150 goes on sale this fall and in other Ford news the automaker is stepping up its interior quietness game testing for wind noise inside the cabin is normally done in high-tech fifty-million-dollar wind tunnels but Ford is now using mobile arrow acoustic labs to get the job done these mobile wind tunnels don't require many of the large expensive instrum but still can use the high-tech in cabin noise sensors and a steady stream of high-speed air the patent pending system allows the automaker to use it in early production vehicles to identify and develop solutions for unwanted wind noise faster ford says the mobile units can be broken down within a day and be shipped by truck to any facility in North America once there it only takes a few hours to

America and the Soviet Union is today becoming the focus for defense against a growing Soviet bomber threat and the projection of US air power in the strategically important Arctic and North Pacific as technology has changed and the Pacific Rim has grown in geopolitical importance the defenders of Alaska have taken on new roles the US Air Force Army and Navy are developing a highly coordinated Arctic warrior operational strategy to blunt Soviet power and deter the USSR as frequent intelligence and strategic bomber exercises in the region the Arctic warriors face unique challenges from east to west Alaska extends as far as all the lower 48 states with five times as much coastline to defend the central fed today is the long-range Soviet tu-95 bear bomber the Bear H can carry up to 10 nuclear armed AAS 15 cruise missiles launched over Southern Alaska or Canada they could reach the heart of the United States the bear Jie often equipped for electronic intelligence missions of Alaska can carry to shorter range AAS for cruise missiles in wartime these will probably be used against Alaskan and Canadian targets to open the way for the bear each and its long-range missiles in 1987 and 1988 the Bears flew scores of strike training missions near the alaskan coast and the Aleutian Islands on 8,000 mile round trips from the central USSR they practice the procedures that would be used in the nuclear strike mission so far however none of the Soviet farmers has entered US airspace on the horizon is the supersonic blackjack bomber and a new generation of faster cruise missiles for it and the bear G these developments are redefining the mission of the US Air Force Alaskan Air Command headed by Lieutenant General Thomas G McInerney we have seen a growth in long Soviet long-range aviation in the Arctic region for instance in the early 80s we saw less than five long-range aviation flights per year the mid-80s we have grown up to 50 flights per year a slight drop off last year we don't know if it's significant but the significance of these long-range aviation flights by the bear age has changed our thinking it's because the Soviets have changed their strategy they have moved to cruise missiles that the Bears bring into the as a mothership into the Arctic Basin in North Canada and then launch on the United States so the cruise missile has changed the Soviet strategy on long-range aviation the man bomber force and that's very important because Alaska is the furthest north location that can reach these airplanes and for that reason alone Alaska NORAD region plays a key role in the defense of manned bombers and cruise missiles against the North American continent if training were to become the real thing Soviet bombers headed for Alaska would be escorted by new fighters the su-27 flanker is expected to be facing Alaska soon and the mig-31 fox sound has already been deployed to Soviet Far Eastern bases well the growing Soviet fighter force in the Far East Military District is concerning me now the Fox hound can reach Anchorage and go back at altitude if he didn't have to spend much time so we're now seeing for the first time a long-range fighter that could reach here which means that our fighters could be engaged fighter versus fighter so that is a concern but Alaskan air command too has new capabilities the 21st Tactical Fighter Wing operates out of Elmendorf Air Force Base near Anchorage the wing has 34 f-15c & f-15d fighters with improved radar and conformal fuel tanks for greater range they are divided between the 43rd and the 54th Tactical Fighter Squadron the two squadrons maintain f-15s on alert at two forward bases of the Alaskan air command from Galena in west central Alaska and from king salmon at the Northern Neck of the Aleutians they scrambled to intercept and Shadow the Bears improved detection command and control over Alaska's vast distances are provided by two III AWACS aircraft from the tactical air commands nine 62nd airborne warning and control squadron also at Elmendorf training together day in and day out the fighter and AWACS crews are developing new tactics for a theater where an interception can reach out a thousand miles and Soviet and American soil are only a few minutes flying time apart supporting their mission our kc-135 tankers of the Strategic Air commands Alaskan tanker task force and the Alaskan Air National Guard operating from Eielson Air Force Base near Fairbanks just south of the Arctic Circle and an improved ground radar network linking stations of the Alaskan air command Tactical Air Command and the joint us-canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command or NORAD the old dew line is being replaced by an integrated North warning system that will eventually incorporate 52 radars across Alaska and Canada two dozen fairchild a10 ground attack aircraft of the alaskan air commands three 43rd Tactical Fighter Wing basted Eielson are available for quick deployment to the Far East or across the pole to Europe which they can reach more quickly than units from the lower 48 and since World War two when the Japanese easily seized islands in the Aleutian chain no planner can ignore the defense of Alaska itself the a-10s trained for that mission with army units at alaska's superb training ranges [Music] air power in Alaska is part of three organizations the air force's Alaskan air command the Alaskan region of NORAD and the newly activated Alaskan command a subordinate unified command which stretches the US Pacific command's responsibilities from Alaska's North Slope southward to the Indian Ocean I think the strategic and tactical importance of Alaska starts with our location we are the closest between the Soviet Union the United States masovia Union the Far East Military District buttresses right up against our borders here so that strategic location when one talks about naval forces ballistic missile submarines submarines long-range aviation Bayer HS Bayer G's the location where we are is a superhighway if you will and we're part of that superhighway and control those resources that flow or could flow and wartime back and forth the cutting edge of the Arctic Warrior concept is the air superiority and air sovereignty mission of the f-15 fighters [Music] Colonel Chell stirrer commands the 21st Tactical Fighter Wing whose mission has expanded to strategic deterrence as the Soviets have increased their dependence on air-launched cruise missiles what our primary goal is to try and intercept the launcher you know if we wait until they drop their cruise missiles we've got a big task ahead of us so our jobs try and get as far out forward as we can to attack those Baer H's when they come inbound and take the airplane out before it launches Alaskan Air Command fighters have two rules an air sovereignty role against the Soviet bombers and an air superiority road against Soviet fighters that might escort the Bombers all you have 15 pilots in the 21st TAC Fighter Wing either come from or likely to go back to an f15 unit anywhere the f-15 roll of course worldwide is air superiority so we one want to train them to be able to conduct full range of air superiority missions in Alaska we are essentially the you could call it a tripwire I suppose farthest forward point in relation to the the lower 48 in the Canadian the North American land mass so we need to be able to have all the skills available to us to meet whatever type of threat comes in that situation makes the experience of Alaskan fighter pilots unique at any moment of any day they may find themselves a few hundred yards from a Soviet strategic bomber hundreds of miles from shore over the Arctic Ocean or Bering Sea Lieutenant Colonel Pete Marty commander of the 43rd Tactical Fighter Squadron is aware of the special demands his pilots must meet a young pilot on his first assignment to Alaska can be put into a really unique terrifying perhaps experience in that and his first operational tour he has put out a Galena Air Force Base short runway middle of winter slick at night and launched off on an active air intercept against an unknown perhaps another country and he takes off his lead may abort so therefore he has to be prepared to go off into the dark night go against an international type situation on a very young age so it really has to know his stuff and be top-notch between standing alert for intercepts f15 pilots in Alaska have some of the best air superiority training opportunities in the world thanks to the low population density they can practice intercepts and dogfighting at all altitudes [Music] Roger [Music] 31 [Music] and I got one of these [Music] got one let's disengage we're on [Music] [Music] the Alaskan air command encourages other units to train here says Colonel Storer we've got some absolutely fantastic range space here in Alaska I've flown in the Pacific I've flown in Europe and I've flown in the continental United States and I have never seen better training airspace than what we have here out in the West and stony airspace we have terrain that can simulate Korea terrain that can simulate European mountains can simulate the fold of Gap planes truly outstanding airspace [Music] wherever they come from the vast Alaskan distances mean that pilots must raise fuel consciousness to a high art especially when bad weather can force a diversion of hundreds of miles at when Soviet cruise missile range make it necessary to plan for intercepts increasingly far from base major Steve Brown director of operations for the 43rd finds the newest f-15s a big improvement in that area the f-15c has been a big boon for for Alaska here in Alaska Air Command the additional fuel capability with the conformal fuel tanks in the additional internal fuel not only gives us a longer range capability to go out and get out to the Bombers farther out but it also gives us a capability in carrying that fuel to go farther out still come back and have plenty of gas to divert with distance is a challenge to the a-10s flying out of Eielson as well as to the f-15s here one refuel from a tanker task force kc-135 18,000 feet above the Yukon River of being the Arctic Circle Lieutenant Colonel mark Perkins assistant director of operations for the 18th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Eielson has become used to conditions at this latitude the challenge of flying in Alaska two things come to mind the cold weather and the darkness particularly during the wintertime we do operate up here probably four months out of the year where it's totally dark low Sun angles slick conditions runway breaking conditions are very slick and we operate up here under ramp conditions that some other units wouldn't even dare to walk out of the building the darkness itself we get up in the morning it's dark we come to work it's dark you go home it's dark the Sun never comes up more than just above the horizon so we're constantly operating in the darkness we become very proficient at that and we are the best lunar night fighters I think in the world during the winter months and of course during the summer months where the were the best day fighters because we do have 24 hours of daylight Colonel Mike Ferguson former vice commander of the 343rd Tactical Fighter Wing also knows what it takes to keep his eight tens flying we routinely operate in environments around here in the winter time of 20 to 40 below and our maintenance people have worked out a lot of procedures that keep us flying at a normal you trait utilization rate that is during during this the winter months here just like we do during the summer but we found out when you go to the extremes of 60 below it's a little bit different and we learned a lot of lessons out of that we learned that that people slow down a lot but they still continue to function very well machinery is very difficult to operate in minutes 55 to 64 low temperatures fluid stop being fluids rubber stops being pliable and it was very difficult but we did learn those lessons we learned that once you get a vehicle started the best thing to do in those temperatures is to keep it running and that goes for airplanes too our people are very innovative you know they make they make bubbles out of heaters and plastic large plastic sacks fill it up with hot air and get inside of it you can warm up in a hurry the f-15 ground crews face equal challenges according to Colonel Doug ferry deputy commander for maintenance for the 21st Tactical Fighter Wing the winter of 1989 was a very difficult winter for us we had windchill factors that God is low is minus 80 to 85 degrees with ambient temperatures normally ranging around minus 35 for a two-week period this was the coldest that it had been here in Elmendorf in approximately ten years that winter certainly provided the challenge that we needed in terms of operating in the cold environment in seeing how well our airplanes would perform with this severe weather the harsh weather goes with a territory a territory growing in importance as geopolitical balances change the importance of having a ten s based in Alaska is our central location to the European theater and also to the Pacific Theater we are able to deploy from Alaska and go right over the North Pole itself into the European theater in a minimum amount of time going over to Asia or the pack F theater the a-10s can deploy from Eielson Air Force Base down through shamea in the Aleutian Islands and then across to Korea or any place in the Pacific in a minimum amount of time so we're centrally located even though it seems like we're at the top of the world it's a great place to Train the weather is great the terrain mirrors very closely we're will be required to fight if and when we're called upon to fight and finally we've got the sixth energy division light right next door so we're in very close proximity with the people that were committed to go to war with and we can practice with them every day the maneuverable heavily armed 810 also crucial to the defense of Alaska from a potential attacker just across the Bering Strait I guess the first question would be do we need to defend Alaska sometimes we need to remind people that Alaska is part of the United States and its sovereign territory and it needs to be defended we have a lot of high-value strategic reconnaissance assets here in the state so we don't see massive land forces attacking the state but we do see special forces that will require us to deploy forward to the outer edges of the state and support maritime forces and also land forces in the defense of Alaska neither f-15s nor a-10s could do their job without aerial refueling keeping the Arctic warriors in the air over Alaska's enormous distances is the responsibility of the Strategic Air commands Alaskan tanker task force managed by SEC's sixth strategic reconnaissance wing the 168 air refueling squadron of the Alaska Air National Guard also plays a vital role three or four sac tankers are always on one-hour alert and the Air Guard is increasing if the alert force as well the tankers support all elements of the Arctic warriors operations f-15s [Music] a wax [Music] and eight ends Navy fighters operating from carriers in the North Pacific and military transport aircraft in transit to and from Asia via the Great Circle Route 7 to 11 tankers are rotated in from squadrons in the lower 48 or 42 days since the assignment is eagerly sought the crews typically fly twice as much as they wouldn't home and get unique operational experience Colonel Bob Warner commander of the 6th wrote ejek reconnaissance wing if you compare us to other tanker operations down in the lower 48 they basically are training crews to do a job when you come up here to Alaska on your TDY duties or the crews we fly almost totally operational missions so we are here to service the people who need refuelings you have to sort of imagine at the last as a state that's almost 800 miles across and depth netted you could cross the whole Great Plains United States from say Oakland bottom of Oklahoma all the way up to the North Dakota and looking at the kind of area that we have to cover for refuelings the vastness of the state and Avastin of the area means that airplanes operating up here need gas to be able to go someplace do a mission and return home and they cannot carry a payload and and perform the mission if it was the amount of gas they would need to do it the Alaskan Air National Guard's responsibilities have grown with midair refueling needs in the region its tanker force will soon grow to 7 aircraft Lieutenant Colonel Doug Clinton commander of the 168 we work rather closely with the the active duty sac forces here in Alaska and contribute somewhat to their tanker task force mission we do place one of our aircraft currently on alert for one week out of every five also we we share Air Refueling training in the theater covering such a vast territory would be inconceivable without sophisticated radar and command control and communications techniques at the center of the radar system is the NORAD region operations control center or Rock its Elmendorf headquarters is known as top rock for its mission at the top of the world here each red star plaque marks a successful intercept mission major Jim Johnson is director of operations for the seven forty-fourth aircraft control and warning squadron Rock is the regional operation control center that's NORAD's command control unit here in Alaska we take the radar data from the 21 ground-based radars here and it's displayed on our radar scopes we use that to detect any unauthorized aircraft in our sovereign airspace two Independent Systems link top rock with 21 radars of NORAD the Alaska Air Command and TAC one is a SATCOM geosynchronous satellite link the other is a meteor burst system which bounces signals from ionized dust left in the outer atmosphere by tiny meteors of course we're May in twenty-four hours a day and we basically have 30 people on each crew that work with eight-hour days on the rock floor itself were basically divided down the middle the ops room with the surveillance people on the left and the weapons controllers on the right the surveillance people go through the process of detecting any tracks as the entered our sovereign airspace our identification area and then a science and biology to it if the track cannot be ID'd through correlation of flight plans or a positive Friend or Foe beacon squawk then the senior director coordinates the scramble of the fighters and our weapons controllers vector the fighters out for the intercept under peacetime rules the team at top rock exercises extreme restraint even should a Soviet aircraft penetrate US airspace they have instructions to divert it back out or direct it to land at a civilian Airport unless it shows obvious hostile intent u.s. aircraft in the Bering Strait region and the far Aleutians maintain buffer zones and keep close watch on their navigation systems to avoid crossing into Soviet airspace Rock operations are coordinated with the Canadian NORAD controls in Ontario when needed responsibility for intercepts can be passed from one Center to the other a Canadian Brigadier General serves as deputy to Lieutenant General McInerney in his NORAD capacity many of Alaska's radar stations can be supplied only by air or by river barge for most of the year here at tattle ena in west central alaska half a mile of elevation separates the top camp and the main facility like the other stations tattle ena has been upgraded from 1950s technology to a new radar with computerized control and satellite data links in addition to enhancing their capabilities these changes have made it possible to cut crew requirements by 90% or more saving one hundred million dollars a year data Lena and the other sites are operated by General Electric government services under contract to the Air Force this facility is home to 15 technicians who live and work in two geodesic domes far below the radome on the peak temperatures can reach 70 degrees below zero and the facility is resupplied by aircraft which must land on a short narrow runway the key new element in the Arctic warriors radar capability is the boeing e-3 airborne warning and control system or AWACS whose high-altitude surveillance can cover two and a half million square miles in a single flight AWACS makes it possible to spot even low-flying aircraft using terrain features to mask their approach from ground radars standard procedures make it possible to divert any a wax training flight into an intercept mission at AWACS crews here stand alert for rapid take notes the importance of AWACS cannot ever be underestimated because it is a mobile radar and with these vast areas that we must cover the flexibility of a wax to move out when the Soviets don't know it's unpredictable when it's going to be there it gives me as a command and our team here a great flexibility and it gives us our eyes which is so important in warning and in defense the AWACS extend not only the eyes of the Alaskan air command but also its Communications Lieutenant Colonel Tom toups commander of the 960 second airborne warning and control squadron in addition to extending the radar coverage of the ground-based radars the e3 also has the comm capability to maintain calm with the f-15s assigned here at Elmendorf throughout the intercept in addition we can communicate with the ROK the regional operation control center back here at Elmendorf throughout the entire intercept by using HF radios or SATCOM communication until the AWACS came to Alaska in 1986 fighters had to remain within about 200 miles of ground radar sites the United States could not risk losing radar and communications coverage of its fighters in such a sensitive zone now with the AWACS wide coverage and communications relay capabilities intercepts 1,000 miles and more at sea are possible because of Alaska strategic importance a NORAD representative on each a wax mission has the authority to direct intercepts from the aircraft if communications with top rock are disrupted on an AWACS flight it is the mission crew commander who tells the pilots where to fly and determines how the radar surveillance will be conducted Maj Steve Carr a mission crew commander describes the organization in flight the division of labor onboard the AWACS during mission execution is very specific first of all the surveillance section is the one that's primarily responsible for picking up the track initially in assigning some symbology to that track once they have done their job and we have told the track by that I mean we've passed that information to the ground we have received the identification on the track that has an effect on the action will take from then on assuming that track is a track that we wish to intercept then the weapons directors who are under the direct supervision of the senior director on board the airplane will take the fighters the f-15s in this case and will be responsible for the tactics to intercept and at that point identify that particular track supporting the surveillance and fighter controllers are highly trained technicians who manage the aircraft radar computer and satellite communication systems AWACS patrols often extend thousands of miles on round trips to the end of the Aleutian chain or to the North Slope with midair refueling and AWACS can stay aloft for long periods here one is refueled over central Alaska Alaska is one of the few places in the world where a wax and fighter crews can work together so closely and frequently briefing and debriefing together not only for the bomber intercept missions but also for the fighter versus fighter air superiority role there are important benefits for both the AWACS and fighter crews lieutenant-colonel tubes in addition to the air sovereignty role here at Elmendorf we in an IC t ii also have an air superiority or dogfight mission that we have to train our controllers for a good example of how we train them is through daily training missions where we would control air 15 against another aircraft for example f-18s Canadian f-18s who deploy here from coal lake frequently to get that type of training because the AWACS aircraft in Alaska perform on NORAD mission Canadian military personnel routinely fly in most crew positions the AWACS crews and fighter pilots jointly developed new tactics to counter new Soviet fighters and the black jack cruise missile carrier which fly much faster than the propeller-driven bears as an example we've used the b1 and its capabilities to simulate the capabilities of the Black Jack bomber we work with the the wing in their simulator their flight sim and we also have developed simulation tapes that are enable the f15 pilots to come on board the e3 and observe the flight profile or expected flight profile of a black jack in a better ways to counter that threat 24 miles 22 today when the threat still takes the form of the bear bombers the first immediate are often f-15s based here at Galena airfield near the Arctic Circle in fact the field has a long historical connection with the Soviet Union according to Lieutenant Colonel Tom Petty murmee of the 50 72nd Combat Support Squadron which manages the facility 1941 to 1942 the base was used as a drop-off point in the lend-lease program as the United States ferried fighters to the Soviet Union in World War two one of the unique structures on the base is the Birchwood hangar that was built in 1941 1942 both with US and Soviet money and construction workers to support that effort flying the f-15 out of Galena is definitely a challenge one of the key factors is the runway length a runway usable length is 6600 feet which is the shortest operational f15 runway the Air Force uses the cold weather in the dark at Galena is also a challenge approximately a little over 200 miles from Fairbanks which is Eielson Air Force Base over 300 miles to Elmendorf which is our primary base so our divert capability and and divert options if the weather goes down is a significant challenge on the banks of the spectacular Yukon River Galena is only 350 miles from the Soviet mainland when its pilots pass little Diomede Island they are only two miles from Soviet territory on big Diomede Island lieutenant-colonel Pete Marti commander the 43rd Tactical Fighter Squadron knows what that proximity to the Soviet Union means it's often cross my mind sitting alert in Alaska at king salmon or Galena that there are Soviet fighter pilot sitting alert and flagons and foxhounds just on the other side of the border within a very short distance and that the fact that they must consider that we have a very capable air force on this side of the dateline facing them in case of hostilities when Soviet aircraft are detected all the resources of the air force in Alaska are coordinated to intercept them let's follow an actual bear intercept as f-15s AWACS and tankers are directed toward the incoming target the intercept package is coordinated from top rock at Elmendorf part of a chain of command and control that can extend if necessary from an f-15s cockpit all the way to NORAD headquarters in Colorado Springs or to the White House two f-15s of the 21st Tactical Fighter Wing are kept ready for takeoff on five and it's notice armed and fueled in their alert sails of going [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] while fighter pilots taxi in the takeoff position the controllers at top rock balance distance time and fuel for an encounter that may be a thousand miles from Anchorage an AWACS takes off [Music] and a tanker is scrambled from the alert force at Eielson aboard the AWACS the radar control and communications team begin to coordinate the intercept package as all its elements converge on the intruder [Music] afterburner takeoffs are the rules with the fighters with two conformal fuel tanks to wingtai for sparrows and for Sidewinders an f15 C weighs 60 7,500 pounds [Music] [Music] the intercept mission can last six or seven hours making fuel critical here missile armed f-15s refuel over packed ice in the Arctic Ocean on the road to intercept Soviet there [Music] a wax personnel supply position data to the fighter pilot and relay communications back the top rock both fighters and AWACS use their radio and radar selectively to minimize Soviet opportunities to gather intelligence about their capabilities gradually the distance closes the AWACS usually remains at least 100 miles from Soviet aircraft but a tanker may close in 210 miles along with the fighters and remain parallel during the intercept in the clear air of the Arctic visual contact is often made at 50 miles or more [Music] the turboprop vintages over there they make it seem out of date but appearances can be deceiving this is one of the most capable long-range bombers and cruise missile platforms in the air major Steve Brown describes what it's like to approach a Soviet bear in the final actual intercept portion of the bear intercept or coming up to identify friendlier foe the most important thing that we're worried about is of course the tail guns on the on the Bears we're making sure in our tactics that we're coming in there's always a guy in a firing position such that if we are fired on us we're coming in again identifying that bear that will have a person who would be in a position that they could fire back if called upon our first response all if we found the the guns uncaged and tracking us would be get out of gun range so our first thing would do is to break away once we have taken the stock of the situation we figured that in fact the Bears do not meet us in your arm and are flying in the international airspace and now we're going to go on in take a look and see identify the type of bear that is and then the next thing now is we want to get some pictures of them so we'll have one person in identifying looking for our tail number on the bear while the other one is in the cover position if there's two bombers we still only pay our attention to one initially making sure that we keep ourself covered and then we'll clear wingman horn up to the other to the other bear with the other fighters staying in a position again not ever letting down our guard the intercept team may fly in formation with the Soviet bombers for two hours or more taking turns refueling from the kc-135 as needed as the Americans take photographs their counterparts aboard the bear used their own cameras at times they waved but the f15 pilots rarely reciprocate this is an enemy bomber approaching US territory no gain but part of a serious show of strategic readiness by both sides Lieutenant Colonel Marty recalls his experience is a unique experience that in fighting at jet fighters and when we wear helmets and have your own jet engine and cockpit noise you very seldom hear anything outside your aircraft over approaching a bear aircraft unique in that you can actually hear the kind of roll trading problems grinding away as it's moving through the sky and you're impressed by the size of the aircraft and the capability of course the big red star on the tail eventually the intruders turn and head for home and the US Flyers do the same the tension eases on the long flight back to base again the Flyers can enjoy the beauty and emptiness of Alaska the bear flights have become less frequent lately and proteic confrontation has given way to us-soviet civilian exchange programs but the Arctic warriors ensure that the strategic deterrent is always in place [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music]", "KLs_Xy31pXI": "[Music] welcome back to another edition of the dr. greenthumb strain review for be real TV we have yet another strain you know the doctor travels to many places different times and experiences different types of strains that comes up every now and then today we have a strain called the fiery they say they mixed the fire og with tangerine so this is a hybrid we don't really have too many statistics I didn't lift that great I mean it looked like tangerine but it didn't look like tangerine nuggets that one would you know become accustomed to seeing and as far as the og element I mean it definitely didn't look like fire og I you know I really really don't know what to say by the looks but looks are deceiving as we all know it was it was kind of dry a little brittle not that bad but you know the breakup was easy I don't recommend a grinder because it might be a little bit too aligned and if you're rolling with one of our funky field tips then you know if it's too dry troop too brittle it might get clogged but I mean it was okay that it smelled okay it didn't really have necessarily that the the the og smell it had a little bit of tangerine but it was okay you know I don't know what to say too much that I'm a little skeptical on it but the doctor is always willing to give it a shot no pun intended so I'm just gonna light this [ __ ] up right here one more thing was it the Nuggets you know they weren't full not that too many City bizarre but this is a hybrid it's probably looked more sativa you know heavy because you know these nuggets were you know they were they were not up to par but like I said sometimes looks are deceiving smaller Nuggets can be more flavorful so we'll see right now doctor is disappointed firing I'll tell you what I had this moonshine shot to celebrate made in America [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] no matter maybe this fiery fire tangerine hybrid here was gonna be great but you know what here look I'll just do this because this is all this strain has worked well like that [ __ ] up on fire do it that way because smoking it this way ain't gonna work this has been the dr. greenthumb strain review normally I'd say go [ __ ] yourself but if you got this weed fire it up [Music]", "dDT3JSDXuAM": "hey good morning guys I wanted to show you the ATF the Alaskan Thunder fook please take a good look again this is the day of harvest on the Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] some of those colas about the size of baseball bats up top I couldn't film this in the horizontal setting so here's in the vertical I wanted to get you up close and have a good look of the Alaskan it is it is quite beautiful look they're getting purple in there the inner nugs are pretty gorgeous I'll take you all the way up look this is not Harris about as long as a baseball bat a few of these up up top as that they look like a top look they're really gorgeous another some big long ones anyway here's the Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] thanks for taking a look and you know come into the shop at sweet relief thanks a lot everybody bye", "c2gITgcghU0": "[Music] guys that bring thing for 20 we're back with a new video I have dank bakes pineapple express oil pretty nice like always at ding Bates official no propylene glycol all organic has a story on the back I'll be leaving that down in the description below and it is 90 point 55 percent THC I hope you can zoom in and look at this all right it's a Graham pretty nice box I like that they put the little train with a pineapple in it always open it from the bottom easiest way stop struggling with the boxes and that's a seal at the bottom as a plastic tip at the top if it doesn't look like this it's not a ding vape and because I have to seal at the bottom has already been used that means you buying a used env always has C cell at the bottom okay and also a serial number if it doesn't have none of that or all of it at all and he's not a big big I'll be on the lookout for the fakes and if it's date dates official ordained its official account they're all real although if there are none of that than your faith let's try yourself all right it doesn't really have a pineapple taste to me it has a light pineapple taste with like a mango taste inside of it so it's like a pineapple mango flavor it's not just pineapple express it also does Ceylon the fact that it is a combination of pineapple in a mango flavor with apples and don't taste the apples in it but I do taste those other two the taste is really good if you like fruity if you like fruity flavors it's really good if you like more of a natural herb flavor then I would recommend like an Alaskan Thunderfoot or White Widow and all those other flavors that don't have a fruity name in the front let's try this out again for the high all right the high I give it like a six out of ten it's not that strong the Alaskan Thunderfoot was literally 90 point 79 percent I think and it was way stronger than this it was him so if y'all want something is like these packing a punch yeah I'm gonna get something else besides this I know pineapple Express is they good like a STONER fanatic that you always want to get your hands on besides just the flower but I would recommend y'all to try how they doing beeps as well like I said guys stay tuned because I got more [Music]", "DUkSomB8FMo": "I think there's something in front of me there might be oh my gosh I found something

happening this is Florida medical marijuana reviews coming at you with an updated Blue Dream whole flower video from Liberty Health Sciences now this strain is great the flower is great the trichomes are great the percentages are great I'm happy with just about everything but the trim on it is still subpar like you could still get a little bit of these sugar leaves off of here and be selling us true whole nugs rather than you know excess weight but nonetheless let's get back to the price here they have increased your price from twenty eight dollars and eight to thirty three dollars in eight the which to me is completely unwarranted I don't see how you could be charging a base twenty eight dollars for all of your aids across the board from super a five to even Starkiller when it first started but now Starkiller is forty dollars and eighth now Blue Dream is magically 33 dollars an eighth but super a five which was oddly my favorite of the first two super a five and Blue Dream is still only twenty eight dollars it just doesn't make sense to me honestly really doesn't I think it's bad business practice just like I think it's bad business practice how they lied about free statewide delivery for so long while completely denying the Panhandle with the Pensacola store open in the Panama City Beach store open there probably is not a problem anymore but it still makes me

very last about to fall out the very last of what we got I picked up a browser stuff yesterday and we're ready at the end of our dabs this is like the last of it so this stuff went by really quick anyhow um lime sherbert wonderful string it's an indica dominant hybrid and from what I found out the THC nose on this can get twenty-five percent and that's what a flower it's not for this sugar accent about the dab on but this is a really wonderful strain it's a cross between key lime pie and sunset sherbert and although i haven't had key lime pie before I have had sunshine server and it's a it's a nice straight on this this is another good strain as well really wonderful one of their stuff like anxiety and depression and stress pain relief was ass it was ok wasn't like the greatest thing but I found myself constantly medicating quite often for pain relief but as far as like the anxiety and the stress absolutely wonderful I think this is probably more for that than it would be for the pain relief I medicated with this throughout the whole entire day from wake and bake all the way to the evening time and for me I have to say probably evening time it would be the best in fact the the best I would think for this train is for like probably right after work especially if you're working a really stressful job you come home he sees your traffic you irritated agitated or frustrated you know if you if you're like just totally stressed out this is a good strain is kind of wash away everything settle the nerves you know round you out and just kind of wipe the slate clean and get you to kind of be able to enjoy what's in front of you without dwelling on stuff that's been stressing you out and dwelling on things that just there are little bring you down you know this is good for kind of boosting the mood kind of label yep it's often just kind of you know just forget about all that stuff that's that's bringing you down and he's got that's how it was for me and that's kind of what this string kind of seemed good for for me it didn't really seem like it was more for pain or anything but probably more for just kind of you know distressing and chilling out you know because it definitely did settle the nerves it kind of puts you a nice mellow mood you know the only thing is if he's solo strolling with this if you're hitting this hard it can make you lazy I Medicaid with a sort of day and I did take some big dabs and I had a very unproductive day this the kind of stuff is good for just whatever you can sit down whether it's watching movies and talking story hanging out you're playing games i kind of got kind of bored with you know i wasn't really into its kind of want to chill and relax if you want to put much effort into anything but you know being entertained by the TV the movies it's good for this kind of stuff I can't think of anything else other than like there I didn't experience any munchies the only thing that that still have to be watched the crash you know about lethargic that got lazy Kottonmouth was there but nothing too serious overall really wonderful strain but i don't think i would medicate with this throughout the day because just because it made me lazy this is a nice after work type of strain something to have on hand for like those stressful days maybe days you feeling kind of lean oh you're not having a good day this is a good string for that kind of stuff so we'll take us a nice dad I can't believe how fast this thing ran out then usually a gram of shatter can last like two three days it's the first time I've brown eye shadow just like one day it's a fastest disappearing shatter our head Lac does it say huh anyhow here's for the lime sherbert nice anyhow this is a nice train well I probably just keep this more for the evening time you know i medicate ways to of the day and I was just like even though it is a good date I me a good strength to medicate with if you've got stuff to do if you got responsibilities you might want to save this for after you're done with those things because at least for me it made me laugh RG kit made me lazy and and very unproductive and can't have that during a day time and I got way too much stuff to do so but the benefits for me I think that the store is the strongest was definitely for anxiety stress stuff like that if you just had it with the day you today I'm so done with today rattling of this strain it'll help you out but it's a good string man and I don't know if i buy it again because I probably wouldn't use it for anything other than like probably late at night you know most of my medicating comes in the daytime so i don't i pick this up again but i don't know if i would be good shrink they have on hand just for the just for like that getting rid of all the frustration and kind of wiping away your emotions you know clean you know fresh start kind of you know get you just not dwell on negative negative things you know I wouldn't say sometimes like you get into an argument or sometimes you see something that's kind of just kind of triggers you you know and it just kind of stays with you and it's in your mind or back of your mind this is the kind of stuff that kinda makes you forget about that and sometimes that's really needed man because negative thoughts they can bring you down they can take you from having a good day to having a bad day so it's good to keep those thoughts in check man and stay positive and this is a good string for that kind of stuff so overall it's a nice train but gotta use them wisely out pushing the evening time so anyhow wonderful strain it'll probably get this again uh if I need it", "P_uYm7To0UI": "beginner growers check this out and they'll take you through how to grow I thought it was difficult first but it's not that weed it's a weed that's why they call it a weed it wants to grow honestly start off with the northern lies of wine light then as you shall stay strong indica strains start you off easy very easy very hard they I've nearly killed my friends before and brought them back and cropped hard you'd also caught up to 18 ounce in a one by one meter squared tent I actually copped fourteen and a half ounce when I squat here's some pictures of what you can achieve you can achieve this if you follow my method and I'll see you on the other side great people [Music] [Music] [Music] okay sobs Oh viewers UK mainly perhaps to piers prices and stuff can be uk-based right you seen those images I'm no expert trust me weed wants to grow if you're a beginner it's easy especially go for a strain both for Northern Lights it's so easy to grow it's a strong smoke it doesn't stretch much you get nice close-up bad so if you've seen the micros I mean you can crop up to 18 ounces in a one by one ten that the one that I've got is they're not quite 9 is 3 foot by 3 foot my second well the second grow images the images on there the one plan was about for in our fans so all right you've initial layout in England and this is buying from shops I my initial layout was about 300 pounds but that's buying it all from a shop online I'm sure you'll get it all for 200 good thing about Northern Lights don't need a carbon filter because it hardly smells and what it does smell of why this growing is almost why sweaty sweaty sort of socks and then you got a bit of a smile for the two-week period but you don't smoke tent very honestly you've got no worries on that respect and there's ways around it anyway so sad 250 pound payout and you're gonna be gonna cop if you follow up after you've got at least an ounce at least and if you use the market value what's that 2200 pounds and you've got all your care popery consumables go again you said top so I'd advise anyone to do it Norvin luck lies or as you'll see as a series progresses there's also a Hawaiian genetics from the grasshopper which is also indica dominant and very easy to grow I'm good and there's a bit of a surprise at the end but anyone who's starting up a Grove in the UK or Europe or anywhere actually it's about actual full beginner or beginner when they buy the care say let's set that ready set up I'll send you out some [ __ ] awesome Hawaiian genetics who's got a wine genetics in UK easy to grow I'll take you throw it with agro my friends got going on another place and yes so Northern Lights and Hawaiian light in a very easy to grow the hard years how I mean during my first boys I mistreated them you know forgetting to water I'm a limp and anyone that pops right back up honestly those things could survive a nuclear nuclear winter so that's why I suggest don't go for your hay strains and all right when you first start growing a yeast Gong Kenichi because they stretched too much they stretch too much you you won't get much yield the harder to grow the more disease prone so I'd go through an Endicott and I would go for Northern Lights or Hawaiian lightning yeah so what you're gonna need is you were you only die small but get yourself one by 1/10 in this shop I bought it from it with 70 pounds got a little nest here yeah you need a light reflector bulb which comes with you and what power by Lester should bake everything that sits next to ten and doesn't blow yeah electrics gets formed with what going up against 240 so yeah so you got that and it also comes with a three light and that was six three bulb bulb and that was sixty pounds some lamps have chained very important and Caribbean eclipses just how you gonna have it is clipped up to the top top bar of you ten you can have on long chains they'll board up so you can move it up and down the Caribbean Eclipse to wherever you want it exactly in that tent and you can move it across that way that way a little bit that way so yeah chains and carabiner Clips you can never have enough to times clip funds have got some over there for inside you turn this time here is the best time best time because you're not going to get any heat issues at all it's been perfect twenty three twenty five degrees in there now here mine new new method is one part in a one me to attend a big massive five or six gallon pot and train it old down and stuff but see you an absolute and I'd suggest three parts three free gallon pots by for pot five seeds hopefully you'll be popping Hawaiian lightning pop pop pop all five yeah plant floor and check which what you you will know pretty so much one's going to be once and then get rid of that and that be free in their make room for um yeah I'm go ahead of myself well you need to two times scorpion I use scorpion seven-inch extractor slash intake funds they're about 45 pound each so that's 90 you can have one blow in our end with duct in I do in an adapter so I'll carry it just just smiley on my window so it's sucking in fresher and then the extractor I also out going out the window well head and you know you don't need a carbon filter as well to know for life that's a good thing it doesn't stink like that doesn't stink like that I have to make those Northern Light yes I gonna didn't need a bag of Kanna because you don't use soil for it my this is my advice on you first go use canner kind of cocoa it's a lot easy easier in my opinion so you'll need a medium bag which is cheapness small bag of perlite perlite is absolutely crucial because those roots when they're going through they want the one air pockets one little pockets Italy and things and the perlite I can grip round and grow through so it sort of so there's a soilless so the cocoa is aerated really well drains well I mean without I said the difference of parallel without peril I looking at houses I use fake Sun I'll put a bit of little in tip a bit perlite and mix it up watch the clavicle yes come on do it again to get set up yeah you're gonna need just one five metre aluminium duct and I'll go to the other ammonium stuff pick it just pulls out 5 metres long now so you'll need that's all you'll need some duct tape obviously and adapters as well because you read that you a 7 inch adapter won't fit your ducting quite right so you need that you can get them in any DIY store Norwood adapt to the it even comes out even thinner that I put out show or window cord of a t-shirt soaking in the pressure all right and then your nutrients cannot go for cannot a it's kind of a and B same size bottles there last year couple of guavas you know same size bottles we'll get to the feeding measure in a minute video but same size bottles and a PK 14/15 booster that that won't be used until um flower so that that altogether cost you about 20 pounds all the things you'll need is a jerrican timers good quality timers clips you can never have enough clips yon duct tape and some sharp thermos all right so yeah get it set up get your [ __ ] seeds [ __ ] poppin get everything first voice I don't they see if I can get it all set up make is good you can and then yeah literally you'll be [ __ ] you've been one away if anyone but if any beginner that now wants to start grow I'll happily in the next few weeks three four weeks what again together the kit I'll happily send them some Hawaiian wine in Hawaiian genetic cross between Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] Thunder [ __ ] Alaskan from the book and the strong city but that's in the class that's about 50/50 good for the first time for our they have any views and show me great setup Verde boom I hope your hope you up my is you get mad missiles you've seen that I'm gonna leave you now I'll show you a few clips on the way out of what you need peace up big love to you New Glarus and UK keep it looking fresh honestly follow my series and you will [ __ ] you will crop what I've got cuz I'm no expert peace out to everybody sponsored by grasshopper genetics and

be near me don't be near me big boy you okay [Music]", "5MYARvEm3pU": "this episode is brought to you by blitz bongs calm go to their website and use promo code you do 5 hey everybody welcome to another episode of YouTube thank you for joining me 9 my name is Bud so today we have a strain review pretty excited about this one this one is called della haze from San Rafael the total THC is twenty point three zero percent a percent THC that is huge and then CBD is zero point zero one so this is very much a high THC version also it is a sativa as you know other sativas and indicas and then there's hybrids I'm sure this is mainly like a hybrid because a lot of a lot of sativas aren't true sativas anymore because then the growing phase for an indica is shorter and so it's just easier produced so they do hybrid versions anyway so again delle haze I'm going to show you kind of what this bottle looks like there you go I really think maybe I should rank later but no I'll rant first these big plastic containers that are the government approved versions and there's like like okay how much is in this not very much like what a waste of space what a waste of container in plastic I think some stores even the like not all of them are still illegal in in British Columbia there's a lot that have popped up illegally still but they are trying to do it right by paying their taxes and stuff but some places are starting to create these drop-offs where you can go to the store and send your empty containers and they will ship it back the company for you so they can reuse them which i think is a good idea your roadside recycling pickup they'll take it to but you know a lot of that stuff just gets thrown in the landfill so I think really they got a look at better packaging for these things it's a natural plant put it in something a little bit more matte natural I mean you could make hemp packaging and that would be pretty cool okay anyways let's get to it whoa this one is very very citrusy almost bubblegum like in a way like that juicy fruit style bubblegum nice okay really small buds like look at these things really small buds again that could just be the producer I'm sure a lot of growers can grow nice big juicy buds of this stuff but you never know anyways I'm gonna put it into this nice grinder here it's magnetic which I really like and let you know what I think about this stuff it's already got a beautiful nose without being ground up so let's try try getting some of these oils out from some of those sorts of things here we go Brian's really smoothly and easily okay there you go well kind of turns in to a powder though it's like look at that it's pretty much just like a powder because kind of dry not gonna lie dry okay maybe I shall grind a little bit more up just so it's not such a powder yeah we'll see okay there we go zigzag whites those are my fav the nose really breaks up some of the oils it's really a little bit more like lemon need - all kind of a smell but not chemically by any means nice and oily and citrusy I like that okay here we go and you guys you viewers out there I know that uh hopefully you're starting to buy from some legal places and get your your marijuana from legitimate sources but I want to hear people's opinions on this because you know a lot of the time there's been shortages across Canada there's been kind of not amazing actually you know I suspect in British Columbia to have one of the higher rates of sales you know lots of sales happening in British Columbia but I think a lot of people are still just kind of going to the person that they originally got it from because like or just you know black market dealers or what happened whatever you want to call them they saying that always makes it sound like they're just such evil people but half of the time that people have like one guy that's their best friend or a good friend that they get it from all the time and they don't really sell any other drugs and they're just into man-up marijuana cause it's like it's it's a culture it's a part of our culture it's been a part of our culture for hundreds of years but of course you know in the last 100 ish years it's been frowned upon which is the total total misconception of what it can do for you anyway let's go for this we're gonna put that later okay let's try this out I like to kind of just burn the tip without sucking it in first just let it kind of light naturally because sometimes if you suck it in too hard at canoes and goes all one down one side so that's nice here we go oh yeah mmm beautiful flavors Wow it kind of comes out a little bit more floral on my taste here we go mmm this tastes really really nice for being so powdery and fine I thought you know it just burned really quickly or just light up and just go but if you roll them tight enough like this is tight you can get them to burn for a little bit longer especially when they're really dry and powdery but the flavor on this some of that citrusy oiliness is coming through it's a little bit more earthy earthy tones on the flavor the nose is quite potent really nice I'm instantly you know a couple minutes into this feeling good already it's a sativa it gets me motivated it gets me moving along I'm going on a big trip coming up soon so I'm going to probably pack after this but and again this is a huge amount of THC in here what did I say third twenty point three zero percent that's a nice high number I'm gonna have one more okay beautiful okay I'm ready um so far really like this stuff complaining about the packaging but that's not that cannabis this fall as a strain itself I'd highly suggest go out and find it if you can go on to whatever your provinces website is ours is the beast basically the BC liquor distribution branch is teamed up and is now the cannabis distribution branch as well but check out their products on their website they have a lot of really great information they have a lot of good information on kind of flavors and feelings and prices and how to go slow with it and if you're a beginner with smoking cannabis kind of what to expect it's it's so well put together website so if you have one in your province please check it out or if it's legal in your state I'm sure you have something along the same lines um anyways my name is bud thank you for joining me click like subscribe and I'll comment back when I can and we'll see you next time peace [Music]", "Fh8yjfWA910": "[Music] sup guys sigh birthday 420 I've just gotten a daily hi clothes box it's a membership that I had myself and you get a glass piece every month for $29.99 a month it's supposed to give you your supplies for a41 right in this box this month's box is supposed to be pretty good I've been having some pretty good stuff but you know not very exciting let's see how this one is look at the front cover you should already give you an idea what the glass piece is gonna be glass pieces right here make that last the little bowl just to package it in to give you a little wax Mack never had one of these before this is brand new they're upgrading little by little they die cuts doing their thing they give you a blunt splitter from kingpin a raw clipper later bears where I've been getting all my clipper ladies look at this this is for Halloween this one's free this month is not really like anything new anything but it's wrong then we have a little doobie tube which a little sticker inside I have like six of these already and then we also have a pack of herbal wraps tobacco free xx pedal brushing cream like I said supply you for a month I don't think they'll last but they also give you a pack of raw papers brand new and maybe I can see in the jar it's a glass tip that says DHC we're gonna open it up they gave me one not that long ago it was Tommy Chong's but I lost it so this replaces my last one did it like I said guys it's $30 a month they give you a little card to see if you want a raffle to win a mega box which is like a huge box that gives you more than one glass piece and a whole bunch of supplies and then they give you two stickers and then if you like the stickers let me know I can give them out now let's see the glass piece all right you guys y'all ready look at this look at this that's a rocket bubbler he's a little Bowl in his little packaging to this bad boy right there I'm supposed to make you lift off then hey so since we already have it I have a little bit of some gelato right there kind of sprite this up a little bit let's see how this rocket hits not sharing this hole looks pretty small to put some water in but I'm not sure I want to put it - yeah I think I'm gonna put it through you all right perfect gelato breaks them down real quick got to do this the old-fashioned way always like it old-fashioned don't like it broken down too much turns into dust all righty see this is a straight hit you feel this view you milk this up I'll have you feeling pretty good but that finishes off the daily high clubs unboxing like I said I appreciate it daily I clubs good look out like it every time is upgrading every month is getting better but like my usual videos we're going into pain tapes alright usually I'm vaping my thanks on a vision spinner but sadly about a week ago from my last video I accidentally lost the battery and I stepped on it so I bent the tip of where the paint goes and I can't use it no more so I went into a lookout went on the website and I ordered this from whose is a twist slim pin preheat mode because with the charger already with it and suppose II the charger that is in here it automatically knows when to turn off when your battery is fully charged so it won't overcharge it so if you don't use this charger you're gonna gonna break your warranty guys save the charger don't use those cheap find all these charges from some friends little gas stations this ISO package pop it off in here because of this charge already screwed on you can mess with the temperature at the bottom you can spin it all the way to through 4.8 volts and the charger all righty the battery the battery looks pretty nice a little all at the bottom with the whole symbol has it on the little button as well and guys I got to think thanks today to ding beats today listening I have this one which is blue dream it was a request one 24/7 vape life thanks for the request my god I was able to get my hands on it here it is blue dream from Dean babes like always I think Bates official all organic no propylene glycol it also has a little story on the back I'll leave that down in the description and it's eighty nine point ninety nine percent THC this is an indica with a sativa so it's a crossing of an indica with a sativa and then I also have Jack Herer when dink Bates as well look at this that beautiful oil besides always out of a pink pigs official all organic no propylene glycol strolling on the back as well I'll leave Bolton down the description if you're interested and this one is ninety six point twelve percent THC this is a sativa dominant eye I messed with it because but you know for today I think I'm okay with uh sativa and they cuz make me want to go to sleep so we'll start off with the jack herer like always comes with a little seal at the bottom and I've always said guys if it's not a C cell it's not a dink vape also it's supposed to be a kosher tank has a little K at the bottom guys should be looking for these things and it comes with a clear plastic tip I guess is not glass is plastic and a good thing about these tanks is if you drop them they don't break as easy I've had a brass knuckles it broke after a job to like twice these I dropped them a couple times they just pick them back up on they're burning like like new let's see how this goes yeah let's taste it without hitting it without actually burning it how's that go and I can't say it's not piney it's like grassy like earthy herbal kind of teas I'm sure but it's it's not sweet at all like it's not anything I'm used to vaping but see how the highest all right off the bat the hits pretty strong it's really potent but it doesn't taste anywhere sweet it has a grassy horrible taste you wouldn't need much to be feeling lit on something like this it's 96 percent is about the highest I've ever had I am I've had a king Louie it's like 95% but this one to me it was the highest egg I've got my hands on it's 96 let's try one more thing all right I ain't joking you ain't smoking but if you can get your hands on it I would recommend it so me I'll give it a 9 out of 10 cuz I'm I'm already feeling pretty good I'm not even sure if I'm gonna make it through the blue dream after this but let's go on to the next one like I said guys I've been getting database a lot I got one brass knuckles I probably won't even go back after these kids done the blue dream like I said it was a requested video so I'm combining them both right here this is oil here's a seal so Cecil as well like I said all of them are the same this battery is way better too it's like the perfect battery to be burning the soil the hits bigger this this one it was good it lasted longer this one doesn't last as long but the hit when you burn it is way better than the vision spinner all right let's see how's that go a blue blueberry taste but then it has like a date taste as well like you actually taste it in there see how it is all right this one as well it's pretty good I would say if you can get your hands on it as well it does have a sweeter taste in a Jack Herer which is this one and it's even less potent than a Jack Herer but it's I think it would be one of my favorites I'll give it an 8 out of 10 as well flavor a 9 out of 10 has a blueberry type of flavor not sure what other flavor has inside it but it's pretty good like I said guys stay tuned this will be in my next video don't forget to Like and subscribe [Music]",

review carts and we review beat moments now before anything I want to start by saying thank you so much for taking this time out of your day to come watch this video thank you so much now today we got a little special product for you guys last video I did a little dancreep review purple punch not gonna lie to you change it changed my perspective on take beeps was not bad at all but now today you know we came in we came through with another dispensary [ __ ] I got two products for you guys today but I'm only gonna be reviewing one we got the new kingpins this is the Skywalker og which is an indica this is the gelato which is a hybrid now these are the new newest newest boxes so before I open this up I'm gonna show you guys how to make sure that you know if you get these new boxes and how not to get scammed so with these new boxes [Music] instead of having the seal that was more of you know it was it was kind of patched on this is fully printed on so this is on here you can't scratch that off for nothing like this this is on the actual box it still has all the same information it still has the manufacturer date the best body the batch number everything like that you know I'm saying and of course ingredients just cannabis oil and then of course one second draw is a single-serving you know they always say that but you know for today let's try out this gelato so today we're gonna be trying out this gelato kingpin next time why have the Skywalk OG the reason why don't want to do the Skywalker og just just as yet I had the Skywalker og strain and man oh man it is a night night hitter like the Skywalk OG is very strong in - that's the thing was trying to have you do it just it just have you all types are completely gone so let me start right here by Samuel it says on here this is July - of course a thousand milligrams the THC amount is seventy seven point 38 percent total THC is seven hundred and seventy-three point seventy six milligrams there's zero point thirty percent CVD and it's 2.99 excuse milligrams of CVD so push I already know C so don't judge me we're using a plastic knife today to open these up yeah sorry for that that didn't work so we're doing the crackhead way the only choices now if y'all haven't have this tool you need to use this please don't use this tool I done damaged up the box oh yeah I forgot whole sides both sides both sides now a lot of people was saying that with the kingpins you can get the stickers online don't be real with you for you to try to take this thicker Zoff as you can see watch I'm trying to take a sticker off and show you guys you can tell if it's tampered with you see how dingy and everything on top of that looks already so you can put like no and look I've ripped it off and you see what happened the whole bottom came on you bro you you know what you didn't when you know what you're getting this very very hard to do it with that look and I rip off the other side look what happened same thing with the other side you can't just rip you know rip them apart put a new one in there these kingpins are different they're different I mess with them heavy heavy heavy oh okay okay with these new boxes they went back with the regular black of course got the insert [Music] [Applause] [Music] got that my stinker there it is right there as you guys can see of course has the grommet of course has the grommet on each side just take off the holes take off the top let's take off the bottom this one no leakage at all I mean the last one was months and months and months old I live on the East Coast so to ship it and whatever it's been stored it kind of makes sense that it was a little bit of leakage so you know for that last King and it kind of makes sense with no leakage at all for this which

paddled hambone you let it happen what do you even know what happened don't gotta I blacked out for most of it okay [Music]", "AYHHFocrjcg": "[Music] welcome to wheat entertainment and there's been a lot of requests to try mojave cannabis or mojave reserve and i was able to buy it at two different dispensaries and today we're going to talk about something called mojave kush and you know it's i love trying new cultivators and i love trying new flowers and mojave reserve really has some as a cultivator some followers that really like them and people asking me all the time try it try it try it i haven't really got the fire strange yet i'm not sure about this string well i i am sure but i'm going to tell you in a little bit and uh but today we're going to check it out out of vapor cup so let me load my two little scoopers excuse me my one more scooper in here i've got two in there already mix three it's the same amount as a bong hit we're gonna tamper and we're gonna stick this down into the cup we're gonna talk about this flower so mojave kush comes in this jar and i got this at the excellence down in sun valley and i ran down there because they had cryptochronic by alien labs and i wanted to try that flower so a lot of times what i'll do is they'll have one flower that i really want to go for so i really pick dispensaries because of the strains they have and then when i go down there depending on if i have time that week i might buy a whole week's worth of flour so i have my picks and then i get blood tender picks and this was one of those flowers i just bought the two mojave reserve strains that they had so we're all excited to try it today um so we're gonna use it out of vapor cup i don't really see too much vapor in there yet i don't really know why you see that i don't see anything right but we're gonna check it out anyway we'll see what happens so here we go mojave kush by mojave reserve at a vapor cup at 330 degrees now this flower was very dry in the jar and it's crazy because it is still really smooth this flower has a really standard weedy og taste and it's crazy because you would think that these people that spend the money on this beautiful flower would put a boveda in these things even something maybe someone has to come up with a cheaper lovita pack because we want to keep our stash buds it's so important and i hope some of the cultivators that are watching the show realize that stash buds bring people back meaning you always got to keep your favorite stash buds and also this year i'm going to spend some time showing people how to make the salad you can take your stash buds and your not so good flour and mix them up to make flour better than the stash buds it's crazy i'm really good at mixing up flowers i have so many flowers i can mix them up and also your body can get used to one strain so mixing things up gives a little bit maybe more coverage of whatever's working because they don't really don't know why sunflowers are better than others they don't know but what did we think about mojave kush this flower was a totally enjoyable vape and as you can see i'm rambling this flower was strong enough it has focus and actually i like this flower i'm giving this flower a range i'm going to give it a 8.65 heavyweight and an 8.75 lightweight this is actually a strong flower with focus i liked it it's just so smooth and i want to try more uh flowers from mojave reserve they're doing a good job good job guys so if you can imagine if you're smoking a joint right over using vapor cup and you go the same time you're gonna see you use i don't know 10 times the flour and you're no more stone than you are from vapor cup with that just a little bit which is crazy i love this thing and you can get a vapor cup on vaporcup.com it is awesome telling you i'm so stunned right now i love this thing and you can get one on vaporcup.com i'm telling you there's no disappointment from the doctor i don't have any games man i'm a serious dude and i love this thing if you want to see my favorite picks you can see them on weedentertainment.com those are all my favorites i did a lot of work to make those lists enjoy them they have the heaviest the sweetest thanks for joining in if you have a tip for me leave it below the video i'm the doctor i'm back every day but sunday come join in leave me a tip party on my friends [Music] you", "ZECcth7O2Yo": "what up [ __ ] boy Long Beach push here coming to you once again it must be a thursday so know what time it is but uh I guess I'll get into once I lift this [ __ ] open or whatever so I quibble it for dang couldn't pass this up Dustin that long beach mean green which is Marcia mean Martian mean green and sorry guys I had to do it again man I had to get some more that headband that [ __ ] was [ __ ] business yes so get a bit for me to eat normally I'm not I don't do that but uh this stuff stuff just that good I couldn't I couldn't pass it up so here we go ahead and check it out it's four grams looks like more than four grams right look at that just one big [ __ ] up bunch of nuts huh check down and look at that thing I beauty min looks [ __ ] chunk let me give you guys something to compare that to kick that dude out i'll put some exit i'll post pictures today i'll post more pictures on the old twitter so for those of you that have been been enjoying knows whatever keep keep an eye out later on Pied i would say probably maybe like 10 minutes or so after i load the video i would say check to check the twitter and awesome posters some posters some [ __ ] pictures posted um I'll do his headband pulling on the Martian mean green i posted i actually did I went to a different collective earlier this week I'll get to them said let's do this mmm love that Martian mean green smell man smells almost like melons and a little bit of a like a little bit of a green crack to it as well look at that four grams right there man bang stuff pretty nice dent give you guys another comparison here so the bug girl is almost similar to the headband but the smell is definitely not man it's got a great smell to it this vote for just thought what's what we're gonna review today do the Martian mean green so check this dude out Thank perfect little nub set up for us right there so without further ado Oh before I forget I went to the sea and sand collected in Sunset Beach played spin the wheel and want a free lighter it was cool collected I picked up some I picked up three grams well there deal with for the first time patience but you get a free gram as long as you spent 20 bucks from yeah twenty bucks with it and so I spent they have this their special older what two grams for 35 bucks which is normally a little bit more than I like to pay but after looking at the selection I you know I was I didn't really have the K that's a really good [ __ ] for those of you that live in huntington beach Seal Beach oh do this [ __ ] drop test here I've been neglecting it for a while wait for those you that are in Sunset Beach seal beach huntington beach i'm sure you guys but I already know about this place so I'm not going to bore you with it but uh for those of you don't check out the weedmaps they don't they don't post their menu which is rather strange but I read enough the reviews that I was comfortable enough with going there to very small place is literally right on the beach it's right on the corner of I think if there's like a jacket I beach and PCH I think there's a there's a jack in the box right on the corner as well so but yeah check them out 15 255 cap all their 55s are pretty [ __ ] pretty [ __ ] strong can you find them cheaper yeah you can find that [ __ ] a little bit cheaper i picked up grandma some short bus bubba a grandmas and larry OG and i got free grandmother blue dream and i must say that their blue dream is [ __ ] the blue dream is probably better than the short bus and the larry and and the blue dream was the free one the blue dream is what i got for going in so i think they said that was up either 50 or 40 58 or you know if you wanted an 82 the blue dream so said for those of you arm around there check out the sea and sand collective so uh alright without further ado we're gonna do some this Martian this long beach mean green so without further is a heady sativa I'm supposed to be so it's good trying to catch my ship here okay the taste comes out just let the smell it's got like a spicy this angle Gina said no dankness I don't say like a like a spice me with a tinge of like a melon of some time oh the melon really doesn't come through in the smoke but the spiciness does kind of like it a jak spicy in my opinion not not quite as Extreme as like the stupider OGE or for that matter just some regular Jack but if you try to know the path on top you know I'm going down here you kind of kind of will kind of get the idea of what this smells like it's a floral e spicy with um you know in the hit comes off real clean and it's got that spice to it and I can feel it it's this is a supposed to be a straight sativa it's supposed to be very little in the ten that's probably like an 8020 or something supposed to be the real deal they were really high on this stuff and this is actually one of the first rains when I got my card that i bought at the high quibble I think it might even Bend up the first training that i ever got from a hike wiggle except it wasn't long beach mean green it was just the regular marsh and lean green so um i'm happy with them i'm stoked with it i'm glad i got some more headband who knows maybe I'll shoot up I'll shoot a review up of the headband i know i've already done some headband before but I said these past couple batches of the headband have been flying out of the door to quibble the guy in fund me today in line with picking up an 8th to the eighth to the headband as well so 445 an eighth and four grams you're not going to find any better headband than this unless you're getting it you know straight from the homie this March means being is partly talking the last long i would imagine it it usually doesn't come around very often it it's a it's not it's not a way Khalid I does it produce a lot from the plant so that there's not a lot of people grow on it because you know you got a gross shitload of plants just to come up you know what you can with one plan of indica or whatever so he said if you're looking for some some really good marks and mean green Pete this is a good sativa and the headband is definitely a good end at us huh towards that man I'm I'm feeling it I'm definitely it's definitely Dominic says first smoke of the day but nice and relaxing feel Goodman so as you can tell and I can even tell him myself have kind of slowed down and I can I can actually feel my eyes dilate a little bit so [ __ ] yeah all right [ __ ] I'm a piece of [ __ ] out oh [ __ ] having happy Memorial Day to everybody and rest in peace march

up so we have some cheese hash right hey we'll just get right into it it's a sativa dominant hash it's 60/40 as it says on the label this hash is really really in small little chunks so there's not really like a big kind of piece to look at but there's um a lot of lighter colors in this I know the Lighting's not too great earlier but um it's a mostly like a light brown kind of a color when it's compressed together it gets this a lot darker looking I don't want to like you can't really see the lightness of it but it's really not as dark cuz it's coming out on the screen but the smell from this is incredible the cheese on the smell is so strong I've never smelled the hash that smells so much like the strain when it's already been turned into hash so I'm really excited to get into smokin this so I'm gonna be holding the camera ever got guests blowtorch and going on torch that [ __ ] Charlie doing work on the toy like what the [ __ ] is that go first sonic go hell yeah watching the [

bacon do you prefer that your eggs over easy or hard always scrambled oh okay yes a little bit Connie sauce Oh always the best that's always good the red names are kind of following us down a little bit over anyway if you're gonna bail I would recommend it now before the lunch rush comes in oh yes that's true you might if you bail later you'll beat the line check please [Music]", "Egwd5X3OSI0": "what up guys it is time for a bud review this is some local grown snow cat it is a very very good snow cat but it doesn't vary it trimmed up very well but yeah it isn't trimmed really well I'm gonna be trimming this up and I'm gonna be using the trimmings to make a extraction how-to video but yeah this here is the snow cap you can see the really really light orange hairs really forest green color this is a greenhouse cut of snow cap and you can see the leaves are still really long but I'm gonna show you guys these after I trim him up but I'm just showing you these before so you get an idea so what they look like before inside you could see just a real contrast between the orange and the green there's um I can't really see it there's a lot of frost coming in here actually I think there's this little mode on my camera no no that's gonna work out maybe it's gonna look like [ __ ] actually and I know this stuff by the way I don't know if you guys eat there it's really really smoky I mean smoky frosty the trikes aren't really gigantic and they're not leaping off because you know I got out there but but there's a lot a lot of crystals in here there's really wild formations I can't wait to show you these guys these when I'm done trimming them but they're really really tight nugs it smells and tastes exactly like Jack Herer if anyone knows anyone's had that before this is a good comparison for it it's definitely just a outdoor indica but it's like a Jack's counterpart pretty much like its indica version of Jack and taste and smell are basically exactly the same it's really piney and citrusy smells just like a pine forest like right when you walk into a forest of like pine trees is exactly what it smells like it's really really sweet really outdoorsy really crisp smell smells like like wintertime trees pretty much that nice wood like wet woods smell it's really really nice as you can see the leaves are still falling off under the table you still really leafy they're pretty long I'm gonna be trimming these up and yeah but I've read trim them up I'll take that all the trim and turn it into a how-to video and there'll be something else but I'll recut this video with the notes and they're all trimmed got a good bit here a few ounces of it to trim up so we should get a good bit of concentrate out of these and I can't much shade these legs when they're done because they're gonna look a lot cleaner I said trust me so cut to now okay hey guys it's getting kind of late I'm not playing any music and watch this to me but I have finished trimming the two zips this one's all trimmed up I don't have to get to see it I'm not gonna take it out of the bag these ones are all trimmed up this is my chin that got left over and you'll be seeing this guy I'm gonna be returning this to miss them oil wax butter we'll see what it turns into in another video I'm gonna make right now and offload later oh how to on pho making these are the scissors I use just super they're curved so they can kind of curve away from the plant they don't cut in too deep and they're really short so it takes a little while to cut the plans but it does a really good job as you can see before they were super overgrown now now you can see they're really really tight nice orange hairs coming through yeah I don't know if you see the crystals but it's really sparkling out there deep in there there's a lot of try coverage I didn't even know it until I started cutting these but there's an amazing amount of tri coverage inside there they just Sparkle right up when you shine light on them it's a really really really good snow cap smells really coming out now it's a lot sweeter now it's all the leaves kind of cut off lost a little bit of the paynus a lot more of the sweetness coming through and nice nice example of snow cap don't really know what else to say I kind of said a bit and the other one but we're gonna take a little snap of it right now and this stuff is super head heavy it's just a knockout head dome and just killer indica really good outdoor indica you can see these long the nugs are nice pointy really fat dense rock-hard nugs can't squeeze them at all but yeah just nice son made send me I just love the smell of this stuff you can take a small cabin trying to find a little and nugget that's why I hate about the gas bags this little snap sighs now use nice little baby Doug I left some little smaller Doug a little bit more wild because we start cutting up some more nugs he just fall apart watching a little Chicago code I'm a famous watch dude had a good openness had a great opening show shitty like second third of course show and that kind of started getting better stuff boo boo boo boo makes music it's getting kind of late took me a while to cut those legs up but I was smoking with my friends and [ __ ] a good bit just gonna put a little bit you know bullet hole took this up I'll tell ya about it so I'm really faded now I've just spoken with my friends got nice and baked homegrown snow cap [Applause] you're doing it really nice and sweet on the flavor really sweet on the flavor a lot of the Piney nish goes away in the flavor it's really most of the that's sweet aroma that comes off it that Jack Herer aroma that many very familiar with a lot of people that don't get snowcap lots looks like a California strain and releasing in other places but still caps really popular here we had jig one Jack they all kind of taste and smell the same this is spot-on just a great great snow cap really really heady feel it a lot in the top of my head it's really slows down just so real relax are nice great in the night bud and yeah some good stuff and I hope you guys like the next vid that's coming up I'm gonna making some some butane honey oil turn it and some sexy little or some butter I don't know we'll see what happens it's not gonna be a lot there's only about 4 grams of shake but forget they don't we get there so I'll

education we are TNM news [Music] hi everybody todd danged here with TM news and joining me once again my good friend shifty going for you this week of july exciting it's also my birthday as well cancers man of summer babies we get along yes that's right that's right we were made in the cold months when everyone was cuddle time haha that's right yeah i didn't even think of that yeah we were made with love that's why we're so great or warmth definitely warm made with yep yep survival right I was actually born premature so I think I should have been something else but I came out a little early so here I am a cancer got this false one my god mom made me it's like the accordion style I think I know it's perfect like and she also made me the spittin like Daisy she knows I'm a crazy plant lady so she got me this one and then a motion approaches just want me to be so fashionable course I'm reppin the plant on the plethora of others clearly and then this one which makes me feel like a total badass legal criminal I got this one that wraps around my whole face right in case I want to rob a bank this was was that this one was actually done by the illustrator that design my latest cookbook belek dishes so he did the cover and all the illustrations in it that's awesome how do you decide which one to wear where I'm going and what I'm wearing and so it's really just about fashion right right brief anybody's journeys on me yeah me neither yeah it's strange that I have some friends here in town that won't wear a mask unless you tie them up and put it on physically and then I have other friends who you know don't do anything without you know going without putting a mask on I wonder why there's such a indifference to masks why do you think people don't like wearing them so much you know some people say it's difficult to breathe and some of them are so that might be an issue but then again there's athletes that actually wear masks before commit even happens no endurance like working out so that cause stress so but then you know everybody is different you know people's body some people's lungs and the stoppable issues they can't you know you know it's more difficult for them to wear that and then you know where it's short term only when you go to the grocery store them and stay home pretty easy it's pretty easy it is pretty easy well in in Nevada they did pass a mandatory mask law that went into effect actually today so everybody has to wear a mask I know mandatory math laws are happening in the red state of Texas which was shocking for me to hear because they were all anti masks and you know Pro Liberty but and in Florida which has the biggest outbreak right now in the country no mandatory masks so it's just reaches still no mandatory masks yeah it just doesn't make any sense not a big fan of that Ron DeSantis the governor down in Florida he's a bit of a tool right not the tool that's helpful nothing like those guys like that's exactly right so uh we have been going through some education with some terms of cannabis and I know your book is coming out on the 18th coming up in just just a week and we can have right well okay so two weeks so let's talk about your book and what's inside the book because what we're gonna do is is we're going to talk about some psilocybin terms and some mushroom terms next time so it's the week before your book and then we'll prep that but today we're going to talk about more cannabis terms we got a huge response from our our show last week so I think it's only fitting that we continue with the X of cannabis but before we do let's talk about your new book and it's coming out July 18th right yeah yeah pop Dalek dishes some good some good press again happy chef teach team in the happy chef expert where I just and the boiling points with the flash points of your cooking oil because that's the thing it's the old-school way with cooking with cannabis was you just grind up your pot you throw it in batch brownies and you just bacon acids you know and like my my my time changed but this book miss delicas which is the happy chefs guide to cooking with psychedelics where I also incorporate and I educate on all different well-known psychedelics everything from hoppy stuff to combo ayahuasca to ibogaine ketamine moly ecstasy LSD with you know again diving into science you know like you know combo per se which is like medicine has della morphemes that are four thousand times stronger than on the planet naturally and like I go into how the Brazilian government actually you know protects their IP on this because there's lots of outside practitioners they will let an outside practitioners need more because it checking their IP and once you've taken these plants and these frogs and these medicines outside of their environment the medicine does change but I go into you know all the compounds just to educate people on what kind of natural medicine can be good for you I'm very I'm always I'm not a fan of Pharma I'm not that fan of any kind of synthetic medicine I use natural medicine and herbs or everything really I don't even keep aspirin in my house so I really dive a lot into that and kind of giving you guys choice you know versus go into a doc in the box because what do we call a doctor that graduated last well I'll give you a minute what are you called doctor you still call a doctor you just graduate dead last and it's still called a practice and except for you're the guinea pig that's the only thing people you know like I want everyone just yourselves educate yourself you know a diet has a big key to it which is you all it's all vegan vegetarian dishes because again natural natural medicines work better on a plant-based diet that's just like oh you stayed away from processed food which a lot of meat is processed a lot of food in general is not safe anymore it's all heavily processed and maybe lab and I have a hard time believing that something that cost millions and billions of dollars to develop in the lab it's actually considered food so I mean what happened to the plant what happen to grown every time yeah no I agree I agree I'm a big fan I I'm uh I eat a vegan lifestyle as well and I I what happened was was six billion people on the planet and you know how to feed six billion people you know there's not really enough land to grow enough food in order to feed six billion people and you know we know that because there's millions of people still starving right and that's why GMOs were created because they had to feed more people I don't agree with it I agree with what you're saying is that you know something in a box or a can usually isn't that good for you and has very little food actual nutrition you know in it so if you go to the grocery store and you have to read what's on the box chances are it's not really even food and the reason why there's so much of food like that and so much fast food it's all pricing because you know organic food is expensive right and you know getting fresh good greens and and green and plant food is expensive it's much cheaper to feed your family with McDonald's you know a family pack than it is to buy even just one stalk of broccoli right so it's it's sad that we would rather spend money on doctors and pharma than on food that's the keys we will all spend the last penny that's right I always wondering I like to stay on the outer rim of the grocery store I kind of got taken away I think it was like the forties was as possible for that you know stupid mama to work so we had TV dinners that were too much fun there but um and I go berry islands I've also cooked with the common lot tones that go in there's active compounds and then I go into psilocybin which mushrooms all mushrooms are magical we just first say that way all of them are magical oh they're Bionic like how they work with the neurotransmitters in your body that creates their that your serotonin levels so they literally make you happy they literally pallet keep your mood balance and this that's all mushrooms that's not even just the you know the trippy came it's all missions and I go into all of those those compounds and potencies and also teaching you that the maths and formulas and how to work with those cannabis and psilocybin and I actually found it humorous because when I started writing this book three years ago just from you know my own personal Rd and my own work in research in cannabis and and in psilocybin and growing in my ecology and I found that the two worked very well together and it's mainly because there's terpenes which are mainly in cannabis but they're also many other plants like that's one over 200 species of plants but also in fungi so it's like all these plans work well together so food is your medicine and plants are medicine so it's like I work with always of natural healing and teaching you how to medicate yourself and dust yourself properly and mainly in the my producing way is the way that I prefer on everything you know I do you know I do like to smoke a joint every once in a while which is not that's not Mike reducing but Mike reducing so Simon I found to be very beneficial and I go into a lot of that and also teach you a lot of fun planting recipes to get you there and it's an autobiography cookbook so I go into you know what you know IQ from where I'm from from Virginia I moved out west to work in cannabis and pursue a dream and publishing a cookbook and you know also share with you guys some tales from the trip which are uh we're singing I did there a nut Tales from the Crypt guys tells from the trip you are definitely the pun queen everything so I gave you all the cliff notes July 18th make sure you check out these website at or ennoble decom it'll also be Amazon and I'm sure it'll be flying off the shots gonna be a trip taking I see what you did there it's a mush rush that's right that's right well that's exciting right yeah that's right July 18th look for chef B's book coming out to Amazon and I'm sure you've all been to Amazon before you simply type in that happy chef or chef D or edible D or D rustle and any of that stuff and it all come right up alright so moving along to more cannabis terms we got another twelve term so people understand about cannabis you know we talked about it last week now you know sometimes you're in the conversation these days and you know someone who's been in the cannabis space knows what a lot of these terms mean and if you're new to the cannabis space you know words like decarboxylation and endocannabinoid system just don't make any sense and and sometimes people are you know embarrassed or afraid to ask the question of what does all that mean so that's why D and I are here is to help you so you feel more comfortable with the plant and you feel more comfortable talking about the plant learning about the plant and like I've always said a hundred times is that a good education always makes for good legislation the more we know the more we know how to legislate so it's important to really understand about the plant so last time we were together we went through the bees and got all the way through the ease and that leaves us to the s and because you are female and the client is female our first word is feminization nation right so yeah this one's for the lady so d want you take feminization and tell the folks what that is females because everything that she's smoked is female is that not correct that is to 100% correct yes absolutely yes usually in the in the grow room the first thing you do when the plant gets about this eye is check for the females and check for the males and what do you do you kill all the males that's right in order to make the plant more potent okay we're working off numbers and I appreciate the numbers being high in forms of extraction because it helps me do my job better and also hurts yourself so in order to get the flower to produce more higher potencies you have to feed it everything it needs but you deprive it from sex because it's kind of like a woman once I give birth to a child I have given my powers to the child so once the male has seated the female the potency levels drop and it creates seeds giving parts of his power away to its seedlings so in order to keep the plant but at its highest potency you feed a lot of sunlight give it a lot of co2 like crack to the plant get them to grow all big and like get all trippy and smelly grown towards the light leaving the men far far away and then and then we harvest them and then there you go there's your joint ways and Jonah that's the joint that's right that is the joint and it's all done by female plans so feminization like Dee said is just making sure that your plants stay women right now and on our change does that plan scan her me very very good and weeding out the men that's right and her me just so for those of you who don't know that means hermaphrodite and that means that the plant has both sex organs and then doesn't do anything and gets all confused doesn't know how to flower and doesn't produce buds the way a female plant produces bud so again in a cultivation room you kill all the males and watch for the hermaphrodite to happen and if it does you also have to remove those plants as well and then suddenly it's expensive so feminization very very important to a grow room to keep your plants female moving right along with another f-word flavonoids you know you work with flavonoids a lot because you cook a lot and you you definitely like how things smell how things look and frack - hello slab annoy a signifi with the color of sunflowers and the red the red hue tomatoes and like syrup flavonoids flavonoids and terpenoids waiting on this are both in all other plants but cannabinoids are only found in cannabis right so that that's kind of the the difference there but more pronounced they are you know part of the scent and flavor and hue color identifiers of the plant yeah that's exactly right and and the ones that are in cannabis are called canna Flavin's right and like B was saying they play a very important role in how the plant looks how it smells much like the terpenes and that's really how you tell the difference between the different strains the cannabinoid is a cannabinoid is a cannabinoid right but it's the terpenes and the flavonoids that make the differences in the plant so if anyone ever asks you you know what a flavonoid is now you know all right now you know right and one of the f words that we use all the time not the one you're thinking of flower flower and for those of you who don't know you know you you think that marijuana makes flowers like a typical sunflower or rose or a daisy but that's not what it is right what's a what's a what's a cannabis flower D my my two female plant and holes the trichomes and all the medicinal compounds of the planet is what we extract to basically remove the plant matter in order to get the medicine so flowers are very important very important in fact it's the flower that gets you high it's the flower that makes you well it's the the manipulation of all of the chemicals that are in the flower that make all of these things possible so so the flower is the bud in its simplest term it is the bud of what you know when you break it apart and roll it in a joint you're rolling the flower that's the classification because so it is actually its own class now because everything you smoke is flower and unless it's concentrated it's flower and it comes from females well there you all the good stuff that's right well last week we spoke about broad spectrum today we're gonna talk about full spectrum another f-word right what's the difference between broad spectrum and full spectrum spectrum which is THC my initials I know they left me out of that bull spectrum is all the good stuff plus th same stuff they included me on that one said you know now that's a good key it's to teach everybody is because knowing the difference between broad spectrum and full spectrum allows you to better select your medicine especially for those that don't like the psychoactive compounds of THC because that's that's where that's where the munchies is the higher the THC levels the more psychoactive and psychedelic plant is if it's better less with CBD it's counter and it's less psychoactive and again like the potencies will go down but if it's broad spectrum THC is completely removed so if you don't want THC and you don't want any of the psychoactive compounds go broad-spectrum if you want all the good stuff get the full dose be good that's right that's exactly right and the good stuff what she means there is all of the cannabinoids all of the terpenes all the flavonoids that we just talked about all of the fatty acids and all of the wonderful things that we don't even know about right that are still being produced by this plant so that's full spectrum again it is all of the compounds put together and including the THC well that does it for the apps right we missed that one off to the Gees genotype it's a good G word and it's not it's not different Italian guys named Gino that's not what a genotype is right a genotype is really the genetic building blocks that the plant was created from specifically you know which genes are isolated and combined to create the genetic makeup now if you walk through a cultivation room you'll see different strains well those different strains are really different genotypes of plants right a ak-47 or a Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] or a blue dream right they're all different they all start with different genes just like you have a different gene that that cats have for instance right so so genotyping is really again the the genes that are used to create the genetic building blocks of that plant genotype and very often you know a lot of you know amateur breeders have created the plethora of strain names that are out there but if you break them down there's only you know really you know a dozen or so main strains and everything else is an option meaning that they all started with the same genetic building blocks cannabis kind of got to be numbers like oysters oysters you just like if you have your own like bed and you just put it say put Pease like you know Prince Edward boys right there you can name them whatever the hell you want extent because as Todd just said almost it's all about the compounds we used to focus on sativas and indicas and then hydrogen steam is keep you really awake and indica is making it asleep and hybrid as well actually has nothing to do with the couch so it has to do with again there's genotypes across we were talking about it here to teach you and educate electing your medicine because strain names look at confusing and for sure I said all about the compounds that's right always look at the certificate of analysis so you see the cannabinoid profiling and the terpene profiling and then determine what you want don't really go by you know the names of plants because more often than not it is not what you're expecting and and somebody either just named it that's right somebody either just named it what they wanted or they named it what was popular in order to sell it all right moving on age another G word germination germination is key it's literally the start of the plant cycle you know it's when to see yep that's right as soon as this seed pops and you see a little piece of green coming out of that that is germination so very often you know you don't take a seed and you put the seed into the dirt very often you'll put the seed across like a wet paper towel and then put another wet paper towel on top of it in just to get the little seed to pop out you know the little green garter that's right that's right and that's what germination is is really getting the seeds started for planting and it is crucial because all seeds don't germinate all seeds don't grow some grow short some grow tall you know and that's just nature that's right but it is the beginning of the genotype that's exactly right is the very very beginning of life hash is our first h h word and that is short for hashish famous from Turkey back in the day and if you remember the old movie Midnight Express where Billy was was smuggling hash from Turkey and then finally got caught and did like 25 years in a Turkish prison so don't do that Billy Hayes actually is a friend of mine he's the guy who who that movie was about and was the guys smuggling the hash he's actually he has a show now a he has a one-man show where he goes around and does this this performance about his whole experience about getting caught with the hash and then spending 20 years in a Turkish prison and then and then finally escaping and if you haven't seen the movie check out Midnight Express it's back in the late 70s I believe but it is the life story of Billy Hayes but anyway so what does hash be concentrated material it's actually more potent than flour is how she smoked in the hashish it's like old school way of doing it but you know that they basically take all the trichomes NamUs build them into these little balls cakes and you just take a little crumbles of that you smoke a hashish ma yes very popular in Europe and very popular in all the way it's smoking many people actually prefer it so I wish that I wish the hash game out here was a little bit good hashish I here now you know that there used to be these hash balls that we used to test at the lab that were really good I was I was a big fan but I'm not sure if they make them anymore you know and I don't know why yeah they it is really hard to find and maybe because it's difficult to make in it's a you know it's just a long process and you know making extracts are just so much easier you know then extracting the powder pressing it together whereas extraction we just throw everything to a machine and then it is definitely old-school but if you can find some mash in your area it is a really great concentrated cannabis product and you have to concentrate less I don't know what that means yes many people don't know but hemp is also cannabis it is in the cannabis family it is part of the cannabis genome if you will and the one difference between him and what you're smoking as Pont is the lack of Delta 9 THC now the definition of him is it any cannabis plant with less than 0.3 percent THC but that's not really accurate because those plants are just high CBD cannabis plants right they're not really him it's hemp fiber which kind of looks like bamboo almost and kind of grows similarly to a bamboo and fiber is the stuff that they make plastics and paper and sales and rope and Carrboro all of that stuff concrete in crete and literally over 700 active compounds including cannabinoids and terpenoids every bit of the plant is useful it does no bad to the environment and the crops and agriculture when you're turning crops you can't grow the same crop one plant next to bamboo that you can actually grow multiple that's right and because of him because the hemp roots go so deep into the earth the hemp actually kills the soil for the farmer and exactly what these said it's correct you don't have to rotate crops when you're growing in because the not only does it put the nutrients in there but this the roots are so strong and it goes so deep it moves the soil around and it tells the soil for the farmer so you can literally harvest and then replant so a very useful plant and it is in the cannabis family known as cannabis sativa L scientifically and what we wouldn't mention this earlier we talking about sativas and indicas which really is not the best way to classify plants anymore but what's a hybrid you mentioned a hybrid earlier Oh two genotypes have completely opposite you know characters or compounds and then you make a baby you make a baby a lot of them like to blend the heavy indica dominant strange or the heavies Teva dominant strains and blend those together and make a baby again it to me I'm just looking at the compound so like I'm looking at the pregnancy levels of what terpenes not boys are in there you know and that's how I know how it's gonna affect me if it has high baby carrier that's what I look at but hybrids is another class not indica straight dominant or it could be are labeled dominance on face steep and dominant in a good nominee for the hybrids rather than just be in a full class of a cannabis indica where it's cannabis sativa they usually name name one as dominant and pretty much whatever ones in the compounds take hold there is usually what happens that's right that's exactly right so hybrid is uh you know it's really based in due to crossbreeding you know taking one plant mixing it with another plant making a baby and then grow in that plan and see what happens that is a hybrid now a way to grow I'm sure you've heard the term before it's called hydroponics yeah that's right growing plants without soil you're saying how is that possible Todd well it's simple because the the roots they float in water right and that's right so the water is here then the roots drink up the water until it goes a little low and then the roots grow a little longer in order to reach the water in order to feed themselves and one of the advantages of growing hydroponically is that you deliver the nutrients directly to the plant so the plant doesn't have to go searching the soil to find bam treants it's little bit in this so you have more control in a commercial setting is what is what we believe because you don't have to recycle your soil you know the soil isn't soaking up the nutrients that are meant to go to the plant so one does have more control in a hydroponic round but it's grown a scale yeah that's exactly right so hydroponic is simply a way to grow cannabis or any plant really without any soil and hydro obviously meaning water now here's that I word our first I word we were just talking about indica right and like we were talking about before you know the two different you know scientific names for cannabis was cannabis sativa and cannabis indica but really it's been because sativas have really been bred out over the years everything is really indica dominant or I should say most everything about 90 to 95% because indica traditionally has higher THC and over the years all of these amateur breeders over the last hundred years I always try to get the higher THC higher THC higher THC because that's what sells that's what's in the market that's what people want it's not really what's important about the plan but a lot of people like to get high and that's what's important so over time it's the sativa that has been bred out of all of these genomes that we were talking about earlier and it's very difficult to find a sativa only plant these days because of all the crossbreeding that has happened over the last 100 years or so you know unless you're in Afghanistan or China or Russia you know where cannabis grows wild or in Africa right well it just grows wild it's very difficult to find a sativa only plant so even if you walk into a dispensary and they say Oh what do you prefer the Indigo or the Skiba you can't really trust that again like Dee said make sure you look at the profiling from the certificate of analysis you see the cannabinoids you see the terpenes and that will tell you you know what is in that plant the difference between indica and sativa really doesn't matter and really isn't accurate these days yeah and finally isolate is isolate isolate that's when you isolate it compounds see what you did there especially the world we like to use isolate make sure that we've isolated the absolutely Mendel tonight in there we did it's a form of extraction that kind of takes it down to power kind of resembles the street drug cocaine however it's not water soluble we have to act just like everything else but when we do but it makes it easier to add into your topicals and your stabs and your edibles but it again you've isolated CBD out of plants so there's no residuals of THC in there so it is a safer way for the consumer to get to know what they're getting so if you guys look at a CBD package and it says it should be completely safe military of a government job that you guys can't test for THC or any of that look for CBD isolate versus honest a versus broad spectrum a full spectrum because nowadays they just label everything however the hell they want yeah I think isolate is going to be the way that all cannabis will be delivered over time like he was saying that it is a really much easier when you have the one ingredient of an isolate so you know exactly what it is it could be 99% CBD and you know exactly what it is there's they take all of the other stuff out and I believe that that's the way that all of these consumer products goods makers will add it to their plants and ir-2 their products and I also believe that it will be sold as a commodity over time you know like soybean like coffee and stuff like that so isolate again is it's an extracted compound it comes in a powdered form and like that guys well there you go and trust me it's CB it's CBD I do the other stuff a white powder looks just like this you can actually you know some CBD companies like American green right here and on literally on the ingredients list it says CBD isolate just to keep you guys a check what we also have the CBD Islip sold by itself for you guys to cook with at home so this this white powder would be the isolate and this would be the full-spectrum extract concentrate which we talked to you guys about in the last show on the last episode well we just talk about full spectrum just a minute ago that's right so there you go yeah we saw that alright that takes us to the end of our terms for this week we will pick up on the Jays I wonder I think joint will be the first for Jay that's a really good idea so next week we're going to talk about Dee's book we're gonna get in detail about what it's all about and we're gonna go through some psychedelic terms so you understand what exactly right and then then we'll come back to following week and finish with more stuff about the cannabis plant we've got about another 30 or so words to go through to make sure that you understand what this business is all about certainly and what all the words mean when you're in that conversation with you know somebody who is in the pot business so uh it is fourth of July week and II make sure you be safe make sure you stay indoors make sure you wear your fourth of July mask very high saving me on makeup I don't that's right at 20 I stopped shaving a little while ago so it hides all my old miss when I put my mask on you wear a great mask there D and you look very patriotic alright so check out these she is a cannibal D on all the social networks you can check her out edible D calm she is very active on her Instagram account very active on her Facebook check her out she's also uh or should I say she is always pumping out lots of really great knowledge that you should know if you want to learn more about the cannabis plant same thing will do here on TM news on a pretty regular basis so d any last words don't be a dick you know this is it's my birth month it's also plastic free July okay so on your journey to plastic free we aren't putting so many like so so much microplastics and classics are in the oceans it's killing a lot it's actually being found out on our food they actually say they've done studies to find out we're actually consuming a credit card a week just in our food that we're eating and consuming so plastic problems is a huge problem so like July is plastic free month so try to steer clear of you single-use plastics use a reusable grocery bag and say no two straws they need plastic straws when you're going anywhere to eat there's also there's tons of like great companies like I said buy a water bottle get one of these swell bottles these things are amazing especially because they keep my water cold all day hundred eleven degrees outside right now and I can leave this in my car so usually usable water is this tons of companies like you can get like this is made out of bamboo again completely biodegradable or reusable it's the toothbrush and then there's also you can kick the tube I did and this is a bite it is super cool new toothpaste that comes in a pellet that you just put in your mouth and it cracks you up and into a paste and there you go you can brush your teeth now a cooler than it within a tube of toothpaste but there's so many different options like eco-friendly options that you can just make several changes in yourself and just say no to plastic straws and plastic grocery bags you're already doing a huge huge thing for the huge good things so be sure to be more cautious and conscious about how much classic you're using and try to work in some plastic free switch ups in your home really really good advice and over time I think when hemp takes over all of the corn farms here in the United States will have hemp options for all of our plastic cups these days like a toothbrush and everything else that we use plastic it's funny if you if you literally try to go without plastic for a day or a week or whatever you'll see how difficult that really is and how dependent we are on plastic but I think he said it best when she started this whole thing with don't be a dick right I don't find a beautiful waterfall and have to pick up someone else's trash I have to do that every be cautious be conscious about how much plastic you're using like Todd said you'll actually realize how much you're using just by going to the grocery store when you when you go and you get your avocados tomatoes everything you're getting a small plastic bag say no to those just put it in I mean but they all have this little sticker on there anyway you can do an look all the colors can do that so just start making subtle changes get some cute bags you know be authentic you know where your brand or whatever in a grocery bag and you know market yourself you know what do that and wear your masks don't wear your masks don't be a dick adhi work she is edible d the happy ship chef t she got like eight names but you could always find her right here on TM news and always find her at edible be calm at edible D on all of the social networks my

at this new box they're all black now every single box they have now is black bother other ones we the other ones I used to have the long ones there those are gone has a shiny paint vapes label in the front at the top at the bottom and also a ding dings official account all organic no propylene glycol it does shine as well and guys you have to be able to feel this bump out from the box as well as the name in the name in the back it has to bump out you can see the C cell has like a laminate shine it is 93 point 43 percent THC still has a story on the back I'll put that down in the description below and also sorry my nose a little bit runny been kind of sick it has like a light watermelon slice like you can just see the little emblem on there you probably can't see it on here get this oil still has this the round plasti tip at the top and to seal at the bottom if it doesn't have a seal already being used it is cease okay percussion a CA 4 7 8 serial number my camera probably won't catch it I'll just put an image burning it on my battery but to me is probably the best concentrate battery out there I also burn it at a 3.3 volts I would recommend it instead of burning your all the two on the high voltage just keep it on the lowest one which is three point three for me but if you can't just three point six is fine I just don't do it because it burns my oil to quit let me prime this bad boy all right off the bat Bing babes literally what you put on the front is what this is tasting like it tastes just like watermelon guys like if you went to the farmers market bought a watermelon came home cut it up and ate a slice it does for some reason have a great flavor a very light grape flavor in it but I don't know why it's there I don't know if they try to get it to the flavor to get it more like spot-on or what but I taste great for some reason okay just like watermelon guys just like the fruit the only thing is that light grape flavor I don't know if it's just me but I taste it like it's there and if you were to go to the store I don't know if you ever seen it it was these little watermelon candies that have like the shape of a slice it literally tastes just like that and it's delicious like spot-on flavor ten out of ten off the rip hi I feel it a little bit not too much I'm up I'm woke I'm happy it's probably a sativa like hybrid sativa I'm not sure I don't think the box says it either let me see oh it's an indica strain well I don't feel tired yet it's probably gonna feel it later when I'm hitting it during the day but let's see let me feel it hi again down strong okay my chest is killing me for right now it killed my chest now I'm really feeling it I feel tired I feel really lazy and tired at the moment like the coffee in the big hit I just took it got me it's an indica first I wasn't feeling it now I am it's really delicious though the hi guys ten out of ten I don't give them ten out of ten down often usually eight seven sometimes this one is a ten out of ten I'm really feeling it like I'm baked this is this is like a high that I get for like pacing like a blender teeth in two hits that's crazy really good if you can if your plug has it or if you can get your hands on it I definitely recommend it ten out of ten on everything the oil has to look right look at this if it's dark and it doesn't look go to guys don't buy it's fake they can probably just be swapping the tanks the real tanks in the box for a fake thing you have to be looking out for that also serial numbers see a serial number - four seven eight yours probably can be the same or different keep an eye on that like I said it goes I have way more videos coming up just stay tuned [Music]", "fgKCFP11JQI": "welcome to the elk chalk podcast with Randy Newberg and

technical clothing world John Barlow he was John you were just heading out on a big British Columbia hunt last time we hooked oh that's right that's right yeah and you got to bring that up huh I'm sorry it was a grand adventure I will tell you that was a big adventure well that's part of the fun ongoing right your side but last time we talked about synthetics versus merino and then we got into sleeping bags synthetics purses downs I did I tell you this I went out and bought a synthetic sleeping bag the next day after a lot yes I did Wow you talked me into it so maybe you should be in sales instead of the technical product design part no that's after by way of introduction folks if you go listen to that podcast they can't remember which one it is but John your title at Sitka is what big game product manager big game product manager yeah really he's the mad scientist if you go over where he and Eric are at over at headquarters it's like the skunk works it is I call it yeah oh yeah and anyhow after you were on last time everybody not everybody but we got so many emails saying hey I want to know a little bit more about outer layers and membranes and whoa weather waterproof versus DWR for rain gear and in other shells so I don't know if that's something you're wanting to talk about today yeah anytime I can try to enlighten or educate the consumer I'm I'm all about that cool well I can't guarantee I'm gonna do that but I'll give it a shot last time I think I told you talking synthetic and merino and down vers synthetic insulations like talking politics and religion at a cocktail party right not advised yeah but everything called the smart guy so let's get but it's just you and I if they get mad they're gonna get mad at okay so Cory was supposed to be here with us folks but Cory was suffering serious ailments the last few days and we told him stay home but I just got a text saying oh no I'll be there I'll be there later today so we don't have Cory here so we can pick on him all we want all right um well this is such a great show I know why he's gonna make it you know I mean you hate the missus yeah Joe and it's growing it's amazing that's growing every year yeah people here are our audience you know the the type of people that we touch are here and in big numbers in Salt Lake so it's it's good for us to come here and promote our public land message in our self-guided message and yeah we're fortunately folks we're here we got John an hour before the show actually opens so this is going to be the most quiet podcast of all the ones we do today I'm pretty sure of that so but with that let's jump right into outer layers so I go to Alaska a lot Southeast Alaska it's it's not quite as bad as where you hung out in Alaska up in Kodiak but outer layers you always get people say well I want 100% waterproof quiet layer yeah of rain gear is it possible physik if they do the laws of physics allow it to a point to a point but there's always a given to take okay right so you can make you can make something quiet or quieter yeah and make it a hundred percent waterproof so we have something in our line called the Thunder head yep so that's that's a three layer in that case gore-tex but it's got a quiet face on it quiet as we can make it yeah but I wouldn't recommend that layer for a backpack hunter so what I mean by that is somebody is going to go out multiple days spend time in a tent and maybe inclement weather because what you're giving up by having that quiet face is it's always gonna be a little heavier yeah and maybe a little more take up a little more room and you pack yeah and then that face is going to be prone to attracting debris yeah it's not necessarily always going to be as durable but then ultimately that face even though that you theoretically won't get wet or the garment won't absorb the water the face of them will and it'll get heavy and then it'll get heavier all right and so I think so I forgot one of your leading questions we'll get into this but when you have water sitting on the face of a any kind of waterproof laminate yeah it it really drastically starts to cut down on breathability okay so there's it's a spec I would call that a specialized piece not something I would recommend for a backpack on it the other thing I forgot to throw in there is people also say I want it to weigh 6 ounces yeah yes ok that no that is a possible current currently with what we were dealing with and and you know it's uh because obviously as hunters we want or we seek to get as quiet a garments as Rihan yeah but it's also you know unless like what my whitetail cohort Chris did with some of the whitetail stuff coming out next year and actually proved it with science of sound it's an opinion so one you know it might be acceptable quiet for you but not acceptable quiet for somebody else so no right now it's really tough to make something what I would call acceptable quiet to the masses in a super lightweight package that I would feel comfortable saying yeah you can go out for multiple days or 10 days in your case maybe on a sheep hunt yeah and and take that garment it's just so I haven't seen anything yet okay so because with your product line I mean I end up with the storm front as my versatile if Hurricane Katrina is coming on in I'm gonna stand right there with that product it's super breathable super durable I mean I look at the places I go in Alaska the The Devil's club and everything else and it just do it holds up it just keeps performing so and then I have some of some other lightweight items where maybe in August or September when you get those afternoon Thunder burst something super super lightweightt yeah just all I need is it to work for about ten minutes right in repeal and I'll be back off and running again yeah if you're going into those what I like to call dynamic weather environments that those Alaska Canadian even New Zealand type of environments I mean you have to have the best rain gear quite frankly you can afford because that is literally your first layer of protection from the elements you know from snow from wind from rain you don't want it to leak you want it to be durable and ideally for the money you're gonna spend you want it to last more than you know one trip or even one season you know I have guides wearing the storm front that you mentioned and they're getting two and three years out of it and spending 200 days a year in the field so today I feel real comfortable saying you know for for you know the the hunter that's spent in 30 or 45 days in the field he's going to get he's going to get tired of the jacket or the pant before it wears out yeah and that's you know you mentioned the BC moose hunt but just because of the weather we had you know I was wearing that it's actually updated for 2019 and it is that means I get a new pair yeah I come over to this network's lab yeah we reduce some weight increase the breathability and durability it's really cool so let's talk quickly brought up a really cool point there breathability because yeah when I go to Alaska a lot of times I see people who take what they're wearing when they're commercial fish in there right rubber PVC type right rain gear and my experience is that stuff doesn't breathe as well as I'd like it if I'm gonna be climbing up to the Alpine through the jungle brush from the coast right well in a pluralities that's not what you mentioned isn't gonna breathe it all yeah I mean it's essentially rubberized you know cotton in a lot of cases or something along those lines but so how do you get breathability yeah so not not to go too in depth but essentially you have this membrane most cases are in our case it's just basically Teflon right that's that stretch and has little holes in it and the holes are large enough for for moisture to move through from the inside out but not large enough for raindrops to work their way in and it it's not it's not just as easy as that laminate there's a lot of things that go with it so you put a face textile which you see on the outside so that provides durability and then you apply a DWR of some type so that's durable water repellent finish so those are the things that make it the snow or rain bead and run off so it doesn't absorb those those that that moisture and that's something you have to retreat over time yeah and then you normally have a backer we call it on the inside again to kind of protect that laminate so those three things that sandwich like it's really it's really quite detailed how you pick all those things in different weights and etc to give the best performance to that that membrane in the middle and in this you know in our case it's gore-tex but and so that membrane is the ticket to breathability it is but I I see you're given a qualifier here yeah well what I want to say is it's not so I like to say that the hunter needs to be an active participant in this event and and what I mean by that is I can sell you a jacket and I can tell you what does all these things but it really behooves the the hunter to educate themselves on how and why it works so that when they're in the field they can modify or adjust what they're doing to get the best performance out of the jacket so what I mean by that is if I put a storm front jacket on me and you and we start not that you and I are going to do this but let's argue mouths we say we're 20 years younger and we're gonna start running up the mountain okay and I'm not gonna do that so at a certain point you were gonna overwhelm that rain layer and if you can imagine there's only those holes are only so large there's only so many of them so only so many can get through at a time molecules of moisture correct it all accuse of moisture and it's going to overwhelm it and it's going to start building up on the inside while everybody's trying to get out you know the door the concert hall so to speak so at that point the hunter has to understand that and regulate his pace to not overwhelm the system right to not sweat and I call it a vicious cycle this is a whole rabbit hole we could go to later but I'm into rabbit abut so what are you doing when you're overwhelming that system you're not only gonna get wet from the inside out like literally you're gonna make yourself wet with your own sweat but you're also now dehydrating yourself prematurely so it starts to send you down this put it like I say this vicious circle where you know maybe if you don't hydrate and you keep pushing like it's going to you know lead maybe to some bad things so instead of running up the mountain we would regulate our pace and hike up at a reasonable pace to not sweat and then that moisture is going to move through because and I've said this in the past but I really can't overstate this that your body let's say it's always 98.6 so your body is the engine your body is the heat source mm-hmm that is going to push these these water this moisture these water molecules right out so it's going to be pushed out and seek this balance this equilibrium and so almost inevitably it's not 98.6 outside so it's going to want to move through in your body the we call it the temperature gradient right your body is the heat is going to push that moisture through so if all of a sudden you get to you know we're running and it's a hundred and two now inside that garment and there's only so many spots for the molecules to go through it's going to get overwhelmed so when people wear and I saw it a lot in Alaska and I'm guessing you have to now because you mentioned it but when people wear like a Grund ins or some PVC coated cotton it doesn't breathe at all like there's literally no no holes for the moisture to move through right so I mean I personally don't feel that that is a smart decision but because I know a little bit and and let's say that's all I had I could regulate my pace and I could put layers on underneath to somehow let's say mitigate right the the lack of performance of that garment so a lot of times what you see with people well at least I saw with people that were doing that is they would just literally run around in their base layer underneath that PVC coated ring here because they knew they were going to get wet they knew they were gonna get hot but again all you're doing is prematurely dehydrating yourself and you know are you going a tenday sheep hunt like you don't need to kind of pace yourself and not burn out the first day or two because you want you know maybe that opportunity you're gonna get is on day ten yeah so I don't know I kind of I'm a little all over the board but there's there's a lot there's a lot that goes into it and I think that like it's I've just I've called it my crusade but if you know if I can help educate hunters to understand what's going on and why it's going on then they can then modify or regulate what they're doing at that point in time to get the best performance out of whatever system they're wearing got it well that's for me as somebody who hunts in all different conditions I anymore I'm such a wuss I try not to hunt in the rain oh yeah at that but you go to certain places you're just hunting in the rain you just know it I mean it yeah we did Sitka black-tailed in the southeast last August and it was torrential what does it get like an average of five hundred inches in year same if it rained is hard twice a twice a week as it did for the week we were there yeah I mean Tyler Johnson was one of the camera guys yeah yeah we just batten down the hatches and Tyler he said you know I don't think I've ever been in anything this torrential for this long and so when you're in vegetation - right so yeah not like you like you're just constantly in it yeah and it's steep really really steep country so it's exerting and you got every kind of deadfall dirt - good limb every Devil's club grabbing at you so you need that makes of durability yeah breathability and it just it's an application that those pieces work fantastic those uh those alder and salmon berry jungles that I don't know if I was the first one in the world to coin the term but I'll take credit for it I should make t-shirts and I just say hike angry it's like channel your inner piece like just hike angry because first time I remember the first time I was going up I actually ended up killing my biggest black tail ever on that trip but I remember going up a slope through alder and being so humbled when I realized that there was literally vegetation that I could not get through like I literally had to find a way around it and you're like you've got to be kidding you've got to be on our way off the mountain we could hear the waves crashing on the beach yeah and we're way up there but I guess before maybe 300 feet elevation is all above it but takes forever and I pickin our way through there and finally when you say hunt angry this is what makes me laugh about it as Tyler says screw this and I just hear this busting and thrashing and falling and finally I hear way down there I made it in a tone of I'm not sure if it was worth it but I did it I got hit with a thousand baseball bat but go ahead know you I was gonna say but there's one other thing I want to I want to mention because people have sometimes people have unrealistic expectations of what what a product can do and so you know another thing that that I say is there is no Superman's cape and what I mean by that is you can buy you know our product you can buy another brands product it doesn't matter but there's no product in the world that you can just put on and expect it to do everything for you right so it's not going to help you hike up the mountain it's not going to you know keep you warm if you you have to understand and have a little bit of education and and go out and try it a little bit so the environment you mentioned in southeast when you have a really humid environment that you're operating in let's say in that case I would I would argue that if it wasn't a hundred percent humidity it was really close right in a very high dew point so I talked about the moisture inside the garment that you're creating wants to go through and seek this equilibrium or stasis yeah if it's a hundred percent humid on the outside in the environment you're working in mmm-hmm there's a little there's a little push from your from your temperature but the molecules don't really need to go anywhere because it's a hundred percent humid on the outside so there's like it I'm also a man exactly so that that that that gradient is so much lower now and again if you understand that as a hunter and go well why isn't this Gortex jacket you know just crushing it and moving all this moisture again you need to understand and be an active participant in this activity and say you know what it's super humid out the dew points crazy high the efficiency of this system is is is restrictive because of that I need to I need to change what I'm doing or how I'm doing it yeah conversely if we're going and let's say the weather clears let's say we're up on a sheep hunt we're at some elevation it clears it's really cold and dry all of a sudden that garmet just starts moving moisture like a champ yeah right so again I understand that maybe I can pick up my pace or whatever the case may be but that's why people sometimes say well this jacket isn't working okay well there's a series of questions you have to start asking people yeah to really drill drill down and say okay what's happening here for those of us who took their first two years of engineering like I did we took these classes called heat and mass transfer and it talks I mean he transfers just like moisture transfer so you're telling me you're an accountant and an engineer well I heard a prize my first time years of engineer and then I went I went to this place called Arizona State University and then within two years I was on academic probation so why were you hunting too much I was the dove and quail hunting was unbelievable plus the other extracurricular activities were probably more than oh hey hillbilly from northern Minnesota was prepared for I could go into more details but we won't I don't want to ruin Brandon and all the wonderful companies make this possible I don't want to ruin it all at one time so but let's just say you're an active participant yes I was aware of the surroundings and I was active actively participated maybe too much but know that it really is a lot about that in reaching that equilibriums of the internal temperatures and humidity and dew points are similar to what the externals are you're not gonna have the trapars is the simple way is that but so cold weather outer layers I'm yeah everybody knows my elk hunting uniform is your Jetstream jacket it's got wind stopper in it right tell me what is wind stopper yeah so I'm glad you mentioned this because I truly feel that wind stopper is the most underrated technology in the outdoor space as a whole I I agree you guys sent me back to your gore-tex sessions back your headquarters in where is it Delaware yeah yeah and all your PhD engineer guys come out and talk about this and instantly I said that Windstopper stuff now I know I that works so well but yeah so essentially just in a real basic form because people say well what's the difference between a wind stopper and a gore-tex and and there's there's several things one of which is is the way the laminate is is made and the other is that sandwich I talked about how it's put together yeah but but essentially the holes are larger in that in that Teflon to allow again it's providing you bigger doors to get that moisture out there but again it's still preventing or giving you a barrier from that wind right to can to cut down on convective heat loss but the sandwich is made in such a way that the entire thing is built to be breathable so it's not just the laminate in the middle it's the face it's the backer together but why I feel that it's an underrated technology as people say well I'll just going to put on my gore-tex jacket and I'm not going to spend the money to buy whatever wind stopper jacket so in your case the Jetstream where I would argue that my wind stopper garment is my 90 or 95 percent solution there and I only need to put a gore-tex jacket on when it's raining so hard that it's starting to compromise that system or you know I'm a big fan of our mountain jacket so it doesn't have a hood so if I need a hood then I go to my gore-tex jacket but I can keep a steadier pace I can move moisture better I can be drier all these things regulate my temperature far better with a wind stopper product than a gore-tex product so if you're going into the mountains you have to have rain gear because there's nothing that's that's going to protect you better than that but 90% of the time I'm gonna well 100% of the time I'm going to have a wind stopper layer with me and there's a couple we have so you can pick and choose but I'm always going to take that but 90% of the time that's what I'm wearing so you know you're sitting there on a glassy knob the wind comes up yeah you can put on a puffy layer but a lot of times I just have that that wind stopper jacket on whatever it is yeah it cuts that wind that's all I need and then I can hiking it I don't have to take on and off jackets as often I think it's a really and and I probably haven't done a great job of maybe promoting and educating people just on the technology but I mean you have a wind stopper vest on right now like it is an amazing piece for his lighter weight as you can get and as little insulation as you can provide people you know maybe they don't realize it just having that win taken off your core in this case of you wearing the vest is it all it needs to keep your body at a steady temperature or to throw your collar up like you have right now to keep the wind off your neck it's an amazing thing yeah but it's going to perform vastly well I'll say it more efficiently in more conditions than gore-tex ever would and that's why I use it I I can't explain the science but I'm a walking billboard for your Windstopper products because of what you mentioned from about mid October to the end of season whether it's elk hunting whether it's mule deer hunting wolf hunting my outer layer is always going to be a wind stopper because I like you were saying I can regulate temperature and sweat you call it what it is just will call it will call it sweat I can regulate those so well with a wind stopper guy yeah and then when I get up there very often we're hiking in the dark we get to a glassing knob in these late season hunts and quick is you get there it seems like wow the wind wasn't blowing that hard down oh you get up high okay you got a 15 20 mile an hour wind you want something that stops that effect that heat loss effect of I mean because evaporation because your your body you've got evaporation going on with this moisture transfer right that hurts though the heat retention there's a little your core and then you got the wind that just accelerates that right if you have something that blocks all that it's amazing how such a lightweight piece can provide as much yeah comfort as it does yeah I've heard you know so many people say well I you know I hike up to the top of a you know my glassy knob for whatever species and of course you know everybody wants to get up there quick and so they they sweat and then they get up there and inevitably like you said the wind's blowing yeah and it doesn't have to be blowing all that much right I mean it's that that wind will strip heat away quickly and then they say well I'm chilled and I need to change base layers and all these kind of things and I'm like no no what you need to do you need to either apply in this case a wind stopper jacket a really lightweight wind stopper jacket which will immediately stop what what what I call flashing off right where you just you stop and that wind comes up and it literally just strips all that heat away and you become chilled or you need to put up some type of puffy jacket on right some loft and insulation whatever the case may be but in certain cases you need to actually have both so the loft almost isn't enough and you have to have that wind stopper you started I believe you started this conversation by saying is it possible or people want to have lightweight quiet durable rain gear and I said well that's pretty much impossible at this point in time but I would argue that you can have that in a wind stopper product right and again it's just because of the way it's you can construct it those products do exist yeah I'm with my wind Stoppers I don't know what DWR treatment you put on there but it even in torrential not torrential Blizzard types no it it's lufs off yeah you know it's got to be a pretty hard rain before right I start getting worried about it right and I know some people say well I'm not gonna go back to the truck like you do Newberry and the reason I go back to the truck if it's raining really hard for hours at a time as I'm gonna ruin 10,000 dollars worth of production yeah that's a very good point so sometimes I may be sooner than other people would but I've owned it and some pretty good rain just drizzling miserable conditions and it I don't know what kind of finish you put on there but it beads and yeah there's all kinds of DVRs and and interestingly enough and I'm not a chemist nor do I ever claim to be but we're actually Gor is working on for for the entire industry I'm some some much more environmentally friendly DW RS because apparently the ones kind of probably the good ones you and I like 20 years ago or weren't so good for the environment yeah they're actually doing a lot of work on that I don't I'm not very privy to any of that I wouldn't understand it anyways but but but I would say a DWR is incredibly important to a wind stopper or a gore-tex product or any kind of laminate product and you do need to overtime you need to be able to retreat that so you know I go on their moose hunt twelve days I'm riding I've got my rain pants on crushing through brush willow and all that I needed to come back and retreat those because it literally just took that that kind of that treatment off the face yeah and it'll still keep you dry but like I said when that face fabric begins to absorb water remember that human environment we talked about the moisture isn't as prone to want to move through that that garment so what DWR do you apply to it you know I knew you were gonna ask I don't want you to pick a favorite er or get yourself in trouble yeah you want to say a range of them our idea is there's there's a there's a couple real good ones I've done the washing product I think so let me let me take one step back real quick so first thing is do as I say not as I do because I am absolutely a pigpen when it comes to rain gear and sleeping bags like I literally never wash them that's horrible I know so don't do that but-but-but what you should do to get the best not only the life out of the garment but the most performance is like again when I come back from a trip or you come back from a dull sheep hunt you actually should wash your rain gear yeah and at that point in time even if it's not totally necessary that's when you should retreat with some kind of aftermarket DWR treatment so you can do a wash in product and then you put it in the dryer or you can do one where you wash it and then spray it down I this is just you know I don't like I said I don't do it a lot but I have found that the spray ons after washing work a little better for me okay and there's there's some good products and you know if people called our customer service we actually recommend some and we may even we may even send them some in some cases but I believe revive X's one Granger's has some really good products you know there's a couple there's a couple good ones out there yeah because I I end up doing that regularly well not great I'm like I would say probably every August I think all right that's a great that's a great time has this storm front for three or four years just got this many terrible days of abuse yeah it's about time yeah yeah and so that that's when I'll end up applying it when you get to talking about these outer garments pants are another one where it's I did because I don't think we're perspiring as much there it's probably we're not as worried about it but for me a lot of times I'm walking in the morning and there's moisture there's do there's whatever all right I let the storm clear off and now I'm wading through brush up to my thighs or the most common one for me is I go and I sit down on a rock the glass and if you don't have a really good garment yeah you're gonna end up with itchy butt that's gonna get wet and so is there a whole different set of technologies and ideas that you got to think about when you're when you're buying or in your case building the the product for ya compared to so not necessarily the same the same laminates that we would use on a jacket or are very similar in the pants you know you obviously all your internal organs are in your your torso so that's the one you really want to make sure you're regulating the most and obviously gets hotter you know my legs necessarily don't need as much regulation but you have some full full zips I would say I'll talk about a few things but one of the things I would say is that I see a lot of people not doing is not sitting on some kind of ground pad when they're going to sit down and glass and even you know when it's le warm outside you know that that earth isn't as warm as you think and it's got moisture it sucks the heat redatti it's got moisture all those kind of things especially if you're sitting on rocks but we do have some products you know one of the pants has a water one of our softshell pants does have a waterproof seating at the Timberline I think in fact I almost wore a para down he really mom yeah I wear those again that's that's my elk hunting uniform yes yeah Timberline pants and as far as how cold it is I'll bring a base layer that I may put on if it gets cold but when I leave the truck don't just the the Timberline and I'm off and going and either there are remarkable piece and there you can abuse the living tar out an abuse them again as I say not as I do yeah I've never put a finish on any of my I don't know if we should be admitting missiles even with all that abuse Randi still works but that's an amazing product just because it does have that waterproof seat and knees but it breathes so well and it's so durable and it stretches so that's kind of a hybrid garment you know that we have or you know if you're sitting on a saddle you know you're sitting in the saddle in the morning or you're gonna go sit on a snow machine or an ATV or something like that it's nice to have that that waterproof seat but I found that a little ground pad you know that I just carry on my pack definitely helps as well but doesn't get a sore and again that little bit of insulation I'm with you I airy though you can get them for like a buck ninety-nine down at the home and garden star these Gardens yeah the Gardner pet yeah you know you put under your knees when you're bent down yep plant your tulips in the spring I wouldn't know that because I don't garden that's my wife's cut but that's I just strap it to my packet weighs three ounces for ounces maybe I don't know but it the comfort is surely worth what a little bit of weight absolutely it has especially over time if she pun or something like that where you're gonna you know you're gonna be in rocky terrain you know you're gonna be glaston for long periods of time like if you can't focus and find that Ram and be able to judge them effectively like you're really not doing yourself you know a favor yeah so so some people say well I never wash any of my garments that have laminates because I'm afraid it's gonna hurt yeah that laminate yeah that membrane yeah it's not gonna hurt the membrane like I said actually what it's going to do is cut down the efficacy efficiency of the garment and let me go into a little more detail of why so internally on the backer or the liner especially if you have like a short sleeve shirt on or something like that but even if not your body oils are gonna get on that face and again that oil is acting as a barrier right that oil is essentially you know somebody standing in front of some of those doors saying no you can't come through here Sweat right recall it's wet and on the outside as you get there dirt or sunscreen or insect repellent some of those things on the face again you're cutting off some of those exit points for that sweat so it's really important to come back and and to wash it if you want the most efficient the longest life all those kind of things and you know I mean let's let's admit it you know these products are investments right they are any kind of laminate type product be it gore-tex or anything else is not inexpensive and you want to get a long life out of it and you absolutely should that should be the expectation but again you know to do that you should actually care for that product so I would say do not hesitate to wash it and do not hesitate to put it in the dryer to kind of keep that DWR on that face I am active I was of that old-school belief until I went to your headquarters and I said no please wash and dry these as often as you need to it's gonna enhance their performance right because just for the reasons that that you say yeah I have to put out a disclaimer because I can't talk about every product in the industry right I would say our gore-tex products you can do that right I would say some others I would I would I would ask the manufacturer because there's a potential I've seen it in the past where you go to dry it and this the taping on the inside will begin to peel off so but you know up I would say a high quality product of any type that's got a laminate you shouldn't be afraid to wash and dry it okay yep well those outer layer things are to me that's my first defense to whatever the weather is absolutely and we hunt in some miserable conditions whether it's snow or wind or cold or whatever I I don't have the luxury of saying well at zero degrees I'm gonna just shut it down for a week because we in our situation we've got film permits we've paid for we've got camera guys I already blocked and blocked in and you got a job to do yeah and I need gear that is gonna keep me as comfortable as possible no matter what those conditions are that so yeah you know and I got it I gotta admit that you know living in Kodiak for 15 years I mean I became I think the word is hydrophobic you know I was a diver in the Navy and spent 30 years around water and the mountains and and I I'm almost scared of water anymore so I don't like to be wet is really what I'm saying and no I don't even you know I really I really make sure that you know I pick the right things for the right for the right hunt or for the right environment and you know you'd mention a lighter-weight rain gear and again if you go lighter weight you don't necessarily give up durability to get lighter weight I mean you could but you don't necessarily have to but you can get increased performance you can get a little bit better breathability because again that sandwich so to speak that we put together has thinner thinner textiles together and so that's just you know it's not as it's not a law as long a journey to get through that that sandwich so for the sweatin evaporation yeah you know and you and I obviously were very lucky to have access to a lot of different things so I would I would recommend you know somebody's if somebody lives in Arizona or New Mexico some of these things and you're at swear you're gonna hunt most of the time you know you I don't think you need to go all the way to the guide were the storm front no I brain gear no you can get away with something a little lighter but I would say if you're going to go on that trip to Montana for late-season rifle or you're gonna go on that dream hunt for moose in Alaska you really probably do need at that point to think about upgrading to something a little more because you want it I mean at the end of the day we do want to go out and enjoy ourselves right I mean I'm not out hunting just to be miserable I'm actually trying to to have an enjoyable time I mean that's why we're so passionate about this and we have smiles on her face when we talk about it so yeah I think you know you need to kind of you know to kind of there's mix and match and not great sometimes if you're gonna go do something out of the ordinary yeah and everybody has a budget and I guess that's why I think that's part of why I've become so dialed in to the jetstream Timberline combination is its cover nastic such a wide variety of conditions and circumstances now yeah if I lived in Arizona and I only needed that when it was in December January I'd probably go to one of the other setups but for the kind of elk hunting I do and the places I go though those are the outer layers that just yeah make it for well I would say thinking on the numbers in my head I would say that the Jetstream jacket is absolutely the number one selling jacket is a big game oh yeah and then that that combo you talk about so it's a Jetstream jacket and then it's either the Timberline pant or the mountain pant it's one of those two but that that trio right there is the lion's share of kind of the western yeah and I want to say Western I mean you know up to Canada in Alaska as well but the kind of the Western hunters Arsenal right there because as we're talking about this and this podcast is called elk talk yeah not whitetail talk because you I would probably ask these questions differently about outer layers and such if it was something not as active say it was right and toning your white tails in November uh-oh it opened 15 minutes I think I'm sorry folks we're just gonna have to talk a lot louder to overcome that I don't know how we're gonna make this work John but we're gonna try so you know you mentioned whitetail and I would say that that you know generally speaking I mean the the technical answers would all be the same but the application would be different so you know I grew up in Ohio I've hunted a lot of white tails very unsuccessfully for the most part but nonetheless I put I literally put my time in in the tree stand and can sit there you know all day every day for ten or twelve days and then still go home with nothing but but I still say that Windstopper is the single biggest technology that people don't understand for for the whitetail guy really you know yeah because again you're not you don't have the capacity to move around I don't want to take this into the whitetail realm but you don't have the capacity to move around nor would you want to in a tree stand right so you you cannot generate body heat you know you and I have the luxury amount on an elk on getting it up and walk around yeah right get it and walk around I can stand I can potentially do jumping jacks way your Glasson or whatever the case may be you know and they don't have that opportunity but yeah and so I would say if we're talking desert southwest area even southern Utah you know we're in Salt Lake now but even southern Utah South I would say mountain jacket would be an amazing jacket paired with like the ascent pant like to me that you know I've hunted late-season meal they're just like you have or I haven't hunted coos but breaking but those but those kind of things but I would say that would be you know my go to down in this kind of neck of the woods but but I still always use some type of wind stopper product and then I would be remiss and I want to make sure that just because we're talking laminates that and I really kind of like to get your opinion on this as well but I see people not because we talked about hunt budgets not spend the money to buy Gators right and then that leads to a bunch of miserable miserable days in the field I I don't go anywhere without Gators yeah because you get that you know you're walking through snow that's melting because you've got this heat right around your the cuff of your boot down your pants or it's what grass or whatever and as quick as that starts wicking down into your socks down into your boots up your pant leg you quickly are miserable absolutely and then if you got a stand and glass somewhere for a long time misery comes in heavy doses at that point yeah so I'm yeah I am always wearing gaiters if you get wet so somebody says well I have I have waterproof boots what do I need a Gator for all the time yeah and like you said wet grass do we brush crossing a creek and if if the top of your sock which almost inevitably sticks out above the top of your boot gets water in it then that capillary effect sucks it right into the boot now you've got wet feet wet socks what you can be dried but now the inside of your boot is wet it's depending on the hunt and the environment is not going to dry in the field now you set yourself up potentially for blisters you set yourself up for some cold related injuries possibly at a minimum you set yourself up just for a little bit of misery suffering but you didn't need to do so you put a gator on so you'd mentioned and I know you you've hunted a lot in Oregon right and that kind of not and are gonna happen is it but in Alaska okay so they basically kind of the same but it's those those coastal temperate areas where yeah you can wake up and it can be completely sunny just a absolutely gorgeous Bluebird day and you have to hike through a bunch of brush and it's either created do overnight because of that dew point humidity or it's rained overnight and people say well I'm just gonna go and and hike you know across the slope or up to the top or whatever and not put rain pants on not put gaiters on and within 10-15 minutes you're completely socially out from the waist down yeah and again there's you know and I've talked about it there's ways to dry it out but you're taking away from your hunting time and so people say well it's not gonna rain I'm not gonna bring my rain gear it's like no actually I've worn probably my rain pants more when it's not raining when in a hunting situation and when it is raining and it's because I put them on I put my gaiters on first I pull my rain pants over top and then I can take off and I can cross you know quickly you know even sometimes maybe almost knee-high streams if they're short and I can go up through all that brush and dewy grass and you know eventually when I get up say into the Alpine I can take it off or if I'm staying down in that low brush country say hunting sit the black tail I make keep on my rain pants all day even though it's bluebird just to keep my lower body dry yeah you know and and so yeah it's it's interesting when even if you had an experience out of say you're coming from the desert south southwest you never maybe think of that scenario until it's too late and you're like geez now what I know I'm miserable yeah yeah and yeah I I do not like my boots to get wet on the inside now cuz of what you're talking about because if if you're camping a lot of times it may not be super cold but when it's 20 degrees out your boots don't dry that well when I'll get wet on the inside they know this thing called the ice yeah who is telling me you will sleep with your boots in your bag yeah depending on the hunt and what I have I'll put them either in the sleeping bag I've put them between the ground pad and the sleeping bag down near my feet and a lot of times I'll use them as my first layer is a pillow so on top of my ground pad underneath my sleeping bag and maybe put if I have an extra layer I'll put those on top for the heat to keep the boot from freezing yeah you know so you know you can imagine if you're hiking all day you do have you do have moisture in those boots just well if it's cold if it's at 20 degrees scenario you're talking about and I just take them off and put them in ten they're gonna be frozen in the morning they're gonna be hold their knots and you know and there's ways to kind of warm them up and mitigate that but but so that's that's one thing that I've done but I I can be wet all over but I really truly try to keep my feet in the inside of my boots dry for you know all the reasons we've talked about and I'm I will go to great lengths to keep that from be yeah being wet yeah before I started using the Jetstream I was one of those guys who hated hoods because I can't hear as well or I can't hurt my peripheral vision whatever now I don't go anywhere without a hood you got a preference funnel so you know it's really funny you mentioned this because I had this conversation the other day and and maybe a few months before that or before this podcast I was thinking to myself kind of what happened and you know when I was in the military and training guys for so many years we were basically anti hood and part of it was you know somebody's feeling kind of like down and lonely and whatever the case may be like it's easy to pull a hood up and you know and you can kind of suck back in your little sanctuary and got a and you know your your mental state kind of maybe decays a little bit that aside it also cuts off your peripheral vision like you absolutely at some point start to take yourself out of the hunt with a hood or at least this is what I thought yeah and then also with the military applications getting on and off helicopters you couldn't have hoods just blowing around in the wind you know so you had to tuck them away or so anyways I was kind of anti hood and I don't know if it's just my increasing age for my increasing wisdom or just you know or whatever but the last year year and a half I have become a hood fan yeah a hood fan where I will have so that BC moose hunt I won't go through the full system I was wearing but I had multiple hoods at the same not at the same time but I had multiple layers with hoods on hm and I had no problem with that you know as a colder environment I'm a riding a horse I'm not really making a lot of heat on my own at a minimum you just pull it up it keeps it back your neck warm right you can pull it on for some protection you can pull it on for heat and a lot of the hoods that we try to craft not all but the vast majority are cut to the point where they provide enough protection but they're cut back far enough to give you peripheral vision so that you're not disengaging from the hunt you're not just kind of seeking some sanctuary you know some of the big Puffy's when you're kind of sitting there just kind of hunker down you know you do want that sanctuary from the cold but I have become a huge fan of hood some of the stuff we have for women coming out in 2019 for the big game line I actually well with with them with the women hunters in sight but we put hoods on some of the layers that the men don't have like the new mountain jacket has a hood and I'm like gosh I'm so jealous so jealous of the women hunters for sikit because they have a hood on their mountain Jack and I'm like I'm going to change it I'm on record right now at some point in time there will be a hood on the men's mountain jacket you took my vote on that oh that's so jealous that is as weird as it sounds as I've become a hood fan yeah that's probably why I migrate more towards the guy that has a hood and I think that's a real valid point and I know that it's probably weird but I used to hate hood idea why but then when I started using them I'm thinking to myself whoa why what would they weren't cooler what was the deal Randy yeah you know you know sometimes it cut your hearing off a little bit but maybe it's because my hearing has gotten so bad anyhow it's yeah well critic Chris again my whitetail counterpart he's doing some really interesting things you know it he's kind of done this scientists sound thing but he's doing some really interesting things with hoods and beanies etc that my guess is you'll see it begin to migrate across the line but yeah you kind of begin to cut yourself I always felt I was cutting myself off from the environment by having a hood and now I just find myself going to a more and more more like I said even in the you know even in the Sun just pulling it up on an antelope hunt it take the take the Sun off your neck or just give yourself a little protection for your ears yeah yeah oh that's funny I did its I get asked that question a lot how do you deal with the hood and it's oh I don't think I'm too much out in the weeds as the the exception about hunters who had or have a a preference away from hoods but now it's if it doesn't have a hood and I'm probably not gonna be using it you guys you guys can send me anything you want but if it has a hood it's gonna get more used to it but so other outer layer things anything you want to give the audience I know you you and I both got the next thing we got to get to yeah well this has been great because you know I feel like over the course of a few podcasts we've been able to to kind of walk people from base layers you know all the way out and just give them a pretty good general overview I you know and I always encourage this we go shoot our bows we go to the gym we shoot our rifles we get on you know go huntin and I just say now is well not right this second but I would say going into shed season spring season is a perfect time to begin to you know either take the system you have and go start to test it and think about some of the things we've talked about or you know maybe you buy a new piece or two and integrated into what you've gotten and just go try it out and kind of think about what's going on and and you know try to find out a little bit more if you if you don't understand why something's not work you know like for sicka we have a great customer service a part of it and you can call them and they'll walk you through you know almost any question probably you have and if they can't answer it and it's a big game question quite frankly they're gonna come in and ask me and then I'm gonna you know give them the answer and they'll go back with it but you know it's that's what you know we only have so many days to hunt in a season but the fun thing is that I can be on go hunt for instance every day right I can go train and test gear and shoot my bow every day you know and that's where it becomes a 365 kind of endeavor even though you may be you know you and I probably get to hunt a little more than most but let's just say 3045 days like out of a year it's not a lot what else you doing ya know whatever what other things you do for me I'm always thinking about gear I'm thinking about hunting I'm I need to channel my inner accountant from you and try to figure out this so full disclosure uh-huh I'm gonna I'm gonna maybe take in a slightly different direction but full disclosure I'm a go hunt insider now and quite frankly a trail who's a very friend of ours here and and but listening to you and uh and Cory yeah and I'm not gonna say my wife is a super big fan of go huh yell that on Sunday rightly so rightly so because you know Arizona apps yeah they just astro an antelope Utah's coming up I got a bunch of points I'm trying to figure out my season and I just I went deep I windy I'm telling you it's one of the best it's one of the best tools I've I've seen in a very long time yeah super easy so I'm not maybe the most computer savvy is some but just super intuitive and easy to use and I do have to call trail and ask him a few few questions on how to help me but the part I like about him and this is a bit of a diversion but it's not it doesn't tell you go do this or here's our team recommended units it just gives you tools to do your own research and figure it out but for me to have access to like I just wouldn't have the time or quite frankly maybe the the know that know the know-how to go get the information that's right at my fingertips that then go oh I have X percent chance to potentially draw this you know with these points and then I go look at that unit and start digging in and oh my gosh you want to talk about rabbit holes I think you know I know you spent a lot of time on there and yeah I don't know why I've always been a little bit of I don't know sometimes I'm stubborn you know we all are but that's that's why our wives love us did you hear the that I I did on one of my own podcasts about marital advice 30th wedding anniversary and Rhonda Thanks on Monday on Monday fantastic coming up on 28 here are yeah yeah so I oh I should have jewels on my podcast because we did a guy's version all over how to hunt six months a year and make it to your 30th and it was all guys so I said look oh we got an affair we got to have the women on that so now I think that's a great idea to have the women on I'm just not sure you don't want it to be your wife she's been I mean she's fantastic but you know it's like yeah anyway we don't want to get you in any trouble no ABI I think it's a brilliant idea like frankly probably get a lot of people listening just to just to hear the zingers from oh yeah from wives yeah for sure it's probably it's only been out for four days oh okay how many comments we've got wait to listen from the entire spectrum of you're an idiot tooth that's great advice why didn't I think about that through a lot a lot of them are I don't think you quite understand and I made the disclaimer out front yeah you're right I don't understand I got tunnel vision man I'm going hunting yeah yeah I got two goals in life stay married and hunt as much as I can well so it's interesting it's interesting you mentioned this because I booked my trip to come down here uh-huh and you know my wife and I were both in the military for a very long amount of time and we don't have children so you know quite frankly holidays anniversaries like it didn't I don't want to say it didn't matter but we celebrated when we were together and yeah the actual date didn't matter so yeah I've become maybe callous to this whole thanks anyways I booked my trip and I fly down yesterday Valon the 14th of February right and she says seriously and I said what what what what's what it's a random Thursday she goes it's Valentine's Day and I'm like oh my gosh I'm so sorry I said you know it never meant really anything in the past you know we could celebrate Saturday whatever she goes yeah but John you're not in the military anymore like you have to think about it so then I tried to go down and like deflect I'm really good at deflecting and I said well you know it's it's Western hun expose fault like they're the ones that did not vote now very well yeah not very well so you know I was I mean we had a we had a quite a few people in the booth but yeah was I was uh there's more people here today let's say than there were yesterday anyways I made her a beautiful dinner and we celebrated on Wednesday so there you go you made it out so yeah cuz I want to keep hunting to my 30th anniversary you know a little over two years to make it far so I'm gonna work on that I'm gonna I'm gonna make sure that she's gonna get an invite didn't mean to just run it in the ditch like that but since Cory's not here he's kind of the straight arrow yeah he keeps the conversation on track he's a ninja he's got checklists and okay we got this one covered we get me I'm just like you know whatever people walking by here waving at us and then I stayed on point pretty well I think we did yeah but I covered a lot of ground yeah now I'm just waiting what's the next series of questions gonna be that people are gonna ask I'm really yeah I'm really curious to see if they want to circle back if they want to keep going deeper if they want to talk broader yeah I suspect they're gonna have questions about our tree all cutting yeah okay what if I'm going out in September what do we need what should I have yeah because I've covered a lot of ground hit bits and pieces here and there about the late season package in laying and stuff but you can run into some pretty diverse conditions oh well I mean the last couple years in September in Montana yes snow I mean it has been all over the board literally from week to week it's yeah I mean swing the spectrum swings from one end to the other so I think that's a great one because you want a really versatile system and and a couple key pieces are really kind of carry you through yeah we should we should do that be good hopefully Cory can join us now we've had he gone I just don't think he likes you John the well I'm I was I was gonna mention that I'm getting to think that thanks for being here thanks for having me no I love this show I'm so excited to just walk around and see everybody and yeah everything something tells me you got a lot of people wanting to bend your ear about technical clothing yeah if I walk by the booth right now it's gonna suck me into the back I appreciate the time out of the booth yeah okay yeah well thanks John thanks for listening folks and if you have serious gear issues read or consume anything John Barlow from Sitka gear talks or writes about because what's this thing been there done that I think in your military career in your post military career you're probably close to the top of the pyramid of hands-on experience of technical gear I might have to agree with you on this alright folks thanks for listening until the next time", "wnxb8RTdl6Y": "we drop in on the game yeah CEO topper handy tips for working with a TC from a pilot who's also a controller what are you communicating with the dollars just there's something to be said for just being professional and conversational at the same time there aren't always technical words to describe exactly what you want to do British Columbia has a thriving general aviation scene I'm here to meet a champion of this flying community Ryan van Haren he's a highly experienced pilot and air traffic controller and he runs the DC general aviation Association he set me up with a ton of great West Coast flying starting with a sunset tour of Vancouver in his plane okay so this is a barrows bear hawk for place it's a home-built aircraft designed by Bob barrows he's originally an engine designer and his idea was to design an airplane that he could move airplane engines it opens up like a minivan this one was built by Gavin Chester on Vancouver Island when you buy the airplane you can buy the kit in various stages of completion or give this by the plants and the cabin bought plans and then scratch built everything struts or cut down steps and struts but other than that Gavin's a sheetmetal worker by trade and fabricated everything off the plan and the attention to details better than anything the factory would have done so what we have here is a lycoming o-360 200 horsepower constant speed fabric fuselage so tube and fabric and then i've got metal wings and fabric control surfaces this one has a Goodyear 26 inch Tundra tires some guys put the big 31 inch Alaskan bush wheels there's a lot of guys who put skis on them in the winter time we could throw on floats and go do that as well so great airplane great engine and Gavin you built it in a phenomenal jobs doors open up all the way here so you got the two main passenger doors that go up and then that opens up all the way there a lot like a mall so we can take this backseat out in about five minutes and throw whatever you want in there an airplane engine all your camping gear dogs whatever whatever the mission calls for and in this

that's sweet people think hope builds are not high tech I mean this thing is way when I take on semi do I fly nice thing about this airplane is it's in the the home-built category here in Canada experimental in the US so really the sky's the limit in terms of what we can do to it if you there's a modification you can think of you can go ahead and do it covered switches are just sexy feels good yes sir shared yesterday - one for drug six all two or three zero Niner you're number one hair she Emma Victor Fox Bravo tolls adult oh really - six right with the gather one shooter by Fidel Magette Northwest down sparks recruit wind one four zero thick could take uh pretty cheesy great pick up to six Bravo topics [Music] [Music] Public Enemy conflict at twelve o'clock three miles east on fillets of us 2007 1500 oh I love 1500 for now the only thing I see if I falter now son yeah shaders on he says actually polarized why with toys I one of the biggest challenges of both the Lower Mainland airspace here is that we're stuck in a bowl to the north we got the mountains to the west we got the Pacific Ocean and then Vancouver Island and Japan and to the self we got the US we've got a lot of air traffic in a really confined space and that's everything from all the airliners and an IFR traffic in and out of Vancouver International Abbotsford Boundary Bay Pitt Meadows all the local airports here as well as all the trainers okay so we just want that tower we're at 1,800 feet so now we're kind of in no man's land the next piece of controlled airspace is about five miles ahead of us that's a debris control zone the Vancouver harbour is one of the world's busiest water aerodromes so you got a mix of all the floatplane traffic harbour air helijet like 30 40 flights a day back and forth in the middle of the day when it's creeping busy out here I like to stay close to the hills those people won't fly right up again so I like to keep a safe distance obviously I did what that allows me to do is cut my traffic standing out so I can really look straight ahead and to the side away from it all right so long as you know winds aren't coming over the hill and not too turbulent for threading in a side monitor the harbor just to see who's coming out of could we're talking about poll earlier a space war really nothing comes then we're talking about the clock a well just thinking what that board is the lid on the bone the lid is the Class C right so everyone's within the coast motto and then vertically compliant below the hybrid tower controls are actually starts at the second Narrows Bridge which is our bridge right there okay I like to give a call a little bit early every target evening is bear-hug Charlie Gold Foxtrot Bravo fulfill bear hog golf Foxtrot Bravo Hotel Harbor target evening altimeter three zero one zero go ahead your request three zero one zero just like States Park and Stuart a city tour so I'd like to feel in our shoulder and out towards Horseshoe Bay and then steal time books maybe oats words are born and then back along the south shore prepare metal talk strat bruh Hotel Roger and cleared westbound by the North Shore two thousand towards Horseshoe Bay and possibly Bowen before when you're ready to proceed back east on Foxtrot Motel Wilco thank you one of the biggest questions that I get asked around here especially my position with the DC general aviation Association then knowing that I fly and knowing that I'm also controller is they say well there's always these no times out about the the airspace being restricted right and restricted does not mean closed if you need it call up and ask for service restricted just means that there's a fair possibility that you may be denied service and not because the controllers don't care it's just you've reached that critical workload test operation point just like when we're in the cockpit you know VFR IFR busy airspace whatever it is we'll talk about tasks titration and workload management and crew resource management all those concepts translated ATC when you're in the airplane the controller's part of your crew when we're in the area control center of the pilots quarter marker we have a obligation to provide separation to the IFI aircraft unfortunately sometimes we have to deny service to the VFR aircraft what I will tell them is if you'd like you can monitor my frequency and I'll let you know when I can take it and they go about their flight and when I have a moment you'll call it back and say hey I got a minute for right now what can I do for you sometimes controllers sound chirpy on the radio and you may think cause I got having a bad day or what did I screw up what did I do wrong it's not that at all it's everybody's everybody's human we're all we're all trying to do the same job and hit the same same goals right everybody's doing the best they can and they truly do care you know one of the biggest things when you're communicating with the towers just I don't try to get too good frizzy ologies also always good but there's also something to be said for just being professional and conversational at the same time right everyone understands a casual conversation okay and there aren't always technical words to describe exactly what you want to do that we have you can see the big bill that's the top of ghost mountain egos were there the other day yeah yeah shiny thing right on the top of the Bell that's the gone below just going into the top station where you were I would normally go in there to show you the gone below but I don't really like the fact where there's no contrast there are those yeah something I'm going to do this every day number one Ln if you look over there there's kinda two places with all the base sales Ali I'm at to the right see there's like three docks that stick out so those are the floatplane docks with all the flow claims we go up and down the coast here you guys went to the aquarium yep okay so right there in Stanley Park you're on your side omelet there's a white building in the trees that's the aquarium that we walked about that tiny tiny bit there which is the really cool part with all the fake party rose bottom line if you've got a clear concise request and it's obviously not busy on the frequency there's no harm in asking pirates our thought forever call request Robo till

for the bit Darwin when he throws 7.4 3:01 1/3 direct approach clear track don't like Lea climbeth Ryan was really cool he's a controller and a pilot and seeing that kind of passion on both sides of

last video I kind of uh opened up the jar and it kind of the scent kind of got into my nose and so I said [ __ ] it so this is a little nugge we're gonna row so I'm not gonna puff up or down and I already did that in the fandom video so if you're really jonesing for me to dump it out go to the O go to the fan emoji video and you can see it in all its glory oh okay alright so without further ado San Fernando Valley Oh G and for some of you that are watching this video that are not from California San Fernando Valley is best known for the porn capital of the world so this little arm Long Beach [ __ ] factoid for you cuz I'm gonna do a job test don't let me forget here we go like I said this stuff has got like a Kim dog planetary gonna stick you with them fifty stinky yeah like I said it's it's right up there with the rest of the oh geez that you've been smoking so I can smell it from way over here and feel it on my hands if you can see my hand sorry this is not the same beer the beer number DOS so apologize Stella Artois if you did see the thing like said always I'm gonna picture I posted phantom video first but always watch the previous video just in case there's more likely this one's like a part two so you always want to watch the oldest one first alright with that being said to me as ramble in the [ __ ] on we're gonna do the same Fernando Valley Oh Gina oh by the way I just just kind of throw it out there just tell if you got t-mobile and so many [ __ ] hates on you imma let you know something I was a t-mobile user or whatever the subscriber for almost six years since pretty much since Jump Street from them right and my contract came to an end up two months ago right so I kind of got this wild hair in my ass [ __ ] you know I kind of want to kind of want to go somewhere else change change carriers change kinky did get anything falling out still rocking little flip phone ship so I ended up going with AT&T and I didn't get sucked into the iPhone thing and my main thing with the iPhone is no not the whole stupid deal with not be able to get insurance on it and and just I'm not really big you know Typhon so I really didn't go to 18 T for iPhone I just kind of up to 18 t you know kind of for a change you know they had some really polyfoam so I end up going with the HTC Inspire the phones the [ __ ] the phone is the business the phone is without a doubt the best one I've ever had but the [ __ ] service att's phone service is the worst ever I think in six years of t-mobile I had maybe a dozen drop calls or you know at points where I can hear myself or you know I lost when I lost the car so maybe maybe twice a year that would happen it seems like every other phone call with AT&T is garbage unless you're calling somebody else who has AT&T which is then then you're looking at about an 80% chance of it just rockin on but then there's also still a chance it's gonna [ __ ] up some somewhere down the line or right off the bat so if anybody out there has got t-mobile and you've been hated on I was hated on not remain not really just by some friends and stuff hating on a stick they call it a stripper phone they talk T Mobile stripper phones so to all you guys out there who were rockin the t-mobile cheers [ __ ] this one's for you I wish I was back there but I'm stuck with this [ __ ] for two years so look that said that little rant out of the way here we go is that vog don't a big way more expansive than that then family taste matches the up the smell for sure definitely though that's um it's got a nice little lock to your throat definitely very definitely expensive definitely I'm definitely saying it's right up there what now I'm not gonna be able to really tell you how the high end because I'm still hiding a little bit but in this drink but I'm definitely going to tell you that all right was just at one point and now I feel like this doesn't like I feel like I'm oh this is like a know like a sativa think five minutes ago I saw like I was kind of like leaning a little bit you don't want the indica but right now I feel like this is like a moralistic this is a guy like I said it shot us a tee way you know so props to the hike wiggle we'll shout it out at a 15 and gram 4584 grams on Thursdays so we don't talk out with that three-point talk [ __ ] we wait till Thursday so anybody else's cat [ __ ] throw up and then eat it again my cat does that and it has no problem I mean he eats it all backed up everything am I the only one let me know so many hit me up I mean I got an older cat and stuff but I mean he does he pretty much anything that moves budweis I mean it [ __ ] up a you know a cricket you know what I'm feeding some [ __ ] some of my my aquatic stuff some of my reptile and [ __ ] sometimes said a lot a creek you'll get loose or whatever and he'll say note something he's got no problem [ __ ] killing it and eating it like it's nothing I see almost sometimes it begs me when he sees me bring home the food phone so I don't know maybe I'm scared we're don't get okay so maybe not maybe guys got a cat that [ __ ] eat people let me know but uh I thought that was it just bizarre and he just did it around like 15 minutes ago whatever an expression my mind so maybe that's why I'm throwing it up in oh man this week rest in peace Ryan done you went out like a [ __ ] champ like I mean you can't say that she didn't go out like the way you lived you know like you didn't get bit by cancer some heart attack or stroke enough and you went out like like you probably was supposed to go out or like to play envisioned it or something but top damn that's some [ __ ] up [ __ ] so rest in peace man you entertained me more than more than to more than one occasion man I'm gonna [ __ ] on jackass so just want to throw that shout out there man I'm gonna in this video I can make that long battery turn it out and put a shirt check the Twitter for pictures these [ __ ]", "IakY_03WPGg": "thanks it hot hey everybody welcome to the God cast episode 171 this week we have the land race Preservation Society thanks for joining us about it thanks for having me yeah we also have Marty hey what's up everybody we got Roger I guess I just muted mr. green dings hey everybody glad to be here mr. green jeans how are you mighty alright so uh what why don't you tell us that what about what you do you have a pretty unique set of genetics that you breed and they're working on adapting quite a bit of natural land races from around the world it's a really really cool thing that you're doing and something that we need to have especially given the patent Wars and you know the the scarcity of some of these genetics you know there's there's some you know extinctions going on in in you know a lot of the different cultivars because people aren't growing some when these older longer-term growing stuff that people used to grow you know there's quite a few stuff smells and tastes that I can remember from high school that certainly I don't remember the last time I tasted them because people have just bred away from the you know for sure and you know this long you know group dr. green spoon and some of those other you know 18 20 22 week strains you know people just aren't growing any more they realized switching to the seven to nineteen week stuff so what are you tell us what about what you do and and what you're passionate about well so basically we found in the land race Preservation Society to you were say and to preserve and acclimatize as many we started started with Hell or Himalayan cultivars because our area lends really well to acclimatizing them in they are they're fairly they're fairly you when it comes to land races like intersex wise and you know it's it's it's easier to eliminate the negative traits I found in in those cultivars at least up here when you're doing the outdoor selections indoor is pretty much the same with I mean it's swing the pendulum swings I mean I I'm not a huge fan of working with Southeast Asian genetics for I'm sure obvious reasons for anyone who's had experience with you know any tie or Vietnamese or Cambodian stuff it can what issues for those that aren't familiar so well aside from incredibly long flowering times you have plants that will you know appear to so out of a 24 week flowering period you know you you might get through half of that and you'll be just sailing through then all the sudden you know an entire branch decides to become a male and so you have you know you have you know half a year basically dedicated to you know this one particular cultivar that you're working on and it's it's a it can be extremely frustrating and disappointing and heartbreaking you know when you think you've you know you think you've isolated this you know though the perfect Fino and so you go to run it inside and it's just it's just a complete [ __ ] show and so yeah intersex is probably the most difficult factor when you are working with with land races that have never been grown either at our latitude or in an indoor environment before that's got to be 100% the number one issue people face so I always try to tell people if they're if they're know purchasing you know seems for you know a cultivar like that just be prepared for you know just be prepared for what comes with the territory and you know yeah Wow what are some of the other unique challenges that you've run into you know growing landrace cultivars whoa I didn't mean to interrupt here your your speech there in the beginning oh no that's all right some unique challenges just just being able to work with the amount of the numbers needed to do the selecting that is required to get the expressions isolate the expressions that you know are desirable to modern Western growers and breeders because people are definitely looking for a specific you know out of an Afghan line let's say like the you know people are looking for specific things or they think they you know know what they're looking for when they start digging through a you know a specific Afghan land race but so it's just working with the amount of numbers that you need and most people don't have the space or the plant count or the time to really do the digging they need to to find the stand out keepers to you know isolate the traits that they're going after it's just time in space really time and space and plant counts so laws are also a huge hindrance to this work you know I mean it's the there's there's definitely some unique challenges that this this kind of work presents you with when you decide to dive in so is there any cultivars that um you tried to work with and maybe ended up just hitting a dead end or weren't able to to work out in terms of land races yeah there have been a few for sure I was trying to release our Highland High and piriform for probably five years I was trying to get you know get workable enough endorsed where the intersects rate was was manageable at least and so that it was you know I could reduce the flowering time to you know maybe five months after many many many failed and frustrated attempts at that I I had to I had to throw in the towel and turn the scenes over to to somebody in Hawaii who has the climate in the space and the patience to and the love for special especially the love for that particular cultivar to really take it to where it needs to go because you know if part of the difficulty with that work is we were doing it in a greenhouse so you know we are already getting weird expressions from the environment and then we were doing the indoor selections after we'd kind of you know thought we'd smooth things out outdoor in the greenhouse when we brought indoors it was just basically started from scratch and it was incredibly frustrating so we turned that project over to another member of our collective and he is yes happily working it right now in Hawaii on the Big Island and you know he's listening he knows who he is and we are very grateful for his work he's doing with our Southeast Asian lines so as far as what no go ahead okay I was just gonna say in just to clarify a little bit I feel like it's important to say that you know the the reason that you're maybe not you but in general a lot of times people that are after preserving land race it's a really a different mindset and Steve alluded to it a little bit and you know it's not necessarily something you're you're doing trying to turn a profit but just preserve the genetics in their in their pure form right talk about that a little bit yeah yes I mean that yeah you hit the nail on the head like that's that's definitely there's not a ton of money to be made in this kind of work so like you really have to it's something you have to kind of be a little crazy and passionate about and obsessed with to really you know me successful I think in preserving some it's especially some of the more difficult to tame lines but sure you know I inherited a very large seed collection for my father when he passed away and it you know he's the one who kind of instilled in me the the curiosity and the the passion I have for this kind of work and you know for for quite a while and I worked hand in hand to - he taught me a lot of a lot of what I know and so you know it's basically it's it's it's it's making sure that the the gene pool stays intact because we are we are not I was going to say slowly but fairly rapidly at this point with legalization taking hold we are slowly bottled bottlenecking the cannabis gene pool to the point where you know we are gonna be facing some of the same issues we had and we started hybridized in corn and other of our cash crops I believe there was the the corn the corn fiasco in the 1970s where farmers had to there was a major effort to have somebody has more knowledge about this feel free to chime in but so basically there was a there was a blight affecting corn crops in the United States and it was it was decimating these farms and so what they had to do was come up with a new f1 hybrid of an older seed stock that hadn't been hybridized and they were able to you know go back and you know reinf use some of these resilient genes from some of these older lines and you know create a strain that was able to withstand this blight that was affecting you know corn crops around the country and you know it's that kind of thing that is going to be very difficult to do all of these genetics disappear and it would be impossible right in terms of like what to replicate what they did because they they went back to non hybridized seeds rock and there's nobody's growing it and nobody's making the seeds and nobody has it and really whether you're talking about you know the reasons why you wanted maybe never maybe you're like mr. Greenjeans over here who loves to you know breed plants and put them together with specific traits and how are you going to be able to find uh you know the pure genetics that you want to cross with something else to get exactly what you want if they're all crossed with something else already so even even if you're looking at it from a connoisseur standpoint you you the value of having those pure genetics is is still very high for and I guess in my opinion no absolutely those chemo of are in Turkey and profiles that are totally not found any more in most of your modern cannabis that are still found in a lot of those landrace and and that to me you know we don't even know what the medical values are and and there could be something you know the next CBD or alcohol bond and cannabinoids or or any of some of these other stuff that that really can be mined out of these that needs to be studied well yeah and I think I BAM from coastal seeds put it well and he said I was at the 2013 Emerald cup I believe I heard him he was given a talk and fact this is at the very beginning of the open cannabis project and all we're all wide-eyed and hopeful about what was to come or all this Philo's [ __ ] started and but he said he said you can take you can take blue and yellow make green but you can't take green and make blue and yellow and I think that like sums it up really well because you know once you know yeah you can do you can do back crossing if you have the original you know one of the original parents and you can you can do certain things to try to reclaim certain traits that you've lost but ultimately unless you have that pure stock that's been preserved and and open pollinated and so you have all the potential expressions that you can you know keep you know you you will end up losing the unique traits of that plant that made that plant so valuable and that were developed over hundreds if not thousands of years in certain areas by farmers you know selecting from a very very very large population of plants so so what um what traits do you look for in landrace plants maybe for breeders you know good potential breeding plants that might be different than what say traditional breeders are look for in terms of males and females uh well I mean it just depends on like what stage of a preservation project we're we're in so we keep we cast an extremely wide net at first so we basically start by eliminating we do well we start first by just doing an open pollination of everything and then we collect the seeds from the plants that we can't find any like obvious you know undesirable traits and so no intersex traits you know etc we've super late finishing time so if we're trying to do an outdoor acclimatized line you know let's see so I mean that so that would be that's the first step and then as we we kind of narrow things down as we go but resistance especially you know we're working outdoors up here in the northwest we have rain and mold to contend with and you know a lot of times we're trying to create or find I should say dig out those genes that will enable the growers in the northern latitudes to grow out you know some of the longer flowering sativas at their latitude without them holding out you know even if it's finishing and you know mid November with a little snow on it you know there are expressions out there that will allow you to do that and it's just about finding those so I mean resistance you know blood structure eventually when we get to that step that's definitely something that's taken into account you know resin production things that make it desirable for you know that are gonna make it fun for somebody to grow that also retaining the characteristics that the old heads are gonna you know when they smoke it I like oh yeah this is you know whatever this is you know this butit I stick I smoked and you know 1979 like I recognize this terpene profile and you know so it's a it's a it's a very long multi-step process of narrowing down and we keep large amounts of seed from each step so if we have to go back if we're like no we you know we [ __ ] up like that wasn't we thought that was a trait we wanted to follow but the turn out that was you know recessive and it's now it's we are unable to find it in these subsequent generations and so on and so yeah and so depending on what a grower is looking for breeders looking for you can kind of go back into the freezer and be like okay well these you know that the F trees looked really good and they had this trait and if that's what you're looking for this will help you with your breeding program and you know so and a lot of people are also just looking for just the straight straight from the source know they want to do this work themselves and you know so we offer them just the you know we'll do breeder packs of you know it says 24 we usually throw in you know 40 or so seeds just so people have a chance to find you know what they're looking for so you know it's it is a long long process and it you know it varies depending on the cult of where we're working with but yeah it's gonna outdoors of course it's a really long process because you know you have to wait a whole year generation and that is one of the advantages about breeding indoors and I was wondering you know what what thoughts you have about doing parts of those projects indoors and you know trying to obviously trying to work with day lengths things to match to outdoors and things like that I mean if you are it's would you be able to get any use out of any I have indoor situation same question for light deprivation okay yeah for sure like we definitely like that is one of the things that we once we once we feel like we've gotten it stable enough we definitely move the program indoors we start our indoor selections but we instead of trying to match the photo period of the region it's from or trying to mimic the outdoors anyway we what we do is we just we we will run some on 24 hour veg cycles so we try to match what the average you know home grower is going to be you know utilizing photo period wise in their setup climate wise etc you know because ultimately they're gonna be the ones who are growing it they don't these seeds don't come with special instructions on you know I mean I suppose they could but you know like ultimately you know when people are buying these are getting to grow them on 18 hour or no maybe 16 hour you know veg but 16 to 24 hours is generally what they're what we test them at and then we'll do decaying photo periods for somewhere really longer flowering sativas so you know we'll start off but like you know 11 13 and end it like you know it just depends but usually around 10 hours of light love it yeah so that's yes endure the endure step is extremely valuable too because there are people in parts of the world where it's either illegal highly illegal still or their climate just will not lend to growing anything other than autos like no matter no matter how much digging we do you know although we have found to our friends at the Indian landries exchange there are a couple members who have been going up to Siberia recently and doing some hunting and there's some pretty interesting auto stuff coming out of there right now that we're gonna start playing around with here and then coming seasons so you know something too something to stay tuned for these Siberian landraces are interesting very resinous like super resinous and fairly tall very narrow narrow leave what's that I said go on super very tall narrow leaf is pretty cool too yeah so they have a lot of those narrow leaf traits and like generally from the smoke it's it's I would say I don't have any testing on these yet but I would say by the smoke I'd say it's probably about a 1 to 1 or there abouts ratio so I definitely think there's a lot of potential in there for not only hunting the de pere stuff but you know outcrossing - you know let's say like a super long flowering maybe even a haze or you know i've brainstorming a lot of projects right now in this area because I've been you know ever since finding out about these Siberian Siberian lines and with everything going on in Alaska right now and you know there's there's definitely a need for northern cultivars that can finish in climates like that and still produce well and provide growers commercial growers with the the resistant plants that they're looking for for you know environment oh he's be outdoors and Alaska's gotta be pretty tough sledding yeah thank you probably most of the other stuffs got to be in or at the moment in a lot of that like you're saying is duty yeah the genetics that are available on the market are I'm gonna work where there and just based on the amount of sunlight that they get weather patterns yeah exactly I mean it's the 24 hours of light or there abouts you know that do make it challenging I mean if you were if you're growing photo period plants like you'll definitely grow some gigantic plants during that summer but unless you have a greenhouse to finish them and it gets a little tricky so you know that there are a lot of Canadian breeders so we're doing some really cool stuff with autos right now I'm not super familiar with some of their work because it's not really an area I have focused a lot of attention on but there's definitely you know been you know a lot of progress made over the last even 10 years with autos and yeah so I mean there's but there's there's still a huge demand for you know some solid commercial hardy outdoor commercial varieties for areas like Alaska and you know you know Upper Canada probably mangy low and angry oh for sure yeah definitely I was just looking at somebody's farm up theirs today I came here what something some they're they're a DDM pure certified farm up in Maine I cannot remember what they're called oh yeah yeah mm-hmm I don't know but that's just assumed you know pretty much anybody in you know in both of those states that have some form of legalization now so yeah yeah totally legal with uh and they didn't ruin their medical program when they did their recreational they got both also they did it right they both sexes yeah ugly ugly so we're gonna trying to kill the program yeah yes that there are three dispensaries in the entire state that are still medical only yeah exactly yeah told you Steve there's only three I'm not everybody else is Rick thank everybody and not like no shade towards them but there's [ __ ] three yeah yeah a lot of people are left with pretty much no choice it's like we're doing away with the medical program so if you want to keep you know growing cannabis for a living you have to do this now so that's pretty much what they did to everybody in Oregon use it for money and you've got yep see Michigan is kind of keeping it that way - Michigan is gonna be similar to Maine I think because we talked about that when we're up there to conference in March that I told those guys that said man you need to really start lobbying about making sure your medical program and they said in Michigan it's more of a they can't just outright go change in laws like they have they have to have the people's vote in Michigan so I thought I should be state-by-state thing they can't just say we're doing away with the medical program because they have to have a vote by the people of Michigan to do remember we all remember what happened in Nevada or the governor on a declared state of emergency in order to fix the cannabis laws that I've ever seen emergency just because there's one stop calling you about weed that's that's impressive I applaud you - that's lame yeah all right so what kind of cultivars do you focus on growing you have quite a long list here on your website it's pretty awesome you put a lot of work into this won't you tell us about the cultivars that you've been working and are passionate about all right now I'm as you can probably tell on the site like my focus has really been on our North Indian and Pakistani stuff we are starting kind of a Mediterranean breeding program right now if we have some Greek some Lebanese Syrian and some Egyptian stuff that were playing around with at the moment so that's something that we just started but for the last like three almost four years it's pretty much been exclusively working with our Central American and North Indian stuff and as well as our northern Pakistani lines so it's probably because they're just so much fun to grow up here in this area because they just do so well and it's it's it's exciting to kind of see like the expressions that come out at this latitude and in this climate cuz a climb it's really similar and I've never seen plants that just would not mold and the climate that I'm actually looking out the window at right now or is pouring down rain and it is you know beginning of October so my plans for the rain I mean I don't have anything outdoor said I just moved so it's not a concern for me but obviously here in Southern Oregon we have just a few growers and I know a couple of them and they're all pretty concerned about the amount of rain we're getting right now yeah you know significant concern I would say lots of p.m. as a consumer I would be concerned going to a dispensary yeah hearing about I don't know two to three months probably for some of them yeah Christmas time's gonna be sketchy for buying weed dispensaries over don't buy the pre-rolls do you now by the pre-rolls I would I would cut off pre-roll use like November yeah that's probably safe but yeah a lot of biomass for cartridges is being created right now but this rain a lot of this does yeah so uh what are what are some of the next projects that you're hoping to focus on need talked about working on the Pakistani stuff and some of the Himalayan stuff what are some of the other ones you hope to work on well right now like we just like literally this week just started is we have kind of like not really in the forefront because there's been a lot of people doing other stuff with the Afghan lines and like they're doing some really good work so like Afghan selection on Instagram it's the his handle used to be well it's like Baba Baba 69 something or other he used to have the handle is like Afghan Kush black I mean really nice guy his named Haroon he is based out of mazar-e-sharif he is I went to school to study journalism then the war happened and he a recent one not the Soviet one but so he's around the same age and you know he really passionate about getting cannabis tourism reintroduced to Afghanistan and he's been sharing all the seeds from all his favorite cultivars and regions with you know the online cannabis community now for the last couple of years and the response has been amazing so what we have been doing is we have some of our holders selections from the 60s and 70s that were collected by my father and his friends during that time on the hippie trail and we have that we've been working these lines for an incredibly long time so these are solid you know as solid as as we're comfortable narrowing them down to and so we've taken some of our favorite cuts and we are working on a feminized feminized packs for home growers who want to try these out you know who are may be limited by plant count like an Oregon where you can grow four plants so as really lend well to growing from seed because it's not for mature plants that's just for plants in general like total so you know and I know in other states they have similar you know repressive plant counts now if you're sure about the only value less than having a medical program at this point is it exactly the card you can grow six bonus flower things exactly can have your bedroom and your flowering yeah you can have veg plants at the same time if I'm correct I think it's double the amount that you are registered for so if you can have 1200 implants you can have 24 veg plants yeah and you can have as many under a foot tall so clones basically as many as you want so that's the only value left for like a medical card really unless you count the two extra plants that you get for flowering but it cost you like four hundred bucks or some [ __ ] so oh it's really yeah it's like a cloud cares anyway so I mean the yeah so the feminized seeds like that'll you know like we we haven't up until now like released any and feminized stuff just because I have never been a huge fan of you know the feminized seed craze that kind of swept the scene community in the early 2000s late 90s but with the laws that have passed recently like we were just talking about there is a lot of value in someone being able to you know if they don't want to grow you know from dirty cuttings from a dispensary all they can pick up a pack of seeds and you know get you know at least you know ninety percent female plants I would never say they're a hundred percent feminized because that doesn't exist but you know you'll you'll receive stable you know intersex free feminized seeds or come a nice plant female plants from these and you'll be able to you know see if it's a line you want to work with and if it is then we also have the you know the regular seeds and breeders PACS and you can do all the you know experimenting and the whole point is to get people breeding with this stuff because if people don't and they're gone so like when people buy them you know we we encourage people don't just keep them in your freezer you know like do an open pollination then put you know set aside however many of those in your freezer and then you know play around like play around with these seeds like find your favorites you know if you don't like this line that's okay like you decide that early on and you know hold the seed stock share those with people who might enjoy them and move on to something else like the whole point is to you know get people growing these and get you know get them get them out there get them into the gene pool so we do not lose them yeah that's a great ok so I put all our friends are doing mr. Greenjeans does that vision does that oh the guys out in North West and Canada do a lot of sharing a land race for that very reason so they can get it back like green mr. green jeans has a great story about his cherry bomb how he gave it away and then it lost it and he didn't have it and then a guy gave it to had been breeding it and give it back to him back that's awesome you ankle and only way to ask people what do you look for in a male when you're looking for the right male and your female hunting well that is a again like that's that's can be fairly cultivar dependent I would say in general like working a longer flowering line I will select the more the earlier flowering males but it's generally the opposite you know I'll look for a male that is you know pretty much coal any male out of the population who is showing his sex in veg obviously like that would that's a desirable trait so you know the later flowering males earlier flowering females you know any male that's that's putting off a lot of stink has a strong being profile without even you know a stem rub you know just something that is just a stinker you know males that show resin ultimately though like you know it's just the you know the trial and error if it's gonna pass on you know the traits you want it to pass on if it's gonna you know create [ __ ] then you know it's just about just about trial and error but I mean that's a good starting point at least because it's displaying those traits that you find desirable well that's you have a 50-50 chance you know well it's either gonna not pass those on or it's going to and yeah structure as well because the male is definitely gonna pass on its structure to the subsequent progeny so yeah and any males that have like a nice really strong floral structure is also something that I look for and yeah that's just you know it's about numbers and you know you grow out enough enough seeds and you'll find like just the craziest-looking males that are just you know you're like where did you come from like your ear sticking around you you know yeah especially if he passes on those traits it's like you know that's that's gold so we have a lot of welders definitely with the always include the the Maverick boy you know the male that's like really kind of strange yeah yeah and there's yeah there are some really really really interesting you know male you know there are definitely a lot of breeders that post a lot of pictures of their males but like for the most part it's just you know that the blood porn you see online it's just you know no he's using female flowers but I think it's so much cooler you know when you see just these math inka AKB n-- brains has some really interesting males in his collection he yeah and he's just got some really really really cool males and he I believe he ships to people who request it from some of these so he's got the original Alaskan Thunder fog and some other stuff and yeah it's yeah that's really cool and I think that they're you know like we talked about you know breeders wanting some of these different strains to work with and not really you know in some cases not really realizing what they ask until it's gone I think that in a similar way where you know for so long we were chasing just THC and and now are even getting into you know chasing just high percentages of THC as necessarily being quote unquote better when you know you still have a lot of people that have you know smoked a lot of we even as low as like eight or nine percent THC that still can be really effective whether you even if you're just looking to get high and so I think you know it there'll be some interesting swings back to something like once we get over this like chasing like 30 percent THC streams that you know maybe maybe we'll get back to like you know testing the plants actual effects and how how it really works as opposed to just what its percentages are like the character the character of a high and rather than just the sheer amount of THC or being bombarded with right yeah so much more important you know it's like the I THC is really only good for if you were limited budget and you're only you have twenty bucks and you know certain amount of time really nobody really you can just put a little teeny crumb in there and get really exactly it's like the old Prohibition era you know like oh you know I got to stretch this out is only time that's all every time THC counts at all I swear to God the rest time you know if you have five or six jars you're the connoisseur you know you're rarely gonna choose the strongest one you know yeah especially anything else you know if it's well I understand THC and zero CBD and zero almost every strain that is high in THC rarely has anything else it almost definitely makes the terpene profile one-dimensional you know you've got that really strong sort of turpentine sort of piney maybe a little bit of peppery thing out fun but pretty much nothing else if there is anything else you can't even smell it or detect it under the rest of the you know all high THC strains that I've ever experienced are very one-dimensional in the trip I agree I agree and I think when people start getting over that they're gonna come knocking on your door that's exactly why the the land races and everything or so are so valuable you know it's because you can combine those those traits and stuff like that and and I think going into the future as its cannabis gets to be a lot more available everybody is eventually gonna has the potential to become a connoisseur you know it's relatively inexpensive and easy for them to obtain they're gonna start collecting jars before they know it and as soon as that happens you start really thinking about the you know the different effects you know you notice the differences between all the different jars if you are just going from you know stash to stash in your you know on the limited budget you don't even really have the opportunity to notice differences between the different effects you know what I mean so it is really kind of all about being a connoisseur not that a connoisseur or somebody who's so special and know so much just somebody that's got choices you know what I mean right really is about the choices you're in the connoisseur Club and you know you you get a lot more scent tivity to all the other that's when you know that's when all the different you know becomes a game of like looking for the most different things you know and that's where all the the land races and the things that you're talking about are so incredibly valuable I think it's like a lot of times when you talk to casual smokers you know we'll say like people that you know maybe are spending their 20 bucks on the weekend to smoke me on once or whatever and they keep which is fine you know you can do that but I find a lot of those people are like oh we taste the same to me hmm yeah double for sure I got you know whatever just give me the 20 bucks worth and it you know like it's all the same but there's something but ya know there's some there's some you you know for sure there's some ones that'll really knock them for a loop you know hey we cheap now and then they become connoisseurs as they you know kind of burn out on the on the cheap we and I've you know I've got through Colorado California Jamaica Canada and all these other markets and I've gone through legalization and all of them know and work with clients and those markets and that's exactly what happens in the beginning everyone's super happy and you're always gonna have 30 to 45 percent of the market that just wants their bag of weed like they do not care because they're not educated enough on why they should care and and what what's really interesting is is that especially when you start pairing terpene profiles with with what customers buy you can make super really easy predictions on what they're gonna want to buy and what they're gonna like like to within you know five percent error rate it's kind of stupid because people really like very specific Turkey and profiles they don't realize it but when you actually look at it from an analytic side from the other side of the register it's it's plain as day and that's one thing why you know why it's so silly to me to see states where people don't aren't doing cannabinoid interpreting profile testing is that you know you're you're hurting your sales ability like legit totally yeah for sure health would really consider all that stuff and breeding too you know and I mean I mean I that's I think that's really important to know absolutely so what are some traits that you see in some of the land race varieties that you don't see quite so much in the you know normal production varieties for people that are a little less familiar with you know land racer old school cannabis reproduction I think the entourage effect is far greater in the land race varieties especially varieties that have been selected for resin production or hash production because they weren't selected individually plant by plant they were selected out of out of a field so you'll end up with you end up with height you know high CBD low THC plants you'll end up with one two ones and you know high THC plants and everything in between so I think the trait that you find the most is are these really novel you know not common novel cannabinoids that pop up like CBG and you know some of the others as well as terpenes that you're you know haven't really been around in you know quite some time because they were no they belong to a cultivar that you know just didn't have the prohibition prohibition area selection traits that people were going for which is just massive yield fast finishing and high THC and that's unfortunately still the mindset that most breeders have everyone wants a seven-week finisher like you know when's this gonna finish well probably 9 to 10 weeks oh but it's a pure Afghan well yes but you like traditionally like these are at least usually 10 to 11 week plants you know they usually harvest them when it's snowing you know so I mean I think that's probably the biggest thing is the range of possibilities and a pack of seeds that you get even like that's been you know selected and worked the climate eyes like you're still going to find now a pretty pretty diverse range of expressions even just from one you know 12-pack seeds so and and especially okay so like if you're considering like equatorial varieties which are traditionally extremely high in THC just based on the way they select the plants so it'll be extremely high in THC and most will have almost zero CBD and so you'll find that really prevalent in South Indian genetics you know a lot of equatorial Africans stuff you know South East Asian stuff especially to anything that's been selected for ganja like for flower cultivation by an indigenous population they're selecting those by the flower so like if you're but they're sitting there smoking and they're like ah this is really this is a great bowl we just smoked like they set those seeds aside from that bud and that's what they end up planting the following year and so you know generations of that you're gonna end up with almost no because they're selecting for high THC that's what's you know so you get that you tend to have especially with South South Indian lines you generally get the very very similar incense kind of fruity piney incense aroma generally in those cultivars and I feel like that's probably because those were originally the plants that contained you know the the highest THC and were you know the most desirable to the people that were selecting at the time and and generally like they were selecting for high THC because these were plants that were used you know for spiritual practices up and you know and up until you know modern modern times you know cannabis is still a huge part of no spiritual well just the culture in general in India and you know the Himalayas in Southeast Asia so yeah it's a very good complicated question but yeah well you see a lot of landraces are grown more for for making charas or making you know for resin production and not not for ganja or flowers you know they in your in other parts of the world they refer to flower production is ganja production worse right ash production or resin production so or oil production depending on what part of the world you're in or in some parts that would listen gum instead of charas but yeah what other is there any other maybe unique traits or things that you found maybe just in your own you know phenome hunting and seed searching that you've done that you found working with a lot of land race that really surprised you or was striking or different or unique i think yeah one of the things that I found really striking is you know I think we've all experienced you know like getting a clone and you know it looked a certain way for like the first two crops and grew it once you got it you got it from another grower so he's been growing it in his setup for X amount of years and you get it and you're set up and it looks the same kind of starts to look a little different after that second run and then you know a year later it's a completely different plant and it's a it's a clone so that that I think like most of us have experience that like adaptability and then like witnessing you know are those genetics kind of the epigenetic expressions starting to come out after a bit of time but with the land race genetics what I find so fascinating is how quickly they do this like literally so from seed plant to second-generation clone you will have you will have like in a hundred percent generally speaking especially with the Pakistani stuff I bred just incredibly adaptable the clones will be just completely perfectly adapted to that environment within two or three runs so and that's that's definitely something that I found really fascinating it really really kind of makes you think about you know the environment you're you're putting your plants in and you know the stimuli that they're responding to and the expressions that come out of that stimuli and landrace genetics just tend to have they really take on the characteristics of their surroundings in the the terroir especially if you're growing them outdoors so I because the plants that we grow you know like a mile from the beach compared to the plants we grow up in the mountains like it's nine-day even though you know same latitude just that simple elevation and the slight climate difference at those elevations like makes such a huge difference in Turkey and expression and the cannabinoid profiles that come out yeah have you seen any um you know more increase in twins or any kind of weird binding or weird growth or lace leaf or anything else funky in terms of you know maybe more morphology or anything well I've definitely noticed like in our Chinese populations we've been working through some very interesting mutations coming out so yeah like I've had twins I've had triplets mainly like a lot of arrogation and a lot of basically I would call them albino plants that pop up out of cloned populations so that kind of goes back to the epigenetics drifting I'm gonna call it genetic drift but you know the the adaptations that the clones go through i've had i've had plants go from you know relatively relatively normal-looking girls to you know an entire side of the plant is just completely you know pale yellow to white completely healthy but just you know that's the that's what it's decided to express itself as so it yeah some interesting especially in some of the more primordial populations like up where it's you know in China you know where you've like Yunnan Province especially man the hem Alain read like you know belts that goes all along southern China you can find some really interesting yeah primordial expressions of cannabis that are you know you'll find you know the wide range of he knows that I was describing earlier the different profiles and and and whatnot and a lot of really interesting mutations I was actually I was just looking at somebody's there's that was Australian bastard weed or you know I'm talking about the Timmy see uh yeah I this is this has been like an obsession of mine recently I just think it's so cool who somebody somebody nearby me was just working with this actually but it wasn't from that line it was from something else that they're working and an expression popped up out of the blue during a breeding project and it was it's interesting and I don't know what environmental triggers bring that expression out or if it's you know where it's coming from but there are it's this kind of proof like what we have no idea like you know we've Westerners have been breeding cannabis the way we've been breeding it for you know very short amount of time compared to the rest of the world and so I think going forward you know we're gonna be seeing especially as more people delve into the preservation and breeding and working with land races I think we'll start to see some pretty crazy expressions that you know none of us have had the pleasure of witnessing in our lifetimes have you have you heard about them all yes via the in a perennial the perennials yeah have some land racism all what are your thoughts on that have you worked with it you know I have yeah yeah I got some seeds from Lewis over at a seeds like ten years ago right around when they were first starting to play around with the small stuff and I have never been able to duplicate the and I've heard I've heard this is actually pretty common not being able to duplicate the perennial you know regenerative regenerating trait that the that that cultivar expresses at you know in its native habitat or maybe not native but where it's you know climatized too you know yeah so never had that had a chance to see it do that but I've heard like from a couple other breeders who tried growing it out in Central Africa we're not able to replicate that either but they got the seeds from plants that were from from La Reunion Island that were you know expressing that trait but so I don't know like it's it's kind of one of those things like I'd like to I definitely like this whatever the soil microbe well yeah it's what some people are saying like it's either it's a some people are saying it's the volcanic activity in the magnetic field from all the volcanoes in the island or it's a you know it's the I mean in my opinion it's probably just like the way the plants are being farmed there and the climate lending to you know rejuvenation happening a couple times a year you harvest the tops you know plant grows back grows more tops they you know the one thing I had noticed that like I did do some regeneration in a couple grows and I did notice that as like the farmers say on reunion like that you know after three seasons the plant is that it's its peak so you'll get the best harvest after your third crop out of that plant so the plant in my experience like those the mine does tend to like after two or three runs you know harvesting regenerating harvesting regenerating and that we did that from clones not from seed plants so but yeah we did notice an improvement in quality after the second run so uh yeah I've never tried that with with any other lines though so I don't know if that's specific to that plant but I've also read Edie Rosenthal saying that about just cannabis in general so I don't know I've always found that clones in my opinion I found that when I clone a plant that about the third third time I go third run I get the best results because of the adaptation like you say to the environment yeah and that's why I found that to be pretty you know for 20 years I'm seeing that you know if you start cloning it's that third run on the clone and it seems to really take to your style of growing in whatever environment that's been you know growing in what do you look for when you're when you're doing your clone selections like for a mom like when you're you know I floor that I like the best yeah just in general I work for a seed bank so I I kind of have I keep going through different ones and I don't clone a lot I did for a couple years but I got tired of it and everybody was doing a land race thing so I got some lands so I'm in the middle of starting up doing a little bit of breeding now which I didn't really care to do before but you know after a while I just get sick of hearing about everybody is doing this cool stuff and you're not so but I I choose clones by whatever like if I grow three or four different cultivars or strange hybrids or whatever or whatever I like the best is the ones I keep though you know whatever I like the way the plant looks you know that's about yeah not a big breeder so you know that's where that's the limit of mine is what I've cloned yeah sorry about that and I thought I lost God said did my some issues with my mute and unmute for whatever reason them I think so is there anything else you wanted to share with us what are some of the other things that you would recommend to people that are maybe trying to get into breeding land race or maybe run into some challenges or some frustrations you know with their own land race preservation projects I would just say like don't bite off more than you can chew like it's your your depending on how how I don't want to say raw because these are well worked by the people we you know who've been keeping them for all these years but you know don't bite off more you can chew because it is a time-consuming process so start with you know start with a line that you are passionate about because ultimately this you have to be in order to you know stick with this kind of work yeah just find a find a region that you're fascinated by you know part of the world but you know you just you know that captures your imagination and a call or a culture that you find you know just because for me I studied anthropology and you know it's so like it's the it's the relationship between you know the the people in the plant and the I feel like just consuming the cannabis that in its in its you know in the form that it's been selected you know by that specific village or that valley for however many years like it's it's such an insight into you know what's important to that culture and and it's kind of like a window into you know what what what's in to these people and and helps you kind of relate to them on a certain level that I don't think you really could otherwise and because cannabis is in these in these places it's such an intricate part of their their lives it's it's it's so interweb and that it's it really does give a lot of insight into you know what these what is important to to these people so but yeah if you're getting into it you know just be get inspired and let that inspiration carry you through the project because that's what will do it and you will like it from persevere you're looking footing you will succeed like it's just about having patience and you know don't you know don't take on more than one project at a time especially if you're starting off with this kind of stuff like it's really important to just you know stay focused know what your goals are that's really important like knowing what your goals are and like what your selecting poor cuz you could go off in a thousand different directions and and yeah just you know don't be discouraged if you end up with some seeded buds because there's nothing wrong with seeded buds people been smoking them for a very long time and know it hash is great too you know like that's you know basically no get out yeah get some good hash making equipment because you'll be making a lot of hash most likely and yeah just have fun and remember while you're doing it anything else you wanted to share with our listeners before we let you go oh no I it was a pleasure chatting with you all today well let's tell everybody how to find you and your website your Instagram and all that stuff and we'll make sure that's in the description as well yeah so you can find us on instagram under landrace underscore preservation underscore society and also through old underscore world underscore organics underscore LLC and the website where you can find and purchase genetics that we've been discussing is land race preservation society dot org awesome thanks for all the amazing work you've been doing and keep up the good fight and you know I look forward to hearing what some of our listeners do with some of your genetics in the future oh yeah me too and I appreciate you having me on love your attitude and yes yeah you want well you know as we move the show on if you want yeah I'll stick around oh well uh what do you really appreciate it man what do you been up to there mr. Greenjeans oh I don't have too much to report doing a lot of outdoor growing watching a lot of Cherry Bomb plants flower outdoors here in Los Angeles at 33 degrees latitude it's awesome you know I'm getting Hugh there the huge some of them are big old trees that's pretty exciting uh yeah not much else um yeah not much to report that was a fantastic talk by the way Patrick really great excellent guest we had tonight huh I just wanted to add one thing I thought of while you were talking about was the and I think you were kind of alluding to this a little bit Patrick was the that you know actually new stuff does seem to kind of appear out of nowhere in terms of smells and tastes terpenes it is it isn't exactly true that I mean I've experienced that a number of times I've seen it happen a whole bunch of times you know in my in my experience that something brand new pops out that as far as I could tell wasn't really you know there in either of one of the lines that it came from you know was not not a particularly in the areas of smells you know like yeah turkey wings and things like that I've definitely seen brand new smells come out and this is many many times so so you know the idea that variability that we're in danger of losing variability I'm not sure about that I think that there has been a lot of carelessly read stuff you know and maybe you know a lot of stuff related too much to too much stuff you know well we've even seen that with aquaponics as well or aquaponics seems to activate whole other terpenes that are just not found in that and equal again and that's exactly right and it could be something like this you know it could be you know you know genetic drift or whatever we used to call it back in the day I had a we actually got an email this week from the show last week or a comment I believe I don't remember where it was from because we have I get so we have so many different places we upload the show now I just I don't know where the comment was from but it was from somewhere that said hey we should do a show just on flavor and I think it'd be really cool to do just to show on on how to increase flavor and things that we've found and things that you know other guests have brought up over the three years or for however long we've been doing this pipe yeah I had cultivation methods I mean it's really amazing one thing I've noticed recently since I've really been running seriously running out of space and setting plants outdoors were literally just into the backyard you know to finish flowering is you know how much the quality of the Sun the sunlight is so much better than any of the indoor so yeah I haven't really used LEDs and I'm sure they they they maybe are a lot closer to the sunlight but when you put plants out and they're you're not doing anything different you know other than you know I mean it's exactly in the same container the only difference is you're setting it outside and giving it sunlight and yeah after one week the difference in the terpene profile is pretty obvious you know when you pick no you smell that plant and you you know what I mean it's definitely oh yeah for sure so just that alone at which probably I assume is just ultraviolet light although it might be also cooler temperatures at nighttime then they're getting indoors that might help us well but it's probably mostly the the quality of the sunlight I think yeah they're just adaptations in general they have to go under or go through - I know be in those conditions you know after about 10 days it's it's a it's pretty striking the difference you'll see and be able to smell you know for sure yeah yeah so you know I mean I remember people people with a lot of people believe that indoor grown cannabis was better than outdoor you know Indo is totally not the only reason we have indoor is out of necessity I feel like we'd have a lot more northern latitude varieties for growers if prohibition had never been issue you know we we'd have all kinds of cultivars you know if we've been doing all this breeding for the last 40 years but with 50 years with you know large populations of plants you know we weren't where because I think that's you know something you're touching on I don't think it's careless breeding I'm sure in some cases that's definitely the case but I feel like a lot of it is just you know people were working with what they had in the space they had and it's you know if you could if you know a lot of people can I mean I'm sure you guys can all remember the days and like everyone you got to keep it under 9999 or under because you know otherwise you're you know you're you're pushing the limit there that five-year mandatory minimum technically technically if I just had to have this conversation with someone in Oklahoma is that if you are the the so Congress passed a bill in 2014 and that what that bill does is that protects cannabis producers only if you abide by state law are you exempt from federal law if you do not abide by state law those federal laws apply so you still if you're in flagrant violation of those federal laws are in state laws rather they absolutely can charge you with that even to this day can charge you with that you know five-year minimum for our for every one hundred brother I had to explain that explicitly to someone who refused to listen it to putting a fence up just to stay compliant it was completely idiotic but it's just one of those hey man you know you do buy the book or you don't do it like you're gonna if we're gonna do it for legal business like stop [ __ ] around yeah exactly yeah that surprises me that just blows my mind somebody gets that far into that big of a farm you know like I know what your farm you're talking about and and they won't finish putting up the fence I mean come on you got 400 and some plants and you don't have a fence up you are not in compliance you know no I know Steve wouldn't talk to him and talk to the doctor and I don't understand it at all that's all you can do and it's an is something that you know to a fury consultant and someone's not abiding by a law don't be afraid to walk away there is nothing wrong with walking away from a non-compliant you know you know customer especially if you're a consultant and reason why you should risk what you're doing and risk your livelihood because someone else is greedy because no reason that whatsoever because like speed would you know told us all the the whole point of it is is that if as a consultant you're liable to to be and if you're on that property in that grower yeah but if you're in the grow right I mean you're pretty much oh yeah I mean if you're on site absolutely yeah yeah you're liable so that's why you can walk away if it's not seekers you don't want to ruin your life and your license or your ability to be a consultant you know because you never know how to law take shift you get arrested you may be banned from doing that you know it's you never know no that's why you got already well anything else there mr. Greenjeans and are you working on some new some new lions or seeds I [Music] dude that's that is kind of true thanks to you you know I'm around with your or without you know that the the blue hash of course I crossed a delegate did you guys ever get any of the seeds of that crust with white wizard did I give any of those to you or those wings I have a few no I didn't get any yeah now that would be in that would be a bit fun and we I think we only had one not being a male of the six that we popped or four that we popped we didn't pop a ton we do there are some that we were kind of phenome hunting in and then some that we just didn't have a ton of money and so yeah that's on a time in rather ya know so you didn't get to finish the experiment either did you oh you know I know what's going on I also made seeds off the Shirley Temple plan I think I crossed I think I crossed it with a phage Oh a cush male I don't know what anybody was going to my daughter is growing out ones off of your flow chem dog that's a good lawyer now it sounds Stacy yeah and but so I crossed that also with them my fado a coach male yeah so Hugh's gone she's calling a couch dog Oh pictures you sent me those pictures up that's true yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah they're just huge trees and she was a little worried that they were starting kind of laid up there and I'm sure you know that course they need to finish as quick as possible but I knew those were I knew they were that at both sides finished fast both sides a little bit you know sometimes stuff doesn't start flowering right away but we'll still catch up in and finish faster than something else of course yeah yeah but anyway I both sides both the flow chem dog and and phage oh of course you like that so I was able to tell her I was able to tell yeah well when they get going though they'll start finishing up fast she and lest she communicated she was like yeah you're right they're finishing really critical so like working out okay in Southern Oregon but you know that's pretty it's always pretty chancy you know taking seeds of genetics and groan um outdoors just hey you know it's indoor grown indoor bread Beano and stuff like that it's a gamble oh yeah and then you know the thing is that I think one reason why my stuff has been successful outdoors I mean I've read Cherry Bomb like 13 generations indoors probably or 14 before I started giving it out in the early 2000s and I think the reason is that I've never really used I've always used like a 16-8 veg cycle I have never used that long a longer day length and so that I'm fairly certain translates better towards outdoor growing because if you think there really isn't any place in the continental US that has a day longer than 16 something is there you got to go up to Alaska actually the longest in the lower 48 we had this discussion we had an argument before I believe it was 14 and a half hours in the lower 48 was the longer night isn't even that long but yeah yeah by the way I wanted to say this I've started interruptive mr. Corinthians just real quick to Patrick when you were talking about photo periods there nobody on this panel ever probably been just more than 16 hours of light and we're more worried about the dark commercial stuff we're doing 18 but I would never get 20 and it blows my mind that people do 24 hours of light on on anything in fact I've you've talked about this on the show on on both equatorial stuff for a gym mix have gotten from Jamaica and CBD cultivars when I run them on 24 hours of light they'll throw nanners like straight veg they'll throw nanners but if you switch the same cultivars to 16 or 18 hours and give them a night time they stop throwing nanners and they won't harm on you anymore I've seen that people think plants don't grow at night I mean absolutely crazy well the root zone is more active at night there's hormones that are solely produced about sleeping the same as a human we have hormones and enzymes and proteins that are only made while we're arresting and and plants are no different fact they're even more reliant on it because their microbial interaction changes dramatically and what like in their their internal microbiome those those ratios change quite a bit from my time to day time that's what you can even measure that if you actually check when you do a Brix test if you check the pH of the SAP my time to daytime there's even a small amount of change you see this quite a bit even in large aquaponic systems if you check the pH from nighttime to daytime it'll be as much as point four different point two two point four different because of the microbial interactions just because of the stuff you know consuming different minerals from daytime to nighttime and different amounts of oxygen and and co2 and everything else in the water I learned this from UK growers who are all loved sativas okay they don't they don't the real I don't know why but I guess it's the high THC but I was taught years ago about a decade ago to tell you when I do a s or better grow it at twelve twelve after after you get the seedling started and you want to put it in beds and do you do at twelve twelve all the way through and it severe it extremely retards the finishing time so you can get something done in a in a in the eight to ten weeks or so instead of twelve to sixteen well you know is interesting there is a I was recently in a talk and they were showing how they had quite a wide variety of different cultivars and almost all of them stopped between day thirty and forty of grow of flower in terms of vertical growth which I thought was real interested not you know bud development but in terms of you know internodal spacing I thought that was really interesting that had you know free radical different difference in genetics and having that that same kind of stopping Korea now I'm sure there are some sativas for sure that don't follow that rule but it was really interesting to see that kind of uniformity in production strains well it helps to instead of stretching all at once for two weeks after reason for inducing flower it's constantly just adapting the stretching tool and becomes uniform I think that's what it is you know so what about what about anything else there are mysteries I know I'm gonna see you next week yeah and I don't know what we'll do a definitely do a thing we're gonna do is I'd next week because I'm going to be traveling I'm gonna be on the road so we're gonna see if I can fit them in Thursday is gonna be we'll see we'll see it's gonna be rough that week but we're gonna try we're definitely gonna have some video content I just don't know if we're gonna have normal shows because the scheduling with where I'm gonna be so and for anyone interested I will be in Long Beach California on Tuesday I'm speaking at 10:00 a.m. at the California cannabis business associations conference on an aquaponic cannabis cultivation and it's put on by the National cannabis Association which is a really cool if anyone's interested in checking that out so it's a lot of fun and and then I'll also be up at new West summit in San Francisco or now Oakland next week as well for those of you that are interested in hanging out or getting together let me know I think I'm sure we'll find time to pop over to the Castro Castle and say hi to Wayne and Jeff and go over there and you never know who else we might bump into there's some pretty cool people we're working on trying to arrange some meetings with some pretty cool stuff that we're gonna be doing while we're in California this trip and you never know where else I might pop up at and um yeah I think oh wait to my segment and I'll talk a little bit more about what I've been doing maybe you did do a castle podcast because I'm on Thursday night that'd be a stretch I'll be in Auckland yeah yeah it's the closest you're gonna get without being there here so what what do you been up to there Roger yeah we're just going still going through our hemp compliance licensing and stuff for my farm things are kind of slowing down because of the time of year and all we're we're still in - we still had summer-like weather here hot hot humid as hell but Nick I've had I got great news that I looked at the projected forecast over the next few weeks and next week it looks like we're gonna have 70 degree days and start going towards a nice fall climate which I'm I am ready for I got so much work to do and you can only get so much done in a hundred degree heat so I feel you so much we finally got a very first day of 70s in Oklahoma and it's like whole like I literally just there was like okay this is the excuse I needed to walk for us to go get lunch like yeah aren't you nice out to stay inside but it's gonna be beautiful that's better just trying to clean up I'm really looking forward to it because I'm gonna get to clean up my farm we're redoing my greenhouse and we've not been able to do it because my partner's been just because of the heat not subsiding as it would into fall normally see normally in September we start getting 70 to 80 degree days we had two of them and then it went back up into the mid-90s and so he's a HVAC guy so shout out to Ryan hey buddy he he's just been blowing up you know would be doing AC work because of the summer and never subsided but so we're all excited about getting together and and getting know my greenhouse back online and that's the number one thing we're trying to do now and of course I'm playing with stuff I got I got some nice nice genetics from our friends of the show kaya Malik and Wendy going and I'm getting ready to put them in Flour allegedly and that's about it they you know just trying to take care and hang in there and keep a good attitude amongst all this depressing world that we live in oh it ain't depressing Trump's about to get himself impeached he literally talked about a bunch of stuff that was pretty teachable on live on TV today when I watched him so it was pretty awesome oh you like there's a little bit of Hope in the world so but okay Oh note that I would just say no you watch Timothy I care yeah well no I popped up on my phone you know what I could get a good giggle on because you guys anyways I don't want to get into too much in politics that's not good I don't think it's good I think that the vast majority of our listeners are do not think of Trump favorably and we'll leave it at that anyway everything's going pretty good here the estranged wife has been coming home a little bit more and I think she's finally you know chilling out a little bit so we're having a lot more harmony here than the last couple two-and-a-half years or so and yeah that's enough it's two and a half you were talking about how long the show was i I was talk I was thinking about the other night and I joined the show about two and a half years ago we're almost at two and a half years I've been doing it with you guys over a year before that yeah yeah I don't have I can't get into all the details I would like to get into yet because I have to wait on the press release to go out but we're gonna be doing a big-ass project in Africa one of the bigger projects going on in Africa there'll be a press release at some point in the next very short while with a bunch more details but that's what's been keeping me busy and what I've been doing and why I've been zipping all over all kinds of cool places and hanging out with all kinds of cool people that are gonna help us along the way so that's what I've been doing and why I've been very quiet for a minute that I pulled into this bigger project with some of the great people and working with you and yeah it's kind of snowballed into something that it's far bigger than I could have ever imagined and it's really cool so we're gonna get a chance to talk about that here in a few weeks but we'll be doing some filming over there and once that happens once I transition over to there I think we're just gonna do live on Thursdays and then do a recorded show on Tuesdays and then get some of the guys there's a whole list of guests that we've not been able to get because we've been able to you know happen to do evening shows or weird time zones or like Jorge Cervantes him and I have played tag more times than I can count trying to get him on the show he's in Spain and a handful of other breeders are in Spain that we get on you know our Jean is in Netherlands it's a [ __ ] to get him on the show so there's a couple of other you know European people African people and other people will be working with that we'll be able to do some recorded episodes and and you know stuff on weird timelines that and just you know more personal interviews and I think that'll be really cool later on towards the end of the year beginning a next year when I never miss all uh you know whenever in the move date comes which is gonna come sooner than later so that's what I've been up to so we're looking at a couple of different countries in southern Africa that we have different assets and already and that's what I've been doing so let's give you a lot of fun and far bigger than anything I've worked on yet so I'm super stoked on that I'm glad you chose Thursday I was gonna suggest that I'm glad you did that so it makes me feel good and the record it's really great cuz yeah you only be a couple hours two or three hours difference from Jorge's time when you get over there - yeah that should work out yep of course I'm available 24 hours a day so you know I'm always gonna be here if Steve allows me so yeah it's gonna be really cool we're gonna we're gonna do a little bit of our own strain hunting in a couple of countries I'm actually actually talked to the woman and I'm gonna go do it with but once we get set up we're gonna get their plan out what we're doing we already have a bunch of seeds and stuff lined up that out and then go find some local stuff to work on you know and and then read that up and then you know work on you know crossbreeding up some of those local cultivars trying to find some more THC V cultivars and work on some other cool unique stuff that we have in the works some pretty cool partners and some really amazing people again I gotta I gotta keep my tongue tied until the press release coats out but goes out but I did get permission at least enough to to say that as much as I was allowed to say today so yeah it's like he's been telling us for like three months yeah I got a new thing but I can't talk about although talk about it it's hard when you're like yeah that's cool you know we have a fate you know we're looking at well I should keep the details but we're looking at building on a very large greenhouse facility right off the bat along with some other cool stuff that were working on so but you can't talk about it so well I once they release the press release I can talk about all of them yeah I know that it's like to mess with your kid since it's the first time you had met well we were supposed to it was supposed to be out and then good things keep happening every week so we keep pushing it back because we keep adding good things can't complain when it's good reasons so but yes so that's what I've been up to and just working on and working on you know sourcing beneficial insects in southern Africa and working on Bennett sourcing all the different things that we're used to having here in the Western Hemisphere trying to find them over there and and what is nice is that you know there's a lot of things that are getting pretty expensive in the United States because of the tariffs that Trump has caused with China well they don't have tariffs in Africa with China so it's pretty nice that a lot of the stuff is actually about 1/3 cheaper and we're pricing out the growing stuff it's kind of funny yeah you wouldn't really think that but so yeah and then one last thing here will Marty and I are working on the we have the class coming up last August a little climber October 17th through the 20th we'll be teaching a four day intensive commercial aquaponic cannabis class at Marty's farm in Gold Hill Oregon just outside of Medford literally just on the outskirts of Medford so everything about coming out there if not we will also be offering the class Alive online for the first time for the commercial course we go through a whole almost an entire day of microbes and nutrients and then the first day is basics aquaponics cannabis 101 and aquaponics 101 on cannabis 101 and then we do a whole day of design and management and plants you know plant training and all the different things like that and the fish and whatnot and they were do a day of system design and system you know management and you know protocols and business stuff and all the other kind of portions of the you know industry that you end up running into and a little bit on extraction you know we'll go through some hands-on extraction stuff I know Marty's got some cool stuff going on over there and I know we have a couple of other neighbors that he's gonna he's hoping to get us some access to for some tours of some outdoor stuff as well depending on on what's been chopped down yet or not so we're hoping to make it a really cool experience and you know we'll have plenty of cannabis to smoke there and you know quite a good time we provide lunch and you'll get a booklet that has all kinds of detailed information as a reference guide with the course as well and then some shared digital files so that you have four references and we also cover MIT pest management microbials be over microscope work how do we analyze stuff with the microscope how to analyze your nutrients and a dose your nutrients I know Roger has been through the the two day class actually both of you guys have been through the class yeah I want to say it's an excellent class and to be at Marty's farm from what I've seen it is so beautiful up there in the mountains and it's gonna be awesome if you guys can make it this would be the class it the most informative cannabis business class business / cannabis - everything including bugs and everything that you could possibly think of going to and yeah I I couldn't recommend it more yeah and then last time we taught it up a Dutch blues farm that was a lot of fun we had Mike West show up and he was really cool so you never know who what other kind of cannabis experts might show up to our class I know we have a couple that are talking about coming down right now who will leave one on of us because it's always fun to surprise people so but but yeah and if not you know you can always join us online we'll be live-streaming the whole course on zoom so you can check us out on there if and by an online ticket as well for those of you who can't travel maybe you're on a different continent you can happily join us that way so yeah and then we're working on thanks to a big friend of the show we're almost ready to launch work just a 2 to 3 weeks away from launching we have a bunch of merch we're going to launch on four aquaponic cannabis growing and regenerative farming and all the proceeds at least for the aquaponic cannabis stuff is gonna go to just the server costs and everything else with zoom it got a little bit more expensive to host the the podcast this year there we also pay to host this you know course on on video and audio de to re-upload it everywhere so that's you know available in iTunes and everywhere else so we're just gonna use it for that wasn't happen to be fully transparent about all of that I mean we'll make sure that gets published up on the website and quarterly or you know twice a year or something like that so that you guys have a transparent way of knowing what's going on with the funds from that you know not looking to to profit off of it in any way it'd just be nice if the podcast could pay for itself a little bit and that's really all we're trying to do but we had a member of the community really step up but she's also willing to offer free of you know cert a service for people you know breeders or anyone you know from the show that's wanting to get their own merch and gear up on there you know she can get it up on there and there's no upfront cost in terms of investment for you know you get your designs you do it all for yourself and we'll be able to facilitate that for for breeders and Friends of the show that are looking to get some some representation for their their their brand and and their seeds and all that stuff that maybe just don't have money for the you know to have merch you know a lot of us are on shoestring budgets and and she's gonna help people out quite a bit and once the store is uh pliable we'll get her on the show to to talk about it so to be really cool and remember happy to help and happy to have someone that's part of our community that's this trying to help us out as well and we're very grateful and grateful to be able to help other people is at the same time that will be cool that's all come yeah yeah so alright well I think we'll wrap up the show on that note why don't you tell everybody had to find you there Pat before we let you go yeah yeah you can find us on instagram at landrace underscore preservation underscore society and land race Preservation Society org is the site where you can come and check out our genetics and you know purchase them awesome there's a lot of people looking for landrace out there listen to the show that are super stoked to find out about you what about you Roger oh you can find me Roger Lakewood at Instagram Facebook which I really love seeing a lot more people posting some stuff on Facebook even though it's the evil Facebook it's easy for me to communicate being legally blind and of course I run the forums that I love growing marijuana calm and you're welcome to come there and share your information possibly if you're if you've got a special category that we would need to open I even offer that to people you know like I would love to have a brief category if I could get some breeders to sign up and start putting their stuff now we have a seed bank so I don't think that the company would want to allow sales of it but I think we could have a breeder it's good like a discussion category if people wanted to do that we we've had a lot of breeders on the show and they've all been great so and thanks again Patrick you were fantastic tonight I I love your sense of humor and all - you know nice to hear people take take things real seriously but have a sense of humor and laugh at things - yes sorry if I cut you off there I didn't mean to you did you cut me off no I'm a I think I cut off Patrick a little bit there didn't mean to I'm sorry all right what about us green jeans yep Green jeans garden calm email me or I have an Instagram account - I think it's mr. green jeans guard yeah I think yeah thanks you guys have great show Patrick yeah thanks dad well thanks for having me guys this is fun we also need to give a shout out for Marty who's probably going to bed 80 meds at Chico and straight almost gave his email but he says that uh at patreon or at Instagram and then I'm not sure what is he well he's part of the aquaponics cannabis growers group on Facebook so that's probably the best way to catch Marty yeah that's also you can find this video for 5,000 growers that grow aquaponic cannabis over on Facebook cannabis Facebook growers group and you can find out oh I forgot to mention the class the the website is a a pmj class calm and there's also a link to it in the description as well and yeah I think that's gonna do it for this week you can find out more than any of the video episodes on important products

join the coalition and defeat a common enemy and contested Alaskan and Canadian airspace red flag Alaska is an exercise that provides a realistic perspective on how to fight in an air-to-air conflict it's the chance for our fighters to fight before they get over to the war and our role as tankers is to allow that to happen we keep them in the air longer so that they have more opportunity to practice throughout the two-week exercise McConnell tankers will support Ally aircraft including the Republic of Korea Air Force Air self-defense force a wing bomb runs it's the aggressors where we're overseas we do refuel more than just Americans we do operate out in the battle space with our coalition brethren it kind of further defines the meaning of one team one fight we're used to using that term across our own military but now we're talking about other countries other nations military as well that we operate with it unifies us in a better way the exercise will strengthen relations with our allies while providing valuable experience to our air crews there is a chance that your newest boom operator might not have deployed yet it's their first exposure it increases their experience level because you'll have so many fighters that we have to work through the boom I'll float gas to and get them on their way to the fight a less experienced boom their head might catch on fire just because they're not used to having to deal with all those receivers at one time the end result will be a more effective delivery and warfighting support when they need to execute and sustain rapid

well want to welcome everyone to the March meeting of the finance efficiency economy and sustainability subcommittee will start this meeting like we start all meetings of the subcommittee with the Pledge of Allegiance counselor I'm wearing would you lead us in the pledge please to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible deliver he showed us all right thank you very much we our first item today is the minutes of our februari meeting of this subcommittee I would entertain a motion for approval of the minutes so move okay all right we have a motion in a second any discussion all in favor please say aye aye all opposed motion passes unanimously we have several items today but wondering if if my colleagues don't object we'd like to take one item out of order item number seven which is the capital improvement project procurement protest policy changes to any of my colleagues have an objection to take that one out of order okay great then we'll go ahead and move on to that one good afternoon i'm used to saying good morning at these meetings / special afternoon meeting a little bit of a change well good after a good afternoon mr. chair and members of the subcommittee I'm kini knutson the city engineer for this street industry Transportation Department for the City of Phoenix up here with Julie Cree this isn't city attorney and we're both going to be talking about an item that has come before this subcommittee previously we were here in February to talk about the procurement policy changes regarding our CIP procurement so the procurements that govern our design and construction procurements we're looking at making some changes to their our policy or city code ordinance that governs the our protest policy and the subcommittee here asked us to come back with some additional information and so we're here today to present that information as long as provide as well as to provide a little bit of a summary of what we did last time so without further ado as I mentioned this is an existing policy that we have in place it's in chapter 2 article 12 of the existing city code it hasn't been updated last time I was updated in 2007 and our last updates were to incorporate additional procurement methods that the state had allowed us and authorized us to do construction management risk job order contracting and design build and so that that's what happened the last changes in 2007 this time we're going to make me suggesting some changes more for efficiency's sake and some purposes of clarity with the policy so what those changes are is some clear definitions we've got some clarifications of the authority for me as the city engineer what my part of this process also in and to be able to make some clarity of when we have protests come up that we can treat them both informally and formally through a hearing process or without a hearing process and also just a clear flow in structure for the protest policy to make it more chronological a little bit more logical flowing for people who may be interested in protesting a city procurement dealing with CIP / q projects one thing I would like to make sure mention is that this is an administrative process not a legal process this is intended for us to have an administrative process for dealing with protest or procurement issue before the baby come before City Council for award or contract action so what things have changed since the last time we were here in February one thing we wanted to do is probably give a scale because we do have two major types of procurements in the city we do have a CIP procurements which governed the design and construction procurements which we were talking about today and also goods and services your general goods and services types of procurements and we wanted to kind of show the numbers when we were talking about the number of procurements we've had over the last few years and also the number of protests we've had over the last few years in general we've had about 150 different procurements out there on the street in the last two years on the design and construction side and of those we've had about six protests over that period of time about a four percent rate if you look at that in comparison about we're about a third of the number of requirements that the goods and services procurements have but their protest rate is about five percent but that just gives you a little bit of a relative basis of what how many protests were actually talking about when we're talking about these policy changes additionally we also we had to did some engagement and outreach before the last meeting and februari what we had conducted additional outreach to make sure that we were covering everything that we needed to cover in the industry when we're making some some policy changes here we did some outreach with additional outreach with the construction community both the associate generous oshi ated general contractors of Arizona and also the Arizona builders alliance those deal with the vertical and horizontal construction type projects that we have here in the state also with their the American Council of engineering companies the Arizona chapter here who represents the engineering companies that we deal with on these types of procurements I would say in general their their their input has been neutral or positive we did receive a couple different comments as we were going and drilling down with some of the membership some folks within the individual memberships of these industries and we're able to incorporate actually some changes into the policy not substantial changes but really some changes that help clarify for their purposes and those were reflected in the report as well all that Julie talked a little bit about the outreach that was done on the legal side as well the folks we deal with on protests that we generally deal with as you can see we we reached out to three different firms and a couple different people in each of those sorry a couple different people in each of those firms we did receive good feedback they liked the changes they thought it made it more clear we did make one minor change that we received from Fenimore Craig recommendation and it was just a clarification on the days for allowed to make a protest on there's different triggers and they wanted to make it clear it was the earliest whichever trigger so we did receive the feedback another was just clarification of some of the policies we reached out and talk to that attorney and clarified some of those issues so so at the end that concludes my presentation were we're seeking the support of the subcommittee if possible on our protest policy changes and if the subcommittee is supportive of it this will be coming before the formal count of formal meeting of the City Council later to adopt these changes and incorporate them into the city code all right well thank you for that report and the additional outreach that you've done which which this subcommittee asks you to do so I appreciate that we do have a card from David Martin not to speak but available to speak if requested would you like to to say anything at all about these have proposed changes thank you for being here today sure mr. chairman thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak just want to let you know that a GC is in support of the proposal in front of you but I'd like to dovetail it into something that I think is important for you all to know I think the quality of work that was done here is something that we can take as a template to the state legislature believe it or not we don't have a set protest policy for job order contracting for construction manager risk or design build and I think the work that the staff has done here is provided an excellent opportunity for us to discuss this at a higher level the other thing that the proposal does is it really puts nice and cleanly the process in chronological order which we really really appreciate and so we appreciate the outreach that they did to our organization and let you know that we're in support wonderful thank you so much any questions from my colleagues I think all right thank you for being here any questions or comments from from my colleagues or you know additionally would you know emotion would be germane as well motion approved in a second any any comments at all you all right well if there's no discussion then all in favor please say aye aye all opposed motion passes you name it's like thank you so much for your effort and sounds like it might be of some assistance down the street so appreciate it maybe again if my colleagues don't object may be continued going a little out of order here and jump on to item 8 which is the Family Medical Leave Act whatever you want okay super all right come on down good afternoon mr. chairman members of the board I'm Blair Johnson on the city's human resources director I'm coming back to talk to you to kind of close an earlier item that we came before this committee which was with regard to the Family and Medical Leave Act and we the human resources staff came to you in the fall of 2015 with regard to looking at the process we would look at either internally or externally at managing the administration of this so this summary provides you that update and some recommendations just to kind of recap some of the goals the things that we're certainly concerned about as an organization as an employer is to be fair and consistent with our Family Medical Leave Act we are looking as an organization to substantiate longer-term issues through recertification simplifying the process or employees and for our supervisors and also certainly improving visibility and reporting to our operating departments so they have a better sense of who's not at work when they're due back those kinds of things overall obviously an important part of this committee and what we're looking at is also reducing costs and so that was one of the concerns and one of the focuses of the RFP I just want to recap on the next item some recent progress so that you having to advance this I apologize just recap these for you this is my inaugural at this committee so you'll bear with me so it's a recent progress and then again this is just a root cap some things that we had talked about with the community that we were going to do that we actually have done so we have now as an organization centralized FMLA administration that happened in January of 2016 so that has been completed we came to this committee and talked about I'm changing the tracking method FMLA has various different options and working with outside counsel as well as looking at other organizations we looked at best practice and that was adopting a rolling backward leave calendar that is now in place and has been communicated we also updated the FMLA policy for city operations that was in January of 2016 we're now using a recertification requirement that's annual previously that was every other year so again a little bit more attention to that and then probably most importantly for this group one of the things we also talked about was meeting with all of our labor partners to look at the solutions that were amenable to our employee groups to operating departments and managers our human resource practitioners we did all that before coming back and that's what I'm going to go into now in terms of kind of some recommendations so current status just to kind of recap some of the important numbers when the decision was made to centralize FMLA in human resources the number I'd call your attention to is the 677 thousand-dollar number that's the equivalent or the value of the nine positions that were centralized in human resources so in our mind that's the number that we want to benchmark against in terms of the costs to look at what's most effective we did the RFP again to compare the costs of looking at internal versus external we had five vendors respond to our RFP we identified as a subcommittee of labor partners human resource and department folks brought that down to three semi-finalists and they present it on site and then again we're coming back here today with the recommendation on what that looks like I won't review this each item but this is just from the professional association of society of HR management it's kind of a good benchmark to ask the question should we as an organization be outsourcing and you can see we really fit many of these categories with in terms of the size of the organization the decentralization were obviously a service organization that operates across many departments and really one of the goals here is to use technology and best practice to really streamline that process so again looking at what other organizations are doing in the time since we undertook this last fall the city of Dallas Texas is now looking at the same model following our direction and Fulton County Georgia is also looking at doing else we're starting to see some more activity in the public sector this is certainly not uncommon in the private sector in terms of outsourcing this so what I tried to do to kind of lay the options that were before us we wanted to come to you or to create three lanes and the far left lane is a centralized model obvious that we've already accomplished that but keeping the work internal the far right is an outsourced model and the center is what I'm calling a hybrid model and this is essentially the best of both in our minds the pricing are again on these three options is most favorable in the center or the hybrid solution it's a five-year pricing agreement one of the things that was very important to us with employees groups and with the labor unions is we didn't want any surprises when it came to contracting terms we were a little concerned about any incentives or disincentives based on utilization in other words you know we didn't want to give the impression we're going to drive down the cost by denying claims if people have legitimate FMLA claims we wanted to make sure they had the chance to avail themselves of that so well some vendors had pricing reopen errs or they had triggers that would change that we really wanted to avoid that and so as you can see in terms of kind of some of the pricing the hybrid solution is a hundred and ninety seven thousand dollar annual cost that's for the vendor relationship to manage all of our FMLA outsourced the reason we call it a hybrid solution is we're still the employer and we still have to have involvement and we think it's very important in terms of keeping our eye on that vendor relationship but also connecting with our employees so the hybrid is keeping some city staff still focused on FMLA and that's that two hundred thousand dollar cost so what you see is the options the outsource was the most expensive and it was more than the 677 thousand we talked about so that wasn't an option on the right the six hundred and fifty thousand dollar option on the left the internal is not only a more expensive than the other hybrid solution but we don't benefit from the expertise that the vendor has the systems the infrastructure the legal expertise so the middle solution at three hundred and eighty seven thousand dollars saves us about three hundred thousand dollars or two hundred eighty thousand dollars a year in terms of that 677 thousand dollar cost that's the hybrid solution and then just to kind of recap as I've got here so the recommendation is the lowest cost solution which is the hybrid solution against a five-year pricing guarantee doesn't have any of the ties to pricing one of the things that's very important to our employee groups and I think our supervisors is the simplicity of having one call so that we can administer and track that information again it's a hybrid because it has this internal advocate or liaison piece those are also individuals that frankly can keep an eye on the contract service level agreements performance audits you know are we actually getting the value from the contract and again being there have been available for our employees so next steps that we were asking for the committee is to recommend that we take this forward it would be a contract with a company called calm psych corporation they're operating businesses FMLA source we'd like to recommend a contract to outsource that FMLA administrative services it's about 120 day implementation and we would do joint training one of the more important things we think is to do that with the labor partners jointly and with our departments so we would do that in the later part of summer look implementation towards September happy to answer any questions but just one to give you that recap and ask for your support in contracting that out all right well thank you very much mr. Johnson for that presentation questions or comments from my colleagues counselor not kowski so all cases aren't going to be handled by the individual that we have here as our local staff member right well it's just special cases no actually you know one of the things we find actually is kind of the actually converse so you know the balls the the bulk of FMLA cases are fairly straightforward and I always say that this is kind of the most black and white of the human resource body of work when so much of it is kind of gray so for the for the bulk of FMLA cases those will be handled centrally through FMLA source because they really have the systems and the expertise it is about five percent of the cases that really are the more complex ones they're intermittently they involve a bit more medical complication and we need the the vendor support and expertise on that but they require frankly a bit more hand-holding and that's really where employees kind of need that advocacy in that liaison so what we find is that the it's the smaller number but they tend to take more time that will be more handled by that liaison an advocacy a Blair example pregnancy childbirth very straightforward a beginning and an end right probably easily handled by central HR absolutely more difficult would be someone who is diagnosed with intermittent migraines you don't know when they're going to happen it can be for one day can be 45 days you eventually you need to start getting into more serious medical interventions and questions and all that sort of that's where you would go external is correct sir is there another example like that or no it is it's you know it's those situations that have kind of clean time periods because they're very event-specific as opposed to the things that are more intermittent they've come up they they require some more time and you're right they flare up and sometimes they need some attention and what in both cases we benefit from the experts at FMLA source but certainly in terms of kind of helping with employee advocacy and to answer your question councilman Nowakowski it's it's really about making sure that we have someone that can kind of Shepherd those things through those questions and further from the perspective of the employee so let's take the migraine example the migraine flares at 4am you know I'm not in today right who do you call but with this you call that number 24 x 74 seven as opposed to do I call my supervisor now do I call them later I'm not capable of calling them later the supervisor wonders where's the employee so so from an employee perspective we think in those cases it gives us a better than if we were purely internal accidents on weekends you're right I mean life doesn't always happen between you know eight to five monday through friday so absolutely so how many cases did we actually experience last year with you know we have several thousand cases and from from my review of some of the information you know with with more than about 12,000 employees that annually have eligibility to FMLA it's tied to length of service and hours that you work we have a fairly inline utilization with other public sector employer employers a little higher than some of our benchmarks but several thousand cases but again the vast majority of those are kind of the ones that are the more pregnancy related or you break an arm you have something that that's more finite as opposed to the intermittent leave and there's several hundred of those are so then that that price per employee went dollar 38 that's for the 12,000 not just exactly correct sir yes so so the price that's quoted as a per employee per month price based upon per employee of eligible employees for FMLA and doesn't have any kind of link to type of case any kind of incentive or distance and / or correlation to that and which is the cleanest process and kind of is how insurance plans if you will are kind of priced in that way and then we benefit from the services of the organization based upon that pricing so we're looking at a five year contract and 197,000 and for it per year and I guess correct and we would as I underst right is that are your contract with two one-year extensions as your standard okay that's going to totally be about 900 87,000 and Plus on top of that is it what a dollar thirty eight per employee know that that is that rice that's the compressive correct sir perfect inclusive Thank You councilman other questions or comments now the centralization yes that first should that has already taken place it is how long has that have we been in a centralized model well I think you moved in december i think november december of 2015 and what we've done in the kind of the meantime is we've continued to work with departments when there's questions because we really didn't want to staff up obviously we want to keep the positions that were moved to HR as vacant positions until we came back to this committee and made a decision so what we'll do is obviously what the most important thing for us is we didn't want to displace anybody so those positions sit vacant and the value of those positions would be then used to compensate the vendor for those services and will continue to have that small group those three employees centralized in HR that work with the vendor or put the departments it's been a pretty short period of time but have you seen any changes in utilization rates since this has been centralized yeah I don't know that going backward year no the rolling backward year is probably the bigger impact by the bigger splash immediately which means instead of January one start your eligibility all over it's always from 365 days ago till now that was a big change is that that was a very big change and you know and frankly it went really well I mean there was good communication lots of advanced communication it certainly does tend to kind of change your numbers drastically because it's a it's a dropping the line and then changing that process but I also think that we have certainly seen at a greater ability maybe not so much in utilization but our focus has been consistency and so doing some across the city and being a little more uniform about that or it was decentralized it was different departments I think doing their best but certainly doing things differently and this has probably improved that consistency and fairness and that's probably the early indicator that I would report on great gray well I'm very pleased with where you've come out it makes sense I think it's gonna be providing good service to the employees but then also the city will enjoy some savings and potentially there could be more more that's right we would hope and I think it's you know it's been a real testimony to working in partnership with our labor unions because we wanted to find something that would feel good and and at the same time it be responsible in terms of an employer and save money like you say but also not cause disruption in the departments and and make this transition as smooth as we can so definitely great well with that i would entertain a motion you know a motion to approve staff recommendation there's a second thank you for all your hard work on thank you sir all right motion in a second any further discussion you know just a comment just really want to thank you for reaching out I know there were some concerns with some of our employee unions that were just concerned about that customer service yes that they were afraid that they're going to be calling on from a different state and that they wouldn't have that response and especially for those special cases like this say manager was explained to us it's really taking that team Phoenix approach working together and coming up with that hybrid solution so thank you making this hard work and bringing everyone together appreciating all right with that all in favor of the motion please say aye all right all opposed motion passes unanimously thank you very much all right now we will go back in order to item three which is our this is the key economic indicators report and this information he is given I'm sorry it's item for its december 15 and january 16 key phoenix economic indicator reports and i encourage you the folks who are at home to go online check out this information i want to thank the city manager i think it was last year that you started to provide these economic indicators to us and if you look at them if folks go online and look at them a lot of good news in there counts when wearing thank you saw his head I know who I drug this mary 0 here 0 here okay yeah so I just had a couple questions we have Mario if it's about streets planning items with Rick freeze is the deputy budget director who's here on I was looking at a few of these charge is gonna see if a conclusion I drew is actually both Alaskan both to come up with you both come on on the water sir on page 16 the water services account yes the blue line which is current looks like a drop and that's not the true that's how many we have right so it's gone down a little bit correct ok so then multi-family units permitted is going up not as rapidly as the prior year but it's going up fairly substantially it looks like and then I'm sorry there was another one I was going to tie in here that I'm not immediately seeing but I'm contracting it looks like it's still going up so I guess I'm curious are you able to evaluate 21 so the first one I mentioned with on page 16 the second one is about page 17 the third one the contracting city sales tax is on page 21 so I guess my question is it looks like what would prompt water service accounts to go down is that people selling their houses but then nobody moving in well let's so if you it's over a three-month period so September you went up slightly into October and down slightly in November although over the year it's still higher I think it looked to me it looked like it was a little bit lower but I don't mean just way I'm looking at the it's closed right so the blue line shows in September from september-october it went up slightly october to November went down slightly but over the total current year to date over prior today it's still up by about a thousand five hundred accounts but so i'm not sure that the graph doesn't show the year right the graph is showing a month-to-month change but it's an interesting question to find out what what would it account for just seems like there you go down ya see what I'm saying to me it just doesn't now you've got multifamily units permitted going up substantially does that mean people are moving from houses two apartments which could also indicate something about how much people are making that's kind of a broad statement but you know I'm looking at one line going up pretty substantially and one kind of trending downward could or could not be worrisome and then I'm looking at the contracting going up on a pretty steady line not as steep as it was the peak year but certainly to the recent comparable three-year average and the prior year to date on page 21 I guess what I took away from this is is maybe we're still growing but its people moving into apartments and that people the city sales tax we're getting on from contracting is from people building apartments which has some implications I mean I know multiple family has been up does any of the conclusion i'm drawing there the water service accounts going down was the most i thought a little bit worrisome some of this seemed a little counter into it yeah so I think you guys you guys are not it maybe you don't have any broad conclusions I think that I think we need to really dig into that question a little more with Alan right and see what's going on and then end with water service you don't answer right now no yeah but I understand okay you understand what I'm in the ties and how we we would ask to explain that yo hey yeah I'm good maybe they'll come back with an answer they can just if you guys you guys consider back to me and if you want to share with everybody else it's fun right no good good questions that were asked some one thing I would just comment on for again for everyone watching new home construction permits issued is up seventy three point eight percent we're still you know fairly early in here but up seventy three point eight percent as opposed to the prior year that's very encouraging and like I said is you dig through these numbers you will see several very encouraging encouraging numbers so again thank you to staff for fighting this information to to the community putting it together in one place i get if i could just sit again that jives with the again the chart on page 21 about the increase in city sales tax for contracting but it doesn't seem to make sense when you look at the decline in what I mean how can we be having more houses but fewer water service accounts yeah I guess the one thing I him that isn't well yeah except these are permits issued so this is right in the beginning no permit of them would have beds permitting would be a leading indicator right it's going to be probably six months I understand but I mean it just seems like over a three-month period the question might be to go back six or nine months whatever the lead time is from a permit to a water account and see if this tracks with whatever was going on with permitting nine months ago and that's we'd have to ask let me I've had friends build houses and be in up in three my mean you can do it if you really really want to focus on that so okay when one additional clarification as you look at the city sales tax for contracting the chart actually shows a year-to-date total and so that's going to be going up every single month no matter what amount is collected in the next month assuming it's more than a dollar it's going to go up ok so I'm month-to-month it sir it's a year today whom exactly so it's cute accumulative but if you actually look at the comparison to the prior year it's down nineteen percent so that's that's more reflective not necessarily of activity but changes in state law to how contracting sales tax is collected thank you i appreciate oh yeah great questions anything else on this item alright well thank you thank you for your time on this and that takes us now to item 5 which is the office space study update Thank You mr. chair Tony macalin I've been waiting for yes Tony macaron has taken the lead from my office in several the immediate projects we initially did this we wanted to update you on the moves into this building because they're happening as we speak but then with the budget conversation last week several members of council raise the question of where are we with property sales generally and since this committee has been fully hands on in that subject for the last three years we wanted to come back and talk more about that and Chris Mackay from CED has the part of our portfolio where we actually RFP out downtown buildings so with that Tony right thank you good afternoon chairman gates and subcommittee members so as you know we have come to the subcommittee a few times now to talk about the citywide office space study in the goal is to take a look at citywide office space and see if it's being utilized to its fullest extent as you are aware the HR building is one building that we identified that was not being utilized to its fullest extent and it's a 58 thousand square foot building with six floors in a basement the debt on that building is 2.2 million dollars and we expect to pay that off with the sale of the building we also expect four hundred thousand dollars in annual savings and that's for maintenance and other things like that that we will no longer need once we sell sell the building and we'll have a two hundred and twenty thousand dollar one time savings and that's attributed to the telephony project we won't need to do rewiring on that building we are in the full implementation stage with the HR move so I call it up putting all of our puzzle pieces together and we are making good progress we have had many different departments clearing out space because the goal is we are moving the HR employees over to the Calvin good building on the first third and seventh floors so you will see all of these puzzle pieces that take place moving staff to other locations to make this happen the most recent move is EOD came over and joined the city clerk department on the 15th floor of City Hall they just arrived on Monday in that move went very well so we moved city clerk employees to one side of the 15th floor in EOD is now on the other side of the 15th floor and they were here Monday and and everything is going along very smoothly with that and what happened with that move is now it enabled the construction to begin on the Calvin good building so on Monday morning construction began they were tearing down walls and getting everything ready on the first third in seventh floors in order to welcome the HR employees to the building in June of 2016 so in conjunction with all of the moves we also have a two-phase process an RFQ and an RFP to sell the HR building and that's what Chris will update you on today as well good afternoon chairman and council members as you'll recall approving for us a number of months ago the HR building will be disposed of in a two-phase process the first was through a request for qualifications which is currently opened it opened on march first and it closes on April 14th we have had our pre-proposal conference and had a number of individuals attend the pre-proposal conference out of the of the request for qualifications we will then write the request for proposal which is scheduled to go out on May second and then be back before ready to be reviewed by the committee in mid-june so we would be planning on bringing a proposal forward to this body after your summer break most likely in either late august or early September so that's the update on the HR process and as ed mentioned we are getting a group together so CED finance real estate will be back to you for your April subcommittee meeting to talk more about the city-owned property taking another look at that list and making some more recommendations as far as properties that can be disclosed up that's our report for it wonderful well that yes very timely after our recent council meeting asking about this any questions or comments council not counsel just making sure this is in my district and one of the problems we have in downtown is parking so there is a parking solution in the RFP an RFQ right chairman at councilman Nowakowski as we move forward with this and the RFQ we did identify the fact that this building does not have any parking in the RFP they will be required to bring back a solution for that parking as per other direction from Council at our meeting thank you any other questions comments all right well no not asking for any action here on this this item but thank you for the update and we'll look forward to hearing from you again soon thank you want to thank the committee because this is real well there's no action here this is a result of the action you've taken so this direction to really assess all of our assets has led us to do something that nobody ever thought we do which was why would we ever sell the HR building but the underused asset is actually this building and that's why we wanted to fully use this building and see what that freed up and with your direction we're going to move forward on the HR building great thank you next is item 6 annual user fee for report or review chairman gates members of the subcommittee I'm just going to turn it over to Greg columns a senior auditor and user fee expert who manages this project he has a short presentation will be available for any questions you might have good afternoon I'm sweets year we perform this project and we present to the subcommittee in March we start about mid fiscal year where we gather revenues and expenses from about nine departments about 45 different fee areas related to user fees and the user fees are really services that benefit a particular subgroup either of residents or businesses these relate to general funded user fees so water and aviation and other enterprise funds are not included in this process they have their own separate rate setting process that we periodically review so in looking at those nine areas these are the departments and this is the revenue streams from each of the departments you'll see at the top planning the bellman being the largest that we look at it's the only one that's the entire departments costs matched up against their revenue stream of user fees the rest of the department's it's a subset of the department like fire the next one down is only three fieri 'as an emergency transportation makes about ninety percent of that revenue stream all the way down to street transportation at the bottom which is really just a portion of their essential records dealing with reprographics and public record requests so it's just a small group when we look at the 45 fieri is what we've distilled down here is the 10 areas that have greater than a hundred thousand dollars of under-recovery so some of its historic so it's nothing new this year there really isn't anything that jumped up this year as opposed to what it's been the last few years what this represents at the top you look at the top one of emergency transportation the first figure you see in the middle is the amount of revenue code we project for the next fiscal year and then the on the far right is the figure just over a million dollars of under recovery and you'll see the key at the bottom of this is it's tied to a percentage of under-recovery so that million dollars is approximately five percent of the total cost to perform that service all the way down and these are in rank order you'll see all the way down in swimming pools at the bottom you'll see 768 thousand dollars in revenue and then about 6.4 million in unrecovered expenses and that represents about ninety percent of their total costs so let's explain this chart just a little bit right okay and then a little bit hard to see so you it's not that they're all the same amount of money is just showing relatively how much of that is not recovered so emergency transportation collects 34.7 million and they have 1 million dollars of unrecovered costs down to the bottom second from the bottom Pueblo Grande collects 62,000 and emissions their total cost would be 350,000 so there's 290,000 unrecovered is that right correct so theoretically Pueblo Grande would have to charge some astronomical admission fee to those recover their costs right I would be so high that no one would go there there's really a separate story with each of these fees like originally transportation at the top that fee set annually by the state we're typically trying to catch up to cost from the prior year when they set their fees down to the ones at the bottom that were mentioned before it's a very market driven you're really hamstrung by really what you could charge to really get customers to take part in whatever service that is like swimming pools so our purpose today really is just review and discussion like I said this is an annual process that we're just presenting the outcome and and just before we get into the discussion just to be clear you don't have any recommended user fee increases today we don't as policy for city auditor recommend anything it's really did we provide the information back to the departments and in discussion between the department's be an RN city management they might bring forward a recommendation but we do not that's a good clarification management at this point we do not believe that it that there's anything where it is really worth the effort or it's or it's economically feasible to recommend a fee increase so for example Pueblo Grande somebody's not going to pay twenty eight dollars to get into Pueblo Grande I'm not sure if that's the amount that would take to get that and so Pueblo Grande ends up being really a service to the community it's an amenity it's a historical artifact we make available to the public we try to recover a little bit through entrance fees but clearly the point for the city is to make Pueblo Grande available to the public broadly as opposed to covering all the costs it wouldn't be feasible and so at this point given this list and the amount and the effort it would take to raise the fees we do not recommend a fee increase as part of the budgetary process thank you and just a little bit of historical basis for this back about 2010 2009 2010 period we had just a drip drip drip of user fee increases that were coming to the council and in that environment it was really overwhelming for our residents and for us as elected officials so we said we all work together and said hey let's unify this let's have you all look at this at once and then come to city management and then from there come to us with any recommendations so I'm pleased to see that we're continuing that approach and by the way it's at the same time it's a budget process so so it makes makes a lot of sense just for folks who are wondering why we're why we're having this discussion in this presentation today so with that do my colleagues have any questions or comments about what's been presented to us all right again this is another one of these where i would encourage our viewers to go online go on phoenix gov and see you know which particular items are being basically operated at a loss and you know in other ways you don't phrase that it's being subsidized but that's a great example you use of a Pueblo Grande but did it there's some very interesting information in here in attachment a witch which gives a great great perspective on things I did have one question on counseling Waring's favorite topic on at all uh I was gonna say oh I was gonna you guys are hurl before when I say today it's getting better okay okay how do I steal your thunder oh yeah yeah you did no I I was good i was gonna ask questions i had credit where credit i do its living better it's councilman wearing accurate and what he's saying and maybe specifically maybe you can just address that a little bit because there has been a real effort made by the parks department to address the deficit that we were running in the municipal golf operations as far as a year to year it is looking up revenues up six hundred fifty thousand dollars our projections this year over last year and expenses are down a little over a half million dollars a lot of that deals with landscape maintenance i'm not sure where there was a renegotiation of a contract but that's significantly down so the overall cost recoveries up from sixty-eight percent last year too eighty-two percent and just a caveat on when we look at the cost model we do full costing so we include indirect costs and overhead that a lot of the time when you're looking at these in terms of go away costs and whether you should do it or not we that's not included so our recovery will represent usually a lower figure than what you may see in other studies that don't include that and just go away cost so that the subsidy on golf used to be or the charge used to be over two million dollars a year budgetarily different from how they calculated budgetarily we were two million dollars a year from the general fund budgetarily this year now it's about 450 thousand dollars so i think it's both what Greg said the efforts to run the golf operations in a more businesslike fashion which has increased revenue and the outsourcing to a professional sports management company OB sports has reduced expenses and those two things have done what he said has changed it from a 68% to an eighty-two percent recovery and it's actually after emergency transportation it's our highest revenue area on this list well thank you for your work and in the work of parks department in addressing this council and wearing uhhh and I would not have but I didn't accept you so callously referenced me that I had you know it's the horror of our colleague I mean I'm not the golf thing again if I did so it is it but it's not a revenue generator and that it's still being subsidized by the general fund does that last comment made it sound like we're making money and we're still not making money at operation we're not making money but I think so I look at its were like like Pueblo Grande are like swimming pools it's recovering more of its on this list it's the third highest recovering operation we have of services that the park identities that occasionally golf up there let's know that that line is only called it even though it's just park / golf that is just all it's just communicating that golf as part of the parks operation sort of like parks Pueblo Grande is in parks I'm swimming pools are in parks yeah right okay don't losing money just losing less we can put that on a bumper sticker or something easy rope reason why not or maybe maybe it's you could cost us less than swimming pools that be a bumper sticker any put up there all right we're gonna debate the merits of swimming pools and golf this is why I got to look on the face when he brought up the golf for the first place I did I take the plane I couldn't help myself hold it I think it's one of the big victories of our city i think the golf program of what you've been able to do city staff I'd you know public-private partnerships of course I'd be remiss if I didn't bring up GCU and Maryville golf I think it's a great story to tell frankly yeah ASU and and Epico have a go absolutely yeah well it would been a greater story if we would have started this traffic we just gotta junior doubts are wearing out on the on the course and yet there'll be more relaxed night golf is coming race night go night golf at Palo Verde today it's but we count some Valenzuela and I've had the opportunity to participate in the past and having played to echo your comments and follow up on them accounts with valence whale I've been out there to the grand canyon golf course at maryvale and it is a great golf course and would encourage folks to get out there not as good as cave creek in district 3 but it it's it's it's outstanding and great milkshakes absolutely all right anything else on this item all right thank you for your work on this really appreciate it and we are just zipping right along here with the agenda today so that takes us now to future agenda items if i'm not mistaken and any future agenda items from my colleagues all right we have you can rest assured we've got plenty of good good items coming in the future including the office space review and telephone intelligent next next month that will be the big item yes hey that will be and as far as called the public is concerned we have no cards for call the public so with that this meeting is adjourned thank you sir you", "z-TxZh9wz4E": "delivery's presents the unpackaging of green crack it is a sativa on

a talk I know it won't be as exciting as interesting as polar bear anymore Stewart but i'm sure some people will show up so again and tell us all about it hi um so as you know I have a minor public presence which has two main consequences one is I get showered under every time the Sun kind of historic snowstorm going by the events we've been doing any actual meal work so I'm not going to talk to you about your science that I've done because I have that excites secondly i do get occasionally invited to do something kind of interesting so i'ma talk to you about one of the interesting things on the spot and then tack on a little bit of science again which I've just done so I think it's in any cabin run into issue it's inevitable that there's going to be a single species that gets kicked out as being the icon for the impacts of ozone depletion can change or acid rain or something so the sort of question for a climate change is which one is it going will it be the mountain pine bark beetle time it's made it all right so we don't really need to discuss that very much Bowie all photographs once I took um they're cute has to be said so I was I was invited by a group called polar bear international to come up to Churchill which is here on the coast of Hudson base is Lake Superior Ontario other words they seem like Winnipeg Churchill so this is pretty much not it's not quite in the Arctic Circle but it's very much Arctic environment it's all of tundra around not very many trees and not very much else to do Churchill exists because it's a deep-water port and there's a train which goes from Churchill through the Gilliam Thompson in from and then back to Winnipeg um there's no road to get there so the only way to get there is either by train or by boat or my flight oh there's actually quite a large community about as in people that they're mostly associated with the report or Churchill's next thing to fame which is that it's the polar bear capital of the world so it is in fact the polar bear cub pocketbook and so people go there to the deployment so I was invited by polymerase national which is new to do that campaigns for polar bear conservation habitat conservation education because they had organized to Martha Stewart of Martha Stewart thing to come to Churchill to have a look at polar bears and to do a story about polar bears the environment and the impacts of thing so it give you an idea about why polar bears congregate in Churchill this is this is a useful man this is sea ice conditions around mid-november 1980 and so you can take this as kind of typical of the pre the pre antigenic era and what you can see is that by the time you get answer November the sea ice in hudson bay is kind of made its way all the way that is the churchill that kind of made its way all the way down to to the coast now the key thing about polar bears is that they are absolutely sea ice creatures they need the sea ice to be able to hunt seals seals or what they eat and anything else is is not even a feeble substitutes no sir and so what happens is that as the so during during the wintertime Hudson Bay is completely frozen out in general and there's quite a large population of bears that live on the ice over here but as the sea ice disappears and the summer they moved to land where they just sit around one around they don't root for months at a time and then as they as the winter comes back on they congregate on the coast waiting for the sea ice to come back and as soon as the cs comes back they wander off onto the sea ice in order to find seals I really move is not even they they have a weird thing yeah it's it's kind of unique for this for polar bears and it's different for Grizzlies but they just shut down all of their systems they don't pee they don't excrete they don't use very much energy they do use their fat reserves so during this kind of a load time they lose about a pound of weight today so they start off at the end of the beginning of the summer end of the spring weighing the big males can weigh you know be a thousand pounds that the females maybe 600 700 pounds and they'll lose a pound a day until they start to feel again hopefully in November or December so look at how many days that is mm seems I wouldn't um so they really do gather in this area so if you're in Churchill they have a bigot it's like a fortress city essentially they have bear tracks basically all the way around the city back and arm they try and discourage bears from coming into town obviously that sometimes they do and they really don't encourage people to walk on their own outside of the city limits because if a bear has c2 and they had an EMS on three or four five or six months you are you want dinner because of their they're really proactive stance so I'm trying to keep it there down city nobody's actually been eaten in the city for about 35 years other people are eaten that science so so I got there the first day this is pretty much typical terrain you got a few trees the trees it's not Norma nuff for them to reproduce sexually so these are all remnants tree clothes that's the propagated up there you know presumably the challah seen the early holocene and are now just kind of like clinging to life in so so these this tree will all be the same tree or just come anyway so we went out the one guys to this for a drive just a little bit and the coast where there were some bears thats hanging around and this point was sitting in a pickup car in a pickup truck and the window is planned down and you know the two of us in the car going or you can click the order because of the kind of thing that's all I've got a whole sequence of bear kind of trampling sloman it towards me and this is this is a male this is a hungry male you can tell that it's been that it's quite hungry could you see all the flaps of skin like normally they're running weapon when they begin in the spring then I from the bulked up so this is this is a bear that handy for a while and and you can tell me who's been in trouble the Cutlass space there and so this is as he's coming quite close to this point so so he's kind of there at which point the person who's seen right next to the window stunt to open to close that we know but while we're all frantic overlooking so so now we're trying we're panicking a little bit because it's quite close and and I neglected unfortunately to keep filming during what subsequently occurred but the the next time when I was able to take the photograph this is this is why so ok so in between here and here um this bear jumped on the front of the pickup truck that's Thai camera guy who's driving forgot argan oil sugar so we're reversing getting and then he kind of rolls off the front of the pickup truck and and then this is after he's kind of rolled off and he's kind of got back up and he's kind of the kids were reversing quite a distance away at this point and he's kind of he's doing us de ole I intelius not so that was that was my introduction to the the cuddly polar bear species oh so what happens when they when they come closer into town is that they have bear traps all over the place I don't put seal meat in the back of the bear trap these things are hungry they go in the door closes behind them these are very very solid steel things and they take them to the polar bear jail so the moving behind here with the poor bed rail which is a leftover service building from when there was a an army base here and they just let them see in the jail for you know a few weeks so they can kind of calm down and sit around you don't need to feed them because they're not expecting three they're not expecting me to this point and so and then after after a few after a few weeks they airlift them somewhere else so they have a helicopter service this is like I said about a 700-pound bear which they kind of sacralized put in there and then car often and dumped on the other side of the Churchill river where hopefully he will just hang out and not come back into town Oh what they used to have to do with was that they would put them down if they came into town because they would get to use to seeing how much food was available in time we go through the garbage you go through people's houses and the houses are not you know bill to it standing and so people will be good but now they have a much better system it doesn't appear to harm the the Bears in any way they they get tagged once they're released and then they track those bears as part of the tagging and population might meet monitoring that the server conservation does and they come back every year and so there doesn't appear to be any harm in doing this it does get them out of people's way so this is this is the terrain this is actually you can just about see Hudson Bay over there there's no ice at this point there usually is but there isn't there wasn't that year and this is like one of this these clumps of of cloned fir trees are there is very the wind is really pretty bad and everything else is this this is in the end of another and everything else is a little bit of scruff it wasn't very snowy and that was unusual but it was quite cold it was a bad minus between minus 5-10 it was pretty pretty big curvature and then what people do is they dig all trips on these tundra buggies so I give you a feline so this this is a fully grown there this is about a meter and a half this is three meters above the ground and yeah so the bearer is thinking or dinner in a can we have but but but they can't they can't they can't drunk up that high and so you'll get them kind of coming up there trying to be very curious most of the time they just ignore these things because they're not accessible food so you'll see bears just sitting around just paying no temple as it is healthy tilton is that is their perspective they are no it's not just me with a can of mopping and so these babies go out there this is about 25 miles 30 miles away from in Churchill town and it used to be the site of a naval exercise yard or an army munitions based so there were roads that were made in the tundra at that point and these bodies just use those rooms so it's not that them they're not messing up any tundra but they are just using an old army base spacing and so I think we'll go on these trips it takes you a couple of hours get out there you hang around and you go back and you'd get some really good close-up photographs on the other photograph my show you which was a bear that was it was pretty much doing that and you know if you've got a decent zoom and you can really get a good a good shot listen zona there's a lot of frozen leaks out there basically the Bears just kind of sick and they don't very much interactive themselves for dealing with the other bears there was back I would say maybe 50 to 100 bears and in this area oh when we were there and mostly they just come out like sit around you know let this stay on a rock and stare at you see what's going on because they're just waiting we're just waiting for the ice to form so they can go out and hunt seals these are these frozen lakes there's no no frozen awareness event so there's no there's no sustenance in these things well and people feed them this book all about then in fact it seals it's just a fad it's what to eat if I don't think you can fat really easy to get some sentimentality came here not unlike people I know where are they going to get the fat fun yeah just you know I don't know there's nothing everything here has to be flown in or shipped in on that on the train there's no there's no excess fat yeah so but occasionally occasionally they do interact it especially the young males this is a relatively young male and and they'll kind of find the other young males and they'll kind of practice play fighting um these these would be males there are a few years old men three or four years old they live in the wild about 18 years but at this stage they're just kind of there just kind of playing around so they do a lot of play fighting and you can see some pretty nice they also do a lot of kind of play den building right so they're not breathing at this point right the Cubs would have been on this season would be around two or three months old at this point awful last year you might be the mother stay with the Cubs for about two years and the dens are made in snow banks or in in holes on land and they just kind of like to sit there for a while and then they come out into the in the winter with the Cubs so they can go feed so this is um this is a female of young female bear and she was kind of making a kind of den in the snowbank here so she was kind of calling in like you know falling over and it was still is great to see him sugar cell phone and this one is actually interesting because she then took a double and it's very unusual to see that at this time of year because they generally do haven't eaten anything right so they have no fiber in their system so there's no you never see a poder turd it's all just but but she's obviously eaten maybe from something that you found on the coast moving moving north and so and so show the staff that was brave and I notice that there are arctic foxes which are very cute if you see one there are Arctic hares there are birds crows are fish in hudson bay but in terms of you know land animals you know what there's this very happy there there's no there's no character woman this is the way not with hudson bay is not actually that close to the other and we were about a burden terminal okay so that's right is there a native population there and what did they subsist on so actually Churchill is there is a small native proportion of England if ever exact it's not a native community it was not there because of an army base because an observatory because of the poor and so it's it's an hour because of tourism so it isn't really it's a large additional there are traditional salmans further north and they have they have an interesting relationship with the bear you no they you know they're very fond of conservation they worry a lot about climate change but the Bears have SP hunted and they're there to provide food and and so there are certain some pretty serious communications issues if you like between scientists and populations might encompass issue dealing with polar bear conservation there's a lot of denial that there's any problem at all and i will discuss why that so um what's what's the year was the climate change angle well I'm really need to explain this very often much to you guys but basically the Hudson Bay sea ice is melting earlier in the season and is freaking later so this this is this is total amount of sea ice so this is the summertime when there's no ice and then this is the wintertime when pretty much the entire person bait is is is free so the anomaly at the moment for peak winter is zero because Hudson Bay still freezes over and the anomaly of this thing when there's the tell on you yes I'm sorry hi I have no idea how you managed to get me in this number can ask you now I have no idea how it's okay ok big Stewart yeah so obviously so but in the midwinter in the midsummer there's no anomaly in handsome beta in handsome SES but you can see they in the tail regions so this is this is the the screen rusev for wintertime what's happened is the freeze up is being is being reduced by a month on one side and  by a month on the other side so the amount of time that there's ice in this region has reduced by back two or three months Oh only in the last you know 30 so that makes a big difference i remember i said that the Bears lose about a pound a day if you start at seven hundred and you go for six months without eating six times me yeah and if you're not 700 pounds and you only 400 pounds or if you're a cub okay that's really you know it it's it starts to they said likely increase mortality but for the better particularly for the young cubs oh you know decreased survivability of consoles what they smell so basically the biggest cause of death of bears in this region stylish it's not it's not trapping it's not hunting it's not being eaten off the ice is not drowning establish um you can add a sense again that the like in the last 30 years what's been going on this is in November so November you know the sea ice is kind of just in here and what we're seeing is when loop is we're losing almost all that CS in at that one so remember the should be sensitive my knee in December the anomalies or in the southern region where it used to be that it with a frozen up by the end of December and now it's any kind of freezing enough way so in this region particularly you're seeing a much neater edition of the freeze effect yesh or anomalies for november and december this year are were really severe it was the warmest summer that they've had their since since records began the warming at churchill in the in the temperature records back to degrees over this period arm and and you can see that the anomalies persisting all the way through december so you know this this you didn't have ice here you know week's pass to initiative so obviously there's a little bit of internal variability that's going on there but it does i think highlights that we've got like this makes it your bit clearer i suppose this is the situation in December December second 1980 this is December first 1010 in 1918 almost the entire Hudson Bay was already frozen over in 2010 almost none of it was so the polar bears are impacted by this in a very regional way and it I think it's very important when people talk about polar bears is to acknowledge that there are very different populations that have different issues and have different stresses the population that we were looking at in Churchill is the Western Hudson Bay population used to be about twelve hundred individuals now pencil back individuals southern Hudson Bay is another one that's quite well studied because obviously needs of places that are relatively easy to get to places that like the Chukchi Sea and the Beaufort Sea are populations these are also ones that are suffering quite strongly because these are the ones where the biggest changes in sea ice have occurred now if you go to somewhere in here like mcclintock channel or the Gulf of butea these are populations that are pretty stable right and this is the populations that a lot of the native population motion in these regions you know the couple of weeks when there's a lot of open water and the Northwest Passage is open right that's that's historically interesting but for a polar bear you know few weeks of open water running is not any kind of problem and so these these populations in the Canadian archipelago are pretty stable and so there's still that these populations are really not in trouble now the populations down here here where we have data and of course and bouncy and heresy these are populations that are in trouble maybe a quick listers you can't really read over where there's a red so this is that this look at the middle column where it's red is where you've got a declining population so that's in baffin bay joke CeCe davis strait cara mason lancaster sound norwegian bay southern both let's see and Western Hudson Bay those are places where the polar bears are really already in trouble and where you've got a very red thing in this in this last column is where the projections are sea ice change combined with projections or polar bear ecosystem health indicating that these populations are in serious trouble so these areas here so that invade in a straight Western Hudson Bay those are the those are the basis for the endangerment finding the US Fish and Wildlife conclude or for polar bears they put them on the threatened species this now there are places for instance the dog booth here which I mentioned before an imaginative channel where the populations have actually increased and that's mainly because of greater controls on hunting permits but where there's not very much that there's no there's no projections that say that those populations are going to be in trouble anytime soon as sea ice continues to decrease because the Gulf of the Canadian archipelago is really going to be the last refuge for sea ice in the Arctic and in fact they're actually there's a plan that Stephanie Thurmond and others are putting forward to actually declare that they are wildlife refuge for precisely those regions so there's been a lot of discussion there was discussion in newspapers I guess a couple months ago on whether the polar bear should be moved from a threatened species to an endangered species and the the arguments that go on there are actually quite subtle arm and really revolve around to what extent each of these regional populations counts as as an independence thing if all of the polar bears around Hudson Bay disappear but there are still polar bears in the Canadian archipelago is that does that mean that the species is threatened or does that mean that or is that totally okay right so a lot of the the debate that's going on is is to the extent to which a population is that's regionally specific and it doesn't really mingle with the other populations whether that can be considered endangered in on itself or whether they need to take into account the whole of the species right so it really generic difference between these populations any yeah i mean the notable people no I mean I you know the same to you soon as they can alter green things but you know they do have you know slight characteristics property and a survey that could could say which publishes a particular bear is strong but they you know they've been tagged and they don't know they do wonder quite largest at season but you don't get Hudson Bay bears mingling with Chuck CC bears right on any kind of short time scale so they aren't quite regionally specific they go out they come back they go out they come back and they pretty much stick to their um and so you get some pretty nice sunsets now um so that's kind of pretty much the end now you won't know that Martha Stewart cover think about Mother's sure she's a very professional right I mean when we were when we were filming she it wasn't sure wasn't particularly warm person she wasn't like it wasn't a politician type person who wants to be a recessed phone but when it came down to actually doing filming or doing stuff she just went back straight into big professional post mode it was it was quite good to see you didn't mess about um she she brought her own sheets love the kids there's only two hotels in this town not very good so she called her and cheats she brought most of her own food what are one of the mornings when we went out on 100 buggies she actually made us all sandwiches using you know some some beans and fresh bread that she brought from New York I was Emma's right I they day she was it she was a fan of the donuts of the local bakery that was corrected she was keen on her arm weaving with those there was one now we were we were all out to dinner in one of the local restaurant which you know they're just kind of normal restaurants and now almost so friendly and so nice and they said oh can get you in or anything you want sit on when pastor Paul yeah we loosely with Jimmy muscles yeah must we all get Thomas talk sort of the year so I don't know why what she was thinking eating mussels in the middle of the tunnel a little bit so anyway especially orders this plate of spaghetti with muscles and a lot of sauce and she starts eating its kind of this is the gossip rental since a little chewy and it's just need the whole thing because there's so much trouble okay ah but they weren't that she's she's an interesting person and she she traveled with her interior decorator and photographer and a camera guy and one what kind of generic you know organizing type person ah they threw up on a on a private jet that was leased hers was quite nicely inside greatly and certainly better than the coach class air canada flight amazon um the polar bear international people were great actually they have all their the kind type people I've dealt with they were both denti interested in science interested in their issue but but very very interested in what the science is actually saying so a lot of time consulting not just on climate issues but with you know polar bear scientists from both the US and from from Canada and there are few people there from the center of biological diversity which is based in in Joshua Tree California and they're the ones that have been suing the US authorities for the polar bear to be listed as a threatened and now as an endangered species so both of those both of those groups to remind any more about polar bears we won't find any more about their their campaigns they're both good good sources to look at um so your honor you want to see the natural the tip that ended up on the TV show be 600 miles north of winnipeg manitoba remote town of Churchill which has a population of pouches touristy is a kicker yeah I know is very nice some vendors I tried to play and beluga whale migration however in The Witcher polar bears library directly through this town on their way north to the gnats at bay this is one of the only places up on earth where humans can observe these magnificent animals up close making it the polar bear capital world and a place i just had visit joined by my friends Kevin shark and Scott Duncan I was eager to learn more about polar bears and discover how global warming is affecting this threatened species my infirmity journey began on a helicopter tour over keep Churchill the formation of Arctic sea ice is critical for polar bears is on the sites that they spend a winter hunting for range seals the staple of a polar bears diet ideally the Bears will spend eight months beasting out on the ice and to build up fat stores in order to survive on land during the warmer months so we just had a most incredible flight and we saw many polar bears all looking for frozen ice and I hope that just gets colder than it is it so it'll say been rigid here and the water is not freezing and that's the plight of the polar bear over the past 10 to 15 years scientists have seen the polar bear population of Churchill declining by over twenty percent right now we're in wapusk National Park it is a preserve for the wildlife up close and personal song holi with the polar bears in this amazing Indra buggy these all terrain vehicles have tires that are five and a half feet tall and three and a half feet wide to ensure successful navigation / very difficult rails and he's well heated but he's we can comfortably and safely observe and photograph the polar bears we're traveling but the bear is just lying there fat skiing as the Sun the vehicles also have large observation decks oh area is standing right here unless the climb up here in the Tundra Buggy to learn more about these magnificent creatures I spoke with dr. Stephen AB stroke the senior scientist at polar bears international an organization dedicated to the month to be should of this species having vermont in Vietnam go Cougars in the National is all it's entirely possible yes well we what has happened in the seal population our seal populations is also there's a lot more since right there's this move on but they need the ice to den and so if the ice is too thick they normally kind of borrowing the ridges and then they kind of make a hole there which is what which is going to investment but as the ice but as the ice thins high there's not so much fringe dice and so they're having been having problems so they're lower than the birthing on the open ice which is not which is not good either for the elements or or for their safety inspector the poem is so for the polar scientists you've kind of got two camps you got you got one count that's kind of very keen on protecting the seals and another camp is kind of keen on protecting the polar bears and it's a little bit of a competent erous so but they're generally okay but but prison Cecilia bits is working with with the civil people because you know it's as a CSV decreases those those would be threatened populations your organization so donations largely go to either research programs that's what an occasion sort of reality to bring the word about trans to polar bears to the general public what are the five nations and cat polar bears the United States in Alaska Canada Denmark through Greenland and Norway and then of course Russia and there are no polar bears in the southern hemisphere that's right when you see pictures of drawings of polar bears and penguins together that's not real polar bears ready becomes fun polar bears evolve brown bears probably between 150 and 250 thousand years ago and when a group of brown bears realized that there was an empty niche out of the sea ice where they could go out and hunt for seals and then gradually turn to wait ish color that they are if you're hunting in a wide environment it probably is beneficial to be the same color as the environment the largest land predators on earth adult polar bears measure six digit feet tall and weigh up to 1,700 pounds their average lifespan is 15 to 18 years and females give birth to their first litter at five or six years typically two to three Cubs are born at a time but due to the lack of food available mother's scientists are now observing any single births breeding takes place from april to june in the fall pregnant bears entered ends to look over their cups you know see we're on the deer river of average home of our helicopter pilot who has been given permission to take us here to a real bear dick so this is a vignette regard in being on the lee side here no would count and basically that t-shirt she looks so so the people that live there there are about how do you know if this is bought you know this is gone you know it was wintertime but you know the other thing yeah I mean you know and get back to my work master Athena and this was that last one so they been much more company about it but top of her so her cubs would be underneath the snow as they grow older should push them farther and farther in the snow until eventually she'll push the right out and they'll do their or walk back to the coast the typical mortality rate is approximately thirty percent but when sea ice breaks up early the mortality rate can increase to fifty percent to learn more about the sea ice I spoke with dr. Andrew Roche from polar bears international why do the polar bears choose to come here for their feelings sea ice will form just to the north of us sooner than anywhere else lots of a system so all this rock that I see out here that covers it I sick and during leisure 500 mom doesn't know you don't have solid ice the Bears tool wander right out about that just 500 miles from here looking crisp seals the prom asleep the ice before me yeah some of these barriers might spent almost six months at du Roche is East gray actually if you wanna know anything about polar bears he's he's really a good guy to go to the University of Manitoba and like a really nice man a question movie where the clear the tourists early results also you also get is a this is a depressing more than might as well I it's relatively accessible and all so you get a lot of package shows these are not cheap so like a tourist and day on the buggy is along the lines of wonderful thing plus you have to get there and it's not a cheap play it's an interesting airport but there's no security whatsoever so there's notice no there's no tsa there's no screaming no because they figure if anybody's hardly enough to have got there mostly from Winnipeg I think it's pretty much I don't really play ball or the other kind of got it I took you all day to get there because you have to change but it's not actually that farm but it is it's not necessary that's where sorry you're really concerned about the health of this popular right because they really need cheating they live off their fat that they gain while they're eating seals so how many seals us a healthy bear eat in the six or seven months that there on the ice if you're just the average bear you're you know one seal at week and we hear so much 45 years the Bears will be really on their way to extinction you look at these wonderful animals and they're so well adapted to living this environment we owe it to future generations to really address this question and deal with climate change in a meaningful way during the Autobots Manitoba's migrating polar bears and attract over 12,000 tourists to the Chinese hammock Churchill outnumbering the residents more than 12 21 visitors have the option of staying at hotels in town or choosing more unique accommodations in the Churchill Wildlife Management Area two hours away there is a little complex of tundra buggies over to our left and that is the Thunder buddy lodge the lodge is five specialized modules include two sleeper cars allowed and a dining unit I'm sitting with John Gunter who is the general manager of frontiers north adventures we've got this opportunity for our guests to wake up in the morning and look out the window and literally see a bear shaking and snow blanket off right and then come and get a coffee and relax there's begats stuff that it's an amazing experience to watch these animals in their natural habitat but when hungry bears wander into town searching for food while they wait for the ice to form they create a safety issue for the residents the manager of a wildlife conservation created the polar bear alert program to capture these wavered polar bears and release them back into the wild several bears have been captured during the night wandering about town with Darrell headman who is the regional wildlife manager the manager of a wildlife this is an important part of the conservation of polar bears in this part of Canada and we are going to see a polar bear that has recently been taken asian activity rather than being shot this is a very good old trick Egyptian miss Terrill it seems that you have a bear yeah the big male is whatever it was hanging there yeah he'll be still meet there when he's been processed to you okay so you were recently in town and your back against a repeat offender that's the idea of the program they really took off in the early 80s before that the bear come to town it was just shot now we will go to the holding facility for the 30-day period why don't you just sneak him now and put him into a net and carry off a helicopter to another wild area the reason for that is he could be back again all day so to come in within three weeks so it's not funny me open alanines f equals object polar bear holding facility is located in an old military warehouse a few miles outside Churchill a bear is about to be taken by helicopter and re-released out into this the sedated bear was taken about 45 miles to the north then dr. Stephen apps trip and scientists from polar bears international inserted an ear tag so they can track the polar bear for their containing studies well I've been watching this polar bear for a couple hours now here at the tundra waking up so he survived rather well out here but this is an endangered species the whole burners are currently listed as a threatened species under the US and deyer species act based principally on the expectation that in the future the habitat would be so diminished for polar bears that they would be endangered which is the next level of status up how many polar bears actually exists here in recent study found that there are about 900 polar bears here but that was down from about 1200 just 25 years before so this population is known to be declining because of the reduced availability of sea ice he is becoming more and more arrest yet might be very hungry after his time and account perhaps it's time to go okay after spending two days observing these beautiful animals I needed to know what is being done to save them dr. Gavin satisfy the same look like how the parents are changing their looking at how dust patterns are changes that are keeping track of how much sea ice there is and this is nice isn't going down particularly in the summertime over the last 30 years and what was the warmest year on record I'm wiping this year right now we're running tiny-g's in 2005 which was also very warm here that decades has been by far the warmest decade that we've seen in the historic Oracle and yet people everywhere refuse to believe that there is global warming going on and a species like the polar bear is really in dire straits for species like the polar bear that is so dependent on the sea ice a big change in its extent in its duration are going to have major effects on that ecosystem we're creating a problem as human beings right the owls are not making the problem now that the animals are just victims we had to change don't we we have to think about where our energy comes from we have to move towards renewables and people can do poor things to weatherize they're harmless to switch to energy-efficient appliances and light bulbs full-length these extraordinary creatures so it does she pay you then no I was horrified yeah so the next thing so that's pretty much it so you have any other I feel that stories about progress now if you point well you know it's a really tricky issue I mean if you you know this is it take bison know there's a desert tribe that you know there's one little thing of ice in it and the entire populations match exactly well you look what I bless my great someplace with a very splendid well don't make this random met there may be some group okay well you kept playing cupcake you can't just take a thousand bears and put them in a new environment I guess the right because then you know with their own territories the amount of water maser particular region is probably quite close to savoy could sustain well that's because of the hunting ban mainly in the nineteen sixties so you know there could be some scope for population transfers but but you know given I mean if you look at the the cs projections you know it's not just this one now the Canadian archipelago can't sustain 25,000 bales what's the difference between threatened and endangered for Ken effects this is all in Canada the right okay US policies so they dragged you about this Oscar so this is my sore concern all right so this is the place is this is a real issue and so in Canada they're not listed at all and there's a number of reasons for that one of which is the little bit and the Northwest Territories I don't have question because they're a cultural it's it's a very cultural issue and so and and in Canada or like you know we're here we have you know like one kind of skeptical person in Hannah there's one skeptic person on polar bears who is okay the Inuit yogi but who gets a lot of play in kind of like a Mitch Taylor who according to an you do a show you soar over that is completely financing we're talking that  to the point where he's pulled guns on other scientists who is having an oh I think so you know who this guy is like we're so they don't have they don't have a listing at all which is a for the conservationists is a real issue because you know you saw most of the bears in North America open clean US foods in Alaska they have exceptions for endangered species for the quail hunting and seal that someone yeah so I mean right now all hunting is done by which the resolution is in used to be so now if you were a hunter bear and there's much the Americans who knocked out there's you pay something like forty five thousand dollars to get a permit that been issued to whether corporations and they'll take you up there um but not in western heights of me this would be more to kind of look to it and another parts but I guess there are also issues with Canada play list polar bears then maybe any nation should not have a legal right to hunt them that's that's one of the main points of contention the other main point of contention of course if you're drilling for oil and gas in polar bear habitats you know there's next to a hurdle that you might have to go through to get a comment if that might have impact on I don't know if that's really the case or whether there has been any real impact from that yet but that's another reason why measured about 25,000 bears worldwide I mean roughly what do they do there she's no check diversity that's in crime unless she said so tell me about all your essential products why are you here people are fascinated by this question and so the answer is yes people have shops that have hybrid bears that's had grizzly fathers and polar bear mothers so you know normally let's get too closely the nature of that relationship um but nobody has any statistics on whether that's a common thing whether it's it's more common now because the bother the Grizzlies are moving more so you know you might think that there's more there's more possibility for the population overlap than there would have been a few years ago but nobody has a system so you can't tell whether this is something that's always happened whether there's something that's happening do you know if the whip the children of you birth they may can reproduce wonder if ya interesting i don't know god I I don't think anybody's ever seen that happen so you know one one scenario might well be that the brand barren grizzly bear populations can emerge and you lose the fact that that there was a unique of their species that just lived on the ice maybe f2 how many I find it quite reading the thing about the health of a species separately from from the health national individuals when when people say oh them that the species are gonna merge or this it all over a new plot okay well that's nice you what happened what happens is that becomes that are born in the South died and the cup that one lives a year in net transfer of population but it's because the ones that are living in situations that are becoming more stressful I don't make it an alien vessel and they have more stress and so you know it's it's this is a tricky thing that's education sorry isms in somehow yes well that made the basis of the voice all right now that mr. this threat but which is one step down from indeed so friend is given current trends they look like they're heading to be in danger so which i think is right for the for the population as a whole I think is the appropriate thing for subpopulations I think he might you can make an argument that there already but that makes it the endangerment finding in based on projections of cs change in the next 30 40 50 years annapolis improvement by greenhouse gases yeah but they try to get poison dependent status you know well interesting interestingly enough when Fish and Wildlife this kid out of the polar bear there's a whole bunch of things that you have to do if there's a threatened species there's all sorts of things that need to change but they put in an exemption that said we'll do all that we can to but not including any change terms you can see that my effectiveness so basically they listed it and say well we're not going to do anything I'll be affected by temperature and she'll like interesting question I guy I I don't know they are extremely wedding today because they have two layers of the furs very very thing um lots of layers that it's yeah I don't know a couple of degrees here oh there probably aren't gonna because they step up for the happy going into the water which is minus one minus two mins then coming back out and then seeing in minus forty-three air and back in the water or that you know so you know a degree or two in the air is probably not gonna be one either work if you feel that we could have dinner because they had no food then a big warm i do you care these stories about bears not making it back it seems to be waiting prices starvation risk but if you're five hundred miles i don't see i guess you can see it you might not see the recession lines we actually let me get to the edge well so then they are pretty good swimmers they can swim on a regular basis they can swim 50 kilometers 60 covers and the planet exceptionally that people they've been tracked going further but polar bears dude ran because they less really far away from straw in a fine oh so that's obviously harder to track because you don't generally see so yeah there is there is a mortality is about 5% in the world the word just they go in just as well for some reason yeah the issue is is not so so I said well you know you just cover it with white plastic and but the thing is you know one plastic is not somewhere where the seals are going to come and then their heads through that side it can breathe you need to be able to break through I mean like what their their design the progress of their niche is seeing seeing a seal kind of coming up through the ice which can be you know maybe a meter below you right and then you stop and then grabbing it and you know you're not gonna find you know some plastic substitute that's that's got there it is great Emilio face like that there's a breathing hole okay but but but okay you know this not okay but they can't break through quite um this is the size of the bear would have been my kind of

notified of something that I have to check out of course being a truck camper channel I love truck campers they said well you're gonna really like this truck camper this truck camper behind me right there is the only one of its kind it's the model 1163 now Northwood has a model that's eleven forty and eleven fifty but they only made one 1163 so I'm gonna do a short video probably actually be the same length as my other ones but quickly before that he closed down they closed down in about an hour and a half so what's special about this RV well as I'm looking at it right now one slide the door is on the this side of the RV not the back we've got two slides it sings oh no three slides three three slides in a truck camper okay let's go take a look inside come on this must weigh a ton oh let me open the door like this so you see exactly what I see right now oh my God look at this camper how is this even possible this is in the box of your truck oh my god okay so we're gonna take a full tour of this 1163 for a lot of you for most of you for anyone who doesn't live in this area this is gonna be the first and only time you'll get to see this camper so it kind of makes it special I believe the reason that they didn't follow through with production with this camper is simply because it's heavy you need more than a one-ton dually to haul this camper if you have the right setup this is an amazing an amazing option but for the normal person like myself or you guys we've got trucks we got single wheel trucks dual leaves of have half tons 3/4 tons this needs a little bit more than all of that okay so I don't even know where to start actually let's start on the outside we'll work our way inside and we'll just enjoy just once-in-a-lifetime experience brought to you by Taylor if you're just tuning into this video right now my name is Taylor I live in a arctic fox 2017 990 truck camper with one slide not three and I'm just down here in legrand Oregon touring the Northwood manufacturing plant Northwood is the company who makes arctic fox so that's kind of why I'm in this position that's why I'm here right now and I'm gonna give you the best tour that you ever had let's go [Music] all right guys let's flip the mic around so that you can hear me and I start going around this thing first thing I'm noticing unless I'm just noticing it and it's not true but it looks like it sticks out a whole lot farther than mine of the the cab over part you've got the same jacks I believe at least they look the same you've got portable water outlet right here and then this is a satellite port you've got your shower you've got your what looks to be your water heater and I'm not quite sure what these are called but when the camper is on it's jacks these are going to stable it so that it's not shaken not not rolling around too much when you're inside of it really like the side entrance right here the steps are a little bit different on the back you've got your slide out underneath you've got a 20-pound propane bottle there and a whole bunch of storage all your wiring that looks like it's your black water tank there so a lot of storage in the back here I'm guessing that this is more storage yeah right on your golf clubs could fit perfectly back here what kind of generator are we running looks to be yes the same one as mine so the 2,500 propane Cummins Onan generator we've got your batteries here more storage even more storage much more than my 990 and that is basically the outside till the top inside and check out what they've done different inside well they've done everything different so this whole back part slides out makes it a nice very roomy coach area and as I'm looking straight ahead there's a TV right ahead of me so how nice is that you've got your dinette over on the left-hand side which looks just like my 990 does but something that I'm falling in love with immediately is this island you rarely see well you I don't even know if another camper makes an island with their with their truck camper you usually see these in fifth wheels sometimes bigger travel trailers but I've never seen one in a truck camper so this is very very nice now of course there's a slide out here the slide out has your fridge your stove and your microwave on it when that slid in you probably can't access this area right here same with this area once this is slid in you probably can't access your bed which for somebody like me isn't very ideal because if you don't know who I am I live in my camper full-time so I sleep on side streets and I rarely put the slide out this unit is perfect for if you stay at camp sites or if you stay longer stays in certain areas you can put all three slides out and you've got a miniature apartment in here but for me it's not very practical although I do love the idea alright so as we continue along I'm sure that I'm missing a few things but this is just what I can see in my general outlook at it we've got your your panel right here for all of your functions looks like every other truck camper looks like you do have solar panels up top let's take a look in here oh I love this mere idea because I actually had to put a mirror on my fridge just something that sticks up on my fridge because my 990 doesn't have a mirror so I actually stuck my mirror on the freezer part of my fridge let's open up the bathroom door and you've got a beautiful dry bath so dry bath really nice a wet bath is the other option the wet bath has the toilet and the shower and everything combined everything gets soaked but with this dry bath you've got your bathroom area your toilet area and then your shower is the only thing that gets wet in there this is a beautiful washroom and then in all the arctic fox products they've got that big skylight up there so that if you're a big tall guy like me you can fit no problem in the shower all of this storage I do not have the luxury of having and then as we creep back here this is your bed oh yes okay oh man oh is this roomy this is massive I'm six two and a half give or take so that gives you an idea of how big this this bed is you could easily fit two people and storage all along the sides and then of course fantastic fan or if it gets a little bit hot you can pop a window up over here which I've learned pop a window at the back turn your fantastic fan to suck air out and then that air travels through the RV and where I'm from which is Vancouver Island you rarely need air conditioning throughout the summer months if you do that with this camper that island that you're sitting on right now that's an incredible idea I don't know how you would incorporate that into a smaller camper though you just can't because that's that's like your space where that island is right there if you don't have three slides Wow incredible so like I said guys there's probably many more features of this RV I just thought it'd be neat to film it and to show you guys so that you can see like I said once in a lifetime opportunity to see this camper good job good job arctic fox good job Northwood so that's it for me my friends I hoped I kept this video short I just wanted to show you this this amazing using our v1 in a lifetime experience so pretty pretty neat if you're just tuning in you're more than welcome to subscribe to my channel I've got lots of RV videos I've got lots of RV tours until next time my friends keep living that dream as always it's a pleasure hanging out with you take care of yourselves and bye bye I just held this camera angle right here does this look like a smaller travel trailer yes it does oh no it's a truck camper it fits in the box of your truck that's insane also a big shout out to thunder RV for let me come and explore that beast right there you", "7QS6yep_Mb0": "Hi, my name is Mike Pettigrew and welcome\nto another edition of Gear Up With Gregg's. Today we're going to talk about Alaska Heat\nPads. What is an Alaska Heat Pad? It is a 120V pad that is designed to heat\nsuch things as oil pans, hydraulic tanks, and a variety of other items such as batteries. The Alaska Heat Pad is available in a variety of sizes, ranging from 1 3/4\" x 5\" like this unit, up to a 12\" x 12\" version, like this! They are also available in a variety of wattages,\nranging from 50 W to 720 W. So when installing an Alaska Heat Pad, how\ndo you know which wattage to use? The general rule of thumb is that for every\nlitre of oil you are trying to heat, you need between 15 and 30 watts of power. How is the Alaska Heat Pad installed? We're going to use this oil pan as an example,\nIt has a capacity of approximately 6 litres. Based on the information that we just learned of using between 15-30 watts of power per litre of oil, you would either use a 100 or\n150 watt heat pad on this oil pan. So on this application, we're actually going\nto use a 150 Watt heat pad. You never want to use more wattage then required. This will cause damage to your oil pan. The heat pad must be installed on a clean,\nflat, dry surface. Which means also the paint has to be removed,\nas you can see in this application the paint is still on the oil pan, you would actually\nhave to take something like sand paper, a roloc disk, or something of that sort to remove\nthe paint. In doing so, you don't want to make the surface\nsmooth, you just need to leave it slightly rough so that it aids in adhesion. Apply a liberal amount of Permatex 77 BR silicon,\nor a product similar, to both the oil pan and the heat pad. Then install the heat pad onto the oil pan,\nand apply pressure to remove the excess silicon between the pad and the oil pan. The excess\nproduct can then be used to seal the edges of the heat pad to the oil pan. Why use an Alaska Heat Pad? It will protect your vehicle or piece of equipment\nfrom damage on initial start up during those long cold winter nights, and no, this is not\nto be used as an electric blanket. I have had personal experience using a heat\npad. Instead of using by block heater, i would\nonly plug in the heat pad. This made initial startup very easy on the\nvehicle because the oil was already warm. Well thats it for another edition of Gear\nUp With Gregg's, thanks for keeping it Canadian eh?", "941GBCmKzf4": "hey guys what's up today I'm going to show you how to take emblems off of my Silverado pickup so those emblems that are right there on the tailgate and the ones on the side and I'll show you a before picture anyway some of the things that you're going to need are some 3m adhesive remover and a towel I you like to use an eraser will and a drill and they have these things called plastic razor blades a heat gun and some gloves so a lot of times people like to use fishing lines and get behind them sorry my chair rolled back I didn't have any fishing line at least I couldn't find any if I do have some that makes it a little easier to kind of Whittle you're way behind the letter but we're going to show you how to use these things to get this accomplished you all right so on these smaller emblems it's not too hard because they're individual letters so it's not real bad I like to heat this up with the heat gun here run it across not not a ton of time if you get if you stand on one spot too long a risk bubble in the paint so just enough to get that warm and they'll become a little pliable and then that that gives you the ability if you have string some fishing line anyway you can come behind and sometimes easel just pull off just be careful not to scratch the paint you want to pull back on them that's why I use the plastic razor blade you can kind of get in behind them and sometimes you're going to have to I haven't even heated this one up and it's starting to pull off now on these other ones like the longer ones this flex-fuel in here they're a little trickier you got to get them a little warmer because there's more obviously contact with two sided tape on these so that will spend a little more time on and just like I said be careful not to heat the paint up too much or to bubble so that's step one alright so once we get that emblem off as you can see we've left the two sided tape on the backside sometimes if you get it warm that tape will stay on the letter but most the time it's gonna stay on the truck is that's where it has the best adhesion so the next step is we're gonna use the erase your wheel now this is exactly what it sounds like it's like a big eraser on a shaft that you put in your drill now the cool thing about this as you can run this back and forth the same way don't stay in one place too long but you're going to basically pull that paint off it's gonna rub and erase all of that leftover two-sided tape and I'll show you what it looks like when we get done all right so me finish with the eraser wheel and like I said don't keep it in one spot too long you'll you risk bubble on the paint with it as well but you can see it's just dust the leftover residue from that and then this there's some spots here that it's a little thicker but you're gonna be able to wipe that off with that adhesive remover I like to use 3m adhesive remover and a microfiber towel and then we're just gonna rub across that and I'll show you what it looks like when we get all about finished here all right so as you can see I wiped it down with adhesive remover and a microfiber towel so it looks way better anyway I went ahead and did the rest of the tailgate so you can see that Chevy emblem is gone the bow tie and then on those vinyl emblems you don't have to work quite as hard on those just heat them up a little bit and then scrape them off with the plastic razor blade and you're good to go anyway guys that's the way I approach taking emblems off like I said sometimes it's a little easier if you use some fishing line but I didn't have any but it looks way better make sure that you put a little bit of wax on there after using that adhesive remover because it does strip the wax off of it I'm gonna clay bar and paint correct this truck so that's something I'm gonna do next but if you liked this video give it a thumbs up and subscribe to see what happens next [Music]", "Wy6qsobAKIk": "I'm jumping with joy to do another video! Seriously? Big Opel news: the Astra Caravan, or actually, Sports Tourer. It's the station wagon variant of the hatchback, which we already know. It's very spacious, with 1630 liters after folding the rear seats. That's huge! The interior is like the Corsa: clean, nice materials, a neat car to be in. Also: new engine, including the 1.0 3-cilinder, which is a nice plant. It's practical too! It has Kick & Go... though it doesn't always work. Artega makes the small, sporty GT with a V6. But that's not the future. This Artega Scalo looks like it, but is a bit different. It sure is, because this has 2 electric motors producing 300 kW up to 400 kW on overboost. So 0-100 kph takes 3.6 seconds and it does 250 kph! Funky. But some details are weird. Like these little dynamic spoilers in the nose. Not to mention this. It doesn't have a combustion engine, but it does have an exhaust. So yeah, it does generate noise for the inside and the outside. So when it passes, it makes a V6 noise. Very special. What do you think? It sounds good. But it's fake! They will make 12 of these and cost 170000 euro's. Made in Germany. Start saving, as only two have been sold. At Lexus, the 4th gen RX draws attention. After New York this marks its European debut. We'll get it as a 450h, with V6 and electric power. And a 2.0 turbo offering 228 PS. So yeah... a timeless beauty. This new Prius is controversial. It's a thing for Toyota, as the Auris is very economical too now. So this has even better aerodynamics. Form follows function. It's 18 percent more economical. Also, it's on the new TNGA platform, and more models will follow. We know more about the RAV4. It has a 2.5 4-cilinder and an electric module, offering 197 PS. It's CO2 emissions are low, but not good enough for tax benefits in NL. An upside: it can pull up to 1600 kg's with this drivetrain. The new Nissan Navara.  I really like how tough it is! It's a pick-up truck... I know, I just love them. Perhaps it's compensation. I'll move along now. As he goes to the next car, here's some info:  Renault is making its own version, the Alaskan, as well as Mercedes. This is the Nissan Gripz - a concept to succeed an existing model. The Juke? But it's sporty too, so it could succeed the 370Z too. I don't get this at all. It's a mishmash. This high crossover succeeds the low-slung 370Z? Yeah, it makes sense: sportscar are hard to sell and expensive to make. This sells! I think it makes sense to Z this happen. So far our 3rd IAA video. Stay tuned for more! Right Marco? Yeah, I'm checking out our next video. It looks amazing.", "k74tvAWxb_g": "Seattle ( (listen) see-AT-\u0259l) is a seaport\ncity on the West Coast of the United States. It is the seat of King County, Washington.\nWith an estimated 730,000 residents as of 2018, Seattle is the largest city in both\nthe state of Washington and the Pacific Northwest region of North America. According to U.S.\nCensus data released in 2018, the Seattle metropolitan area\u2019s population stands at\n3.87 million, and ranks as the 15th largest in the United States. In July 2013, it was\nthe fastest-growing major city in the United States and remained in the Top 5 in May 2015\nwith an annual growth rate of 2.1%. In July 2016, Seattle was again the fastest-growing\nmajor U.S. city, with a 3.1% annual growth rate. Seattle is the northernmost large city\nin the United States. The city is situated on an isthmus between\nPuget Sound (an inlet of the Pacific Ocean) and Lake Washington, about 100 miles (160\nkm) south of the Canada\u2013United States border. A major gateway for trade with Asia, Seattle\nis the fourth-largest port in North America in terms of container handling as of 2015.The\nSeattle area was inhabited by Native Americans for at least 4,000 years before the first\npermanent European settlers. Arthur A. Denny and his group of travelers, subsequently known\nas the Denny Party, arrived from Illinois via Portland, Oregon, on the schooner Exact\nat Alki Point on November 13, 1851. The settlement was moved to the eastern shore of Elliott\nBay and named \"Seattle\" in 1852, in honor of Chief Si'ahl of the local Duwamish and\nSuquamish tribes. Logging was Seattle's first major industry,\nbut by the late 19th century, the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center\nas a gateway to Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush. Growth after World War II was partially\ndue to the local Boeing company, which established Seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing.\nThe Seattle area developed into a technology center from the 1980s onwards with companies\nlike Microsoft becoming established in the region; Microsoft founder Bill Gates is a\nSeattleite by birth. Internet retailer Amazon was founded in Seattle in 1994, and major\nairline Alaska Airlines was founded in SeaTac, Washington, serving Seattle's international\nairport, Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport. The stream of new software, biotechnology,\nand Internet companies led to an economic revival, which increased the city's population\nby almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000. Seattle has a noteworthy musical history.\nFrom 1918 to 1951, nearly two dozen jazz nightclubs existed along Jackson Street, from the current\nChinatown/International District to the Central District. The jazz scene nurtured the early\ncareers of Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, Ernestine Anderson, and others. Seattle is also the\nbirthplace of rock musician Jimi Hendrix, as well as the origin of the bands Nirvana,\nPearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Foo Fighters and the alternative rock movement\ngrunge. == History == === \nFounding === Archaeological excavations suggest that Native\nAmericans have inhabited the Seattle area for at least 4,000 years. By the time the\nfirst European settlers arrived, the people (subsequently called the Duwamish tribe) occupied\nat least seventeen villages in the areas around Elliott Bay.The first European to visit the\nSeattle area was George Vancouver, in May 1792 during his 1791\u201395 expedition to chart\nthe Pacific Northwest. In 1851, a large party led by Luther Collins\nmade a location on land at the mouth of the Duwamish River; they formally claimed it on\nSeptember 14, 1851. Thirteen days later, members of the Collins Party on the way to their claim\npassed three scouts of the Denny Party. Members of the Denny Party claimed land on Alki Point\non September 28, 1851. The rest of the Denny Party set sail from Portland, Oregon, and\nlanded on Alki point during a rainstorm on November 13, 1851. === Duwamps 1852\u20131853 === After a difficult winter, most of the Denny\nParty relocated across Elliott Bay and claimed land a second time at the site of present-day\nPioneer Square, naming this new settlement Duwamps.\nCharles Terry and John Low remained at the original landing location and reestablished\ntheir old land claim and called it \"New York,\" but renamed \"New York Alki\" in April 1853,\nfrom a Chinook word meaning, roughly, \"by and by\" or \"someday.\"For the next few years,\nNew York Alki and Duwamps competed for dominance, but in time Alki was abandoned and its residents\nmoved across the bay to join the rest of the settlers.David Swinson \"Doc\" Maynard, one\nof the founders of Duwamps, was the primary advocate to name the settlement after Chief\nSeattle (\"Seattle\") of the Duwamish and Suquamish tribes. === Incorporations ===\nThe name \"Seattle\" appears on official Washington Territory papers dated May 23, 1853, when\nthe first plats for the village were filed. In 1855, nominal land settlements were established.\nOn January 14, 1865, the Legislature of Territorial Washington incorporated the Town of Seattle\nwith a board of trustees managing the city. The Town of Seattle was disincorporated on\nJanuary 18, 1867, and remained a mere precinct of King County until late 1869, when a new\npetition was filed and the city was re-incorporated December 2, 1869, with a mayor\u2013council government.\nThe corporate seal of the City of Seattle carries the date \"1869\" and a likeness of\nChief Sealth in left profile. === Timber town === Seattle has a history of boom-and-bust cycles,\nlike many other cities near areas of extensive natural and mineral resources. Seattle has\nrisen several times economically, then gone into precipitous decline, but it has typically\nused those periods to rebuild solid infrastructure. The first such boom, covering the early years\nof the city, rode on the lumber industry. (During this period the road now known as\nYesler Way won the nickname \"Skid Road,\" supposedly after the timber skidding down the hill to\nHenry Yesler's sawmill. The later dereliction of the area may be a possible origin for the\nterm which later entered the wider American lexicon as Skid Row.) Like much of the American\nWest, Seattle saw numerous conflicts between labor and management, as well as ethnic tensions\nthat culminated in the anti-Chinese riots of 1885\u20131886. This violence originated with\nunemployed whites who were determined to drive the Chinese from Seattle (anti-Chinese riots\nalso occurred in Tacoma). In 1900, Asians were 4.2% of the population. Authorities declared\nmartial law and federal troops arrived to put down the disorder.\nSeattle had achieved sufficient economic success that when the Great Seattle Fire of 1889 destroyed\nthe central business district, a far grander city-center rapidly emerged in its place.\nFinance company Washington Mutual, for example, was founded in the immediate wake of the fire.\nHowever, the Panic of 1893 hit Seattle hard. === Gold Rush, World War I, and the Great\nDepression === The second and most dramatic boom resulted\nfrom the Klondike Gold Rush, which ended the depression that had begun with the Panic of\n1893. In a short time, Seattle became a major transportation center. On July 14, 1897, the\nS.S. Portland docked with its famed \"ton of gold,\" and Seattle became the main transport\nand supply point for the miners in Alaska and the Yukon. Few of those working men found\nlasting wealth. However, it was Seattle's business of clothing the miners and feeding\nthem salmon that panned out in the long run. Along with Seattle, other cities like Everett,\nTacoma, Port Townsend, Bremerton, and Olympia, all in the Puget Sound region, became competitors\nfor exchange, rather than mother lodes for extraction, of precious metals. The boom lasted\nwell into the early part of the 20th century, and funded many new Seattle companies and\nproducts. In 1907, 19-year-old James E. Casey borrowed $100 from a friend and founded the\nAmerican Messenger Company (later UPS). Other Seattle companies founded during this period\ninclude Nordstrom and Eddie Bauer. Seattle brought in the Olmsted Brothers landscape\narchitecture firm to design a system of parks and boulevards. The Gold Rush era culminated in the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific\nExposition of 1909, which is largely responsible for the layout of today's University of Washington\ncampus.A shipbuilding boom in the early part of the 20th century became massive during\nWorld War I, making Seattle somewhat of a company town. The subsequent retrenchment\nled to the Seattle General Strike of 1919, the first general strike in the country. A\n1912 city development plan by Virgil Bogue went largely unused. Seattle was mildly prosperous\nin the 1920s but was particularly hard hit in the Great Depression, experiencing some\nof the country's harshest labor strife in that era. Violence during the Maritime Strike\nof 1934 cost Seattle much of its maritime traffic, which was rerouted to the Port of\nLos Angeles.The Great Depression in Seattle affected many minority groups, one being the\nAsian Pacific Americans; they were subject to racism, loss of property, and failed claims\nof unemployment due to citizenship status.Seattle was one of the major cities that benefited\nfrom programs such as the WPA, CCC, UCL, and PWA. The workers, mostly men, built roads,\nparks, dams, schools, railroads, bridges, docks, and even historical and archival record\nsites and buildings. However, Seattle faced massive unemployment, loss of lumber and construction\nindustries as Los Angeles prevailed as the bigger West Coast city. Seattle had building\ncontracts that rivaled New York City and Chicago, but lost to LA as well. Seattle\u2019s eastern\nfarm land faded due to Oregon\u2019s and the Midwest\u2019s, forcing people into town.The\nfamous Hooverville arose during the Depression, leading to Seattle\u2019s growing homeless population.\nStationed outside Seattle, the Hooverville housed thousands of men but very very few\nchildren and no women. With work projects close to the city, Hooverville grew and the\nWPA settled into the city.A movement by women arose from Seattle during the Depression.\nFueled by Eleanor Roosevelt\u2019s book It\u2019s Up to the Women, women pushed for recognition,\nnot just as housewives, but as the backbone to family. Using newspapers and journals Working\nWoman and The Woman Today, women pushed to be seen as equal and receive some recognition.Seattle\u2019s\nUniversity of Washington was greatly affected during the Depression era. As schools across\nWashington lost funding and attendance, the UW actually prospered during the time period.\nWhile Seattle public schools were influenced by Washington\u2019s superintendent Worth McClure,\nthey still struggled to pay teachers and maintain attendance. The UW, despite academic challenges\nthat plagued the college due to differing views on teaching and learning, focused on\ngrowth in student enrollment rather than improving the existing school.Seattle was also the home\nbase of impresario Alexander Pantages who, starting in 1902, opened a number of theaters\nin the city exhibiting vaudeville acts and silent movies. His activities soon expanded,\nand the thrifty Greek went on and became one of America's greatest theater and movie tycoons.\nBetween Pantages and his rival John Considine, Seattle was for a while the western United\nStates' vaudeville mecca. B. Marcus Priteca, the Scottish-born and Seattle-based architect,\nbuilt several theaters for Pantages, including some in Seattle. The theaters he built for\nPantages in Seattle have been either demolished or converted to other uses, but many other\ntheaters survive in other cities of the U.S., often retaining the Pantages name; Seattle's\nsurviving Paramount Theatre, on which he collaborated, was not a Pantages theater. === Post-war years: aircraft and software\n=== War work again brought local prosperity during\nWorld War II, this time centered on Boeing aircraft. The war dispersed the city's numerous\nJapanese-American businessmen due to the Japanese American internment. After the war, the local\neconomy dipped. It rose again with Boeing's growing dominance in the commercial airliner\nmarket. Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with\nthe Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. Another major local economic downturn\nwas in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by\nthe oil crises, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the Boeing\n747. Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate\nagents put up a billboard reading \"Will the last person leaving Seattle \u2013 Turn out the\nlights.\"Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when the company separated\nits headquarters from its major production facilities; the headquarters were moved to\nChicago. The Seattle area is still home to Boeing's Renton narrow-body plant (where the\n707, 720, 727, and 757 were assembled, and the 737 is assembled today) and Everett wide-body\nplant (assembly plant for the 747, 767, 777, and 787). The company's credit union for employees,\nBECU, remains based in the Seattle area, though it is now open to all residents of Washington.\nAs prosperity began to return in the 1980s, the city was stunned by the Wah Mee massacre\nin 1983, when 13 people were killed in an illegal gambling club in the Seattle Chinatown-International\nDistrict. Beginning with Microsoft's 1979 move from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to nearby\nBellevue, Washington, Seattle and its suburbs became home to a number of technology companies\nincluding Amazon.com, F5 Networks, RealNetworks, Nintendo of America, McCaw Cellular (now part\nof AT&T Mobility), VoiceStream (now T-Mobile), and biomedical corporations such as HeartStream\n(later purchased by Philips), Heart Technologies (later purchased by Boston Scientific), Physio-Control\n(later purchased by Medtronic), ZymoGenetics, ICOS (later purchased by Eli Lilly and Company)\nand Immunex (later purchased by Amgen). This success brought an influx of new residents\nwith a population increase within city limits of almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000, and\nsaw Seattle's real estate become some of the most expensive in the country. In 1993, the\nmovie Sleepless in Seattle brought the city further national attention. Many of the Seattle\narea's tech companies remained relatively strong, but the frenzied dot-com boom years\nended in early 2001.Seattle in this period attracted widespread attention as home to\nthese many companies, but also by hosting the 1990 Goodwill Games and the APEC leaders\nconference in 1993, as well as through the worldwide popularity of grunge, a sound that\nhad developed in Seattle's independent music scene. Another bid for worldwide attention\u2014hosting\nthe World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999\u2014garnered visibility, but not in\nthe way its sponsors desired, as related protest activity and police reactions to those protests\novershadowed the conference itself. The city was further shaken by the Mardi Gras Riots\nin 2001, and then literally shaken the following day by the Nisqually earthquake. Another boom began as the city emerged from\nthe Great Recession which commenced when Amazon.com moved its headquarters from North Beacon Hill\nto South Lake Union. This initiated a historic construction boom which resulted in the completion\nof almost 10,000 apartments in Seattle in 2017, which is more than any previous year\nand nearly twice as many as were built in 2016. Beginning in 2010, and for the next\nfive years, Seattle gained an average of 14,511 residents per year, with the growth strongly\nskewed toward the center of the city, as unemployment dropped from roughly 9 percent to 3.6 percent.\nThe city has found itself \"bursting at the seams\", with over 45,000 households spending\nmore than half their income on housing and at least 2,800 people homeless, and with the\ncountry's sixth-worst rush hour traffic. == Geography ==\nWith a land area of 83.9 square miles (217.3 km\u00b2), Seattle is the northernmost city with\nat least 500,000 people in the United States, farther north than Canadian cities such as\nToronto, Ottawa, and Montreal, at about the same latitude as Salzburg, Austria.\nThe topography of Seattle is hilly. The city lies on several hills, including Capitol Hill,\nFirst Hill, West Seattle, Beacon Hill, Magnolia, Denny Hill, and Queen Anne. The Kitsap and\nthe Olympic peninsulas along with the Olympic mountains lie to the west of Puget Sound,\nwhile the Cascade Range and Lake Sammamish lie to the east of Lake Washington. The city\nhas over 5,540 acres (2,242 ha) of parkland. === Cityscape === === \nTopography === Seattle is located between the saltwater Puget\nSound (an arm of the Pacific Ocean) to the west and Lake Washington to the east. The\ncity's chief harbor, Elliott Bay, is part of Puget Sound, which makes the city an oceanic\nport. To the west, beyond Puget Sound, are the Kitsap Peninsula and Olympic Mountains\non the Olympic Peninsula; to the east, beyond Lake Washington and the Eastside suburbs,\nare Lake Sammamish and the Cascade Range. Lake Washington's waters flow to Puget Sound\nthrough the Lake Washington Ship Canal (consisting of two man-made canals, Lake Union, and the\nHiram M. Chittenden Locks at Salmon Bay, ending in Shilshole Bay on Puget Sound). The sea, rivers, forests, lakes, and fields\nsurrounding Seattle were once rich enough to support one of the world's few sedentary\nhunter-gatherer societies. The surrounding area lends itself well to sailing, skiing,\nbicycling, camping, and hiking year-round.The city itself is hilly, though not uniformly\nso. Like Rome, the city is said to lie on seven hills; the lists vary but typically\ninclude Capitol Hill, First Hill, West Seattle, Beacon Hill, Queen Anne, Magnolia, and the\nformer Denny Hill. The Wallingford, Delridge, Mount Baker, Seward Park, Washington Park,\nBroadmoor, Madrona, Phinney Ridge, Sunset Hill, Blue Ridge, Broadview, Laurelhurst,\nHawthorne Hills, Maple Leaf, and Crown Hill neighborhoods are all located on hills as\nwell. Many of the hilliest areas are near the city center, with Capitol Hill, First\nHill, and Beacon Hill collectively constituting something of a ridge along an isthmus between\nElliott Bay and Lake Washington. The break in the ridge between First Hill and Beacon\nHill is man-made, the result of two of the many regrading projects that reshaped the\ntopography of the city center. The topography of the city center was also changed by the\nconstruction of a seawall and the artificial Harbor Island (completed 1909) at the mouth\nof the city's industrial Duwamish Waterway, the terminus of the Green River. The highest\npoint within city limits is at High Point in West Seattle, which is roughly located\nnear 35th Ave SW and SW Myrtle St. Other notable hills include Crown Hill, View Ridge/Wedgwood/Bryant,\nMaple Leaf, Phinney Ridge, Mt. Baker Ridge, and Highlands/Carkeek/Bitterlake. North of the city center, Lake Washington\nShip Canal connects Puget Sound to Lake Washington. It incorporates four natural bodies of water:\nLake Union, Salmon Bay, Portage Bay, and Union Bay.\nDue to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire, Seattle is in a major earthquake zone.\nOn February 28, 2001, the magnitude 6.8 Nisqually earthquake did significant architectural damage,\nespecially in the Pioneer Square area (built on reclaimed land, as are the Industrial District\nand part of the city center), but caused only one fatality.\nOther strong quakes occurred on January 26, 1700 (estimated at 9 magnitude), December\n14, 1872 (7.3 or 7.4), April 13, 1949 (7.1), and April 29, 1965 (6.5). The 1965 quake caused\nthree deaths in Seattle directly and one more by heart failure. Although the Seattle Fault\npasses just south of the city center, neither it nor the Cascadia subduction zone has caused\nan earthquake since the city's founding. The Cascadia subduction zone poses the threat\nof an earthquake of magnitude 9.0 or greater, capable of seriously damaging the city and\ncollapsing many buildings, especially in zones built on fill.According to the United States\nCensus Bureau, the city has a total area of 142.5 square miles (369 km2), 83.9 square\nmiles (217 km2) of which is land and 58.7 square miles (152 km2), water (41.16% of the\ntotal area). === Climate === Seattle has a warm-temperate climate, classified\nas mediterranean due to its precipitation standard (K\u00f6ppen: Csb), although other upgraded\nclassifications like the one of Trewartha define it with an oceanic climate (Do, equivalent\nto the Cfb of K\u00f6ppen), due to its regime of temperature. It has cool, wet winters and\nmild, relatively dry summers, covering characteristics of both. The city and environs are part of\nUSDA hardiness zone 8b, with isolated coastal pockets falling under 9a.Temperature extremes\nare moderated by the adjacent Puget Sound, greater Pacific Ocean, and Lake Washington.\nThus extreme heat waves are rare in the Seattle area, as are very cold temperatures (below\nabout 15 \u00b0F (\u22129 \u00b0C)). The Seattle area is the most cloudy region of the United States,\ndue in part to frequent storms and lows moving in from the adjacent Pacific Ocean. Despite\nhaving a reputation for frequent rain, Seattle receives less precipitation than many other\nU.S. cities like Chicago or New York City. However, unlike many other U.S. cities, Seattle\nhas many more \"rain days\", when a very light drizzle falls from the sky for many days.\nIn an average year, at least 0.01 inches (0.25 mm) of precipitation falls on 150 days, more\nthan nearly all U.S. cities east of the Rocky Mountains. It is cloudy 201 days out of the\nyear and partly cloudy 93 days. Official weather and climatic data is collected at Seattle\u2013Tacoma\nInternational Airport, located about 19 km (12 mi) south of downtown in the city of SeaTac,\nwhich is at a higher elevation, and records more cloudy days and fewer partly cloudy days\nper year.Hot temperature extremes are enhanced by dry, compressed wind from the west slopes\nof the Cascades, while cold temperatures are generated mainly from the Fraser Valley in\nBritish Columbia.From 1981 to 2010, the average annual precipitation measured at Seattle\u2013Tacoma\nInternational Airport was 37.49 inches (952 mm). Annual precipitation has ranged from\n23.78 in (604 mm) in 1952 to 55.14 in (1,401 mm) in 1950; for water year (October 1 \u2013 September\n30) precipitation, the range is 23.16 in (588 mm) in 1976\u201377 to 51.82 in (1,316 mm) in\n1996\u201397. Due to local variations in microclimate, Seattle also receives significantly lower\nprecipitation than some other locations west of the Cascades. Around 80 mi (129 km) to\nthe west, the Hoh Rain Forest in Olympic National Park on the western flank of the Olympic Mountains\nreceives an annual average precipitation of 142 in (3.61 m). Sixty miles (95 km) to the\nsouth of Seattle, the state capital Olympia, which is out of the Olympic Mountains' rain\nshadow, receives an annual average precipitation of 50 in (1,270 mm). The city of Bremerton,\nabout 15 mi (24 km) west of downtown Seattle on the other side of the Puget Sound, receives\n56.4 in (1,430 mm) of precipitation annually.Conversely, the northeastern portion of the Olympic Peninsula,\nwhich lies east of the Olympic Mountains is located within the Olympic rain shadow and\nreceives significantly less precipitation than its surrounding areas. Prevailing airflow\nfrom the west is forced to cool and compress when colliding with the mountain range, resulting\nin high levels of precipitation within the mountains and its western slopes. Once the\nairflow reaches the leeward side of the mountains it then lowers and expands resulting in warmer,\nand significantly dryer air. Sequim, Washington, nicknamed \"Sunny Sequim,\" is located approximately\n40 mi (64 km) northwest of downtown Seattle and receives just 16.51 inches (419 mm) of\nannual precipitation, more comparable to that of Los Angeles. Oftentimes an area devoid\nof cloud cover can be seen extending out over the Puget Sound to the north and east of Sequim.\nOn average Sequim observes 127 sunny days per year in addition to 127 days with partial\ncloud cover. Other areas influenced by the Olympic rain shadow include Port Angeles,\nPort Townsend, extending as far north as Victoria, British Columbia.In November, Seattle averages\nmore rainfall than any other U.S. city of more than 250,000 people; it also ranks highly\nin winter precipitation. Conversely, the city receives some of the lowest precipitation\namounts of any large city from June to September. Seattle is one of the five rainiest major\nU.S. cities as measured by the number of days with precipitation, and it receives some of\nthe lowest amounts of annual sunshine among major cities in the lower 48 states, along\nwith some cities in the Northeast, Ohio and Michigan. Thunderstorms are rare, as the city\nreports thunder on just seven days per year. By comparison, Fort Myers, Florida, reports\nthunder on 93 days per year, Kansas City on 52, and New York City on 25.\nSeattle experiences its heaviest rainfall during the months of November, December and\nJanuary, receiving roughly half of its annual rainfall (by volume) during this period. In\nlate fall and early winter, atmospheric rivers (also known as \"Pineapple Express\" systems),\nstrong frontal systems, and Pacific low pressure systems are common. Light rain & drizzle are\nthe predominant forms of precipitation during the remainder of the year; for instance, on\naverage, less than 1.6 in (41 mm) of rain falls in July and August combined when rain\nis less common. On occasion, Seattle experiences somewhat more significant weather events.\nOne such event occurred on December 2\u20134, 2007, when sustained hurricane-force winds\nand widespread heavy rainfall associated with a strong Pineapple Express event occurred\nin the greater Puget Sound area and the western parts of Washington and Oregon. Precipitation\ntotals exceeded 13.8 in (350 mm) in some areas with winds topping out at 209 km/h (130 mph)\nalong coastal Oregon. It became the second wettest event in Seattle history when a little\nover 130 mm (5.1 in) of rain fell on Seattle in a 24-hour period. Lack of adaptation to\nthe heavy rain contributed to five deaths and widespread flooding and damage.Autumn,\nwinter, and early spring are frequently characterized by rain. Winters are cool and wet with December,\nthe coolest month, averaging 40.6 \u00b0F (4.8 \u00b0C), with 28 annual days with lows that reach\nthe freezing mark, and 2.0 days where the temperature stays at or below freezing all\nday; the temperature rarely lowers to 20 \u00b0F (\u22127 \u00b0C). Summers are sunny, dry and warm,\nwith August, the warmest month, with high temperatures averaging 76.1 \u00b0F (24.5 \u00b0C),\nand reaching 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) on 3.1 days per year. In 2015 the city recorded 13 days over\n90 \u00b0F. The hottest officially recorded temperature was 103 \u00b0F (39 \u00b0C) on July 29, 2009; the\ncoldest recorded temperature was 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) on January 31, 1950; the record cold\ndaily maximum is 16 \u00b0F (\u22129 \u00b0C) on January 14, 1950, while, conversely, the record warm\ndaily minimum is 71 \u00b0F (22 \u00b0C) the day the official record high was set. The average\nwindow for freezing temperatures is November 16 through March 10, allowing a growing season\nof 250 days. Seattle typically receives some snowfall on\nan annual basis but heavy snow is rare. Average annual snowfall, as measured at Sea-Tac Airport,\nis 6.8 inches (17.3 cm). Single calendar-day snowfall of six inches (15 cm) or greater\nhas occurred on only 15 days since 1948, and only once since February 17, 1990, when 6.8\nin (17.3 cm) of snow officially fell at Sea-Tac airport on January 18, 2012. This moderate\nsnow event was officially the 12th snowiest calendar day at the airport since 1948 and\nsnowiest since November 1985. Much of the city of Seattle proper received somewhat lesser\nsnowfall accumulations. Locations to the south of Seattle received more, with Olympia and\nChehalis receiving 14 to 18 in (36 to 46 cm). Another moderate snow event occurred from\nDecember 12\u201325, 2008, when over one foot (30 cm) of snow fell and stuck on much of\nthe roads over those two weeks, when temperatures remained below 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C), causing widespread\ndifficulties in a city not equipped for clearing snow. The largest documented snowstorm occurred\nfrom January 5\u20139, 1880, with snow drifting to 6 feet (1.8 m) in places at the end of\nthe snow event. From January 31 to February 2, 1916, another heavy snow event occurred\nwith 29 in (74 cm) of snow on the ground by the time the event was over. With official\nrecords dating to 1948, the largest single-day snowfall is 20.0 in (51 cm) on January 13,\n1950. Seasonal snowfall has ranged from zero in 1991\u201392 to 67.5 in (171 cm) in 1968\u201369,\nwith trace amounts having occurred as recently as 2009\u201310.

In the convergence zone, air arriving from the north meets air flowing\nin from the south. Both streams of air originate over the Pacific Ocean; airflow is split by\nthe Olympic Mountains to Seattle's west, then reunited to the east. When the air currents\nmeet, they are forced upward, resulting in convection. Thunderstorms caused by this activity\nare usually weak and can occur north and south of town, but Seattle itself rarely receives\nmore than occasional thunder and small hail showers. The Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm in December\n2006 is an exception that brought heavy rain and winds gusting up to 69 mph (111 km/h),\nan event that was not caused by the Puget Sound Convergence Zone and was widespread\nacross the Pacific Northwest. One of many exceptions to Seattle's reputation\nas a damp location occurs in El Ni\u00f1o years, when marine weather systems track as far south\nas California and little precipitation falls in the Puget Sound area. Since the region's\nwater comes from mountain snow packs during the dry summer months, El Ni\u00f1o winters can\nnot only produce substandard skiing but can result in water rationing and a shortage of\nhydroelectric power the following summer. == Demographics ==\nAccording to the 2012-2016 American Community Survey (ACS), the racial makeup of the city\nwas 65.7% Caucasian, 14.1% Asian, 7.0% of African origin,\n6.6% Hispanic or Latino of any race, 0.4% Native American, 0.9% Pacific Islander, 0.2%\nother races, and 5.6% two or more races.

A 2008 United States Census\nBureau survey showed that Seattle had the highest percentage of college and university\ngraduates of any major U.S. city. The city was listed as the most literate of the country's\n69 largest cities in 2005 and 2006, the second most literate in 2007 and the most literate\nin 2008 in studies conducted by Central Connecticut State University. Seattle Public Schools desegregated without\na court order but continue to struggle to achieve racial balance in a somewhat ethnically\ndivided city (the south part of town having more ethnic minorities than the north). In\n2007, Seattle's racial tie-breaking system was struck down by the United States Supreme\nCourt, but the ruling left the door open for desegregation formulae based on other indicators\n(e.g., income or socioeconomic class).The public school system is supplemented by a\nmoderate number of private schools: five of the private high schools are Catholic, one\nis Lutheran, and six are secular.Seattle is home to the University of Washington, as well\nas the institution's professional and continuing education unit, the University of Washington\nEducational Outreach. The 2017 U.S. News & World Report ranked the University of Washington\nat #11 in the world, tied with Johns Hopkins University. The UW receives more federal research\nand development funding than any public institution. Over the last 10 years, it has also produced\nmore Peace Corps volunteers than any other U.S. university. Seattle also has a number\nof smaller private universities including Seattle University and Seattle Pacific University,\nthe former a Jesuit Catholic institution, the latter Free Methodist; universities aimed\nat the working adult, like City University and Antioch University; colleges within the\nSeattle Colleges District system, comprising North, Central, and South; seminaries, including\nWestern Seminary and a number of arts colleges, such as Cornish College of the Arts, Pratt\nFine Arts Center, and The Art Institute of Seattle. In 2001, Time magazine selected Seattle\nCentral Community College as community college of the year, stating the school \"pushes diverse\nstudents to work together in small teams\". == Media == As of 2010, Seattle has one major daily newspaper,\nThe Seattle Times. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, known as the P-I, published a daily newspaper\nfrom 1863 to March 17, 2009, before switching to a strictly on-line publication. There is\nalso the Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce, and the University of Washington publishes\nThe Daily, a student-run publication, when school is in session. The most prominent weeklies\nare the Seattle Weekly and The Stranger; both consider themselves \"alternative\" papers.\nThe weekly LGBT newspaper is the Seattle Gay News. Real Change is a weekly street newspaper\nthat is sold mainly by homeless persons as an alternative to panhandling. There are also\nseveral ethnic newspapers, including The Facts, Northwest Asian Weekly and the International\nExaminer, and numerous neighborhood newspapers. Seattle is also well served by television\nand radio, with all major U.S. networks represented, along with at least five other English-language\nstations and two Spanish-language stations. Seattle cable viewers also receive CBUT 2\n(CBC) from Vancouver, British Columbia. Non-commercial radio stations include NPR\naffiliates KUOW-FM 94.9 and KNKX 88.5 (Tacoma), as well as classical music station KING-FM\n98.1. Other non-commercial stations include KEXP-FM 90.3 (affiliated with the UW), community\nradio KBCS-FM 91.3 (affiliated with Bellevue College), and high school radio KNHC-FM 89.5,\nwhich broadcasts an electronic dance music radio format and is owned by the public school\nsystem and operated by students of Nathan Hale High School. Many Seattle radio stations\nare also available through Internet radio, with KEXP in particular being a pioneer of\nInternet radio. Seattle also has numerous commercial radio stations. In a March 2012\nreport by the consumer research firm Arbitron, the top FM stations were KRWM (adult contemporary\nformat), KIRO-FM (news/talk), and KISW (active rock) while the top AM stations were KOMO\n(AM) (all news), KJR (AM) (all sports), KIRO (AM) (all sports).Seattle-based online magazines\nWorldchanging and Grist.org were two of the \"Top Green Websites\" in 2007 according to\nTIME.Seattle also has many online news media websites. The two largest are The Seattle\nTimes and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. == Infrastructure == === \nHealth systems === The University of Washington is consistently\nranked among the country's top leading institutions in medical research, earning special merits\nfor programs in neurology and neurosurgery. Seattle has seen local developments of modern\nparamedic services with the establishment of Medic One in 1970. In 1974, a 60 Minutes\nstory on the success of the then four-year-old Medic One paramedic system called Seattle\n\"the best place in the world to have a heart attack\".Three of Seattle's largest medical\ncenters are located on First Hill. Harborview Medical Center, the public county hospital,\nis the only Level I trauma hospital in a region that includes Washington, Alaska, Montana,\nand Idaho. Virginia Mason Medical Center and Swedish Medical Center's two largest campuses\nare also located in this part of Seattle, including the Virginia Mason Hospital. This\nconcentration of hospitals resulted in the neighborhood's nickname \"Pill Hill\".Located\nin the Laurelhurst neighborhood, Seattle Children's, formerly Children's Hospital and Regional\nMedical Center, is the pediatric referral center for Washington, Alaska, Montana, and\nIdaho. The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has a campus in the Eastlake neighborhood.\nThe University District is home to the University of Washington Medical Center which, along\nwith Harborview, is operated by the University of Washington. Seattle is also served by a\nVeterans Affairs hospital on Beacon Hill, a third campus of Swedish in Ballard, and\nNorthwest Hospital and Medical Center near Northgate Mall. === Transportation === The first streetcars appeared in 1889 and\nwere instrumental in the creation of a relatively well-defined downtown and strong neighborhoods\nat the end of their lines. The advent of the automobile sounded the death knell for rail\nin Seattle. Tacoma\u2013Seattle railway service ended in 1929 and the Everett\u2013Seattle service\ncame to an end in 1939, replaced by automobiles running on the recently developed highway\nsystem. Rails on city streets were paved over or removed, and the opening of the Seattle\ntrolleybus system brought the end of streetcars in Seattle in 1941. This left an extensive\nnetwork of privately owned buses (later public) as the only mass transit within the city and\nthroughout the region. King County Metro provides frequent stop bus\nservice within the city and surrounding county, as well as the South Lake Union Streetcar\nline and the First Hill Streetcar line. Seattle is one of the few cities in North America\nwhose bus fleet includes electric trolleybuses. Sound Transit provides an express bus service\nwithin the metropolitan area, two Sounder commuter rail lines between the suburbs and\ndowntown, and its Central Link light rail line between the University of Washington\nand Angle Lake. Washington State Ferries, which manages the largest network of ferries\nin the United States and third largest in the world, connects Seattle to Bainbridge\nand Vashon Islands in Puget Sound and to Bremerton and Southworth on the Kitsap Peninsula. According to the 2007 American Community Survey,\n18.6% of Seattle residents used one of the three public transit systems that serve the\ncity, giving it the highest transit ridership of all major cities without heavy or light\nrail prior to the completion of Sound Transit's Central Link line. The city has also been\ndescribed by Bert Sperling as the fourth most walkable U.S. city and by Walk Score as the\nsixth most walkable of the fifty largest U.S. cities.Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport,\nlocally known as Sea-Tac Airport and located just south in the neighboring city of SeaTac,\nis operated by the Port of Seattle and provides commercial air service to destinations throughout\nthe world. Closer to downtown, Boeing Field is used for general aviation, cargo flights,\nand testing/delivery of Boeing airliners. The main mode of transportation, however,\nrelies on Seattle's streets, which are laid out in a cardinal directions grid pattern,\nexcept in the central business district where early city leaders Arthur Denny and Carson\nBoren insisted on orienting their plats relative to the shoreline rather than to true North.\nOnly two roads, Interstate 5 and State Route 99 (both limited-access highways), run uninterrupted\nthrough the city from north to south. State Route 99 runs through downtown Seattle on\nthe Alaskan Way Viaduct, which was built in 1953. However, due to damage sustained during\nthe 2001 Nisqually earthquake the viaduct will be replaced by a tunnel. The 2-mile (3.2\nkm) Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel was originally scheduled to be completed in\nDecember 2015 at a cost of US$4.25 billion. Unfortunately, due to issues with the worlds\nlargest tunnel boring machine (TBM), which is nicknamed \"Bertha\" and is 57 feet (17 m)\nin diameter, the projected date of completion has been pushed back to fall 2018 (with tolling\nset to begin in 2019). Seattle has the 8th worst traffic congestion of all American cities,\nand is 10th among all North American cities.The city has started moving away from the automobile\nand towards mass transit. From 2004 to 2009, the annual number of unlinked public transportation\ntrips increased by approximately 21%. In 2006, voters in King County passed proposition 2\n(Transit Now) which increased bus service hours on high ridership routes and paid for\nfive bus rapid transit lines called RapidRide. After rejecting a roads and transit measure\nin 2007, Seattle-area voters passed a transit only measure in 2008 to increase ST Express\nbus service, extend the Link light rail system, and expand and improve Sounder commuter rail\nservice. A light rail line from downtown heading south to Sea-Tac Airport began service on\nDecember 19, 2009, giving the city its first rapid transit line with intermediate stations\nwithin the city limits. An extension north to the University of Washington opened on\nMarch 19, 2016; and further extensions are planned to reach Lynnwood to the north, Des\nMoines to the south, and Bellevue and Redmond to the east by 2023. Voters in the Puget Sound\nregion approved an additional tax increase in November 2016 to expand light rail to West\nSeattle and Ballard as well as Tacoma, Everett, and Issaquah. === Utilities === Water and electric power are municipal services,\nprovided by Seattle Public Utilities and Seattle City Light respectively. Other utility companies\nserving Seattle include Puget Sound Energy (natural gas, electricity); Seattle Steam\nCompany (steam); Waste Management, Inc and CleanScapes, Inc. (curbside recycling and\nsolid waste removal); CenturyLink, Frontier Communications, Wave Broadband, and Comcast\n(telecommunications and television). About 90% of Seattle's electricity is produced\nusing hydropower. Less than 2% of electricity is produced using fossil fuels. == Notable people == == \nSister cities == Seattle is partnered with: == See also == National Register of Historic Places listings\nin Seattle, Washington Seattle Freeze\nSeattle process Seattle tugboats\nTillicum Village", "SH0rc-mLyvU": "Seattle ( (listen) see-AT-\u0259l) is a seaport\ncity on the West Coast of the United States. It is the seat of King County, Washington.\nWith an estimated 744,955 residents as of 2018, Seattle is the largest city in both\nthe state of Washington and the Pacific Northwest region of North America. According to U.S.\nCensus data released in 2018, the Seattle metropolitan area's population stands at 3.94\nmillion, and ranks as the 15th largest in the United States. In July 2013, it was the\nfastest-growing major city in the United States and remained in the top 5 in May 2015 with\nan annual growth rate of 2.1%. In July 2016, Seattle was again the fastest-growing major\nU.S. city, with a 3.1% annual growth rate. Seattle is the northernmost large city in\nthe United States. The city is situated on an isthmus between\nPuget Sound (an inlet of the Pacific Ocean) and Lake Washington, about 100 miles (160\nkm) south of the Canada\u2013United States border. A major gateway for trade with Asia, Seattle\nis the fourth-largest port in North America in terms of container handling as of 2015.The\nSeattle area was inhabited by Native Americans for at least 4,000 years before the first\npermanent European settlers. Arthur A. Denny and his group of travelers, subsequently known\nas the Denny Party, arrived from Illinois via Portland, Oregon, on the schooner Exact\nat Alki Point on November 13, 1851. The settlement was moved to the eastern shore of Elliott\nBay and named \"Seattle\" in 1852, in honor of Chief Si'ahl of the local Duwamish and\nSuquamish tribes. Today, Seattle has high populations of Native, Scandinavian, African,\nand Asian Americans, as well as a thriving LGBT community that ranks 6th in the United\nStates for population.Logging was Seattle's first major industry, but by the late 19th\ncentury, the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway to Alaska\nduring the Klondike Gold Rush. Growth after World War II was partially due to the local\nBoeing company, which established Seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing. The\nSeattle area developed into a technology center from the 1980s onwards with companies like\nMicrosoft becoming established in the region; Microsoft founder Bill Gates is a Seattleite\nby birth. Internet retailer Amazon was founded in Seattle in 1994, and major airline Alaska\nAirlines is based in SeaTac, Washington, serving Seattle's international airport, Seattle\u2013Tacoma\nInternational Airport. The stream of new software, biotechnology, and Internet companies led\nto an economic revival, which increased the city's population by almost 50,000 between\n1990 and 2000. Owing largely to its rapidly increasing population in the 21st century,\nSeattle and the state of Washington have some of the highest minimum wages in the country,\nat $15 per hour for smaller businesses and $16 for the city's largest employers.Seattle\nhas a noteworthy musical history. From 1918 to 1951, nearly two dozen jazz nightclubs\nexisted along Jackson Street, from the current Chinatown/International District to the Central\nDistrict. The jazz scene nurtured the early careers of Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, Ernestine\nAnderson, and others. Seattle is also the birthplace of rock musician Jimi Hendrix,\nas well as the origin of the bands Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Foo\nFighters and the alternative rock movement grunge. == History == === \nFounding === Archaeological excavations suggest that Native\nAmericans have inhabited the Seattle area for at least 4,000 years. By the time the\nfirst European settlers arrived, the people (subsequently called the Duwamish tribe) occupied\nat least seventeen villages in the areas around Elliott Bay.The first European to visit the\nSeattle area was George Vancouver, in May 1792 during his 1791\u201395 expedition to chart\nthe Pacific Northwest. In 1851, a large party led by Luther Collins\nmade a location on land at the mouth of the Duwamish River; they formally claimed it on\nSeptember 14, 1851. Thirteen days later, members of the Collins Party on the way to their claim\npassed three scouts of the Denny Party. Members of the Denny Party claimed land on Alki Point\non September 28, 1851. The rest of the Denny Party set sail from Portland, Oregon, and\nlanded on Alki point during a rainstorm on November 13, 1851. === Duwamps 1852\u20131853 === After a difficult winter, most of the Denny\nParty relocated across Elliott Bay and claimed land a second time at the site of present-day\nPioneer Square, naming this new settlement Duwamps.\nCharles Terry and John Low remained at the original landing location and reestablished\ntheir old land claim and called it \"New York\", but renamed \"New York Alki\" in April 1853,\nfrom a Chinook word meaning, roughly, \"by and by\" or \"someday\".For the next few years,\nNew York Alki and Duwamps competed for dominance, but in time Alki was abandoned and its residents\nmoved across the bay to join the rest of the settlers.David Swinson \"Doc\" Maynard, one\nof the founders of Duwamps, was the primary advocate to name the settlement after Chief\nSeattle (\"Seattle\") of the Duwamish and Suquamish tribes. === Incorporations ===\nThe name \"Seattle\" appears on official Washington Territory papers dated May 23, 1853, when\nthe first plats for the village were filed. In 1855, nominal land settlements were established.\nOn January 14, 1865, the Legislature of Territorial Washington incorporated the Town of Seattle\nwith a board of trustees managing the city. The Town of Seattle was disincorporated on\nJanuary 18, 1867, and remained a mere precinct of King County until late 1869, when a new\npetition was filed and the city was re-incorporated December 2, 1869, with a mayor\u2013council government.\nThe corporate seal of the City of Seattle carries the date \"1869\" and a likeness of\nChief Sealth in left profile. === Timber town === Seattle has a history of boom-and-bust cycles,\nlike many other cities near areas of extensive natural and mineral resources. Seattle has\nrisen several times economically, then gone into precipitous decline, but it has typically\nused those periods to rebuild solid infrastructure. The first such boom, covering the early years\nof the city, rode on the lumber industry. (During this period the road now known as\nYesler Way won the nickname \"Skid Road,\" supposedly after the timber skidding down the hill to\nHenry Yesler's sawmill. The later dereliction of the area may be a possible origin for the\nterm which later entered the wider American lexicon as Skid Row.) Like much of the American\nWest, Seattle saw numerous conflicts between labor and management, as well as ethnic tensions\nthat culminated in the anti-Chinese riots of 1885\u20131886. This violence originated with\nunemployed whites who were determined to drive the Chinese from Seattle (anti-Chinese riots\nalso occurred in Tacoma). In 1900, Asians were 4.2% of the population. Authorities declared\nmartial law and federal troops arrived to put down the disorder.\nSeattle had achieved sufficient economic success that when the Great Seattle Fire of 1889 destroyed\nthe central business district, a far grander city-center rapidly emerged in its place.\nFinance company Washington Mutual, for example, was founded in the immediate wake of the fire.\nHowever, the Panic of 1893 hit Seattle hard. === Gold Rush, World War I, and the Great\nDepression === The second and most dramatic boom resulted\nfrom the Klondike Gold Rush, which ended the depression that had begun with the Panic of\n1893. In a short time, Seattle became a major transportation center. On July 14, 1897, the\nS.S. Portland docked with its famed \"ton of gold,\" and Seattle became the main transport\nand supply point for the miners in Alaska and the Yukon. Few of those working men found\nlasting wealth. However, it was Seattle's business of clothing the miners and feeding\nthem salmon that panned out in the long run. Along with Seattle, other cities like Everett,\nTacoma, Port Townsend, Bremerton, and Olympia, all in the Puget Sound region, became competitors\nfor exchange, rather than mother lodes for extraction, of precious metals. The boom lasted\nwell into the early part of the 20th century, and funded many new Seattle companies and\nproducts. In 1907, 19-year-old James E. Casey borrowed $100 from a friend and founded the\nAmerican Messenger Company (later UPS). Other Seattle companies founded during this period\ninclude Nordstrom and Eddie Bauer. Seattle brought in the Olmsted Brothers landscape\narchitecture firm to design a system of parks and boulevards. The Gold Rush era culminated in the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific\nExposition of 1909, which is largely responsible for the layout of today's University of Washington\ncampus.A shipbuilding boom in the early part of the 20th century became massive during\nWorld War I, making Seattle somewhat of a company town. The subsequent retrenchment\nled to the Seattle General Strike of 1919, the first general strike in the country. A\n1912 city development plan by Virgil Bogue went largely unused. Seattle was mildly prosperous\nin the 1920s but was particularly hard hit in the Great Depression, experiencing some\nof the country's harshest labor strife in that era. Violence during the Maritime Strike\nof 1934 cost Seattle much of its maritime traffic, which was rerouted to the Port of\nLos Angeles.The Great Depression in Seattle affected many minority groups, one being the\nAsian Pacific Americans; they were subject to racism, loss of property, and failed claims\nof unemployment due to citizenship status.Seattle was one of the major cities that benefited\nfrom programs such as the WPA, CCC, UCL, and PWA. The workers, mostly men, built roads,\nparks, dams, schools, railroads, bridges, docks, and even historical and archival record\nsites and buildings. However, Seattle faced massive unemployment, loss of lumber and construction\nindustries as Los Angeles prevailed as the bigger West Coast city. Seattle had building\ncontracts that rivaled New York City and Chicago, but lost to LA as well. Seattle's eastern\nfarm land faded due to Oregon's and the Midwest's, forcing people into town.The famous Hooverville\narose during the Depression, leading to Seattle's growing homeless population. Stationed outside\nSeattle, the Hooverville housed thousands of men but very very few children and no women.\nWith work projects close to the city, Hooverville grew and the WPA settled into the city.A movement\nby women arose from Seattle during the Depression. Fueled by Eleanor Roosevelt's book It's Up\nto the Women, women pushed for recognition, not just as housewives, but as the backbone\nto family. Using newspapers and journals Working Woman and The Woman Today, women pushed to\nbe seen as equal and receive some recognition.Seattle's University of Washington was greatly affected\nduring the Depression era. As schools across Washington lost funding and attendance, the\nUW actually prospered during the time period. While Seattle public schools were influenced\nby Washington's superintendent Worth McClure, they still struggled to pay teachers and maintain\nattendance. The UW, despite academic challenges that plagued the college due to differing\nviews on teaching and learning, focused on growth in student enrollment rather than improving\nthe existing school.Seattle was also the home base of impresario Alexander Pantages who,\nstarting in 1902, opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting vaudeville acts and\nsilent movies. His activities soon expanded, and the thrifty Greek went on and became one\nof America's greatest theater and movie tycoons. Between Pantages and his rival John Considine,\nSeattle was for a while the western United States' vaudeville mecca. B. Marcus Priteca,\nthe Scottish-born and Seattle-based architect, built several theaters for Pantages, including\nsome in Seattle. The theaters he built for Pantages in Seattle have been either demolished\nor converted to other uses, but many other theaters survive in other cities of the U.S.,\noften retaining the Pantages name; Seattle's surviving Paramount Theatre, on which he collaborated,\nwas not a Pantages theater. === Post-war years: aircraft and software\n=== War work again brought local prosperity during\nWorld War II, this time centered on Boeing aircraft. The war dispersed the city's numerous\nJapanese-American businessmen due to the Japanese American internment. After the war, the local\neconomy dipped. It rose again with Boeing's growing dominance in the commercial airliner\nmarket. Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with\nthe Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. Another major local economic downturn\nwas in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by\nthe oil crises, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the Boeing\n747. Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate\nagents put up a billboard reading \"Will the last person leaving Seattle \u2013 Turn out the\nlights.\"Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when the company separated\nits headquarters from its major production facilities; the headquarters were moved to\nChicago. The Seattle area is still home to Boeing's Renton narrow-body plant (where the\n707, 720, 727, and 757 were assembled, and the 737 is assembled today) and Everett wide-body\nplant (assembly plant for the 747, 767, 777, and 787). The company's credit union for employees,\nBECU, remains based in the Seattle area, though it is now open to all residents of Washington.\nAs prosperity began to return in the 1980s, the city was stunned by the Wah Mee massacre\nin 1983, when 13 people were killed in an illegal gambling club in the Seattle Chinatown-International\nDistrict. Beginning with Microsoft's 1979 move from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to nearby\nBellevue, Washington, Seattle and its suburbs became home to a number of technology companies\nincluding Amazon.com, F5 Networks, RealNetworks, Nintendo of America, McCaw Cellular (now part\nof AT&T Mobility), VoiceStream (now T-Mobile), and biomedical corporations such as HeartStream\n(later purchased by Philips), Heart Technologies (later purchased by Boston Scientific), Physio-Control\n(later purchased by Medtronic), ZymoGenetics, ICOS (later purchased by Eli Lilly and Company)\nand Immunex (later purchased by Amgen). This success brought an influx of new residents\nwith a population increase within city limits of almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000, and\nsaw Seattle's real estate become some of the most expensive in the country. In 1993, the\nmovie Sleepless in Seattle brought the city further national attention. The dot-com boom\ncaused a great frenzy among the technology companies in Seattle but the bubble ended\nin early 2001.Seattle in this period attracted widespread attention as home to these many\ncompanies, but also by hosting the 1990 Goodwill Games and the APEC leaders conference in 1993,\nas well as through the worldwide popularity of grunge, a sound that had developed in Seattle's\nindependent music scene. Another bid for worldwide attention\u2014hosting the World Trade Organization\nMinisterial Conference of 1999\u2014garnered visibility, but not in the way its sponsors\ndesired, as related protest activity and police reactions to those protests overshadowed the\nconference itself. The city was further shaken by the Mardi Gras Riots in 2001, and then\nliterally shaken the following day by the Nisqually earthquake. Another boom began as the city emerged from\nthe Great Recession which commenced when Amazon.com moved its headquarters from North Beacon Hill\nto South Lake Union. This initiated a historic construction boom which resulted in the completion\nof almost 10,000 apartments in Seattle in 2017, which is more than any previous year\nand nearly twice as many as were built in 2016. Beginning in 2010, and for the next\nfive years, Seattle gained an average of 14,511 residents per year, with the growth strongly\nskewed toward the center of the city, as unemployment dropped from roughly 9 percent to 3.6 percent.\nThe city has found itself \"bursting at the seams\", with over 45,000 households spending\nmore than half their income on housing and at least 2,800 people homeless, and with the\ncountry's sixth-worst rush hour traffic. == Geography ==\nWith a land area of 83.9 square miles (217.3 km\u00b2), Seattle is the northernmost city with\nat least 500,000 people in the United States, farther north than Canadian cities such as\nToronto, Ottawa, and Montreal, and at about the same latitude as Salzburg, Austria.\nThe topography of Seattle is hilly. The city lies on several hills, including Capitol Hill,\nFirst Hill, West Seattle, Beacon Hill, Magnolia, Denny Hill, and Queen Anne. The Kitsap and\nthe Olympic peninsulas along with the Olympic mountains lie to the west of Puget Sound,\nwhile the Cascade Range and Lake Sammamish lie to the east of Lake Washington. The city\nhas over 5,540 acres (2,242 ha) of parkland. === Cityscape === === \nTopography === Seattle is located between the saltwater Puget\nSound (an arm of the Pacific Ocean) to the west and Lake Washington to the east. The\ncity's chief harbor, Elliott Bay, is part of Puget Sound, which makes the city an oceanic\nport. To the west, beyond Puget Sound, are the Kitsap Peninsula and Olympic Mountains\non the Olympic Peninsula; to the east, beyond Lake Washington and the Eastside suburbs,\nare Lake Sammamish and the Cascade Range. Lake Washington's waters flow to Puget Sound\nthrough the Lake Washington Ship Canal (consisting of two man-made canals, Lake Union, and the\nHiram M. Chittenden Locks at Salmon Bay, ending in Shilshole Bay on Puget Sound). The sea, rivers, forests, lakes, and fields\nsurrounding Seattle were once rich enough to support one of the world's few sedentary\nhunter-gatherer societies. The surrounding area lends itself well to sailing, skiing,\nbicycling, camping, and hiking year-round.The city itself is hilly, though not uniformly\nso. Like Rome, the city is said to lie on seven hills; the lists vary but typically\ninclude Capitol Hill, First Hill, West Seattle, Beacon Hill, Queen Anne, Magnolia, and the\nformer Denny Hill. The Wallingford, Delridge, Mount Baker, Seward Park, Washington Park,\nBroadmoor, Madrona, Phinney Ridge, Sunset Hill, Blue Ridge, Broadview, Laurelhurst,\nHawthorne Hills, Maple Leaf, and Crown Hill neighborhoods are all located on hills as\nwell. Many of the hilliest areas are near the city center, with Capitol Hill, First\nHill, and Beacon Hill collectively constituting something of a ridge along an isthmus between\nElliott Bay and Lake Washington. The break in the ridge between First Hill and Beacon\nHill is man-made, the result of two of the many regrading projects that reshaped the\ntopography of the city center. The topography of the city center was also changed by the\nconstruction of a seawall and the artificial Harbor Island (completed 1909) at the mouth\nof the city's industrial Duwamish Waterway, the terminus of the Green River. The highest\npoint within city limits is at High Point in West Seattle, which is roughly located\nnear 35th Ave SW and SW Myrtle St. Other notable hills include Crown Hill, View Ridge/Wedgwood/Bryant,\nMaple Leaf, Phinney Ridge, Mt. Baker Ridge, and Highlands/Carkeek/Bitterlake. North of the city center, Lake Washington\nShip Canal connects Puget Sound to Lake Washington. It incorporates four natural bodies of water:\nLake Union, Salmon Bay, Portage Bay, and Union Bay.\nDue to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire, Seattle is in a major earthquake zone.\nOn February 28, 2001, the magnitude 6.8 Nisqually earthquake did significant architectural damage,\nespecially in the Pioneer Square area (built on reclaimed land, as are the Industrial District\nand part of the city center), but caused only one fatality.\nOther strong quakes occurred on January 26, 1700 (estimated at 9 magnitude), December\n14, 1872 (7.3 or 7.4), April 13, 1949 (7.1), and April 29, 1965 (6.5). The 1965 quake caused\nthree deaths in Seattle directly and one more by heart failure. Although the Seattle Fault\npasses just south of the city center, neither it nor the Cascadia subduction zone has caused\nan earthquake since the city's founding. The Cascadia subduction zone poses the threat\nof an earthquake of magnitude 9.0 or greater, capable of seriously damaging the city and\ncollapsing many buildings, especially in zones built on fill.According to the United States\nCensus Bureau, the city has a total area of 142.5 square miles (369 km2), 83.9 square\nmiles (217 km2) of which is land and 58.7 square miles (152 km2), water (41.16% of the\ntotal area). === Climate === Seattle has a warm-temperate climate, officially\nin the mediterranean zone by the main climatic classification (K\u00f6ppen: Csb) but other sources\ndue to winter temperatures consider a oceanic climate (Cfb), without meeting K\u00f6ppen-Geiger\ncriteria. It has cool, wet winters and mild, relatively dry summers, covering characteristics\nof both. The climate is sometimes characterized as a \"modified Mediterranean\" climate because\nit is cooler and wetter than a \"true\" Mediterranean climate, but shares the characteristic dry\nsummer (which has a strong influence on the region's vegetation). The city and environs\nare part of USDA hardiness zone 8b, with isolated coastal pockets falling under 9a.Temperature\nextremes are moderated by the adjacent Puget Sound, greater Pacific Ocean, and Lake Washington.\nThus extreme heat waves are rare in the Seattle area, as are very cold temperatures (below\nabout 15 \u00b0F (\u22129 \u00b0C)). The Seattle area is the most cloudy region of the United States,\ndue in part to frequent storms and lows moving in from the adjacent Pacific Ocean. Despite\nhaving a reputation for frequent rain, Seattle receives less precipitation than many other\nU.S. cities like Chicago or New York City. However, unlike many other U.S. cities, Seattle\nhas many more \"rain days\", when a very light drizzle falls from the sky for many days.\nIn an average year, at least 0.01 inches (0.25 mm) of precipitation falls on 150 days, more\nthan nearly all U.S. cities east of the Rocky Mountains. It is cloudy 201 days out of the\nyear and partly cloudy 93 days. Official weather and climatic data is collected at Seattle\u2013Tacoma\nInternational Airport, located about 19 km (12 mi) south of downtown in the city of SeaTac,\nwhich is at a higher elevation, and records more cloudy days and fewer partly cloudy days\nper year.Hot temperature extremes are enhanced by dry, compressed wind from the west slopes\nof the Cascades, while cold temperatures are generated mainly from the Fraser Valley in\nBritish Columbia.From 1981 to 2010, the average annual precipitation measured at Seattle\u2013Tacoma\nInternational Airport was 37.49 inches (952 mm). Annual precipitation has ranged from\n23.78 in (604 mm) in 1952 to 55.14 in (1,401 mm) in 1950; for water year (October 1 \u2013 September\n30) precipitation, the range is 23.16 in (588 mm) in 1976\u201377 to 51.82 in (1,316 mm) in\n1996\u201397. Due to local variations in microclimate, Seattle also receives significantly lower\nprecipitation than some other locations west of the Cascades. Around 80 mi (129 km) to\nthe west, the Hoh Rain Forest in Olympic National Park on the western flank of the Olympic Mountains\nreceives an annual average precipitation of 142 in (3.61 m). Sixty miles (95 km) to the\nsouth of Seattle, the state capital Olympia, which is out of the Olympic Mountains' rain\nshadow, receives an annual average precipitation of 50 in (1,270 mm). The city of Bremerton,\nabout 15 mi (24 km) west of downtown Seattle on the other side of the Puget Sound, receives\n56.4 in (1,430 mm) of precipitation annually.Conversely, the northeastern portion of the Olympic Peninsula,\nwhich lies east of the Olympic Mountains is located within the Olympic rain shadow and\nreceives significantly less precipitation than its surrounding areas. Prevailing airflow\nfrom the west is forced to cool and compress when colliding with the mountain range, resulting\nin high levels of precipitation within the mountains and its western slopes. Once the\nairflow reaches the leeward side of the mountains, it then lowers and expands resulting in warmer,\nand significantly dryer air. Sequim, Washington, nicknamed \"Sunny Sequim,\" is located approximately\n40 mi (64 km) northwest of downtown Seattle and receives just 16.51 inches (419 mm) of\nannual precipitation, more comparable to that of Los Angeles. Often an area devoid of cloud\ncover can be seen extending out over the Puget Sound to the north and east of Sequim. On\naverage Sequim observes 127 sunny days per year in addition to 127 days with partial\ncloud cover. Other areas influenced by the Olympic rain shadow include Port Angeles,\nPort Townsend, extending as far north as Victoria, British Columbia.In November, Seattle averages\nmore rainfall than any other U.S. city of more than 250,000 people; it also ranks highly\nin winter precipitation. Conversely, the city receives some of the lowest precipitation\namounts of any large city from June to September. Seattle is one of the five rainiest major\nU.S. cities as measured by the number of days with precipitation, and it receives some of\nthe lowest amounts of annual sunshine among major cities in the lower 48 states, along\nwith some cities in the Northeast, Ohio, and Michigan. Thunderstorms are rare, as the city\nreports thunder on just seven days per year. By comparison, Fort Myers, Florida, reports\nthunder on 93 days per year, Kansas City on 52, and New York City on 25.\nSeattle experiences its heaviest rainfall during November, December, and January, receiving\nroughly half of its annual rainfall (by volume) during this period. In late fall and early\nwinter, atmospheric rivers (also known as \"Pineapple Express\" systems), strong frontal\nsystems, and Pacific low-pressure systems are common. Light rain & drizzle are the predominant\nforms of precipitation during the remainder of the year; for instance, on average, less\nthan 1.6 in (41 mm) of rain falls in July and August combined when rain is less common.\nOn occasion, Seattle experiences somewhat more significant weather events. One such\nevent occurred on December 2\u20134, 2007, when sustained hurricane-force winds and widespread\nheavy rainfall associated with a strong Pineapple Express event occurred in the greater Puget\nSound area and the western parts of Washington and Oregon. Precipitation totals exceeded\n13.8 in (350 mm) in some areas with winds topping out at 209 km/h (130 mph) along coastal\nOregon. It became the second wettest event in Seattle history when a little over 130\nmm (5.1 in) of rain fell on Seattle in a 24-hour period. Lack of adaptation to the heavy rain\ncontributed to five deaths and widespread flooding and damage.Autumn, winter, and early\nspring are frequently characterized by rain. Winters are cool and wet with December, the\ncoolest month, averaging 40.6 \u00b0F (4.8 \u00b0C), with 28 annual days with lows that reach the\nfreezing mark, and 2.0 days where the temperature stays at or below freezing all day; the temperature\nrarely lowers to 20 \u00b0F (\u22127 \u00b0C). Summers are sunny, dry and warm, with August, the\nwarmest month, with high temperatures averaging 76.1 \u00b0F (24.5 \u00b0C), and reaching 90 \u00b0F (32\n\u00b0C) on 3.1 days per year. In 2015 the city recorded 13 days over 90 \u00b0F. The hottest\nofficially recorded temperature was 103 \u00b0F (39 \u00b0C) on July 29, 2009; the coldest recorded\ntemperature was 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) on January 31, 1950; the record cold daily maximum is\n16 \u00b0F (\u22129 \u00b0C) on January 14, 1950, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum\nis 71 \u00b0F (22 \u00b0C) the day the official record high was set. The average window for freezing\ntemperatures is November 16 through March 10, allowing a growing season of 250 days. Seattle typically receives some snowfall on\nan annual basis but heavy snow is rare. Average annual snowfall, as measured at Sea-Tac Airport,\nis 6.8 inches (17.3 cm). From winter season to winter season, amounts can be extremely\nvariable. A single calendar-day snowfall of six inches (15 cm) or greater has occurred\non only 17 days since 1948, and only three times since February 17, 1990; 6.8 in (17.3\ncm) of snow officially fell at Sea-Tac airport on January 18, 2012. This 2012 moderate snow\nevent was officially the 12th snowiest calendar day at the airport since 1948 and snowiest\nsince November 1985. Locations to the south of Seattle received more, with Olympia and\nChehalis receiving 14 to 18 in (36 to 46 cm). Much of the city of Seattle proper received\nsomewhat lesser snowfall accumulations. Another moderate snow event occurred from December\n12\u201325, 2008, when over one foot (30 cm) of snow fell and stuck on much of the roads\nover those two weeks, when temperatures remained below 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C), causing widespread difficulties\nin a city not equipped for clearing snow. In February 2019, Seattle experienced its\nsnowiest month in 50 years (since January 1969), with 20.2 inches of snow, all from\nFebruary 3\u201311, with 6.4 inches on Feb. 8 and 6.1 more inches on Feb. 11. The largest\ndocumented snowstorm occurred from January 5\u20139, 1880, with snow drifting to 6 feet\n(1.8 m) in places at the end of the snow event. From January 31 to February 2, 1916, another\nheavy snow event occurred with 29 in (74 cm) of snow on the ground by the time the event\nwas over. With official records dating to 1948, the largest single-day snowfall is 20.0\nin (51 cm) on January 13, 1950. Seasonal snowfall has ranged from zero in 1991\u201392 to 67.5\nin (171 cm) in 1968\u201369, with trace amounts having occurred as recently as 2009\u201310.\nThe month of January 1950 was particularly severe, bringing 57.2 in (145 cm) of snow,\nthe most of any month along with the aforementioned record cold.The Puget Sound Convergence Zone\nis an important feature of Seattle's weather. In the convergence zone, air arriving from\nthe north meets air flowing in from the south. Both streams of air originate over the Pacific\nOcean; airflow is split by the Olympic Mountains to Seattle's west, then reunited to the east.\nWhen the air currents meet, they are forced upward, resulting in convection. Thunderstorms\ncaused by this activity are usually weak and can occur north and south of town, but Seattle\nitself rarely receives more than occasional thunder and small hail showers. The Hanukkah\nEve Wind Storm in December 2006 is an exception that brought heavy rain and winds gusting\nup to 69 mph (111 km/h), an event that was not caused by the Puget Sound Convergence\nZone and was widespread across the Pacific Northwest.\nOne of many exceptions to Seattle's reputation as a damp location occurs in El Ni\u00f1o years,\nwhen marine weather systems track as far south as California and little precipitation falls\nin the Puget Sound area. Since the region's water comes from mountain snow packs during\nthe dry summer months, El Ni\u00f1o winters can not only produce substandard skiing but can\nresult in water rationing and a shortage of hydroelectric power the following summer. == Demographics ==\nAccording to the 2012-2016 American Community Survey (ACS), the racial makeup of the city\nwas 65.7% Caucasian, 14.1% Asian, 7.0% of African origin,\n6.6% Hispanic or Latino of any race, 0.4% Native American, 0.9% Pacific Islander, 0.2%\nother races, and 5.6% two or more races.

The 2010 census showed that Seattle was one\nof the whitest big cities in the country, although its proportion of white residents\nhas been gradually declining. In 1960, whites comprised 91.6% of the city's population,\nwhile in 2010 they comprised 69.5%. According to the 2006\u20132008 American Community Survey,\napproximately 78.9% of residents over the age of five spoke only English at home. Those\nwho spoke Asian languages other than Indo-European languages made up 10.2% of the population,\nSpanish was spoken by 4.5% of the population, speakers of other Indo-European languages\nmade up 3.9%, and speakers of other languages made up 2.5%.\nSeattle's foreign-born population grew 40% between the 1990 and 2000 censuses. The Chinese\npopulation in the Seattle area has origins in mainland China, Hong Kong, Southeast Asia,\nand Taiwan. The earliest Chinese-Americans that came in the late 19th and early 20th\ncenturies were almost entirely from Guangdong Province. The Seattle area is also home to\na large Vietnamese population of more than 55,000 residents, as well as over 30,000 Somali\nimmigrants. The Seattle-Tacoma area is also home to one of the largest Cambodian communities\nin the United States, numbering about 19,000 Cambodian Americans, and one of the largest\nSamoan communities in the mainland U.S., with over 15,000 people having Samoan ancestry.\nAdditionally, the Seattle area had the highest percentage of self-identified mixed-race people\nof any large metropolitan area in the United States, according to the 2000 United States\nCensus Bureau. According to a 2012 HistoryLink study, Seattle's 98118 ZIP code (in the Columbia\nCity neighborhood) was one of the most diverse ZIP Code Tabulation Areas in the United States.According\nto a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, the largest religious groupings are Christians\n(52%), followed by those of no religion (37%), Hindus (2%), Buddhists (2%), Jews (1%), Muslims\n(1%) and a variety of other religions have smaller followings.

Of people living in\npoverty, 13.8% are under the age of 18 and 10.2% are 65 or older.It is estimated that\nKing County has 8,000 homeless people on any given night, and many of those live in Seattle.\nIn September 2005, King County adopted a \"Ten-Year Plan to End Homelessness\", one of the near-term\nresults of which is a shift of funding from homeless shelter beds to permanent housing.In\nrecent years, the city has experienced steady population growth, and has been faced with\nthe issue of accommodating more residents. In 2006, after growing by 4,000 citizens per\nyear for the previous 16 years, regional planners expected the population of Seattle to grow\nby 200,000 people by 2040. However, former mayor Greg Nickels supported plans that would\nincrease the population by 60%, or 350,000 people, by 2040 and worked on ways to accommodate\nthis growth while keeping Seattle's single-family housing zoning laws. The Seattle City Council\nlater voted to relax height limits on buildings in the greater part of Downtown, partly with\nthe aim to increase residential density in the city center. As a sign of increasing inner-city\ngrowth, the downtown population crested to over 60,000 in 2009, up 77% since 1990.Seattle\nalso has large lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender populations. According to a 2006\nstudy by UCLA, 12.9% of city residents polled identified as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. This\nwas the second-highest proportion of any major U.S. city, behind San Francisco. Greater Seattle\nalso ranked second among major U.S. metropolitan areas, with 6.5% of the population identifying\nas gay, lesbian, or bisexual. According to 2012 estimates from the United States Census\nBureau, Seattle has the highest percentage of same-sex households in the United States,\nat 2.6 per cent, surpassing San Francisco.In addition, Seattle has a relatively high number\nof people living alone. According to the 2000 U.S. Census interim measurements of 2004,\nSeattle has the fifth highest proportion of single-person households nationwide among\ncities of 100,000 or more residents, at 40.8%. == Economy == Seattle's economy is driven by a mix of older\nindustrial companies, and \"new economy\" Internet and technology companies, service, design,\nand clean technology companies. The city's gross metropolitan product (GMP) was $231\nbillion in 2010, making it the 11th largest metropolitan economy in the United States.\nThe Port of Seattle, which also operates Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport, is a major gateway\nfor trade with Asia and cruises to Alaska. It also is the 8th largest port in the United\nStates when measured by container capacity. Its maritime cargo operations merged with\nthe Port of Tacoma in 2015 to form the Northwest Seaport Alliance. Although it was affected\nby the Great Recession, Seattle has retained a comparatively strong economy. It even remains\nas a hotbed for start-up businesses, especially in green building and clean technologies.\nIt was ranked as America's No. 1 \"smarter city\" based on its government policies and\ngreen economy. In February 2010, the city government committed Seattle to become North\nAmerica's first \"climate neutral\" city, with a goal of reaching zero net per capita greenhouse\ngas emissions by 2030. Large companies continue to dominate the business\nlandscape. Five companies on Fortune 500's 2017 list of the United States' largest companies\n(based on total revenue) are headquartered in Seattle: Internet retailer Amazon.com (#12),\ncoffee chain Starbucks (#131), department store Nordstrom (#188), freight forwarder\nExpeditors International of Washington (#429) and forest products company Weyerhaeuser (#341).\nOther Fortune 500 companies commonly associated with Seattle are based in nearby Puget Sound\ncities. Warehouse club chain Costco (#16), the largest retail company in Washington,\nis based in Issaquah. Microsoft (#28) is located in Redmond. Furthermore, Bellevue is home\nto truck manufacturer Paccar (#164). Other major companies headquartered in the area\ninclude Nintendo of America in Redmond, T-Mobile US in Bellevue, Expedia Inc. in Bellevue,\nand Providence Health & Services (the state's largest health care system and fifth largest\nemployer) in Renton.

There\nare also many successful independent artisanal espresso roasters and caf\u00e9s.Before moving\nits headquarters to Chicago, aerospace manufacturer Boeing (#24) was the largest company based\nin Seattle. Its largest division, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, is still headquartered in nearby\nRenton. The company also has large aircraft manufacturing plants in Everett and Renton;\nit remains the largest private employer in the Seattle metropolitan area. In 2006 former\nSeattle Mayor Greg Nickels announced a desire to spark a new economic boom driven by the\nbiotechnology industry. Major redevelopment of the South Lake Union neighborhood is underway\nin an effort to attract new and established biotech companies to the city, joining biotech\ncompanies Corixa (acquired by GlaxoSmithKline), Immunex (now part of Amgen), Trubion, and\nZymoGenetics. Vulcan Inc., the holding company of billionaire Paul Allen, is behind most\nof the development projects in the region. While some see the new development as an economic\nboon, others have criticized Nickels and the Seattle City Council for pandering to Allen's\ninterests at taxpayers' expense. Also in 2006, Expansion Magazine ranked Seattle as one of\nthe top 10 metropolitan areas in the nation based on climates favorable to business expansion.\nIn 2005, Forbes ranked Seattle as the most expensive American city for buying a house\nbased on the local income levels.

Seattle's official nickname\nis the \"Emerald City\", the result of a contest held in 1981; the reference is to the lush\nevergreen forests of the area. Seattle is also referred to informally as the \"Gateway\nto Alaska\" for being the nearest major city in the contiguous U.S. to Alaska, \"Rain City\"\nfor its frequent cloudy and rainy weather, and \"Jet City\" from the local influence of\nBoeing. The city has two official slogans or mottos: \"The City of Flowers\", meant to\nencourage the planting of flowers to beautify the city, and \"The City of Goodwill\", adopted\nprior to the 1990 Goodwill Games.

The Mariners have never reached a World\nSeries and only appeared in the MLB playoffs four times, all between 1995 and 2001, despite\nhaving Hall of Fame players and candidates like Ken Griffey Jr., Randy Johnson, Ichiro,\nand Alex Rodriguez. The team tied the all-time single regular season wins record in 2001\nwith 116 wins. Since 2001, the Mariners have failed to qualify for the playoffs\u2014the longest\nactive postseason drought in North American sports, at 17 seasons. From 1967 to 2008 Seattle was also home to\na National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise: the Seattle SuperSonics, who were the 1978\u201379\nNBA champions.

Seattle successfully\napplied for a new expansion team with the National Hockey League, which will make its\nfirst appearance in 2021. Seattle plans to renovate KeyArena to use for the possible\nNHL team. On March 1, 2018, a ticket drive began to gauge interests in season ticket\ndeposits. Oak View reported that their initial goal of 10,000 deposits was surpassed in 12\nminutes, and that they received 25,000 deposits in 75 minutes. == Parks and recreation == Seattle's mild, temperate, marine climate\nallows year-round outdoor recreation, including walking, cycling, hiking, skiing, snowboarding,\nkayaking, rock climbing, motor boating, sailing, team sports, and swimming.In town, many people\nwalk around Green Lake, through the forests and along the bluffs and beaches of 535-acre\n(2.2 km2) Discovery Park (the largest park in the city) in Magnolia, along the shores\nof Myrtle Edwards Park on the Downtown waterfront, along the shoreline of Lake Washington at\nSeward Park, along Alki Beach in West Seattle, or along the Burke-Gilman Trail.

ParkScore ranks city\npark systems by a formula that analyzes acreage, access, and service and investment. == Government and politics == Seattle is a charter city, with a mayor\u2013council\nform of government. From 1911 to 2013, Seattle's nine city councillors were elected at large,\nrather than by geographic subdivisions. For the 2015 election, this changed to a hybrid\nsystem of seven district members and two at-large members as a result of a ballot measure passed\non November 5, 2013. The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal\nCourt judges. All city offices are officially non-partisan.Like some other parts of the\nUnited States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing\ncitizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation\nalready passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new\nlaws or tax increases directly to the people). Jenny Durkan was elected as mayor in the 2017\nmayoral election and took office on November 28, 2017. The mayor's office also includes\ntwo deputy mayors, appointed to advise the mayor on policies; As of 2017, the city's\ndeputy mayors are Michael Fong and Shefali Ranganathan.Seattle's political culture is\nvery liberal and progressive for the United States, with over 80% of the population voting\nfor the Democratic Party. All precincts in Seattle voted for Democratic Party candidate\nBarack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In partisan elections for the Washington State\nLegislature and United States Congress, nearly all elections are won by Democrats. Although\nlocal elections are nonpartisan, most of the city's elected officials are known to be Democrats.\nIn 1926, Seattle became the first major American city to elect a female mayor, Bertha Knight\nLandes. It has also elected an openly gay mayor, Ed Murray, and a third-party socialist\ncouncillor, Kshama Sawant. For the first time in United States history, an openly gay black\nwoman was elected to public office when Sherry Harris was elected as a Seattle city councillor\nin 1991. The majority of the city council is female.Federally, Seattle is split between\ntwo congressional districts. Most of the city is in Washington's 7th congressional district,\nrepresented by Democrat Pramila Jayapal, the first Indian-American woman elected to Congress.\nShe succeeded 28-year incumbent and fellow Democrat Jim McDermott. Part of southwestern\nSeattle is in the 9th District, represented by Democrat Adam Smith.\nSeattle is widely considered one of the most socially liberal cities in the United States,\neven surpassing Portland. In the 2012 U.S. general election, a majority of Seattleites\nvoted to approve Referendum 74 and legalize gay marriage in Washington state. In the same\nelection, an overwhelming majority of Seattleites also voted to approve the legalization of\nthe recreational use of cannabis in the state. Like much of the Pacific Northwest (which\nhas the lowest rate of church attendance in the United States and consistently reports\nthe highest percentage of atheism), church attendance, religious belief, and political\ninfluence of religious leaders are much lower than in other parts of America.Seattle also\nhas a thriving alternative press, with the Web-based daily Seattle Post-Intelligencer,\nseveral other online dailies (including Publicola and Crosscut), The Stranger (an alternative,\nleft-leaning weekly), Seattle Weekly, and a number of issue-focused publications, including\nthe nation's two largest online environmental magazines, Worldchanging and Grist.org.\nIn July 2012, Seattle banned plastic shopping bags. In June 2014 the city passed a local\nordinance to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour on a staged basis from 2015 to\n2021.

Murray resigned as mayor on September 12, 2017, effective at 5 p.m. on September\n13, 2017, hours after The Seattle Times reported a fifth allegation of child sexual abuse.In\nJuly 2017, the Seattle City Council unanimously approved an income tax on Seattle residents,\nmaking the city the only one in the state with an income tax. The new income tax was\nruled unconstitutional in a ruling by King County Superior Court and thus was not allowed\nto proceed. The city is expected to appeal this ruling. == Education == Of the city's population over the age of 25,\n53.8% (vs. a national average of 27.4%) hold a bachelor's degree or higher, and 91.9% (vs.\n84.5% nationally) have a high school diploma or equivalent. A 2008 United States Census\nBureau survey showed that Seattle had the highest percentage of college and university\ngraduates of any major U.S. city. The city was listed as the most literate of the country's\n69 largest cities in 2005 and 2006, the second most literate in 2007 and the most literate\nin 2008 in studies conducted by Central Connecticut State University. Seattle Public Schools desegregated without\na court order but continue to struggle to achieve racial balance in a somewhat ethnically\ndivided city (the south part of town having more ethnic minorities than the north). In\n2007, Seattle's racial tie-breaking system was struck down by the United States Supreme\nCourt, but the ruling left the door open for desegregation formulae based on other indicators\n(e.g., income or socioeconomic class).The public school system is supplemented by a\nmoderate number of private schools: Five of the private high schools are Catholic, one\nis Lutheran, and six are secular.Seattle is home to the University of Washington, as well\nas the institution's professional and continuing education unit, the University of Washington\nEducational Outreach. The 2017 U.S. News & World Report ranked the University of Washington\nat #11 in the world, tied with Johns Hopkins University. The UW receives more federal research\nand development funding than any public institution. Over the last 10 years, it has also produced\nmore Peace Corps volunteers than any other U.S. university. Seattle also has a number\nof smaller private universities including Seattle University and Seattle Pacific University,\nthe former a Jesuit Catholic institution, the latter Free Methodist; universities aimed\nat the working adult, like City University and Antioch University; colleges within the\nSeattle Colleges District system, comprising North, Central, and South; seminaries, including\nWestern Seminary and a number of arts colleges, such as Cornish College of the Arts, Pratt\nFine Arts Center, and The Art Institute of Seattle. In 2001, Time magazine selected Seattle\nCentral Community College as community college of the year, stating the school \"pushes diverse\nstudents to work together in small teams\". == Media == As of 2019, Seattle has one major daily newspaper,\nThe Seattle Times. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, known as the P-I, published a daily newspaper\nfrom 1863 to March 17, 2009, before switching to a strictly on-line publication. There is\nalso the Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce, and the University of Washington publishes\nThe Daily, a student-run publication, when school is in session.

Real Change is a weekly street newspaper\nthat is sold mainly by homeless persons as an alternative to panhandling. There are also\nseveral ethnic newspapers, including The Facts, Northwest Asian Weekly and the International\nExaminer, and numerous neighborhood newspapers. Seattle is also well served by television\nand radio, with all major U.S. networks represented, along with at least five other English-language\nstations and two Spanish-language stations. Seattle cable viewers also receive CBUT 2\n(CBC) from Vancouver, British Columbia. Non-commercial radio stations include NPR\naffiliates KUOW-FM 94.9 and KNKX 88.5 (Tacoma), as well as classical music station KING-FM\n98.1.

The two largest are The Seattle\nTimes and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. == Infrastructure == === \nHealth systems === The University of Washington is consistently\nranked among the country's top leading institutions in medical research, earning special merits\nfor programs in neurology and neurosurgery. Seattle has seen local developments of modern\nparamedic services with the establishment of Medic One in 1970. In 1974, a 60 Minutes\nstory on the success of the then four-year-old Medic One paramedic system called Seattle\n\"the best place in the world to have a heart attack\".Three of Seattle's largest medical\ncenters are located on First Hill. Harborview Medical Center, the public county hospital,\nis the only Level I trauma hospital in a region that includes Washington, Alaska, Montana,\nand Idaho. Virginia Mason Medical Center and Swedish Medical Center's two largest campuses\nare also located in this part of Seattle, including the Virginia Mason Hospital. This\nconcentration of hospitals resulted in the neighborhood's nickname \"Pill Hill\".Located\nin the Laurelhurst neighborhood, Seattle Children's, formerly Children's Hospital and Regional\nMedical Center, is the pediatric referral center for Washington, Alaska, Montana, and\nIdaho. The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has a campus in the Eastlake neighborhood.\nThe University District is home to the University of Washington Medical Center which, along\nwith Harborview, is operated by the University of Washington. Seattle is also served by a\nVeterans Affairs hospital on Beacon Hill, a third campus of Swedish in Ballard, and\nNorthwest Hospital and Medical Center near Northgate Mall. === Transportation === The first streetcars appeared in 1889 and\nwere instrumental in the creation of a relatively well-defined downtown and strong neighborhoods\nat the end of their lines. The advent of the automobile sounded the death knell for rail\nin Seattle. Tacoma\u2013Seattle railway service ended in 1929 and the Everett\u2013Seattle service\ncame to an end in 1939, replaced by automobiles running on the recently developed highway\nsystem. Rails on city streets were paved over or removed, and the opening of the Seattle\ntrolleybus system brought the end of streetcars in Seattle in 1941. This left an extensive\nnetwork of privately owned buses (later public) as the only mass transit within the city and\nthroughout the region. King County Metro provides frequent stop bus\nservice within the city and surrounding county, as well as the South Lake Union Streetcar\nline and the First Hill Streetcar line. Seattle is one of the few cities in North America\nwhose bus fleet includes electric trolleybuses. Sound Transit provides an express bus service\nwithin the metropolitan area, two Sounder commuter rail lines between the suburbs and\ndowntown, and its Central Link light rail line between the University of Washington\nand Angle Lake. Washington State Ferries, which manages the largest network of ferries\nin the United States and third largest in the world, connects Seattle to Bainbridge\nand Vashon Islands in Puget Sound and to Bremerton and Southworth on the Kitsap Peninsula. According to the 2007 American Community Survey,\n18.6% of Seattle residents used one of the three public transit systems that serve the\ncity, giving it the highest transit ridership of all major cities without heavy or light\nrail prior to the completion of Sound Transit's Central Link line. The city has also been\ndescribed by Bert Sperling as the fourth most walkable U.S. city and by Walk Score as the\nsixth most walkable of the fifty largest U.S. cities.Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport,\nlocally known as Sea-Tac Airport and located just south in the neighboring city of SeaTac,\nis operated by the Port of Seattle and provides commercial air service to destinations throughout\nthe world. Closer to downtown, Boeing Field is used for general aviation, cargo flights,\nand testing/delivery of Boeing airliners. A secondary passenger airport, Paine Field,\nopened in 2019 and is located in Everett, 25 miles (40 km) north of Seattle. It is predominantly\nused for Boeing, which has a large assembly plant nearby. The main mode of transportation, however,\nrelies on Seattle's streets, which are laid out in a cardinal directions grid pattern,\nexcept in the central business district where early city leaders Arthur Denny and Carson\nBoren insisted on orienting their plats relative to the shoreline rather than to true North.\nOnly two roads, Interstate 5 and State Route 99 (both limited-access highways), run uninterrupted\nthrough the city from north to south. State Route 99 runs through downtown Seattle on\nthe Alaskan Way Viaduct, which was built in 1953. However, due to damage sustained during\nthe 2001 Nisqually earthquake the viaduct will be replaced by a tunnel. The 2-mile (3.2\nkm) Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel was originally scheduled to be completed in\nDecember 2015 at a cost of US$4.25 billion. Unfortunately, due to issues with the worlds\nlargest tunnel boring machine (TBM), which is nicknamed \"Bertha\" and is 57 feet (17 m)\nin diameter, the projected date of completion has been pushed back to fall 2018 (with tolling\nset to begin in 2019). Seattle has the 8th worst traffic congestion of all American cities,\nand is 10th among all North American cities.The city has started moving away from the automobile\nand towards mass transit. From 2004 to 2009, the annual number of unlinked public transportation\ntrips increased by approximately 21%. In 2006, voters in King County passed proposition 2\n(Transit Now) which increased bus service hours on high ridership routes and paid for\nfive limited-stop bus lines called RapidRide. After rejecting a roads and transit measure\nin 2007, Seattle-area voters passed a transit only measure in 2008 to increase ST Express\nbus service, extend the Link light rail system, and expand and improve Sounder commuter rail\nservice. A light rail line from downtown heading south to Sea-Tac Airport began service on\nDecember 19, 2009, giving the city its first rapid transit line with intermediate stations\nwithin the city limits. An extension north to the University of Washington opened on\nMarch 19, 2016; and further extensions are planned to reach Northgate and Lynnwood to\nthe north, Federal Way to the south, and Bellevue and Redmond to the east by 2024. Voters in\nthe Puget Sound region approved an additional tax increase in November 2016 to expand light\nrail to West Seattle and Ballard as well as Tacoma, Everett, and Issaquah. === Utilities === Water and electric power are municipal services,\nprovided by Seattle Public Utilities and Seattle City Light respectively. Other utility companies\nserving Seattle include Puget Sound Energy (natural gas, electricity); Seattle Steam\nCompany (steam); Waste Management, Inc and Recology CleanScapes. (curbside recycling,\ncomposting, and solid waste removal); CenturyLink, Frontier Communications, Wave Broadband, and\nComcast (telecommunications and television). About 90% of Seattle's electricity is produced\nusing hydropower. Less than 2% of electricity is produced using fossil fuels. == Notable people == == \nSister cities == Seattle is partnered with: == See also == List of neighborhoods in Seattle\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Seattle, Washington\nSeattle Freeze Seattle process\nSeattle tugboats Tillicum Village"}
