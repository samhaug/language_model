{"0g1Gn7OQk20": "[Music] okay guys we are doing the flourish gummies in the cub watermelon 100 milligrams of THC already how one of these had to he's kind of funny they're not delicious in my hair supposed to be in a bun but it's not delicious and good like the Caminos I kind of real strong marijuana taste to it really strong they don't taste like delicious but we're gonna seem to get a sign sir we're going to see if it gets as high so I'll be back about an hour to let me show you guys real quick the ingredients my father seen hold on guys you kidding me let me do this right you guys good morning this morning here like that and just won't come back too long ago we talked about those flourish gummies okay first of all I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys I took them and as they went on I literally forgot that I even consumed the gummies that's out but I forgot that I consumed the gummies and during the whole day I didn't really obviously I didn't feel anything really because I forgot that I even took um basically I didn't feel really much of anything maybe it's because of what I ate maybe because my maybe I should have a after maybe I know I ate after a wild learned later on that day but my shirt but time on how long I waited to eat but I think probably I ate too soon and I didn't make the hi I'm gonna make me hi didn't I bring the high up all the way but um I don't know I like some down on me because maybe I ate or I don't know my tolerance is too high I'm not trying to say that these gummies will not work for anyone else they just didn't work for me my tolerance is really high from marijuana you know so I mean like the next person they probably will work for you but with these do not work for me didn't taste that great they weren't delicious you're trying to get us give us someone that doesn't want but just basically if he gives us someone they know they're consuming marijuana because it tastes like it like there's no there's no hiding the fact that it's not and that's I hope this video could help so it out peace out toodles and happy trust all my happy trailers and just another thing to just because it didn't work for me does not mean I have to say this again it doesn't this because I didn't work for me does not mean that it will not work for you okay think about your tolerance I haven't stigma to this I hate staring into the actual like lens because my eyes getting it cricket but this is because I didn't work for me does not mean no will not work for you I hope this would help someone out peace out toodles and Happy Trails don't have patrols out there", "UqzhgZjdpAo": "what's up everybody my name is Sara Vee and welcome back to the haze today I'm gonna be doing another review I'm gonna be viewing the BAM Camino by the very famous brand Kiva confection now you probably recognize the name Kiba because of their chocolate products that you see at most stores they're very well known for them they're very very delicious but today I'm gonna be talking about their gummies now this is the Bliss they do other flavors but I'm gonna be talking specifically about the Bliss which is their hybrid gummy let's talk a little bit about this awesome container it comes in a tin container which I really love it keeps the flavor really nice and fresh it is all summer themed and in the front they'll tell you how much milligrams which is a hundred for the entire one in every little gummy is five milligrams in the back it will also give you you know all the nutrition facts that you're counting your calories if you're trying to get high on a diet that will be there for you to open it it's just a quick little push down and turn voila and you'll find your gummies on the inside too it does give you a little bit more information on why they're called Caminos which I really love when an edible company kind of gives you that it kind of sets the scene it gets you in the mood for getting high every little gummy looks like this look at that little gummy how cute it is and it is five milligrams now the taste is delicious they're very tasty they're nice and sweet they're not crazy crazy good but they kind of remind you of movie theater candy like chewy sweet and something you just want to shove in your mouth all day for the high because these come with 20 of five milligrams your will needle II eat a lot of candy to really get super blown if you're willing to go down that road more power to you're willing to down twenty of these but I would say this edible is best use and best for people who are trying to micro dose specifically for the fact that every one of those little gummies is five milligrams if you're kind of a lightweight or you're doing something that you don't need to be high doesn't it take a little bit of the edge off even one or two of these or eating just one or even half of one if you're looking for a 2.5 is really great and it makes micro dosing so much easier with these guys yeah I can't say enough about how how nice these are for micro dosing and how great these are for also traveling if you're someone who gets nervous going on an airplane or something like that these are great because you won't get to blown where you'll get like super paranoid but you'll get high enough to take a little bit of that edge off which is really great if you're looking for something and that's gonna get you super high if you're looking at like go to a party and you don't drink it but you want to be stoned as hell these I'd I wouldn't it wouldn't be my first choice maybe if you have a slower tolerance or you're just getting into edibles this is for you especially if this is gonna be your first edible a try splitting one of these small gummies is so easy and they have like had like a fake little line between them that can kind of give you a little idea where to split it right in the middle these are awesome if you are working from home like a lot of us are these are great for that too because you won't get high you won't feel stupid you can get your job done but it also helps with a little bit of shaving off a little bit of that anxiety which is great yeah if you guys see these which see them a lot I've seen the prices range I've seen them from twenty dollars all the way up to thirty dollars so I guess it just depends on what dispenser you pick them up from these were pretty average for me nothing crazy that's before tap that's after tax and everything so if you guys see them out of dispensary if you got some extra dollars in your pocket I would say pick up the Camino by the Kiva you won't be disappointed you'll get high you might not get superstone but you'll get there so alright guys well that's my review for the day my name is Sarah P again thank you so much for watching in the haze and I'll catch you next time [Music]", "vAd2MnnDEn4": "hey guys welcome back to our channel if you're new here I am Judith and today's video I am going to be eating a hundred milligram edible for you guys I did get this on 4/20 and I am barely going to eat it with you guys just because I don't know it's been in the fridge it's been getting cold and I thought why not do it today today is my day off so your grocery and yeah so I'm gonna consume this a hundred milligram edible for you guys and see what it does to me I am a huge smoker so I don't know if it would hit me as much but honestly it probably will because edibles hit different than smoking like honestly honestly if you eat edibles they will hit like major but yeah so I'm gonna eat this for you guys hopefully I don't feel like I'm dying and then from there who knows this video will probably be a short vlog and yeah I'm just gonna go about my day on an edible and see the effects of what happens so let me set the camera for you guys and then open this oh so I am in my little sister's room I am at my mom's house and yeah there's nowhere else I'd rather take a hundred milligram edible than my mom's because if I freaked out which I probably won't but if I freaked out my sisters are here and my mom is here and everybody is here so if your girl feels like she's dying everybody is here hominy yeah yeah so let me set this camera up for you guys and then let's do it okay you guys I'm so mad at myself because I literally broke the freaking edible and I didn't want to do that I wanted to show you guys exactly what it looked like and your girl is just not paying attention if you guys have ever tried these let me know in the comments down below and what you guys thought about them so I've tried these before they were good and let's do this again so here we go I'm gonna break this seal for you guys know it's childproof it's childproof you guys it doesn't even have a little cut for you to follow do you have scissors money so you legit might need a knife or some scissors to open the packaging which is always good that's like an a-plus because if you have kids or you have little adults around you don't want them to easily access these things because yeah Oh Jax is sad he's crying outside right now but I don't want him inside because he's just gonna he's just gonna bark and do odd things possible but he's sad because jenna so just dipped or she went somewhere I'm not sure but okay so I went ahead and cut it open I'm sorry my nails are a little rough right now one is really bitten your girl has been super anxious and nervous and if you know me you just have a lot of anxiety sometimes and believe it or not I get and I get anxiety attacks and it's just a struggle you guys so if you guys know what they feel like or you guys are also going through the same thing I hope that you guys are doing everything possible to just stay calm and everything is gonna be fine you guys I always try to remind myself that but anyways it smells so good these are dark mint chocolate bars and they legit smell like dark mint chocolate they really do you guys let me push them it to the front they literally broke it in there I am so upset with myself but they still looks so good okay let's do it I'm gonna eat the whole bar you guys so let's do this they are look look at how they're packaging for their chocolate is like go ahead and hold that for you guys look at that it literally tells you the milligram of each little bar that is crazy I don't even remember eating the other one and I don't remember being this excited about having the milligrams on the bar I don't know I guess yes yes if you guys how do you say it um if you guys are dosing or how would you say I money you just oh yeah mone is smart she okay so if you are micro dosing and you are a big believer or a big person who does micro seeing these are exactly what you need but let's do this image it tastes like dark chocolate man mm sorry 20 milligrams yeah 820 milligrams right there let's go ahead and eat oh my god I'm such an idiot you guys and you guys are not telling me so apparently it doesn't give you the milligrams on here I just assumed that they did but no it doesn't it actually says THC on the bar d\u00f6 oh my god I'm either dumb or I'm blind you guys I'm so dumb but it does say THC on them on the packaging and lets you know that each bar is 10 milligrams so I just assumed that that's what it was on that's what was written on the bar but you know what it's still cool it still lets you know how many milligrams each little bar is and honestly dude the reason why I like these is because ok 30 more milligrams and then it's 50 milligrams total and you can't argue with that [Applause] and I got this one this one didn't break yeah so this one didn't break you guys and 15 milligrams for this little bit is yes yes I love edibles that are tiny but they pack so much like a little brownie that's 100 milligrams like thighs the best because you don't have to eat as much like it legit gets to the point it's not like you have to eat 50 cupcakes to get 100 milligrams like no I love that they high dose these things so that you can eat less of it but get more of a punch like those are my favorite edibles look 20 more milligrams what is that now 70 milligrams oh my god I'm freaking myself out honey you're gonna be here with me okay my sister said if I feel like I'm dying she's gonna be here with me you're gonna remind me that I'm not dying she was gonna remind me I'm not dying guys honestly I can always have I can always be having a bad day but once I get on camera for you guys and I talk to you guys I just make a difference I do feel better I do feel the best I could be sometimes but yeah like I really like being here with you guys you guys motivate me of course I do want to do big things when I'm older I hope you guys stay to see what the [ __ ] that J and J twins are gonna do in the future my sister has a boyfriend and they're hella cute you guys so shout out to all the couples out there especially my sister's relationship because he is so nice you guys like so next so nice oh hi there any more milligrams and that's gonna be a total of 100 milligrams you guys so recently hmm yeah I would buy these again mm-hmm yes mm-hmm so recently I took half a tab with Hubert he took the pool tab you guys I don't know I don't know people could do the most and still survive but me knowing I'm gonna take a full time I know that it's gonna be full-blown everything like everything I'm gonna see God I'm gonna see [ __ ] mythological things everything so I took half a tab right you guys I swear I couldn't stop laughing like I was trying I was trying so hard to keep it together because like I wouldn't look at Hubert and I was just like in my mind it was so funny like to even look at him was so funny like I didn't know I didn't know why looking at him was so funny and while I was doing that I was applying to new things so that I can get my life together and go find better things so I was on my laptop like the laptop looked cool whatever but then I started to realize oh my god oh my god it's hitting like my half tab is hitting and that's why I only take half a tab Jax our guard dog our long-haired dachshund or jealous long-haired dachshund even after the tab was over and we woke up the next morning I even asked him I was I asked him how his tab fell and if he felt it and he said smack - smack but yeah I am my my half tops max I didn't think it was going through because I've never had great oh my god looks so young with short hair so I never like I never really have good experiences with papertabs usually jalisa gets us gel tabs and those are the ones that really really like always boom like and these paper tabs one time we took them and they just it didn't work out so yeah lesson learned gels are my favorite my point is don't be afraid to microdose don't ever feel like you have to eat the whole edible or take the whole tab like no I even take quarter tabs and I feel good I feel like I could take a quarter tab and go throughout my day or take a quarter tab and drink and have a good time so everything is possible you guys don't hurt yourselves but I will come back check up with you guys and see when this hits so I'll make sure to time this for you guys let me check and you're gonna wash my hands because I do not want to lick my fingers so it is currently 138 I will come back whenever these shit's hit which will be in like 30 minutes hopefully or maybe an hour who knows no one ever knows um yeah and I'll check up with you guys and see you later my dude shoutout to jealous because she is hooking it up with some boiling crab but yes but yes okay so it's been like 45 minutes okay you guys so it's 229 now and oh my gosh that's so weird why is it doing that anyways so it's 2:30 you guys and I am pretty faded I don't know what that means that's so weird oh it's doing it's like something the camera can see but not us okay guys so the edibles definitely hit you guys I was watching a really good movie right now called private life it's called private life and I was crying you guys I can't stop oh my gosh this edible is definitely hitting I was watching this movie called private life and if you haven't watched it you guys need to watch this movie like the movie is so it's real and I like that so yeah the edibles this is like 45 minutes after or 15 minutes after so like about an hour it took me to really get the feeling like I am super faded right now you guys like I'm just like deeply in movies right now if you guys want something that's gonna hit you guys should definitely get some wounds and if you like the mint flavor with chocolate this is definitely that so yeah thanks for watching and I will see you guys in the next video", "Qqm0eS5nKmw": "okay so in my current attempt to worry less and experiment more I'm coming out of a sixteen and a half hour fast into this is a candy bar with a hundred milligrams of THC see how it is okay so when you finally wrestle with the childproof packaging which is also micro proof you get this it's a pretty little gold bar it's pretty being that this is the first carbs I've had in a few days it's actually really good you actually don't get a hint about cannabis flavor and who raped you oh no how far hundred milligrams are gonna take me cuz I believe I have a pretty high dollar okay so it has been one hour since I had my candy bar and while I wouldn't say that I feel high I I feel good there's definitely an edge gone a little bit of a body low I'm very uh positive okay now it has been to two hours since I ate my candy bar and now yeah I'm high I'm very tingly and they calm my body weighs a lot it turns out that 100 milligrams just write him out for me okay it has now been three hours since I ate my candy bar now I'm feeling just absolutely fantastic you'll notice the we're on the road because we've had to go buy 20 cheeseburgers I love you okay so 100 milligram bar we're probably five six hours now when I lost count awesome I really think I could even help my dosage coolest thing about all this is just the availability of something like this it was $25 at the dispensary the fact that something like that exists at the dispensary that you can go to the store and buy weed is just a mind-boggling world I'm glad we live in it until next time", "GshuNm0rvkM": "what's up i'm with my buddy connor here and he is going to

] up i'm hoping i'm like paralyzed that's what i'm hoping for so yeah [Music] those taste like real gummy worms though that [ __ ] well no they are real gummies yeah but normally like if you infuse like a cookie with thc and you can still see guy should be [ __ ] up it will be worth it though dude perhaps you're doing that i mean it's not like it's not like you know i mean you don't have to work tomorrow right he's underplaying it dude yeah i'm unemployed baby you're good you're good 25 minutes how do you feel better cousins not bad not bad i don't think it's i feel like it's not hitting yet all right we'll check back in it's a placebo effect right now i his eyes are getting kind of red man i'm baked let's make that right here let's go to the light a bit so these uh people can see how red the eyes are um so guys um i shouldn't say guys i don't like that hey you look at those eyes right there that's what those edibles do after one hour that's 500 milligrams of delta 8 thc um edibles man they're frying me already hell yeah it's been what are you expecting in the next 30 minutes sleeping probably so we'll see if we get any more of this are they sativa indica or what just distilling distillate oh so [ __ ] blacks is that what that is i guess you could call it delta 8 wax i mean wax is desolate um i guess but there's different methods of extracting it like co2 and bho and i guess the consistency determines what you call it but it's just distal it's just super thick and sticky and uh basically the gummies just regular gummies and they actually spray it with the actual thc oil oh wow so you're when you eat the gummies you're literally eating the straight oil on the actual gum that's insane i don't think i heard like a word you said because i'm just [ __ ] just going in and out of my eyes oh okay [Laughter] you feel [ __ ] up oh [ __ ] i can't feel my lips oh no like stuck to my teeth so wait you what do they feel like they feel like nothing yeah basically wow incredible dry can i get some water hey can someone get this man water all right they're saying no man they don't want you to drink it all right homies aren't looking out for you huh oh we gotta do that landscape that's good well let's get oh flip the camera hold on tell me when to alright so go like this and then do it you know like just take the camera okay one two three go dude you gotta flip it man okay okay okay one two three go okay we flip okay so connor just the results are just bad he just he got so [ __ ] up and uh it just didn't feel right filming him he puked so we were gonna do like a one-hour check-in and two-hour check-in three-hour check-in we only got to the first check-in and uh after that he's just like i'm [ __ ] up so yeah uh moral of the story don't eat the whole bag only eat one or two if you want try the edibles yourself and just only take one or two you hit the link down below and try it out for yourself and if you get too high you can smoke some cbd and calm yourself down you can get an eighth for free by the way so uh yeah i hope you enjoyed the video hit that like hit the like", "saNb3mEjFG8": "[Music] the morning i just opened these up their bike

"so what does 500 milligrams of THC feel like well I can tell you that it doesn't feel good it kind of feels like this okay so it's a little over two weeks ago that I was given ten drops of cannabis oil and the dosage was played down to me and I wasn't sure exactly how many milligrams I was taking it was said that it was diluted and very weak and I was given ten drops and I have never ever taken anything cannabis related in my life so obviously it's gonna hit me harder I wasn't planning to take it I thought the worst that can happen is I'm gonna be extremely relaxed and calm and I haven't really done a lot of research into THC and cannabis oil and the effects on what it does to you so I took the ten drops under my tongue kept it there had a bit of a bitter taste didn't taste much else and then afterwards found out that there was 500 milligrams of THC in those 10 drops so I didn't know if 500 milligrams was a lot or not because I've never really put much research into the actual effects and what the dose is is law when I read online that 500 is extremely high and I was seeing a lot of people there are regular cannabis oil users or THC users I saw how it affected them I thought to myself well I'm either gonna feel weird and go through like a sleepy zombie State or I'm just gonna feel okay so an hour went by I felt okay and I decided to leave the house because I actually forgot that I taken it I carried on swimming and we were doing a whole bunch of things as I was leaving my skin was so hot like it suddenly felt like in that split second I was fine doesn't feel anything in the next second it just hit me and my skin felt so hot like there was a con air blowing on me and it honestly felt like heat a so I went up to it and I faltered and when I put my hand closed it felt like cold air but as I stood back that that air blowing on my skin for that I was on fire I literally felt like I couldn't handle the heat the next thing that happened is just almost like the wall closing in and like tunnel vision and it was just black everywhere except right in front of my eyes and it felt like like like falling or furutaka like you at the top and as you drop it's like that whoop kind of feeling like everything closing in your stomach jumping and I was horrible I felt like whoa something's not right and then I remembered I took ten drops of cannabis oil and I thought to myself okay maybe it's bringing on some anxiety because I've suffered with anxiety attacks and I managed to calm myself down over the years and control it it just got worse and worse and worse my heart rate shot up so high that it I could feel it jumping on my chest now thought okay it's definitely anxiety but my heart the way my heart was going and felt completely different to anxiety so on my very very bad anxiety attacks where I've got rushed to the ER I had a heart rate of 140 beats a minute now if you think about it to put it in perspective your resting heart rate is about 60 beats a minute it can range between 60 to 100 but usually your resting heart rate is about 67 so 140 is for me if I'm boxing or if I am on a treadmill and I'm running or on the elliptical machine or skipping doing those intense things your heart rate is about at 140 so now I imagine being at a resting heart rate and suddenly shoot up to 140 where it feels like you're running on a treadmill and you're out of breath like you you're running that fast but you're not so your breathing doesn't match your heart rate your brain doesn't match your body's activity and everything's just out of synch so that's classic anxiety symptoms I thought to myself I just gotta calm down so much my heart rate shot up to a hundred and seventy two beats a minute now that's the highest I've ever seen it even when I've exercised and when I used to do MMA training my heart rate ever used to go to 172 I think 165 was the max I've ever seen my heart rate I felt like my heart couldn't take it I had this burning sensation through my chest like almost like when the letter s it is building up in your body and you're training hard and you feel like your muscle cannot take the weight if you lifting a little bit too heavy feels like I'm also gonna take I had that same kind of burning feeling in my chest and my heart was racing so fast on top of that I had this funny feeling like it was it was just like my heart couldn't cope with a the beats per minute and I lay on the bed I got managed to get to the bed and I was struggling to speak because my heart was going so crazy that I couldn't get the words out like I was freaking out inside and I was told with it that's the weird thing I didn't feel the effects of the THC besides those physical responses like I was I was going through all of this but in my mind I'm like just relax it's anxiety and even though my heart was that fast I'm like you're just gonna freak yourself out more and I was talking to myself to calm myself down using my diaphragm to breathe and slow my heart rate slow my breathing control everything but it just got worse and worse and worse when I checked my heart rates again and weights up to 180 and it wasn't like a panic attack where it stays high for long and then oops it just stayed constantly a tip from 180 dip down to 172 to 165 and it didn't go below 165 it was between 165 and 172 for about seven hours so even though the HC is considered safe there are extreme cases where there are complications so if your heart rate stays too high for too long you can have a heart attack my blood pressure was extremely high eventually we call the paramedics because I didn't feel like I was gonna make it now I've seen lots of stories of people taking too much and especially if it's their first time they think that they're gonna die and they have anxiety and freaked out I've been through so much anxiety over the years and has so many anxiety attacks where I was rushed to hospital and this fall so different my mind was still there like I was still thinking everything and I honestly felt like I was I was blacking out and my heart was going way too fast and my heart couldn't take it they called the paramedics the paramedics came my heart rate was still extremely high my oxygen saturation was so low because I wasn't breathing properly I was trying to control my breathing so much that I eventually slowed my breathing down so much that I stopped breathing basically they had to stand over me and told me to take deep breaths because I basically lost respiration and I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my body so I made a conscious effort to suck in air but I struggled so much to breathe it's almost like a disconnected feeling and I have read that so that you could become disconnected but you don't know where you are I knew exactly what was happening around me I could feel every single thing I could feel muscles in my face I could feel the inside of my ears I could feel all my muscles I could feel everything it's scary because then you start feeling so lame almost like I couldn't really move much then I would try shake myself like just like the little jerks and jumps to like wake myself up because I could feel like I was slipping away - I don't know passing out or blacking out and the funny thing is in that clip where you see me laying on the bed there my blood pressure was so high it was 190 over a hundred ten I think somewhere there and I thought I had glasses on I'd fought like you know when you put glasses on they're a little bit too tight and you can feel the bands on behind your ears I could feel that and because my blood pressure was so high my veins were so tight there I didn't have two losses on it was just those veins and the whole time I thought I had glasses on because of that feeling my blood pressure was extremely high my heart rate was way too fast and that's lost him for seven hours it's the last longer but off those first seven hours those were the worst so having a heart rate go that fast for that long it can be dangerous and having a blood pressure that high and if it rose higher along with that heart rate is extremely dangerous you could have a stroke you can have a heart attack it's very easy so even though it is a natural compound and there are no reported deaths from cannabis the complications or ever stating and I've never felt that scary in my life through all the anxiety attacks that I had and everything that I've been through with thoracic outlet syndrome that feeling right there was the scariest feeling I've ever had when I had anxiety I used to think that I was gonna die and eventually you know you're not gonna die even though you feel like it with us I just I couldn't control it obviously I take it such a high dose that my mind was only focusing on negative things as much as I was trying to stay positive and talk myself through it and the paramedics actually brought the stretcher they wanted to take me to hospital if my blood patient didn't go down and they stayed with me for a quite a while because I saw such tunnel vision and my blood pressure was so high I think I just like to zoned in I honestly thought that they took so many hours to get there and it felt like it was nighttime reading where in the clip you can see I'm laying there as it's fall early evening I think there was 10 past 6 or so so I was really like out of it I doesn't feel good at all my whole family around me none of them had ever seen me look that bad I didn't see myself making it out of it my heart was feeling so strained it was about three days after that that I still felt like I couldn't do anything because just getting off the bed walking around the house I felt like my heart was pumping so hard like it like it was overused then drained from the day before so it was just like the next week I had no energy I had left so much energy I wasn't myself at all I doesn't feel good I had the worst headache and obviously such a high dosage was way too high for my body to handle and I had no tolerance to it and it wasn't something that I've ever wanted to try or thought to try so it was a stupid decision to even want to try it and that's why I just got to be careful with what you take sometimes doctors will prescribe you medicines and things and they just don't work with your body they react differently and your experiences can be totally different to somebody else so you everyone can be laughing and having a great time and then you are freaking out and having the worst time and just now you get a complication and like I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna make it and it was an exaggeration because when I look back at the footage that I have the way I look in the video freaked out and not looking good at all my heart rate I got felt that and I can still feel that I can think about it and feel that scared feeling that I felt and it wasn't just because I was having some weird experience from the THC it was just it was pure anxiety and pure fear and yeah it's not something that I enjoyed at all I know I should have researched first it was one of us things that happen so fast that you make a stupid decision and it can affect you it was one of those kind of things because I love to research everything down to a tee before I take it when I had my thoracic outlet syndrome when I was on tremor doll I took like three tremor dolls and I threw the Box away because of all the first of all the way it made me feel I fall I couldn't feel like myself didn't take my pain away and all the side effects so I threw it away and cured myself naturally and this was just one of those things where it wasn't planned at all and just happened like in that split second I was like okay let me just take ten drops I mean what 10 drops gonna be and ya had the scariest 7 hours of my life fortunately I came right I eventually managed to stand after seven hours I managed to get up stand I felt horrible and weird and zoned out but I felt a little bit more relieved that I felt like myself I felt like it just slowed down enough to a point where I felt I felt okay and I could I could go home so yeah that's my experience it's a horrible experience now I know there's I've really got so many messages from people all over saying it took too much and if you want the right those who just message me or if you want proper CBD oil with no THC I'm not interested in any of those things I'm not interested in any of those kind of questions telling me that I took way too much because I know it took way too much for myself but this was just something I thought I'd share because there are so many websites that you read and and obviously it's promoted as a safe thing to take and obviously if it's measured properly and in the right dosages then it can be safe and it can be useful for many things but if you're just taking it and you don't have any knowledge about it and you're taking too much like I did it can be scary and it can be dangerous and just now you're taking a higher dose and your body can't handle it and you end up having a heart attack or stroke or something that could have been avoided because you don't know enough so I hope my experience can just hope somebody make the right decision and not just take some research first I have been struggling to train I've been back to training maybe once or twice but because I've been so busy at work I haven't like got myself back into training and making videos on regular basis so I'll get back to making all my podcast series that I was trying to work on before all of this happened I hope this can help somebody and at least make them think before they try something I'll see you guys soon", "MxPBmxnLivM": "[Music] two wheats the marijuana animal review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and today we are talking about krispity krunch II no I'm just joshing with you we're not talking about Peter Barnes but I'm on camera one because they're good too because they're high in fat and three because we're actually reviewing a hundred million gummy bears what's correct we are reviewing the ED of your 100 milligram Getti gummy bears today looking at in another this is another in this series if that appeared that we're going to be reviewing smaller dose to the last time we took these if history is going to repeat them itself these will taste awful and won't get me that high I'm hoping against hope that both of those things aren't true but there are no guarantees so the peanut butter minims just that just bad to help me get some of this as the best part of this th e so that's why I'm eating news those are gonna taste so much better than these I have a feeling alright let's open it up here oh man I thought last time this packaging was easy to open but now it's not looking so good balls all right I'm gonna have to grow grab some scissors technical difficulties back that's a negative anytime you have to go for the scissors she'd never have to do that finally finally let's give it a sniff oh man Oh smells like gummy bears with weed here we go that is awful oh and it gets worse it's got that harsh aftertaste oh oh they're so bad oh why would you do this to yourself and get gummies guys why why candies and goes-- why I don't understand it I really don't but I'm willing to keep doing it for you guys just because you seem to like them I I I'm not sure I get it so the head of pure 100 milligram gummies guys I'm going to finish these bad boys off not looking forward to it and I will see you in two hours to let you know how they are feeling and let's hope against hope one last time that they are the exception to the rule and I am coming to you blazed in two hours but not too optimistic see you two hours peace it has been two hours since I had the head of your gummy bears 100 milligrams and nothing really I can't say nothing I little high it's sort of as equivalent if I had maybe smoked a small bowl recently so on about in line with what I thought not a good value proposition at ten dollars not at all they tasted awful tasted really really bad and I'm not very high there isn't really a lot to say about the etta pure gummy bears and then they taste terrible and they really don't get you that high I have a few more and appears to review and I hope things turn around for them and again I want to I do want to say that I think these are more potent than like the infused creations that I've had so take that as you will but you know just gummies and candies just don't do it for me they may do it for you edibles you know can everybody experiences them a little bit differently maybe they just don't seem to work but I'm willing to give ed up here a fair shake in the future reviews guys and I hope you will too should you stick around for future reviews and thank you so much for watching this episode we'll catch you on a future one peace hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "7U_ET0_HVOw": "oh hi guys just enjoying some splatoon too but that's not what we're here about we're not here to talk about splatoon - as fun as the game may be we're here to talk about marijuana edibles welcome to wheats guys the marijuana edible review show the one where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's late at night and I'm ready for bed but I can't go to sleep so that's why I've got my cushy punch hundred milligrams here indica variety right here you know Ben so I'm hoping this is going to do the trick this is the second time of reviewed cushy punch I reviewed their TKO formula before 200 milligrams and found it to be pretty disappointing to be honest it did not do much for me since that time I have had several several people come up to me and say and I come up to me I mean comment online that's what I mean by that I've had simple people comment to me online saying give Chris you budget another chance sometimes that their formulation isn't as strong as others but when it hits it really hits so I decided to give it another chance and this seems to be the perfect opportunity when you're ready for some sleep with the indica variety so let's go ahead and open it up give it a taste and I'll come back to you guys in just about two hours after this and hopefully be ready for bedtime so let's find out if that's going to be the case or not okay so we've got our little jar here it looks like a little butter Pat actually a little pad of butter that you would get at our restaurant it's a hundred milligrams of THC in here I said before so let's go ahead and open her up and slope her to him and hopefully get ready for bed in the there we go there's our corner and there she has one big gummy pop her out for little rivulets they're not gonna care just gonna plump the whole thing I'm not it's not super great it's better than the like confused creations or those kind of edibles I've done as good as the flourish it sort of tastes more like a flourish type edible than the infused creations or at a pure or any of those two so it's better than those but it's not as good as the flourish company's in terms of taste so from here guys I'm just going to wait it out and hopefully in two hours I'll be ready for bed so I will see you guys then I'll see you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the way the wheats reviews work for you it's just going to be a couple of seconds so I'll see you on the other side of the break and for me it'll be two hours and I'll let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeds guys and I'll see you soon peace mission accomplished I think and a slight redemption for cushy punch I am ready to go to bed quite sleepy at this point looking forward to hitting that pillow and I feel pleasantly buzzed for one hundred and milligram edible this cost me eight dollars at my dispensary all-in with all the discounts so you know pretty affordable 400 milligram edible and I do feel about about a six maybe five and a half or so so you know I'm not super super high by any means but you know definitely high noticeably high and ready to hit the sack so I'm ready to give cushy punch another chance try another one there edibles because they earned their Redemption with this one I just there 200 milligram did not see you know any stronger than this for sure maybe it's just as people have told me their potency seems to fluctuate up and down so maybe this was just a stronger batch but we'll review some more could you punch in a few to see if my opinion changes but for now this was a pleasant surprise and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat skies and we will check you out on a future review peace", "KAycqbqNaes": "[Music] thanks for coming back to my channel my name is Karen a and you are my bluff I am

second ellic trip you had any I did mushrooms couple months ago yeah how is that it's [ __ ] awesome where'd you do him um did him with re on the show we did did him during a podcast really yeah and do you guys start tripping during the podcast yeah yeah we're having fun what is what does it sound like it was great podcast was great we didn't take too much yeah we took enough and what like you know no one can tell when you're on them like you can still function normally yeah I mean it depends on how far you go please you guys are so funny yeah you can go down the rabbit hole okay I'm you can go down the rabbit hole and be incoherent mm-hmm mushrooms it's dose-dependent I mean what you're doing is like you're getting you know you take a little bit you're like shaking hands with the Angels but you're not going to heaven you're not going to visit them you're like hi how are you oh my god you're so wonderful but you're not like riding on their wings going going to the other dimension but if you take enough that's where you go if you take enough you're not talking to anybody and have you done Alice T yes and good yes great experience yeah oh you had a bad experience on that no no I took it I took it later in life I don't think it's I think most of these psychedelics where you have bad experiences what you're having is your own psychological dilemma and then your battle with whatever the the drug or the psychedelic is trying to do to you versus what your ego is trying to control and keep it from happening I mean I've seen a lot of people have bad trips on some of the worst trips I've ever seen people have was from edible pot edible pot is one of the strongest things that people don't recognize mm-hmm it's it's a very different drug than smoking it and when you know you when you think of things that can take you down the rabbit hole you don't think of edible pot people think of pot is just like oh you're gonna get a high maybe you can get too high but you're just getting high but boom when you eat it it's a completely different animal yeah literally like physiologically it's a different really yeah it's create something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than THC and what it's like not even psychoactive in smoking it it's a different drug that's a little different totally different drug that makes complete sense yeah it's a different drug it's processed by your liver well there's something called the one pass that passes through your liver and the THC gets processed into eleven hydroxy metabolites Google it's trippy [ __ ] I've way stronger registered on some Micro dos versions of mushrooms that I have to add two of them and they were it was great it just made things a little bit brighter have you ever microdose yes you know does that all-time hey white oh really Ron white so micro dosing [ __ ] yeah cuz I'm on this new drug it's called mushrooms and I just take a little bit every day woah yeah I know a lot of people to do that yeah a lot like dozens dozens of people who microdose including fighters I know a lot of fighters from microdose yeah I forgot today was even on any I was like I was just like oh this room looks like cooler yeah I just feel so oh yeah I ate that little piece yeah you just feel a little better and you're like what is all I took mushrooms yeah I forgot [Applause]", "5-o1BEb8eek": "now speaking of getting high yeah you know not all highs are good highs sometimes there are bad highs yeah do you have a horror high story of that experience while you were high I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste of a spring break danger you", "UgDQ0zsfvVY": "what's up guys thank you guys so much for the feedback on that video it was number one trending for a little bit boys we literally Steve's wanted to do

where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary uh accidentally jumped the gun forgot to record this once so i already opened this package that was just a moment ago haven't eaten anything welcome to weeds guys with a review show here on welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary classic ass episode today which means yes a good old-fashioned edible and one of the most old-fashioned kinds of weed edibles the gummy that's right we're taking a look at wanna one of the makers of the cannabis infused sour gummies these ones your standard 100 milligram edible 10 different uh pieces at 10 each however these ones are also a cbd blend uh at a ratio that they actually have listed incorrectly there of 10 to one even though it should be one to ten the way they have it listed in that it is 10 milligrams of thc per piece one milligram of cbd per piece 100 milligrams of thc total 10 milligrams of cbd total in this package in these strawberry gummies i picked this up and i accidentally already opened it was recording didn't realize my bad haven't tried any i picked these up for 18 bucks at a dispensary here in long beach california which is a slight premium i would say over there traditional gummy edibles which probably average about 15 so a definite premium there not a whole lot but something to notice and again it doesn't have that nominal amount of cbd in it which i'm curious if it's going to have an effect on me that's not a lot of cbd i'm guessing it probably won't but we'll be on the lookout for it um and on here as well as all the good stuff you want to see they've got lab testing results although this is nearly a year old at this point which is a little disconcerting but whatever uh nutrition information all that good stuff so let's go ahead and take a look at the most important stuff the gummies themselves these 18 gummies and here you go looks just like that 10 of these squares in there oh smells very strawberry not very weedy at all mostly just strawberry well let's go ahead and give it a bite give it a test see what it's like gummy weedy strawberry a lot of wheat flavor actually more wheat flavor than i was expecting not grotesque but for the gummy candies higher than average but otherwise a totally fine gummy candy nice soft chewy okay well i would say in terms of taste a slightly weedier taste than your like plus or your steezy gummies but not revolting in any shape or form but it's there uh but of course guys it's not the taste that we're in this for trying to figure out if they're gonna work or not are they gonna make you hide and for that well that's what we're gonna have to wait around and see um so uh any time i do gummies i like to try to do them under the optimal conditions i don't think i said this i did have a little bit of fat beforehand just to make sure it's going to hit me just right not necessarily for you or for everybody i do it just in case so i had a little bit of fat before just for the optimal thc absorption um but it's still going to take a while to hit the old bloodstream so i'm going to finish these gummies off of the next i don't know hour so do all 10 as we do here on wheats we review the whole product i'm going to review them over the next or as i said eat them over the next hour and then two hours after i have that last one or thereabouts i'll come back to you guys and give you our wrap-up thoughts the most important part of the edible review is it gonna get us high and for that guys you're just gonna have to stick around and i'll be back in just a bit to let you know our wrap-up thoughts about these wanna sour strawberry gummies well here's one for the blooper reels guys i'm back two hours two and a half hours later with these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and as you can see with my eyes they are pure as the driven snow uh and i came here with a really bad review i was gonna come and really trash them as i was like these are pretty um non-existent non-existent in terms of the high that i feel from these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and i was gonna say something along the effects of well maybe it's the 10 to 1 ratio and maybe that little 10 percent of that welcome back to wheats guys it has been two and a half hours since my first uh bite at the wanna cannabis infused sour gummies and if i look very very sober you're correct um i this guys is gonna be one for the blooper reel uh i came here to excoriate the uh folks at wanna i'm saying that these gummies basically did nothing to me all ten of them felt practically nothing and i was originally going to think well maybe it has something to do with that um strange 1 to 10 ratio of cbd to thc and maybe just that 10 cbd was enough to totally blunt the thc and but not provide any of those cbd benefits that was just i've said i was gonna feel like i felt just kind of peaceful but that's about it not really high at all uh and that's because that is actually the case uh i had it wrong not them well actually the bud bud tender had it wrong uh i ordered the one to ten and they gave me the ten to one uh so this really is 10 cbd milligrams to 1 thc so this is 100 milligrams of ca cbd 10 milligrams of thc the exact opposite of what i thought it was um at least i know that i know when i'm high or not and i was definitely not high in any traditional sense with these but that's on me not on them this one's for the blooper reel we'll have to review wanna again in the future this was just a fun little [ __ ] up um and an 18 mistake so uh wanna i am sorry i uh did not mean to disparage i don't know anything about you just yet i do know that my bud tender [ __ ] up the order uh oh well uh [ __ ] happens but we will check you out again in the future apologize for that it's been fun it's been funny anyways that's gonna do it that's gonna do it for this non-existent review here on wheats no cherry on top just a big shame on me thank you so much for watching guys stay high and more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you guys right back here for our next review live stream or even [ __ ] up see you then bye", "hFAmvbrX07E": "well hello everybody welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy mixed up scary overwhelming place you call your dispensary today good old-fashioned classic ass episode of wheats which means it is an edible review my favorite kind of review if we're being honest love me some edibles and one today that i've got uh high expectations for no pun intended uh it comes at a premium price and it comes from a relatively um experienced well-known player in the field but one uh one of these players that is known for their cartridges not their edibles but they are branching out and so who is that that is heavy hitters that's right guys we are taking a look at the gummies uh now out from heavy hitters uh those are the fine folks that make really really nice um premium thc cartridges we've reviewed a couple of them here on wheats like them quite a bit uh and now they are making their own gummies that they say are ultra potent um there are some curiosities with this here first of all it says that they are five 20 milligram pieces which is a hundred milligrams what it's supposed to be uh it's just another sort of indication of how [ __ ] up the labeling is and how nothing really matters with labeling um because technically it's supposed to be everything is supposed to be uh at most or minimum 10 doses of 10 milligrams but this says five 20 milligram pieces well but then they get away with it by showing you actually on the back uh that even though it says they're five uh 20 milligram pieces oh sorry it's right on the front it does say two 10 milligram servings per piece so it's kind of very disingenuous to advertise it that way but whatever um we do have everything we want to see on our packaging here nutrition facts lab testing results showing our 100 milligrams of thc um and uh ingredients all that great stuff i'm not sure i've ever heard of a agar agar before it's one of the ingredients uh this is the strawberry flavored it's free of all the things you would hope it would be free of your glutens your dairies and your nuts um so you know if any of those things need to be free for you this claims that it is free uh and as i said this is at a premium this is an expensive edible uh at the dispensary i go to the gummies usually range in the about 15 16 range this comes in at a premium for 20 bucks uh so the heavy hitter's name uh given a little extra premium on the price let's hope it's going to be a little bit premium on the product so uh let's go ahead and open it here does have some opening instructions on the back i find those always to be those pictograms that show you how to open these child proof uh bags are very bad i think um usually they're not too bad it's usually about actually the trick is opening the bag beneath the zipper as opposed to above the zipper is the trick for most of these originally you know you rip the zipper anyways what does it matter um i just think the iconography of those things is terrible so here we go here are our uh 20 milligram pieces excuse me are two 10 milligram pieces i guess it is nominally scored as such does smell like strawberry and of course like all of our wheats reviews the way we do it i'm going to do the entire product i'm going to eat all 20 not 20. all 100 milligrams of heavy hitters strawberry gummies uh and then about two hours after i have that last one i'll come back to you guys and let you know exactly how we're feeling let's go ahead and try our first of five right here for you hmm wow that is a tasty gummy that is a very tasty gummy i like the gummy a lot almost zero weed taste i mean i'm really looking for it there on the aftertaste not not much i mean that is a gummy i would be very happy to eat uh just uh out of boredom and anxiety like all gummy candies should be consumed but yeah that's that's that's great um a shockingly shockingly uh devoid of cannabis taste which you know hopefully is gonna be a huge positive if these get me as high as their ultra potent label suggests we shall see look that sugar off my fingertips well we're two-fifths of the way there i've got three more of these to go i'm not gonna gorge myself right now i'll have these over the next i usually like to do this over about the next half hour to hour or so and then two hours after that last one actually that is not 100 true um what i'm gonna be doing is doing these next three on a live stream with you guys as soon as i wrap up this first half of this review i'm gonna save these three i'm gonna be doing a live stream hanging out with you folks saying hi getting high with you and at the end of that live stream i'll come back and give you my wrap-up thoughts but that's just a little pitch to you guys let you know we do the live streams now and i hope you will join us for those in the future regardless if you do or not we will be back to tell you if these heavy hitters strawberry cannabis infused gummy are worth the heavy hitters premium price until then stay healthy and stay high my friends see you real soon bye-bye welcome back to weights everybody looks like a dog might be joining us welcome back tweets guys it's been about three hours a little over three hours since our journey started with the heavy hitters strawberry cannabis infused gummy and the dog is still coming in hello dog uh and i am very happy to say and especially if any of you had watched the live stream i did while enjoying this review these are quite good uh these are a premium product at a premium price but i gotta say they do land in that top tier uh echelon of gummy edibles i am very high i'm very pleased with my high uh quite impressive with these and that's not to even mention as a taste which um these are among the best tasting gummy edibles i've had especially for as potent as they are um really happy with it the only downside is that price uh these are more affordable or excuse me more expensive rather than most of the gummy edibles out there uh but you know i i uh some of it may be just uh some psychology of uh wanting it to be more expensive more potent because it's more expensive but if you hear me rambling it seems like it may actually work i don't know might be more than just psychological tricks i really enjoyed it really enjoyed it heavy hitters strawberry hundred milligram gummies can i get a big old thumbs up from me if you can find it and if it's not that much more give them a shot for sure so speaking of premium products uh i want to share with you guys a little cherry on top a little something extra that you can enjoy that's not necessarily weed related that's like let's do something a little premium we're going premium edible let's go premium cherry on top what does that mean i don't know that's kind of a dumb thing but what i do mean is go premium on something and really what i mean by that is get rid of ads on something hulu spotify apple music whatever it is that you use that has an ad subsidized version pay to get rid of ads ads are terrible they're the worst i don't think you even realize how hey you're on youtube pay for youtube premium get rid of ads eat [ __ ] the music stuff who gives a [ __ ] who gives about anything else just get rid of ads live your life with as few ads as possible it's not until you start to consciously remove advertisements from your life that you realize how pernicious and awful they are so this cherry on top is a premium service of your choice and this review is a premium product heavy hitters strawberry that tree on top was really abstract but you know what i mean pay for something you'll be happy you did and that guy's is going to do for this chair on top that's going to do it for this review that's going to do for everything here on wheats i thank you so much for watching as always stay high stay healthy and we'll see you guys on the next video were", "6J9aM0Gh0iE": "[Music] and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's old-school today guys cuz we are taking a look at an edible just like good times good times I mean old times but the old times aren't necessarily good times anymore because here in California we are fully in the new recreational world which includes this ridiculous hundred milligram cap on edibles not just that but makes absolutely crazy packaging requirements for all edibles here in California so what edible are we talking about that is ridiculous today what we are gonna take our first look at Plus gummies that's right another gummy review I normally tell you to avoid the gummies but I have heard a lot of good things about Plus and I am a little curious I'm always hoping to find another gummy I like cushy punch or flourish or Tiki killers that's actually worth something so I'm definitely looking forward to reviewing these plus gummies first thing you're gonna notice is how crazy this packaging is so here it is here is our plus gummies I believe they are sour blueberry blue in case you don't know is objectively the best flavor of everything if there is a multitude of colors and blue is available always go with blue because blue is much like a like a law of thermodynamics or whatever the case may be blue is always the best fruit flavor even though I don't know of any naturally-occurring blue fruits other than blueberries and blue tasting foods are hardly ever blueberries usually blue raspberry or something it's always the best trust me on this though so we have a sealed bag with you know all these insane requirements on it batch number this that and the other I mean it's great because it has all of those wonderful serving sizes and ingredients and all the testing results all this stuff you know I like seeing but it's a bag and then a fancy 10 on the inside I think all edibles now have to be bagged in addition to whatever kind of thing holds the edibles they have to have these sealed maggots it's insane it just boosts up the cost because this uh 100 milligram 20 piece edibles so I believe it's 20 gummies each worth 5 milligrams of THC cost me 20 bucks at my dispensary which is outrageous of course but that is the world we now live in and we shall review it as if it's the world we want to live in who knows I don't know what I'm saying I know I'm sad I'm disappointed that the edible world has changed so much and so for such and in such a shitty direction over the past year but let's stop the bitching and get straight to the review of the plus gummies cannabis infused sour blue berry so we're gonna open up the first layer of the packaging here it looks like it's got a little tear thing nice Oh and then then we got our second layer the zip sealed bag on side of the tear bag and then we gotta figure out how to open this the childproofing I think you ground push down and that breaks the seal yes there we go so second layer of security through now we're finally to our chin on the inside and to the gummies in here ah so here are our blue raspberry or blueberry gummies whatever they call it blue flavored the best 20 gummies in there give it a smell oh definitely a cannabis e odor which is not a bad thing I I'd like to know that there's some cannabis in these but also a hefty flavor and aroma of blue but certainly in a cannabis aroma there as you can see just a bunch of little squares dropped one there and let's pluck it into our mouths but before we do in case this is your first week to review the way they work when we do edibles we reviewed the whole experience I'm gonna eat all 20 of these gummies and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling because it's you want to know how have it tasted like [ __ ] but you what you really want is it gonna get you [ __ ] up it's gonna get you high are you gonna get what you paid for it and that guy's is what you need to stick around for but first the taste test so here we go first cube in the mouth um very spongy gummies very very spongy almost hard to bite into because they're so Airy um a surprising cannabis taste them it's not awful but there is a 4 what is 5 milligrams of THC in these cubes definitely a cannabis taste to it but the blue the blue sciency flavor counter sex but if you don't like cannabis taste maybe you don't stick with these because you're gonna taste it again not terrible not overwhelming but it is surprisingly noticeable for what is just 5 milligrams of THC so guys I'm gonna eat me about what 16 more of these and I said I'm gonna eat me which is very back woodsy and folksy way of saying I'm gonna eat the rest of these so guys I'll see you in about two hours I'm gonna scarf these down and I'll let you know then if they're worth your money or not so thanks for staying tuned this far sticking around this far sorry guys this is really my second video back here on weeds and this will probably be another video between season 3 and between season 2 and season 3 so forgive my rustiness see you guys in two hours thanks for sticking around 2 hours since I have had the plus cannabis infused gummies looking at the camera for the first time now since coming back the fuse but I also see now I'm saying the word let's just start over one more time BAM I'm back guys it has been 2 hours since I had the plus cannabis infused gummies and I think there was an even yeah it says create on there as well there are a lot of nouns and adjectives and verbs on that packaging I'm really not even sure what it's called I'm just gonna call it plus gummies plus gummies uh guys I am genuinely pretty impressed uh for a gummy and for a hundred milligram edible this brought the heat um I'm not outrageously high but I am at like maybe a 6 somewhere in that range which is way higher than I expected it to be after a hundred milligrams and especially after a gummy I am pretty pleased with this now that is in the relative scale compared to you know this new world of edibles because this is a very expensive product you don't get a lot for your money here compared to the old world but in this new world this is a pretty good little solution um I found myself not maybe quite as high as if they were like akarova or a Kanaka mini cookie situation but for a gummy and for how much less you have to eat then which is very important to me you have to eat a [ __ ] ton of those cookies from like all you know Pete's and Korova and Kanaka all those ones you just mentioned you have to eat like 20 of those you know many cookies to get the hundred milligrams the gummies here were a hell of a lot more manageable that 10 was no problem to eat by myself I didn't didn't feel like a gluttonous badass after consuming that whole thing at all so really really pleased with that aspect um have a cannabis taste for sure but not awful um I didn't feel like retching after eating that not even close there was a cannabis taste but it was not the primary taste and again didn't have that just incredibly bitter kind of almost you know a cynic that Pacific we've tasted no no just the taste is there but then again for as potent as these came you know turned out to be you would expect that so guys this is a a nice win I think I'm I'm pretty impressed with Plus cannabis infused gummies and then also that were to create for some reason on there as well so I'm really happy with this I think I'll be reviewing some more stuff from plus in the future and if you see these in a dispensary near you and you guys want to eat all of something to get the hundred milligrams Jesus it's it's almost easier to recommend this then which is hard to say which is hard to believe actually then like the Kanak o or the kirova because it's just such it's so much easier to do and they're they're sort of equivalently priced you don't get quite as high but it's it's it's easier to it's easier to manage for sure so really surprised me on this one guys and what the [ __ ] let's just shoot the moon here guys I'm gonna throw a cherry on top - my little cherries on top here just little things I like to add that aren't necessarily we related something you can just do to enjoy throughout your week and I'm just gonna throw this one out because I am having an ever-loving blast playing spider-man on the ps4 from insomniac holy [ __ ] guys it's so great to see insomniac get this win I assume this game it's going to be an amazingly huge hit it seems to be it's only a couple days since it's been out but reception seems to be great and it seems to be doing really well sales wise I'm so happy for insomniac I love these guys since the ps1 days back in like Spyro loved them on the ps2 days Ratchet and Clank so my favorite you know 3d action platformers ever even love the resistance franchises back on the ps3 days and then they have been one of the greatest VR developers as well and I'm a big big fan of VR so you know what [ __ ] it I'm going to this endorsement is not for spider-man which is an awesome game I am having an utter blast with it it doesn't rewrite the rules anyway it's it's not a you know changing the genre it's just a hell of a good video game you know it's not rewriting anything but it's it's wonderful I'm having a blast with it but instead this cherry on top is just for insomniac in general they make great great games they've been making great great games for like 20 years I love them as a studio I'm so happy to see them having this huge success with spider-man so insomniac you'll never see this video but great job guys really proud of you and that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review what a great time we had great gummies that were so good here's an extra piece of packaging we had [ __ ] spider-man and insomniac on our cherry on top woohoo this guy's has been a [ __ ] good review let's just acknowledge the fact that everything went aces this time which doesn't often happen so great job plus great job insomniac and great job weed thank you so much for watching this review it's gone way too long and I will see you guys on the next one peace", "YFKNLym1r3w": "what is up ladies and gentlemen boys and girls it's your boy goblin and today we're coming in with a hoot and a holler hey we're coming in with something a little different a bit of an educational video if you will now hope you guys enjoyed this one drop a like if you do and without further ado let's dive right into it so first and foremost i want to clarify why this video is being made right i get a lot of people coming into my twitter dms or my instagram dm's and they send me pictures of edibles they get and they're these like nerds robes or these gummies or all of these different things and you know up until recently i didn't have as much knowledge on the topic i guess you could say as i did now right like i never really bothered to actually learn much or educate myself because i kind of stopped buying edibles for a while but as i got back into edibles you know i kind of started learning more about what the current street edibles are like and listen alright ladies and gentlemen there's a trend going on that when i mentioned it on stream the other day the vast majority of people in chat not the vast majority but a fair bit of people were like what are you talking about like oh i didn't know that and today we're going to address that right i'm going to give you guys some tips on how to spot a fake edible what a fake edible even necessarily is but first and foremost right i think it's important to note that there's really only two cases where you should even be buying edibles right a go to a dispensary dispensaries have great edibles that are made in ways that a lot of street edibles just can't be made because it requires equipment that is so expensive no dude in his garage is going to have it 99 of the time right or b buy it off a friend of yours who makes it right if you are buying a street edible and it advertises a milligram amount 99 of the time that is wildly inaccurate nothing close to the real dosage right but we'll get to that part later because the real thing i want to push here is like folks make your own edibles okay before i get dive into how to really spot these edibles it's so simple to literally just get together with your homies smoke some weed and cook edibles it's some of the most fun i've ever had in terms of anything weed related making edibles is a blast dude if you've never done it before it's literally it's so easy dude brownies are the easiest thing to make give it a go okay but now let's get into the the real beef of this video okay so first and foremost there's something i want to highlight right not all edibles are made the same way right there's some edibles that are sold on the street you know specifically if you're buying a pre-packaged edible if you buy nerds ropes i guarantee this is probably what you're getting 99 of the time right i know these are a huge trend right now everyone's eating these [ __ ] nerds ropes dude there's probably a few of you guys smacking that [ __ ] right now while you're watching this video okay listen i'm on to you okay i'm on your ass now all right listen so there's different ways that edibles are made edibles of course can be cooked and that's more common when you've got like a brownie or a cookie you know they take an oil or a can of butter and they actually cook something but there's a new and kind of i wouldn't say new but a what's becoming more common trend which is spraying right and a lot of people when i mentioned this on stream the other day this is the whole reason i'm making this video a lot of people didn't know this exists what people will do is they will take distillate and just spray it on the edibles you take a [ __ ] piece of wax paper and you lay it out on a table right and you take nerds ropes obviously are such an ideal candidate for this because you could just put them so tightly together and just spray them down and waste no distillate right so you take this wax paper and you lay these [ __ ] edibles out you lay some let's say you go buy some candy you know you go buy some cheap wholesale candy you lay it out and you just spray the [ __ ] out of it it's so much quicker than actually cooking and think about it for a minute do you really think your plug knows some guy who is handcrafting some [ __ ] nerds ropes one by one in his garage or has like a nerd's rope machine listen there's machines that do a lot of things but there's no machine making nerds ropes and there's also no guy dumb enough to hand roll a bunch of nerds ropes when he knows he could just buy them and spray them and sell them for a shitload of money right you have to understand that this is a very common trend in the comment section i'm actually going to link an article that talks about this right there's a couple articles i found i'm gonna link you guys can actually read some stuff hey you don't gotta believe me that's fine i'm not always the most trustworthy source hey but these articles are okay these will tell you some facts right but moving on from the whole sprayed part there's a couple prop well not moving on but there's a couple problems with it a you don't know what the [ __ ] the dosage is right you have no idea what these people are putting on you can't dose it they're not actually cooking it the spray is uneven but that's really the least of the concerns of the sprayed edible because you have to look more at the fact of like what are they actually spraying onto this product right when something is cooked like you know let's say let's say someone takes an oil or like a can of butter and they make a brownie or a cookie or something like that with it typically you're you're more going to be questioning the strength of it you're not going to be concerned about a synthetic or something fake in it but when you spray an edible you are opening up the door for synthetics to be sprayed on it and this is becoming a more common thing people don't realize that not all edibles even have thc in them sometimes you can get an edible that is just sprayed with synthetic [ __ ] right k2 for example they spray that right that's not like an actual plant they spray some plant matter and you smoke that [ __ ] right they can do the same thing with edibles if they really [ __ ] want to right they can spray it with some synthetic chemical [ __ ] that you don't know what it does to you you don't know where it's from and there's a million different chemicals that they can choose to spray on these edibles and that's why you have to have due diligence when you're buying and you have to look at what you're purchasing and honestly in my opinion the brownie in a ziploc bag is a hundred times safer than your prepackaged nerds rope or sour patch kid is ever going to be okay because like nobody like sure there might be exceptions i know there's of course gonna be that one guy in the comment section he's like well goblin you know i actually have a sour patch kids nerds rope factory in the shed in my backyard and i have over 15 employees churning out nine different machines of nerd ropes you know what good for you you're the one in a million all right but the rest of the people watching this video they aren't in that scenario they're buying it from some guy who is spraying some hoopla right they're buying it from some guy and they're not buying it directly from that guy either it's passed through a hands on hand so you're getting marked up sprayed [ __ ] you're not you're not even getting a good deal on this you have to realize your plug like if you hit up your plug and you asked to buy like a hundred of these edibles in bulk i guarantee you're gonna get some ridiculous price that makes you realize wait a minute how does that even work and i'll tell you how it's probably sprayed specifically if [ __ ] are selling these little nerds ropes or whatever man are these other candies that are on you know trending nowadays you know you go on tick tock and you see these people claiming they they make these edibles you know oh look at these candies brother just spray that [ __ ] dude 99 of the time they don't actually cook something into it but even when they do cook something into it here's the next concern the next concern is that there's no actual viable way of really testing a street edible right you you can't really know you know nobody's taking dispensary weed where they know the exact percentage and cooking it in edibles they're taking street weed that's never been tested and cooking it into an edible that that that's then also never been tested so they really don't know what the dosage is in these you know they could tell you how much they put into it and you can maybe ballpark it but when you get something that is packaged and your plug says yeah it's exactly this dosage don't believe them right if you've got a plug it just tells you yeah these [ __ ] are strong eat half that's honestly probably more reliable going to be a better product than the guy who's trying to sell you some thc milligram that he doesn't actually know exists right so always should have your due diligence and once again this should just be a an advertisement to cook with your homies dude go make some edibles hey go hop in your group chat right now all you need is literally like like a half ounce an ounce and you can make a small little batch of edibles bro that's all you need you and the homies will have a good [ __ ] time you know what i'm saying listen and you don't even need good kush you can get mids bro you don't even need good [ __ ] but hey that's for another video all right another thing that's very important to talk about specifically i see this on some of these right this is a small little disclaimer that we're going to talk about here is i see some edibles advertise activation time and that then and there should tell you to run if if there's ever a packaging on an edible you purchase that says oh man you'll be stoned in 60 minutes oh dude man activates in 45 minutes dude everyone like it's your digestion dude like everyone digests products differently the only way you could advertise that is if you're spraying it with some boo-boo [ __ ] that does actually activate that quick but if it's actually cooked into the product and you have to digest it right that's a whole different story right that's a whole different story and obviously you can't advertise activation time like that so just what i'm trying to say here in this video guys is is really think before you purchase an edible and it's really sad that the street market has become this way you know when i was young and i first started smoking it was just you'd buy some mids and you buy some mid wax and edibles was something you made with your friends out of one of those two things nobody really sold them unless it was your homie with a tray of brownies who was selling them right pre-packaged edibles were unheard of around me right now that's like the norm everyone's selling this crazy carts [ __ ] fake edible [ __ ] it's crazy man and that's why that's why i make some of these kind of informational videos just spread the word about it dude hey man listen if you're a plug out there selling these shits dude you're guilty okay you should feel terrible about yourself but either way hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you did hope you guys learned something let me know in the comments if you did thank you guys for tuning in i will see you guys next time peace and subscribe if you haven't already peace out everyone", "eSw1S_tEOLo": "what's up YouTube it's a boy stuff we preview Channel Denver coming back at you with another weed review we review number 10 today I'm doing something a little bit different we're going to do an edible review it is Incredibles indica Fruit Chews it's a hundred milligrams each one of these is ten milligrams and there's ten of them in there so each one of these right here is ten milligrams so I'm gonna go ahead and give those a try I'm gonna pause the video wait till I start feeling the effects and then I'll start the video back up again and we'll see where we go from there are these it's been about 20 minutes and yeah they're pretty effective you can feel it right off the bat I'm sure as time goes on as time progresses they get stronger and stronger but about 20-25 minutes in boom you can definitely feel that they're definitely there it's you know I mean it's definitely very very very effective no indica I don't know how you're going to feel the difference between indica and sativa when you're eating when you're eating edibles I don't know because it affects your body so much I don't know how you would be able to feel the difference between an indica and a sativa but these are in different shoes so yeah I don't know you know I'll be able to tell but um yeah these are pretty effective the price point for these ten of these gummies which equals a little over a hundred milligrams cost $17 they were on special for $17 I think they were normally like $19 or $18 so they weren't special for $70 I think it's well worth it for seventeen dollars you get blasted out in your brain basically 100 milligrams is pretty good thousand milligrams is insane so yeah we just keep trucking with that once again it's your boy Seth we would do Channel Denver coming to you with another weed review and a mouthpiece you", "6eOw9MLpuKA": "[Music] 20 I'm back with an overview I am at the auditorium or whatever right here in Los Angeles and I'm better Munch out on these stony patches that I just got a dispensary let's see how these are they look like sour patches I better take the whole 350 milligrams the whole thing I'm about to take the whole thing while I'm out here cuz I got like an hour parking and I'm not trying to really wait I've been waiting to eat them at the house but we've been out all day so I'm even here look the different colors they're little squares they're not the little sour patch figures and I got about like 10 of them so they smell like candy I do smell a little bit different in between they don't taste different that all tastes the same no matter what color they were um first time I ever see these they look like the exotic cards for some reason but they're edible got a matter dispensary for $15 so why not I will be coming back they get an hour to to see what the fix were and let you know they were worth the $15 or not so for now just stay tuned and Cheers and stay hi hi guys I'm back as I breathing for 23 hours later after taking 350 milligram edible I did not feel anything guys I went to the observatory in LA and I was up there for like 2 3 hours and they did not even kick in I had my moon rock art and I think after like 2 hours that I waited to see if they kicked in I just started hitting on the moon rock art and I got me it got me high as hell but these they didn't do anything for 15 bucks I bought these at a dispensary in Compton and yeah these are not worth it at all guys definitely 15 bucks down the drain but you know you pay for what you get or you get you get what you pay for and these two out of 10 don't even try ever if you come to LA so let me know if you want me to do more edibles don't forget to Like and subscribe

student inadvertently brought the THC candy to school mistaking the product for a popular sour candy our chief health editor dr. partha nany joins us now with more on what happened and how those kids are doing now doc thanks Alan well first of all the students injuries were not life-threatening the kids were between ages 10 and 12 and were sent to the ER because they were having stomach pains but this is still a warning for parents who have edible marijuana products in their home if the packaging and the candy or treat inside resembles any products that kids are familiar with then they're more likely to see it as normal food and be tempted to eat it unfortunately these types of accidental poisonings are on the rise so dr. nany why does food prompt more overdose incidents well Glenda edibles often have several times the recommended dose of THC now t-h-e is this psychoactive ingredient in marijuana yet the edibles take a longer time to kick it me that you won't feel the effects right away so oftentimes people end up eating even more of the drug as for kids they can experience severe effects like trouble breathing loss of coordination altered perceptions panic paranoia and heart problems all bad things all bad things for sure doc so when kids overdose what are the long-term effects super important question Alan and honestly I don't have a good answer for you because acute marijuana exposure on children has not been systematically studied so there's no research or science findings regarding the full effects so it's super important that anyone who has kids in their homes keep edibles and all types of marijuana products out of reach and out of sight they should also be kept in child resistant packaging that also contains the the way so that it seals it conceals the contents rather so it can't be seen and please don't consumes the edibles in in front of the kids because we need to keep them safe we do dr. Nandi that's great advice thank you for joining us and if you a question or health concern for the good doctor email him dr. Nandi at ask dr. Nandi dot-com or send it to us on Facebook or Twitter we'll get it right to him", "db3sIVwDbUM": "- I feel like CBD is for people who do not have a weed plug, and can't afford a psychiatrist. (upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually.

anything about it because I don't have my tripod my tripod broke I try to get a tripod the other day and they didn't have any for some reason so I'm guessing I need to either order one online or just somewhere else I don't know what to really do about it but right now you're just gonna have to kind of deal with this I couldn't move it but then I'm gonna be like up here to video so I don't know what you guys would prefer see I'm saying like I just don't have any like flat oh that kind of worked okay okay we're gonna roll with it anyway so today I'm doing a quick little review on an edible eye balm I love edibles I mean I love him but at the same time they're deadly to me they're strong girl I took a edible for 4/20 it was the la familia hot chocolate one I took the whole thing and that thing smacked so today I didn't really want like a chocolate or like a brownie I wanted something like more candy like so I got the Smokies edible and these are in the sour blueberry fruit shoes basically so it's a hundred milligrams there's two milligrams of CBD per not per actually the whole bag is I guess that's what it is now per serving it's 10 milligrams of THC so per gummy and then 2 milligrams of CBD in one little gummy so I'm not gonna do the whole thing and by the way you guys this review is going to be really really [ __ ] forward really honest I'm gonna tell you guys about the taste I haven't opened these or anything yet so I want to record like my reaction of like the taste that I get instead of like trying them and then coming back and then you know my thoughts would be kind of you know what I mean so yeah anyways these are vegan this is a vegan uh thing not all of them are weakened from this brand so if you are vegan and you know you stay away from Dairy and stuff so I'll definitely ask them which one is the vegan one because I know not all of them are vegan but I know that their dairy they're gluten-free all of them are gluten-free but not all of them are vegan so I just got this because of the flavor you know what I mean so I'm not vegan so it doesn't matter to me but it's a good thing that it is vegan so I don't mind it and I don't really care so yes so the ingredients on here is just sugar corn syrup pectin I don't know what that is but it is citrus acid natural and artificial flavoring FD&C blue one which is probably like the color of the candy soy let union I don't know and then cannabis extract so the weed basically you know so yeah the sugars in this is four grams I'm thinking yeah per piece it's four grams so if I'm gonna have three of them for 12 grams of sugar when you do the math it's kind of a lot so these are sour they're Fruit Chews had crafted gluten free vegan and so I watched a review on these and people said that only 40 will do the trick I'm gonna try 30 just because I want to see how I feel and if I don't feel it as much I'm so sorry about the [ __ ] Sun oh my god but if you don't feel it as much then I guess well if I don't feel it as much because you're not going to taking them I am but if you don't feel it as much then I'll take then I'll take another one pretty pretty much but I know how adipose are they sneak up on me I keep eating them like I eat them and then I keep eating them and then boom you know so these were $21.99 okay before attacks at my dispensary so I think with tags and all the little bag they charge me for because I've got to break minds it was like $25 so basically it's really easy to open I just rip this up hopefully it's easy to open it cuz I haven't even opened it yet already strong it's kind of like this there's like a little this in here and I'm guessing you pull that apart and they open up they smell like blueberry literally like [ __ ] they smell like powder aid okay you guys the blue powder right that's what they smell like I totally spot on that's what I'm getting and they look really cute and like flat and big oh they're soft they're like super gooey look at all that little sugar let me just you know I'm saying basically they're just coated in sugar they're sour they're pretty big I would say they're like as big as a [ __ ] let me see some money up in here so this is a quarter and then they're a little bit bigger than a quarter even so okay you guys so I'm gonna try one and I'm gonna see you in like a week [Music] mm-hmm gather my thoughts okay so I'll say this they taste really good they have they're sweet they are sweet you know I'm saying like I'm not really like a candy person but I like gummies and like sour stuff so I can make an exception but they're really good I had one of these they don't taste like we do know what I'm talking about you know when you take some edibles and they have that weird like nasty aftertaste of the weed you know you can you feel on the back your throat and all that I don't get it with these ones so I'm gonna take another one this is gonna be my number two you know I'm gonna take the three in front of you guys so you guys know what's real and I'll check back in with like in an hour and two I got some laundry to do so I'm gonna be a little bit busy and then they're just gonna hit me like a truck and I'm gonna be gone you know what I mean I don't know I hope so I hope these are strong they were saying these were strong so they better be so this is gonna be twenty you know what I'm saying these are really good you guys like even if they didn't have ween in it I would probably eat them they're kind of like okay they're like a sour patch kit all most like they kind of remember that but they're not as sour they're like they're like up from sourness it's like a good five it's it's the perfect amount it's honestly good with this week and see what I mean so I'm gonna eat one more you know I'm saying well you know we get lead tea today [Music] he was a [ __ ] fly in here anyways these are really good I wish they had like a pack where they had like all the little flavors that would be really dope like you know they had blueberry rhinos berry that would be mom like a little mixed assorted pack but yeah so I've had if I'm gonna have three out of like seven left so that's 70 grams seven milligrams so basically I'm ready to eat another one this is gonna be thirty and I will check back with you guys and an hour or I think on the back it tells you yeah wait two hours so I'm gonna wait two hours and I think he's gonna give me pretty lip but I don't know because I'm not smoking at the time maybe I will smoke a bowl but I'm not gonna like smoke because I feel like when you smoke weed and you take edibles it's both of them combined and it's just too much so I'm really trying to see how strong these are going to be just with 30 milligrams and if you guys the real tea on this you know I'm going to eat the last one and then I'm gonna go and go do my little [ __ ] wash my drawers and then I'll be back and then I'll tell you guys how they are so yep sure yeah of course chuckles you guys but I told you guys I did a little bun you know what I mean it's like a tank guys so it's like eight o'clock now I took those three edibles at 6:00 it was kind of like noise in there but anyways there's six it's been like two hours I smoked a bowl I'm not really feeling it all that much so I'm gonna wait until like 20 more minutes see if it kicks in and then if not I'll take another alignment so then I'm gonna give it the complete fill out two hours so you know it's good at all so we'll see but if not I'm gonna take one more or maybe two more to see if it's gonna hit me later but yeah that was 30 milligrams and it's been like an hour and 40 minutes I don't really feel anything but I'm gonna wait 20 more minutes because you know how they are they hit out of nowhere so I'll be back with you guys I'm kind of talking fast I'm not trying to but it's just a quick update you don't even a brief summary so I'll be back and I'll see you in a bit hey y'all so it's an update it's been I think a day or so two days I don't know when I recorded that video but basically I'm here to give my initial and final final thoughts you guys about that edible the was it the sour blue raspberry by Smokies the gummies the Fruit Chews to be exact you guys they were [ __ ] smacking okay when I had the 40 milligram that night oh my god was I gone was like on I kept [ __ ] eating I didn't really felt them like hitting me like instantly instantly but I felt like they really creeped up little by little and I also feel like it took a little bit longer for 40 milligrams to hit me it took like I would say to and I have hours and then I was just like Munchie [ __ ] madness you know I was eating anything I was just eating chips food I ate even after my dinner like have some snacks if you're gonna eat some edibles because trust you're gonna need up and then what's getting pulled in here okay and then I took 50 milligrams that I think the day after okay I took 50 milligrams and that actually hit me a little bit sooner I would say that one they fit me I don't know why maybe like maybe because the timing that I took them at I feel like the first time I took the 40 milligram I took it at like 4 to 5 so it was like kind of late afternoon already so you know it girl was tired she was doing her SH and she was tired but the second time when I took it I took it earlier in the day I took it out like 2 o'clock because I wanted to be like awake and [ __ ] at least enjoy my high you know so I took the 15 milligrams and on this sweet so I took him I took him I'm chillin literally I would say two hours later two hours and ten minutes later it hit me I was at Walmart I was grabbing some things and that [ __ ] hit me like a brick like oh my god I was literally in one of the aisles and I was just [ __ ] dying you guys and I know you guys don't really care because don't everybody feels that way but I was legit like [ __ ] dying like over nothing and I was just like the [ __ ] but I realized that okay the edible so I know decided it's my cool I left Walmart and then even when I was home after that my boyfriend looked at me and he was like you're [ __ ] what did you do like I guess I was that [ __ ] high guys but I was like I just knew what it was you know to me that I didn't feel like I looked that [ __ ] high but I guess to somebody that you know from their point of view they would get it but um yeah to me I was really [ __ ] high but still productive so I would recommend taking them on like a very like good day that you're not gonna do [ __ ] you're gonna be eating a lot you're on your own time definitely don't do it if you're gonna go into work or something like that it's noticeable if you're high you know what I mean it is for me so my eyes got a little they got sleepy they got a little low they got red so you know but you guys the edibles smack I totally recommend them I'm going to try other flavors you guys I'm gonna do more reviews on this monkey's fan because I think it's probably one of the good ones okay really good really good so I've been totally gonna recommend to you'll I haven't tried other flavors but I definitely like the sour blue raspberry because I'm a sour person so you know I like sour candy so they were really my cup of tea so if you guys are into that I definitely recommend these edibles so that is my review you guys I don't want to keep going on and on and on but the same thing basically I rate him a 10 the taste is a 9 out of 10 the potency is a 10 out of 10 because I was gone with 40 so that's good because you can literally take 40 40 and then maybe the other two before work because it's like okay they're not gonna hit you as hard at vicious 20 milligrams you know what not as me as hard but like so like 42 like 60 it's like the perfect range for me yours might be a little different so I don't know so be careful but your dosage and all that dogs barking so I'm just gonna go and yeah you guys have a good day I'll see you on my next one bye bye", "4lLn0PhkakM": "[Music] [Music] hey guys mr. and mrs. Smith here and today we're going to be reviewing the heavy hitters cannabis infused gummies we have strawberry pineapple to try today we're actually very excited to try these uh if you don't know already heavy-hitters is possibly our favorite brand I would definitely say I would say it's also primarily smoke heavy hitters for our everyday cartridge and then when we want to like it up a little bit we'll grab some other stuff but heavy hitters is definitely always on a cartridge for us so we're also going to be trying the heavy hares GSC I say trying we've had it many times but we haven't been able to find it for a while not what you are it kind of it kind of went out of stock just weird it used to be available a lot in like 2018 but it kind of just fell out of favor except for certain places would still carry a guy in town by our main delivery service was no longer carrying it but they had it the other day so I had to pick it up cause it's been too long it seems like they almost haven't had it in stock since the name change so JSC used to be Girl Scout cookies I don't know if they changed it in others stances I'm pretty sure it was part of the laws that happened I'm pretty sure it's part of the laws that happened in 2018 for California that's they weren't allowed to call it they can't call it candy I believe they can't use the term candy and they can't use the term anything that could be marketed yes towards children can't market towards children right Paul any so that's why it says gummies or it'll always seem medical or cannabis like that they never never make yeah that would be appealing to a child exactly it can't be bears or anything like that so I mean it's a good law honestly I totally understand why there's some other laws that happened in 2018 which I will give you a refresher on right now now there was some weird stuff that happened when California passed a recreational marijuana back in 2018 I believe it was one of the things that happen is towards the middle of the year they actually switched it to where edibles could no longer contain more than a hundred milligrams per package now if you work in the medical marijuana industry or if you were a user or anything like that prior you know that there used to be packages up to a thousand milligrams in just one treat and what that used to be really good at is you could like just take a nibble off of a treat throughout the day and just kind of keep yourself dosed and medicated off one treat for a whole week basically but they changed it because there were way too many people who would come into a dispensary have no idea what they were doing by one of those really high potency edibles eat the whole thing and then they have a really bad time and end up going to the emergency room they got sick of dealing with that so they made a law saying you can't have more than a hundred milligrams per package there are certain things you can get around that such as cannabutter tinctures and pills those three items you can definitely get in higher doses than 100 milligrams but for edibles and then kind of cookie or anything like that max you're gonna get in a package is about a hundred so today we're reviewing B's from heavy hitters and the way they went about with these twenty milligrams per piece is you can actually rip the pieces in half so it's actually two servings per piece so it actually comes in two to ten milligram servings which I'm pretty sure is the law is that each piece inside a package can only be ten milligrams or something like that I know five to ten milligrams is a state recommended serving I'm not a hundred percent clear on the laws but it's just an unfortunate thing that happened with edibles in 2018 but I am absolutely dying to try these guns so let's go ahead and open up to the [ __ ] strawberry cuz I'm Joey it's been it's been a long time looking for out that let me grab the a7 r3 with the 70s [Music] [Music] yeah we just won't have us we won't help you all this video it's just not working at the moment six and a half hours Nathan I might open the pineapple real quick to maybe these do not open well I feel like we should show just how much of a struggle these were to open just like a montage of the [ __ ] difficulty this is bad this one opened much easier but that first package it just ripped in such a way that it was really hard to open but this is just like the other one has a really strong smell I figured it's it's really strong artificial pineapple mmm it's it's kind of a a bit herbal but not like too herbal it's not like overly pungent or anything like that like you're not gonna have you're not gonna get in trouble they're just keeping these in your drawer or anything like that like no one's gonna smell it yeah I don't know if this has any actual like pineapple juice or anything in it it doesn't have it listed on the ingredients mm-hmm so we're not sure if this is artificial flavoring or real bad no artificial actual coloring and flavor so is that natural flavors that display really use the natural coloring and flavor like or is it a flavor that's kind of that's kind of weird I don't know if I feel someone from heavy Harry's modified food yeah I don't mind it I mean that's just what I mean the people are heavy hitters you might want to put that it is natural flavoring as well like actually specified natural color and natural flavoring because natural color and flavoring just sounds a bit odd it's it leaves it up to the imagination as to is the flavoring also natural or just natural color you're always a nice flavoring this yeah always alright so let's try the pineapple yeah I'm gonna do a full 20 but I'm gonna show the camera how it splits so this is the gummies from heavy-hitters it's a square and if you look very carefully there's this little seam in the middle that if you pull whoops it starts to come apart yes it does if you start to pull it comes apart very nicely into two perfectly even ten milligram pieces so let's start well I'm actually just gonna eat the whole thing at once wait so where's our list of like criteria so I know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing bring it up go on top down your mouth and just roll around a little okay yeah my hands are all sticky now you know I gotta say I'm a little disappointed I'm a little underwhelmed actually I had I had much higher hopes it could just be the pineapple yeah because I mean the strawberry definitely smells better than the pineapple the pineapple is a little strong it's kind of it's very herbal forward which isn't a bad thing a lot of people enjoy that it's not a bad flavor necessarily but it is definitely herbal forward if you're looking for something that you could just totally mound shun and forget that there's weed in it not that we recommend it's not gonna be that yeah definitely don't recommend that but I mean like if you're if you're a fan of someone who like Eric or someone who likes really really flavorful very liked gummies that don't aren't bitter or plant alike at all this is not for you this is made to be strong and to be potent and it definitely tastes like it so keep that in mind and next up we have the strawberry so let's go ahead and pop these open and yeah will rate them in a second let's try the strawberry and I want to go ahead and split this one yeah because there'll be 30 milligrams each mmm much better much better mm-hmm all right strawberry is actually really good um I would say it's definitely pretty it is still has that herbal flavor but um let me bring up the criteria so we can actually start to break these down aftertaste yeah yeah really bad yeah I would say it's a bit odd I I'm almost feeling a little bit um disappointed I know me too it which it sucks because I'm such a fan of their oils but that's where comes in would we be as disappointed if we hadn't hyping it up so much yeah we did we we've also we've held on to these for about two weeks we've been waiting and waiting and waiting to try these specifically for the on camera experience and you know I think that also kind of built it up the fact that we've been we've been like dying sitting on me dying to try them the whole time and I mean they're they're good [ __ ] effects for sure by new user mm-hmm will probably like would probably really like it however its strong grams each heavy hitters recommends 10 milligrams as a dose the state of California recommends that california recommends that I personally have very low tolerance when it comes to most things so if you're like me I would definitely recommend starting with 5 milligrams when it comes to edibles but I mean you've been doing it you've been using medical using marijuana medically for two years yes so her tolerance is pretty high so we can handle the 30 we just say no problem but the big thing is though from let's let's go ahead and actually break this down but the main thing that I'm getting from these is but from trying both of them it is quite herbal forward the the flavor is there the strawberry is much sweeter and more flavorful I would say than the pineapple pineapple is a little more herbal forward as well but let's actually start talking about our rating categories here and give these are actually solid score each [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we're also gonna open this GSC previously known as Girl Scout cookies for those of you have been in the game a little longer and actually know the OG strings we're gonna be trying that card out today so anyways hope to catch you all later and see you in the next video like and subscribe [Music]", "UZUy5uWSpSA": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheat's the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary smokey out uh it's quite smoky out here in southern california not just southern california but all of the west coast uh so i thought you know what better day to finally review these smokies edibles than this smokiest of days also the name of the minor league baseball team uh where i grew up in east tennessee smoky mountains uh so as i said these are the smokey's edibles very handsome packaging picked these up in long beach california for 18 bucks which puts them at a slight premium for the gummy edibles that they carry that are 100 milligrams these are a 10 serving 10 milligram edible and it's got all the good stuff on the back your lab testing results your nutrition information all that wonderful stuff and as i said these are 100 milligrams of thc 10 per piece and they contain less than 2 milligrams of cbd per piece really handsome packaging here from smokies i think it's quite nice looking uh i i really appreciate it it's not super opulent or ostentatious or anything it's just a nice print i'm easily impressed that way so let's go ahead and open up these gluten free dairy free vegan no high fructose corn syrup fruit snacks and give them a try [Music] we've got our standard child proof packaging here not gonna fool me today ah and here we are here are our smokies uh these are the jamberry fruit chews i'm not really 100 sure what a jam berry is but let's give it a try uh and i will mention that i did have a little bit of fat uh just a few minutes before this just to take these under optimal conditions probably not necessary i do it jic so here is our first 10 milligram smokies edibles jamberry gummy [Music] i would jam with that berry all day wow that is really tasty vaguely yeah uh berryish berry medley flavor some strawberries some blackberry but uh great gummy i mean taste wise there is just a smidge of that wheat aftertaste um but not much not much at all uh in terms of gummy's taste these are on the better end these are like the uh the plus gummies if not even slightly better tasting [Music] it's hard to say it's good yum again there is just that little bit of weed after taste it's not a whole lot um certainly not gonna ruin it for me uh outside of that taste is really good but the most important thing about these slightly more expensive than usual smokies edibles is are they gonna get you high and for that we're gonna have to wait about two hours to find out for sure like all wheat's reviews i'm going to finish these eight now seven whoops smokey's here over the next probably hour so and then like all wheat's reviews two hours after that last smokies i'll come right back to you guys and let you know exactly how these things are hitting because that's the most important part of any edible review until then stay high stay healthy stay out of this smoke and we'll see you guys soon later [Music] welcome back to wheats everybody it has been two and a half hours since my first smokies edibles not quite so smokies in here uh but still pretty smokies in here i don't know what that means what i'm trying to say is these are damn good gummies i am uh very high right now um i think i would put this in the uh higher tier gummy snacks in terms of both taste and potency um these feel every bit of 100 milligrams if not slightly more so than some of the uh better gummies like your steezies and plus i mean look at my eyes i'm pretty high uh it could also just be that i just finished and what the [ __ ] let's just cherry on top it while we're here uh it could be that i just finished an episode episode four of lovecraft country on hbo max or hbo go or hbo whatever uh hbo noun or verb next to it holy [ __ ] what a good show i'm pretty sure i actually carried on topped the novel upon which it's based years ago years ago uh but now the tv shows out it's really good it's not a whole lot like the novel but that's not a bad thing but also is not a bad thing are these smokiest edibles they are a bit of a premium at 18 uh as opposed to these sort of more 15-ish dollars but they are damn damn good um both in terms of taste and potency and also uh tasting and uh tasting great and being quite strong love craft country on hbo but things i like quite a bit uh both things i look forward to enjoying again at some point in the future smokey's edibles thumbs up love craft country your random cherry on top no effort added but that doesn't take away from the quality at all just like smokies full circle thank you so much for watching weeds guys it has been a blast hanging out with you until our next review live stream whatever it is that you watch with us stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then love craft country", "zrL0wlu_H-E": "so i had some requests to do a delta 8 gummy review and i definitely was not opposed to that so i decided to try out the 3g brand because that's one of the most common brands of delta eight that i've come across and there's a bunch of pretty solid reviews on there so let's check it out now i actually had to buy this one i didn't get an offering to do it for free but whatever wasn't too bad they're currently 25 off right now so we have here the gummies i got the watermelon flavor they have watermelon or black raspberry i'm just going to give you a quick breakdown try it out come back later let you know what's going on so i got the larger pack there's 32 servings in here serving size is half a gummy i really want to take two but just for the sake of trying it out for the first time and giving you guys a solid review i'm just gonna try one just so i don't get blasted out of my mind because i did see some pretty interesting reviews that even one gummy would do the job for a while before i do that let me first read the back and try to reenact my initial reaction so i turn it around and then i see right here can take up to four hours what to feel full effects that's not really a good actor but i don't know i've seen some of the reviews say it's just been one hour until they feel the effects i highly doubt it's gonna take four hours i did eat some food before this the ingredients i'll post them up on the screen it's basically just a bunch of sugar and hemp extract this feels like one big gelatinous blob i don't even know how these will separate but let's see oh these smell really good they are pretty separated it looks like so it's not that big jello blob i thought it was so let me try one out wow ooh damn it tastes like that old school bubble yum watermelon or whatever the brand was called let me just read a couple of these reviews that i'm looking at on their website here because i'm not going to get too too in-depth with anything with that because you can check it out for yourself i'll link it in the description and probably post some screenshots here too so the first one that got me anonymous may 11th 2020 eat a handful and you will literally be tripping i doubt i'll be fully tripping but i don't know maybe a handful would uh you know definitely do something i don't want to quite need a handful yet maybe at a later date um just to you know cost effectiveness and everything let's see here anonymous may 11th they are tasty great consistency i wish they weren't out of stock all the time that's partially why i jumped on buying these because apparently they're out of stock a lot and for some reason my new phone is freezing when i'm going onto the site so whatever so overall taste is great i'll be back in a while hopefully not four hours and i'll let you know what's going on and then i'll probably based on what i'm feeling have another one so we'll see see you in a bit these are [ __ ] great it's about 6 30 p.m now i took the first one at i think it was around noon so i rode my bike down to the park i usually do this and it wasn't too cold out so i ended up for just a couple hours really a mix of working out stretching riding my bike whatever and then as this stuff continues to just you know kick in it was it was awesome so absolutely perfect especially if you if you've ever you know when you kind of just get in that groove of either working out or stretching or whatever and then everything just feels phenomenal and i just look like a weirdo doing all these weird stretches in the park and whatever so i'm back now i took a shower and like i said it's around 6 30. it definitely would i feel like this feeling would definitely just kind of last feel like it's leveled off and now it's kind of slowly calming down and i feel like this would last this still uh like the euphoric very nice just both uh both body high and then just mental high of just feeling just really nice really relaxed and it's fantastic so i'm sure the vast majority of you know exactly what i'm talking about so these are 100 worth it based on what the price is and then having 16 in here and mind you the serving size is one half gummy and i just took one full i would never suggest just going outside of the full dosage the first time you try it because everyone's tolerance is different but with that said i'm just gonna have one more and i'll be back tomorrow to let you know i assume it's just going to add on to the current effects spike them up again and whatever so i'm just going to enjoy the rest of my evening have this and i'll be back tomorrow morning and let you know what's up the next day wow i absolutely love these so the second gummy as the other one i said was kind of just wearing off after several hours the next one definitely i'd say started to kick in but is the way i experienced it is that that leveling off just kind of built up again and i went to sleep and say maybe around 11 o'clock and i was definitely feeling it for sure no signs of that slowing down or anything i slept great i woke up today i'm still pretty early i've been getting up pretty early even on the weekends and i noticed maybe the slightest bit of grogginess but it wasn't anything that you know made me sleep in for a long time or feel uh bad or impact me negatively or anything but all i contribute that to was just the fact that i had two of them and then the last one i think was around six or seven pm and uh yeah so it wasn't really even a bad thing at all i just wanted to mention that little aspect and that kind of occurred the first time i tried a delta 8 anyway after not having any sort of thc for several months but if you were looking for a gummy delta a thc whatever a good substitute to delta 9 thc and especially if you are trying to find something that's not smokable and edible this is a hundred percent awesome i love this and as with the other uh tinctures and everything but this one was very familiar to the erita hemp tincture that i still need to post a review on but maybe by the time you're watching this video that's already up so check that out but these were very intense very similar to even having a delta nine edible but it was still no sort of paranoia or anxiety or any anxiety or anything i know people mentioned the paranoia and anxiety can be a bit less on delta eight which is you know i find that to be true but even throughout years of smoking or eating whatever delta nine i feel like the anxiety and the paranoia that one can experience with that just in my experience just in my personal opinion it really all depends on your mindset beforehand because i've known that in times of my life when i was when i had much more much higher levels of anxiety in general and you know whether it be anxiety depression whatever other lifestyle factors things that have been going on in my life at the time that the majority of time that i would smoke pot or delta nine my anxiety levels chances are i would my anxiety level levels would go up exponentially when i would smoke until i'd have to actively just force myself to calm down really and just relax and enjoy it and then other times i would have it frequently and that did not occur at all so i feel like a lot of it has to do with your mindset but once again you know thc the endocannabinoid system and everything it's all going to be entirely different from person to person the way they feel the effects as is with these gummies or certain delta a cartridges or certain types of bud whatever the way i experience these gummies here could be totally different for you depending on where you're at in your life your own genetics a bunch of other things but me personally awesome so if you are into this type of stuff which you probably are if you're watching this video and you've been curious what these three chee gummies were like that's how they were for me so i'll put a link in the description below if you want to check out their main website i'm not affiliated with affiliated with them at all but hey if you want a business partner 3g let me know and i can help you out by you sending me more stuff and i can review it so that'll be it for the video if you like it any comments criticisms whatever leave that down below subscribe like all that stuff whatever and i'll be making some more videos that's it see you next time", "Z9jrHoPJb3k": "[Music] [ __ ] enemy how y'all feelin did they mention it today we don't be talking about some [ __ ] kind of nanos these are some edible gummies these shits or Varmus [ __ ] but before we get into that [ __ ] of course you know I gotta ask you where the [ __ ] is another [ __ ] guys please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always say it cuz always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that so you can get a notification anytime so don't forget the follow up [ __ ] over on Instagram this cannot underscore me cannot under [ __ ] score me alright so if you don't like the word [ __ ] mother pregnant you should probably go to another [ __ ] sample I'm gonna just tell you that [ __ ] right now alright so hitting my little uh my extreme cubing dad my weed man came through the other day I want to say you sailor sunday driver I'm not 100% sure but the shade is bomb and any other boy with a little ounce of shape for Christmas so that's dope what kind of lead man gives you Christmas yes what kind of nanos Matt he's [ __ ] right here I ain't gonna front they probably the dopest they're probably the dopest edibles in my opinion that I've had that's on the market that I've had sorry he's gonna need no booze on the market I'm saying it was on the market that's I've had okay so I really like them it's a hundred milligrams and the whole thing and it's five milligrams each dummy now a lot of [ __ ] be like oh 100 milligrams etting she got it had thousand milligrams if you got a thousand [ __ ] from the [ __ ] shop it probably wasn't a thousand milligrams I don't give a [ __ ] what you say or what you think it probably was not a thousand milligrams now some people can't take that [ __ ] don't get me wrong but most people can't because I've had a lot of people that has say a hundred that ain't [ __ ] I ain't got I'd do a thousand I'd do 500 and then they'll take like 10 or 15 of a real actual tested gummy and number uh gonna be [ __ ] up so I don't want to hear that [ __ ] so you know but don't get me wrong some people's tolerance is stronger than that [ __ ] you know cuz I also know that because my tolerance is like probably 40 54 where I like my high to be and if I wanted I could go 60 70 and still be like oh I wouldn't like out there but I could see people being over 100 but my point is you give them up like as a try on the dole singing it yo [ __ ] is to hide I think you need to take a month like a break if your tolerance is too goddamn much so anyway in Tunisia's ah let's see you got twenty gummies in here so I can say it's 100 milligrams one gummy is a serving and so you're looking at 23 servings in this [ __ ] no I'm sorry so many free calories per gummy okay when you're looking at the fat to zero fats about six grams of sugar and I mean six rounds of carbs and four grams of sugar so if you're on a keto diet this definitely is not the one for you and if you are vegan this is not for you or vegetarian this is not for you and the reason for that is because this does have gelatin in it which is weird though because the main ingredient is going to be agar but then they put gelatin in it so you could have just stopped with the agar instead of putting the gelatin in it and this is why I say this for companies that'll do this I give you when I come into the dispensary and they'll ask hey do you have any vegan gummies right that's understandable I've never remember you might have had a [ __ ] come in and say do you have non vegan gummies even make sense so the average person I'm talking probably 95 plus percent of people do not know the difference between a vegan gummy and when it comes to the taste so if I was a company I would just make all my [ __ ] vegan because it don't matter who will eat it because now it can get to anybody because no one's looking for the gelatin the market is not looking for the gelatin so I would just change that up if I was you [ __ ] because they have some that are vegan and those are good and there's no difference in the taste so to me they might as well just do all of them as vegan so I don't know why they only do a couple of women beginning some of them not but that's that so the other dope thing with this company is that they do them in sativa indica and hybrid so I like that because now you can get a little specific with your filling and your effects of [ __ ] and some companies stick to just doing this shit's hybrid which i think is it I think it makes sense because you know if the person walks up and that's the only gummy there some people would not [ __ ] with it if it's in the car and not [ __ ] wouldn't fit sativa but if it's hybrid they're like all right let's go [ __ ] it let me get it so I see the positives of that however the ones who are able to beast like specific admission I see there should fly off the shelves way quicker then a hybrid ones so this one right here is a cran a crammed pomegranate punch weird [ __ ] I don't know but it did taste good and the other cool thing with this is that it's enhanced nano molecular technology that they put in here in gummies and what man no molecular means whoa I don't even understand how that makes it react faster because it makes it react faster but what that means is that's just like a way of like I guess you could say measuring like how the speed of your molecules changing inside of your body so I think what's happening here is that they've sped up the process somehow of making the molecules in your body change for you to feel that humming um it's scented at two hour waiting game these [ __ ] is like probably 20-30 minutes if that like I got to give it to a one what was it last weekend for some reason I couldn't sleep welcome to 1:30 was up like a [ __ ] and I had to go rock climbing at like 10 o'clock or so I was tired as [ __ ] didn't want to go because I hadn't had any sleep whatsoever so I took ten milligrams of this [ __ ] and this [ __ ] was like a six hour energy drink like it was dope it really worked there was no crash I was like goddamn that [ __ ] is pretty bomb and so I like that versus that two hours you don't know when is gonna kick in type of filling cuz I've had that [ __ ] happen before once and some edibles cup but god I took the [ __ ] because it took so long for dumb [ __ ] to kick in I'm sitting there and I'm like mm-hmm hey y'all see that leprechaun run by look how things are turning out of nowhere you forgot you took some [ __ ] so uh I like these because they react a lot quicker so I definitely say give these shits a try now let me show you what they look like they like in little coin shapes and they are gluten free for all you gluten-free [ __ ] out there so it's a little sugar sprinkles on top of it mm-hmm so I'm fine and taste of them are really good no no she was bomb man actually there's really really good so it says that the candies Awards I never saw this really the winner most accurate formulated edible I guess that you mean it's pretty consistent and what they're doing in it I guess it's on mark of what is supposed to but yeah I got a really say my Anisha it's a pretty dope and another thing is some people don't like it we on 5 milligrams per they like oh how come I can't get nothing stronger it's still a hundred milligrams in the package whether I gave you 10 10 milligrams or 25 milligrams it's still the same [ __ ] amount and I personally like when they can chop it down like that because first of all some of these gummies are just good goddammit and I like that [ __ ] so I like to be able to eat more than one and that's one thing the other thing is you have more control over your dosing so let's say you want to go 25 instead of going 20 or 30 like 20 is not enough but 30 is too much so you just want to be at 25 I ain't the one for biting the [ __ ] in half and then putting that [ __ ] back you got me [ __ ] up I don't think that smart I don't think that's a sanitary I think this is like a nasty bout [ __ ] you put that [ __ ] back into the bag with the rest of my fingers now you'll slime it and touch the other ones he you nasty so for me I like to go put five milligrams and so I can like micro dose my [ __ ] and I can have more than one I will say this does give you a little bit of after cannabis he tastes but who gives a [ __ ] it's [ __ ] candidates like I hate when people be whining over to flavor like my Adeline fat and in my mind I'm like I would like to taste the vodka but I'll still take a shot I know you know like oh I just love that case well you say you like the taste of survive that is because it was smoother than the dog [ __ ] you started on back in the day so get the [ __ ] out here so you don't get a little cannabis taste just you know manna lemon woman up and grab you chronic leaves and [ __ ] take the tents guys damn it but even with that being said it's really just a good good gummy but you do get a little bit aftertaste a little bit weak but anyway so definitely I say [ __ ] these if you find these [ __ ] I say get them I'm gonna ask the the company when I see them why they don't just do it all it just you know Eggar and just make them all plant based versus doing the gelatin I say this ain't no like oh go on and be vegan and about that this is literally just to me from a company standpoint it'd be like if I was only in the company I would just make it where I know everybody can get it but I wouldn't even promote them as being safe vegan I would just put them out on the shelf and let them be what they are so that would be me if I was the one doing it but anyway that's the end of this video I hope you guys enjoyed it like I say have you seen these [ __ ] make sure you get them and before you get out of here make sure you subscribe and hit that peace you can get that [ __ ] notification alright and go follow me over on Instagram so anyway I'm out of this [ __ ] y'all keep the love going y'all love each other y'all keep the peace going and be peaceful too each other and I would see our [ __ ] a [ __ ] slated piece the one I want to hit the sequel we in the jungle smokin we in a jungle smokin", "ObGf_ricrcQ": "[Music] hello everyone welcome two weeks the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary guys it's really hot and because it's so hot we're gonna do ourselves a hot review I don't actually know what that means I just thought I would say it what we are gonna do is we're gonna do a follow up review on plus gummies the ever-present ubiquitous plus gummies see them everywhere here in Southern California this is the uplift sour watermelon flavor I reviewed them about a year ago I think they're blue raspberry flavor liked it quite a bit on found them to be very pleasant tasting and to be quite potent but in that year they have grown and grown and grow and I see billboards for them everywhere and it is sometimes true in this industry where a company will get really big really quickly and in their quality starts to drop so I decided to go and take a second look at Plus here a year later see if I like it just as much as I did at the beginning especially with their brand is expanding I think they're doing mints now so let's just without any further adieu here go ahead and take a look at these plus uplift sour watermelon gummies so I actually went ahead and took off the plastic wrap because I knew I was gonna have trouble with it but I have not opened it yet I can actually smell them they smell very very pungent not weedy just very fruity that watermelons scent is quite strong okay so I've got it unscrewed there there are the gummies hope you can see them there don't want to pour them out that is 25 milligrams sour watermelon gummies plus gummies five milligrams each and I will be eating all 20 of these probably over the next 30 40 minutes or so unlike all our weeks reviews I'll come back to you guys two hours after they consume the last one unless you know exactly what I thought of the whole product how I got all that good stuff so plus is pretty affordable they routinely sell for about 20 bucks which is what I picked these up for any legal dispensary in Long Beach which is on the low end of the hundred milligram edibles so that's a good thing you always like your edibles to be affordable and I remember them tasting great as well so here we go very gelatinous very very soft gummy mmm wow that is a cute that's really good sorry guys my dog is gonna go crazy if I don't do this um that's as good as I remember the blue raspberry except not really because no flavor is better than blue raspberry there is a little bit of a weedy aftertaste now just a little bit but that first hit is a great great little gummy snacks if it weren't for the weedy aftertaste I would have no problem eating these sour watermelon gummies just pop them right in speaking of which let's do a couple more of them here now they got sandy fingers oh yeah now that punch mmm sandy gummies okay well so far looking really good impressions are super positive on these but we've done nothing important all I've done is a taste test and told you how much they cost what's important is two hours after I eat this last one am I gonna be pretty [ __ ] high I hope so I think you probably hope so so I will be sure to let you guys know I'm really excited to find out if they're as good as they were before so stay tuned right here and I'll see you guys back here in just a moment ciao dogs three and a half hours actually since I had my first plus gummy and spaced them out over about an hour or so and I am pleased to tell you that these three three and a half hours later I am still pretty buzzed these are as good as I remember they even taste a little better than I remember and I remember them tasting good the only thing is they have a slight weed aftertaste but in comparison to most gummy edibles it's it's they're delicious 20 bucks low end of a hundred milligram edible costs here in Southern California so a great deal and they're potent I mean these are on me you know these are as strong as any other gummy at the 100 milligram level and they just happen to taste a little bit better and a little bit cheaper so I I guess they I am pretty happy with my plus there wish I had some more to be honest um so yeah a big thumbs up still for Plus look forward to reviewing some more of their stuff now that I know they're branching out in those mints and all that other kind of stuff if they're half as good as their gummies I'll be uh I hope I'll be just as pleased uh well guys that's gonna do it for this review then that was the plus up lift sour watermelon gummies they tasted good to me big big thumbs up and before I go here guys I'm gonna give you a little cherry on top something that Yuka you kiddin you know enjoy with or without weed just to uh you know a little recommendation for you so this week I'm gonna recommend the thing that has been overtaking my life in the past two weeks and the Fire Emblem three houses is that the name of it on switch it's pretty pathetic I don't know it because I've been I have played maybe 60 hours in about two weeks which for me is pretty obscene but I am absolutely loving it if you don't know anything about it it's basically the strategy game blended with a sort of Harry Potter ish kind of skin and it's great if you like any kind of strategy RPG game you have a switch Fire Emblem three houses get yourself hooked it's crack and that guys is gonna then do it for the cherry on top which is then going to do it for this review and what's gonna do for everything so to recap + uplift super good Fire Emblem three houses maybe even better alright guys thanks so much for watching and we will see you all on the next review goodbye", "D--AfKOBJB0": "[Music] what up y'all that [ __ ] came to me how y'all feeling today man [ __ ] today we gonna do a little review about these Smokies so I got a little edibles something for you but before we get into that [ __ ] of course you know I gotta ask you [ __ ] the [ __ ] please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always say cuz always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that thing so you can get a notification anytime I post some [ __ ] if you dig in the turfy shirt go over to counter me calm yourselves terpene shirts can survive 10 11 12 13 14 maybe it's a minim [ __ ] man I got some new designs actually that I'm working on so it's gonna be some new [ __ ] coming in I'd say probably Annabelle maybe give it two weeks three max but I got some new designs on [ __ ] with so I'm gonna get that [ __ ] done so uh anyway man Smokey's I it's a pretty good edible from what I've heard I don't think I've ever had these and if I did I might have had a sample but I don't think I've had any of these to be honest with you man but people come in I got this one cat he'll come in and he'll get no joke like 20 of them were some [ __ ] he gets like a [ __ ] ton of them and a lot of like older people like them a lot of ladies like them but also here a lot of dudes like man um motherfuckas tastes good you [ __ ] around and eat all of them so I think that's a pretty cool thing the flavor I have right here is the blue raspberry so it's more of a fruit chew versus gummies and the reason this is a fruit chew I think it's because it's vegan so it's kind of hard to get like vegan things to be like gummies so usually they'll use like a agar powder or something like that I'm not sure what this one used sugar and corn syrup though they use pectin okay yeah so it but it's hard to get it to be like more gummy so it's more so of a chewy type thing so still good though you know and they also use a distillate in it for their infusion this one is actually I think there's a slough pack if I'm mountains yep Wow pack this one is a lau pack so they get their flower for the distillate from from lau pack Smokies has like different I guess they're sponsored by different peanut sponsor but they're flour is produced by different companies depending located so they have California they have Oregon I think Washington and I think Oklahoma working yeah so I think it's like Oregon Oklahoma Washington and Cali I have a Sam in Cali so I got the Lao backward it's only 20 milligrams I'm 20 milligrams the 20 calories per [ __ ] gummy ten milligrams per gummy 100 milligrams and the whole goddamn package so I guess that's pretty much it man I mean that's the most we could say I heard that they use real fruit with it it says natural and artificial flavoring so you know not sure what all that means like I say they're gluten I mean they're vegan and they're gluten-free and I believe that's it let's open it up hopefully if he's ain't all melted to get okay man oh that is been in my closet so hoping these [ __ ] like me just one big mesh or mesh ball all right so circular about the size of a quarter roughly so [ __ ] man they also be having like sour flavors and stuff like that but this is just a normal Flav so let's make this [ __ ] happen dude it's to ten milligrams of THC and two milligrams of CBD per serving we got to talk about the CVD so anyway man that's it bottoms up [ __ ] and [ __ ] gets [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah I can see why comes our bomb honestly these are probably the best companies I've had that are infused I doesn't think these AVX gummies that I had before was probably the best or now the Kaunas is pretty good with these [ __ ] right here hang on front these guys are vomits [ __ ] dude yeah these it is it they get these right to it don't you just disintegrating you know in your mouth yes it is like it's digging it is chili he did they think these things are bomb Victor's life is normal but again you need the plug around to eat the whole bag of these [ __ ] yeah man so mm-hmm this isn't good now someone asked me how come I don't do like how I feel on them and how effective they are and things of that sort there's a few reasons why I do that and I think I've explained it on a video but I'll explain it on this one too the reason I don't do that is because eight how high I get has zero to [ __ ] do with you hi our tolerance is different so I could say oh I took 30 milligrams and I didn't feel anything you could take 30 milligrams and be on the [ __ ] moon right I could [ __ ] around and take 40 milligrams be like man I'm high as [ __ ] you can take 40 milligrams and that fella goddamn thing everybody's tolerance is different so it's to me it's a waste of time to sit here and come back two hours later and be set my camera back up boy okay that's how I feel because everybody's high is gonna be different I just think that's like a big [ __ ] waste of time as far as I'm concerned and then also I don't think it's fair to the company like let's say I hit I eat something and I'm like I didn't really feel anything from it but yet I've been smoking weed all day or something like that and then I said I didn't feel nothing I mean you [ __ ] don't go [ __ ] with them all over I just had too much weed that day and it didn't affect me so I don't like [ __ ] what other people's companies and taking money out they Pike it over [ __ ] like that so that's why I don't do that if it was a shitty tasting gummy I just wouldn't do the review like I wouldn't release it like that was my first time eating that [ __ ] is good but if it tasted like dog [ __ ] and feet I just wouldn't [ __ ] release the video but honestly that should have actually really really bombed so I definitely say if you can find some Smokies go look for that [ __ ] of your own one of those four states I mentioned Cali Oklahoma Washington and Oregon definitely go get them shits them shits a really really dope you can check them out on a website and share the things just Smokies calm and the Smokies would Izzie so it's not a half Smokies so I'd definitely go check them shits out man but I got to give it to him the [ __ ] badass so uh this weekend I'm gonna pop like four or five it [ __ ] and see how they do but I yeah man [ __ ] I got a lot of cool [ __ ] coming I got a gravity bar i'ma show you [ __ ] a [ __ ] so I'm just getting some [ __ ] together with that but I got some cool [ __ ] I got some hash then I picked up man I got a lot of different [ __ ] that I got now I got iced up with all kind of different things so of course I'm gonna show you share that with y'all so anyway man that's the end of this video y'all make sure that y'all love each other keep the love going be peaceful to each other keep the peace go on go over to Canada mink on get yourself some terpenes shirts that i'ma holla let you [ __ ] a [ __ ] ass later I'm out this [ __ ] peace [Music] we in a jungle smoking legal", "oONRHdBHFfY": "hey love Sistani here and today I'm going to be talking to you guys about a new company that I was recently introduced to and all about how it helped me relax more so this company is called diamond CBD and you know a CBD is and you already know what I'm about to talk about my basically CBD is a what is it it's a component that's found in green and that's the component that makes you actually relax and feel better that's than what's actually helping a lot of people with their illnesses and pains and all that stuff so this company actually just done the work to actually take the CBD out of lead and separate it and put it into different products and all of that so you can actually they have a variety of products so depending on what you prefer you can get whatever so I got this candy cuz I'm obsessed with it means like I don't know why lately I'm in love with these rainbow gummy so not even gonna lie to you guys when I first saw this company I thought it was leave like we'd have just food food and I was like don't do drugs I don't know how that's gonna work but but that company like they explained it to me and then they have a video on the front of their site that actually explains all of this so you do not make you high they don't get you high at all you're not going to be like tripping or anything like that they literally just make you relax and feel more I don't know like say you have back pain like I normally no back pain it helped with that if you have issues sleeping if you have just a problem like with anxiety whatever and you just need to be relaxed this is for you it also helps with a bunch of other things okay so you do need to be 21 to use this or to purchase this and so on the front when I got this package I actually did not review this bottom part here I just saw this and then I went straight to the back because I started reading you know the serving size and it said four pieces so I'm like eating eating and I ate three pieces right to eat my fourth and then I see on the front and it says do not exceed more than one to two pieces every six hours so I took three like I said and I'm a small person I'm only buckling and I don't weigh that much like I'm pretty small so I took that and I promise you like the rest of the day and then it was just around around like maybe four or five o'clock for the rest of the day like all the way through the night I was like I don't know I felt so tired and I don't think these are supposed to make me feel sleepy but that's just how I react to a lot of things in general like whether it's alcohol and I've never really I've never done weed so I didn't know that this is how I would react but I just got really sleepy you know supposed to get sleepy per say but and it's got really sleepy like it helps you sleep better but that means that like your body will relax it doesn't make you like sleepy it's not a sleep aid so you're supposed to be able to take these any time of day so I got really really sleepy I wanted took a nap and then just the rest of the night I was like really tired and drowsy but the next day I took the regular dose I just took one piece of candy it's like just to help me relax before bed or whatever and I didn't really feel any more tired because of it but it definitely did help with my back pain and it helped me relax so I will definitely say these work like these are like probably one of my new favorite things because it's natural one and it's just it's just a good alternative to taking pain medication all the time and all of that now I do wish the serving size is a bit more because I like eating candy but I just I just probably need to get it in another form other than candy so they told me they have it they have drops that you can put in stuff they have well so they have they have it in other foods they have they have a bunch of options you just have to go to their website and see and then you can use that to make whatever you want and put it in whatever food or you can take it directly under your tongue whatever you wanna do now these in here it says the serving like if we're going based on what the back says it says serving it's four pieces so there's about two servings in here so if we're going based on the front and there's about four to five start rings in here so I think it's that's great these cost 15 dollars that's before shipping and these cost 15 dollars this back and they have variety of products all different prices if I if you're saying like I can get like maybe five pieces out of this that's pretty good that's actually pretty good and I would definitely get this again I'm probably going to get this again because like I said I do have back issues like I'm spine and stuff and so it did actually help with that a lot I recently got a desktop computer so the flora would often work off my laptop and so I got my desktop and so a lot of times I have to use it because a storage is better and all of that I have to use it sitting at my desk and that is always been an issue for me for years and years and years because I've you know even in high school I was home-schooled and so working at home you know doing my schoolwork I'd have to sit up and then at my desk and all of that it just always been an issue because my back hurts so I prefer to work from my bed if I have to do like you know stuff on my laptop or whatever because it's more comfortable and I can prop up a pillow and all that but yeah so sitting at my desk often time really hurts my back and I don't enjoy it at all like I will do everything I can so that I don't have to work at my desk because it's not the most enjoyable for me but this definitely helps I don't know if I should be taking it every day so I'm not gonna do that but I think it's safe like to you know do it every day it's not gonna be addictive or anything like that but yeah I'm probably gonna use it again and I would suggest that you guys check them out gonna link your website in my description box this is like a really cool product that very happy I was introduced to so make sure you check it out if you have not already make sure you subscribe to my channel and also in the comments let me know have you ever tried CBD not weed not just not weed if you've smoked weed that's great for you but like if you've ever tried CBD by itself let me know and let me know if it works for you and do not forget to check them out alright I will see you guys in my next video bye [Music]", "zoshAm3-szc": "good afternoon everyone as you know I have the best superintendent in the entire United States with me today Jacqui bird and we're here together once again to talk about the great response from the school board and what happened because 12-year olds did things that they shouldn't have done and here's what it amounts to yep this is marijuana it's gummies it comes in a block it's about a hundred milligram block and this hundred milligram block is supposed to be torn in two Tim individual doses of THC laced gummies now once again I'm not gonna elaborate on the fact that I warned all of this was coming these gummies are produced in California and they're sold online and Leviticus Jones who's 12 years old came into possession of this package of gummies which is about so big Leviticus has told us a couple of different stories about how he can't became involved with possessing this but be that as it may we're working with him his parents are totally cooperating and understand the gravity of the situation so Leviticus comes to school today claiming that he got these this gummy that he tore in two pieces from someone else on a school bus that's still to be determined during second period which is gym class he presented this to a total of six other children in seventh grade I'm told that there were two boys 12 years of age and four girls of the six of them that received a piece of this gummy five of them were transported to the hospital because of an overdose it's easy to figure out six kids a hundred milligram bar that should be into ten separate doses of legal use in California of THC is now distributed the ten dosage between six children we rush them to the hospital with EMS where that are being treated the last child was taken by her parents to the hospital Leviticus will be charged with one count of possession of THC our marijuana resin six counts of distribution of THC within a thousand foot of a school and possession of paraphernalia so it would be seven felony charges and a misdemeanor charge we're fortunate in that the children are all gonna make a great recovery you're going to be all right there's no long term injury or illness here as we understand but obviously we're concerned we're concerned as to one how did a 12 year old ever come to be in possession of this drug this illegal drug in the state of Florida and - why did he offer it to these six kids which quite frankly with the exception of one little corner have apparently devoured this bar they're in gym class so the investigation goes on at this time and we will report the results of that to you let me turn it over to our superintendent and she will give you details about what they did and I just want to brag on the school system their response was remarkable to this emergency whenever it manifested itself at about ten o'clock this morning superintendent Burton Thank You sheriff good afternoon everyone you know again I applaud the staff for what they did when they learned of something happening well students they responded immediately they went by classrooms to check on children they went by and they made sure that they got the children and make sure they make contact and contact it the EM has to come out and take those children to the hospital for you know to make sure they are safe and to make sure they're going to be okay they're all okay but you know the sad part of this is again we could have been here with a different outcome if someone did not respond so I applaud the staff for what they did they follow through with the procedures and the protocols that we have in place and making sure we keep our children safe what I want to say to our parents is that everyone at school today is still safe they'll be safe again tomorrow they're gonna be safe throughout because we do have procedures in place to keep children safe but parents I ask you please talk to your children please make sure we're looking at their online social media if they're buying and purchasing see what it is and then parents talk to your children say if someone is offering you something something that's going on at school that's not normal please let them talk to you and notify us immediately notify the sheriff's office immediately if there's something wrong we want to make sure that everyone is safe when they come to school each and every day so again I applaud not only just our school staff I applaud the Sheriff's Office for making sure that they follow through and making sure that they do what they need to do to protect our children the sheriff and I have a partnership and we have a commitment to keeping our campuses and our children safe at all times you know I can't I don't know the exact symptoms because when they heard about it they they actually went to got the children and they had them transported you know so I don't know the exact symptoms or what they're you know exhibiting at that time because they responded very quickly when they learned of it this is the first time that I'm aware of right now that they can consumed it yes it is legal in California for adults it is not legal it is not legal in the state of Florida in in any way so any possession of this is illegal in the state of Florida and as to their symptoms they had stomachaches they were nauseous dizzy one of them was all but passed out and took obviously way more than the recommended illegal dose by the way fine I'm surprised that I'm finding myself have to talk like that but the bottom line is it's all illegal in Florida and even in California it's illegal for a child habit but when you can go online you know Green Hornet's becomes something that'll sting you and it stung all those kids today I know that Leviticus has it I don't know that he bought it online he's told us at least two different stories of how he came to possess it and we are working through that now so excuse me his parents were totally cooperating with us but obviously they will be working with us on the investigation we're focused on Leviticus at this time we don't have any indication that his parents contributed to this if we determine that then obviously there would be other criminal charges but we don't see that at this time in the investigation his parents have been forthright totally cooperative they they are concerned not only that Leviticus did this but that he exposed these other children so they're concerned about the other children as well and according to Leviticus he didn't take any of this the other kids did but he said he didn't so it's uh it's frightening and fortunately for us it was not some other drug that was more dangerous in small doses than the was even though this was toxic to them in the amounts that they took the other kids have eaten the evidence so to speak so in the in the technical term you could draw blood and then there would be misdemeanor possession but no we're not going to charge the other children they will be dealt with appropriately by their parents and the school system under discipline conduct rules there Leviticus right now is the one we're focusing on but if someone else provided this to Leviticus we want to know because ultimately he's 12 years old so if a 20 year old gave it to Leviticus then our focus is the 20 year old but we've got to work through that during this investigation six six kids and Leviticus is seven okay one child went with her mother five went to the hospital we've not found the one child so we don't know whether or not that child consumed but we're told antidotal II that they did but we've not confirmed that yet Leviticus says he didn't take in at least five for sure maybe the sixth one who we've not talked to we know we know five consumed we suspect the six one consumed five went to the hospital by EMS one written with the parents for six and Leviticus says I provided it ask them if they wanted some and they all tore pieces of the bar off and consumed it and Leviticus is facing seven felony charges in a misdemeanor okay anything else", "Qedwsn3DSWs": "hey you guys welcome back to my channel um today is thanksgiving happy thanksgiving i wanted to post this video really quick today uh i'm doing a review on these edibles you guys so this is gonna be a first impression one the other one that i tried was the pink lemonade indica uh gummies from them and i did not like the taste of it it was freaking gross i just felt like the lemon with like the wheat taste did not really it just it was really like bitter so i did not like it so hopefully these ones are better i'm hoping but i'm not gonna lie they still hit like these are definitely really potent i did 50 like in one setting so i took five of these they're each 10 milligrams uh per piece and then it's 100 milligrams thc in there um there are 23 calories per dummy and then they have 2.9 grams of sugar 0.4 grams of protein and 4 milligrams of sodium and then zero cholesterol zero fat no yeah total fat is zero and then saturated fat is zero so i guess that's good um basically the ingredients in here is just like the basic or whatever you know they're not vegan or anything they do have vegan gummies uh from this line uh they're like their nano line but um it's not the one i got i got these ones they were on sale i wanted to try them so yeah and they did smack so i'm gonna open these and we're gonna try them out together [Applause] you guys i'm having such a hard time i don't want to cut them because of the scissors so okay i think we got it i think so stop my dog is like what is this their bag is like hella child proof because i can never get these open like so this is like my thing i just kind of spread it and it always works so okay let's see they smell like mango they definitely smell more sweet it's like orange in the inside let me show you what they look like a piece they're kind of like small they're like small and like kind of like thick thick and they're kind of thick but like they're small and they're coated in sugar and everything this smells like lemon but i don't know how they're going to taste i'm kind of scared but let's try them so this is 10 we're gonna do five and then i will come back and show you guys how high i get in like it says 90 minutes i feel like for me it takes a little bit longer than 90 minutes i don't know why i feel like to hit me a little bit later than that and i'm like [ __ ] stuck so here it goes [Music] [Music] these ones are definitely less bitter than the pink lemonade ones those ones are way more bitter and this one still has a little bit of that aftertaste that you get with edibles so they do have that i feel like the ones other ones that i tried were the smoky ones and they didn't have that bad of like the taste after but it's not terrible but it is there a little bit i know with some you don't really taste them at all so it just really depends so yeah these are the indica ones and they're mango i was kind of excited for these but now that i kind of had them already they're like i wouldn't try this flavor i think i would try something else like a different flavor but [Applause] i just feel like they're not like the best i mean they're good they're potent definitely so i guess that spectrum of it does work out but as far as the taste goes i would give them like a probably like an eight or something like that seven like a seven and a half so i'm gonna have four of these i'm gonna eat one more on camera but i don't think you want to see me eat edibles i mean i guess but i'm just it feels like i'm chewing forever so i'm gonna eat these off camera and then i'll see you guys once i feel the effects and then i will let you guys know how i feel i'm gonna get pretty high i mean i already know this it's already gonna happen so but i will see you guys in a bit br b okay guys i feel like i was kind of bashing the taste with these they're not that bad um but i feel like i still like my smokies edibles a little bit better as far as that weed taste goes that aftertaste is kind of like i guess when you drink some water it'll go away but it's a little much so this is my number three i had the first one on camera i had the second one off camera and i'm gonna have this one with you guys because [Music] like that's the thing with edibles like i just do not like that aftertaste you know like i don't know i kind of feel like this is bad lighting but you guys it is i was gonna film in my car right and then i was gonna film in the living room but i kind of have company over so um i don't wanna do that and then i'm in my room now but and then outside it's so super windy and then in my car i don't really want to sit in my car because honestly i just i don't know i wanted to change it up so i was just like let me just go in my room let me just sit down it's warm because it's super windy outside right now so i just oh my god sorry i got interrupted so these so this is to be my third one and yeah i just decided to do it inside because it's super cold and everything and i just i don't want to be outside it's so windy today like i don't know why it's so windy but it's windy it's gonna be windy all day today so whatever so this is number three down the hatch once they're good in the beginning and the aftertaste comes they're like super gummy like they definitely don't like just disappear like you do have to chew them down i feel like some gummies they just kind of like gone so they're more of like a chewy gummy i like them i don't hate them so i guess i've already had all of them no yeah cause there's six four five six so this is number four because i was like wait i what but no i have one more to eat after this one so there's six left in here i've already done 40 milligrams and this is my last one i'm so happy i love to get to the last edible if i don't really enjoy it i feel like it wasn't that bad i would definitely rate these for the price point and everything um i got them for like i think 15 and then i got them like on like a special promotion deal on edibles so it was like 13 but with tax it was still like 15 16 so for the price the regular price i think for them is like 20. so for the price um would i get them again probably not i would probably get the other ones that i enjoy more but they're not bad they're definitely not like horrible or anything i just feel like that aftertaste is kind of strong it was really strong with the pink lemonade ones for sure but with these ones it wasn't as bad so i feel like i just gotta try maybe different flavors and i will enjoy it a little bit more so i don't hate the guys i really don't but i definitely feel like there's better out there but they're not horrible they're definitely i would give them like a nine no seven to eight eight and a half kind of thing so i was", "x6BgfrYZ7sI": "this is 420 Ohio's medical marijuana product reviews Juanes our

terms of flavor the name says it all these gummies are juicy bursting with strawberry sweetness and a tart lemon flavor that's just right I wasn't wincing or pinching my lips while chewing on this gummy like I might with other sour candies if you're looking for that experience though I'd suggest mixing this gummy with some sour patch kids medicinally wanna sour gummies provide a one-to-one ratio of THC and CBD per gummy this translates to a medicinal experience that's both mildly euphoric and relaxing used a few hours before bed this gummy is excellent for distressing after a tough day it's also great for inflammation relief rest and sleep euphoria creeps up with this one building to a crescendo about an hour or two after eating the edible I could initially feel a slight headband

you know what that means it means we are taking a look at another gummy that's right we are breaking the cardinal rule here on weeds don't be a dude don't be a dummy and buy a gummy we are taking a look at a very very popular gummy brand may be the second most popular gummy brand behind cushy punch and that is the gummy brand from Chiba choose themselves Green Hornet I had a lot of people asked me to review the Green Hornet's and we're finally gonna be doing it this is their 100 milligram indica variety love everything on the back it's got all the stuff you want to see the batch number from the lab testing nutrition information all that good stuff ingredients it's all they're so good on them for putting all the information on their Bravo to you Chiba chews now if you've seen my reviews in the past you know my Chiba chews I'm really feeling them to be sending my world on fire I found them to be good but not great more okay however I picked this one up for a very affordable price just 10 bucks for a hundred milligram edible which is a pretty good deal so it's a little bit cheaper than most of the Chiba juice and so I'm I'm more excited about this one and I'm an indica fan so let's uh let's give it a go I do have the uh oh looks like my dogs have come back from a walk welcome dogs welcome dogs low hello hello goodbye dogs farewell dogs sorry about that guys so yes back to the Green Hornet really excited about this one because it was more affordable and I've heard a lot of good things about the Green Hornet's now if you know as you know I'm not a big gummy fan really only flourish and tiki killers the only gummies that I've really really loved and cushy punches I find to be OH a so Green Hornet is fighting an uphill battle there but let's give them the benefit of the doubt open this bad boy up and give it a taste so if you've never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work it's very very simple I'm gonna eat this whole thing and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so uh it tells us to cut the gummy into ten ten milligram servings there's it's little cut guide where of course not gonna be doing that I guess that's how they're gonna get compliant with the new regs whatever so here is the gummy The Green Hornet fruit punch flavored and again I picked this up for only ten bucks at my dispensary which is a very good price for these Green Hornet's so let's let's break off half here and give it a taste I forgot my I brought my Nutella to have some fat whoo wow that is woo that has a heavy heavy heavy cannabis taste but that is encouraging hopefully that means it's going to be as potent as advertised and seeing this lab tested results in the back gives me faith so let's add a little bit of chocolate to it here just to give ourselves the best chance of making sure we can get high mmm that Nutella makes that a lot easier to go down alright guys well that's gonna do it for this first half of this review for the second half and the most important part will it get me high I'll come back to you guys in two hours or for you just a couple of seconds through the magic of editing so I will see you guys in just a bit to let you know peace [Music] help I've been stung by a Green Hornet welcome back to wheat skies it's been two hours since I've had that Green Hornet and it's pretty good it's up there with good gummies like flourish I actually like it better than Sheba chews period I think it got me where I want to be some pink there I'd say I'm at a seven and a half somewhere in there not to put too fine a point on it uh yeah I I like The Green Hornet quite a bit uh the indica variety at least is muy bueno uh muy bueno bueno bueno way down yeah I'm really pleased with it pleasantly surprised I like it better than any of the other cheapo cheese I've tried so far a really a nice little edible nice discreet package it tasted like barf but that's to be expected for something that's so small and so potent so I don't really hold out it against it but it does taste terrible so if you're really sensitive as a taste no this one is this one's got a pretty intense weed flavor but on the whole if you can get it as cheap as I got it because I got it for ten bucks but I sometimes see these go as highs like seventeen or higher maybe I don't know the that's why I don't really screw that she would choose that much is there crazy expensive but if you can find this for around that price it's uh I'd say it's worth it I really had a good time with this one that's the Chiba choose Green Hornet's a fruit punch flavored one hundred milligrams indica give it a shot if you see the dispensary near you and before I go guys I want to share with you a little cherry on top something a little extra something that's not reviewing weed just something I like in my life that I want to share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related and on this review my little cherry on top is let's give it up for the air pod I hope there's not too much earwax on that because that'd be really embarrassing the air pods they're really good I hope I'm saying that right air pods that's the name of them the names dumb but they're actually really incredible little wireless headphones earphones I had a pair of Plantronics wireless over-the-air ones noise cancelling ones that I had for two years that I adored and have been using the air pods on and off for a while and and really come to appreciate them and they're discreteness in their ease of use and the just pull it out pauses the music all that good stuff really enjoy it if you have an Apple product if you have an Apple phone give the air prodigious shot if you haven't already I know they seem a little expensive but I think they're worth the the the Apple tax in this case so guys that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats that's gonna be a thumbs up for the Green Hornet thank you so much for sticking around at the very end of this review guys and we will catch you on the next one peace", "4AIAdjvu4N4":

video so the last video got cut off because of me being stupid and putting this too close and then it didn't or the camera being stupid cuz it didn't focus back in on our pretty faces so it's actually the cameras fault not my fault but anyway so we're just hi I decided to do it in like better lighting and redo it a little bit so you can see it all better see our faces better but this is the Smoky's blackberry I found out that loud pack it's only made with loud pack in California if it's an Oregon or like some other places made with some other distributor so depending where you live changes who makes it kind of so I don't know that makes me wonder if it's like different quality do you want to rip it open do you want to do the honors that's terrible yeah they're like make it okay purplish I know I like it never goes back again thank you how many we having - okay this time we're gonna update all three you're gonna have for for which is it's a little of 40 milligrams 40 milligrams and then we'll update we're about to watch Hellraiser and then clean our cars so we're gonna clean our cars and watch how rays and we'll update you through the process but uh cheers guys [Music] they're so nice just even as a regular candies I'd eat them like even if these how many day - right they do kind of look like morning regatta maybe I'm having 80 milligrams you sure 80 calories are you sure you way late to film yeah I'm sure eighty calories of glycerin of corn syrup of corn syrup and dextrose do you think that's really good tell me ladies cool see what happens now let's go watch Hellraiser are we gonna duck couldn't cursors oh yeah well it's still light out painter cars I've been probably update turning Hellraiser update so it's been about what an hour-ish maybe about two hours two hours yeah how's the edible feel I feel productive I know I felt pretty like lit but productive I feel like so we cleaned the car and we cleaned the car we clean the living room we clean the bathroom I clean the player with the girl we went to eat well yeah but that was earlier by like since we took the edible and now we're about smoke but yeah I feel like pretty productive not tired like though so we're gonna smoke and anyway yeah we're probably gonna update after we watch how we raise or something so far so good so beautiful baby [Music] long as it then three hours I'd say it's been pretty productive three hours I made some dink so meal it's oatmeal art and inside this peanut butter and doing stuff and it's like layered but the outside is that they just look like candy Cantonese - yeah they do the packaging gon point that tastes at some point like if you saw this on the counter you know these yeah take these oh we should take these to the movies 30 milligrams does the temper better [Music] what would you recommend this oh yeah for sure ten Blake a lot of scale to one detail [Music] recommending this like never or would you recommend this like everyone who smokes weed probably at night yeah because some people can't handle it but if you can't handle it alone these are definitely not or even this everybody yeah see you there go yeah we'll be fine I unpacked some packs of these because the flavors you got terminal anyway good job Smokies good job lab pack a plus or at least an 8.5 co-host which is a very fine I give it I'm working anyway oh yeah I did [Music] so depending on the flavor but overall I think their flavors are really cool and they have a bunch of different options chances are out of all of their options they're gonna like at least one of the flavors yeah that's definitely a good beginner so yeah I'm just quite exciting [Music] so we're gonna take off we can go on a walk and I have a send rest of our day so you should have a Zen rest of your day to do and comment your favorite [Music] I guess why not just comment your favorite out of it we'll just call me whatever you like the most and the craziest terrible story or at least impact [Music] a lot of crazy yeah Meitner probably be when I took the 5150 me curls apart and ended up on a doom starving [Music] that was little curly things and it does that it was one of those for $20 you're getting a really high-quality edible the flavor and everything is on point well we'll see you about the effects I guess what I'm excited yay we should take these in movies though definitely yeah let's do it or at least before is no if we do is doing movies by the time the movie ends will just be stupidly just eating the whole pack of it yeah", "olfWC1gd95s": "okay guys watermelon gummies this is a fun little recipe a little dessert that you can try you know at any point of the year especially in the summertime of my penis will treat watermelon honey and half of a lemon that's what's in the Vitamix right now I've scooped out one half of a small watermelon if you have any kind of remaining juice you can throw it in add it in 1 tablespoon of that of honey and juice of half a lemon I've blended a little bit of it and I'm just going to finish it off right now and then we'll take it to the next step okay so now the watermelon has been pulverized it is now ready to go so behind me I've got a saucepan I'm going to pour about a cup of well it's not supposed to do that it's supposed to be on a little bit of a lighter a lower temperature so now it is so I'm going to put about 1 cup of that in there the other cup is going to go into this pool here and what I'm going to do next is I'm going to add now don't ask me why you know half the girls in here a half goals in there this recipe comes courtesy of nick pinot and jen go man i'm sure they know what they're doing with this so I'm just giving it a shot and hopefully it works out the way it's supposed to you so I'm going to take half the packet of this story this is actually fruit pectin you can also use gelatin which i believe is about the same thing and i'm going to put a bunch of it in here and we're supposed to stir it up apparently so we're going to stir this all up really important that the mixture on the stove does not boil so we're going to warm it up just to a point where you know it's warm but not boiling and then we're going to combine both and i'm just going to make sure i use all this packed in because i do believe that you mean quite a bit in order for this to become a gummy so this these are literally going to turn out to be like gummy bears but healthy versions so really cool snack you can try with your kids a little fun ways to have your watermelon and eat it too nice little changeup from the normal desserts just let that warm for a second so what we're going to do next is once we have this concoction all done and ready to go we're going to pour it into an ice cube tray or if you have any other cool type of cut out trays you want to use that have cool bear shapes or spaceships soccer balls you can totally use that as well and we'll say that that's good enough I hope all right so that has been mixed and combined just can I get all that going together so ideally and normally what should happen is if you have enough packed and I believe that he calls for three packets of this in the recipe now i don't know if that's three full package like this or three smaller ones so we're gonna hope for the best here we're going to fill this up and we're going to put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes and it should gamma phi okay if that's a word it is now it should turn into little gummies kind of an ice cube format and if it doesn't then what we're going to do is we're going to just call them watermelon ice cubes because I will just throw them in the freezer and turn them into ice cubes so that we don't look like fools you know what we're trying to make stuff right so our ice crea is full this is probably a little bit too full so hmm well whatever I mean maybe it'll be one huge gummy they'll have to cut out so we're gonna take this we're going to throw it in the fridge 30 minutes let's keep our fingers crossed that it's going to work out it's going to turn it to a nice gummy if it doesn't the next time you see me it's going to be an ice cube and that's because it didn't come a fight but we'll see what happens cool okay so it's been about half an hour of taking these little gummies out of the fridge as you can see they're not fully gamma phi but they're getting there so I've got two options at this point I can keep them in the fridge for another day and hope for the best or I can put them in the freezer and no full on that they'll turn into ice cubes and we can just use them as watermelon ice cubes so if they don't gamma phi then you probably need more gelatin more Peck there I used three quarters of a pack again the recipe calls for three packets so that gives you an idea of how much you need I would say that if I use double the amount of pectin that I put in these would have turned out no problem so I'm going to keep them back in the fridge for a couple more hours and see how it goes hopefully they turn out as gummies if not then I'll just put them in the freezer and then we can enjoy them as watermelon ice cubes that you can put in with some kind of like sparkling water really cool little idea there for you so there we go we have our watermelon gummies hopefully the turnout for you and enjoy you", "PfYE4KY2DxQ": "it's rolling up until morning is certified pothead you may notice a I'm not smoking right now I do got some super flame for you and you put it on spin move never gonna be doing a review of some dank gummies so without further ado let's jump to the close-up [Music] [Music] [Music] hi Burke owes me some other bird emojis flapping in the comments section as we take a look at the base edifice never look at these dang gummies these are peach rings now I'm already about to in um I wasn't smoking if you know video so I can tell you how they make the reef you just go ahead pop this third one it you know explain to you how to take all right Burke up these have a very decent peach scent oil you don't really get a cannabis scent coming out of them you know it's a very good peach and kind of sugar scent place papi can try to break down how to taste actually it [Music] coating very sugary when you start to break it open very nice peach flavors come - and it's actually a pretty good Pete very good peach representation like it almost tastes like biting into an extra peach [Music] not really picking up too much of the cannabis at first but starting to come through is still behind the peach flavor a lot but figured up on the very end of the taste as far as what I'm feeling right now three of these are 15 milligrams this is the third one out hat so same won't break that break down the third mini twenties they're almost 30 milligrams I've already a and it's a nice feeling nice body high relaxing everything on and you spiny gummies but I will say they do them a try you don't want to go just eating a whole bunch of them because it takes a while creme to uh jump in nice you start to feel the effects so you can easily overdo it but they'll be afraid these at will be real good I'm I definitely recommended that to Lamar come out there [ __ ] cuz [ __ ] bring buddy trumpeted but daddy what a comedown [Music]", "y-UlV_CJ-NA": "i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little [Music] hey and i know you guys are like sick and tired of me disappearing for months on end i legit have been gone for a month even after i said i was going to start recording again i've just ultimately realized like at least for me and my life and my health i i just have to do things when i want to do them and i've learned that in my relationships my friendships like you got to let people go when you want to not when it's good for them and put out good things you know when you have the energy to do so so i am finally feeling like i have the energy to record again and i figured why not give you guys something fun obviously this video is going to be about me trying edibles for the very first time but backstory i have never smoked before i've never smoked i've never legit done any drug ever like nothing ever every time i mentioned to somebody that i haven't smoked before they're like why like i'm 26 years old never smoked before you know nugs not drugs kids nugs not drugs i've always been interested in trying edibles or um shrooms weird enough i actually just watched a documentary i think called psychedelic on netflix i'm not sure what the documentary is called but i have just always been interested and i guess an easier high where you can just eat something and experience it i genuinely think this is probably going to be the first and last time but i mean who knows like sorry mom i know you're probably watching this it's so funny because everybody including my mom including my dad literally everybody i know has smoked before everybody has done something before i literally have done nothing so i figured why not make my first experience memorable and share it with you guys so the big sour patch kids are the highest milligram that i got it's 150 milligrams i don't even know how milligrams work i don't even know like how much wheat is what i remember getting weed for a guy that i know a couple years ago and literally i got it wrong and he ended up like losing money i guess because i got the wrong amount and i was like i don't know how this works like i legit have never done drugs so yeah this is 150 milligrams whatever that means thing that i got was the red velvet chips ahoy honestly this i got just because i was like this sounds delicious like i've never tried red velvet chips ahoy and they're soft and i was like oh like it's gonna be good so i got that that's 175 milligrams last thing that i got were hot cheetos and these are 75 milligrams two um again i don't know how much milligram is what i just know that i was like i'm gonna get the things that i would actually eat this ain't going lowest the highest but he said cookies then cheetos then the gummies um and he said you're a virgin my [ __ ] is rockin um and then he said don't eat all of anything and then he said i'd love to come check on you he actually asked me about a boyfriend i spent 60 dollars um i can put the prices of each thing up on the screen like right here um but it wasn't crazy expensive been around wheat my whole life i just have chose not to um so i know what weed smells like wow okay yeah the gummies definitely have the highest amount [Music] okay i'm hoping somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour something happens i don't even know what high feels like so i don't know if i'm even gonna notice but we'll see so i'm doing this much one cookie oh i'm gonna do two cookies so i guess two cookies i mean i definitely i definitely think if these were on the counter i wouldn't notice that there was wheat in it i mean it's definitely like it tastes like a cookie i'm kind of like noticed doing this much of the other cookie all right i'm cozy guys i'm over here thinking i'm like my mom's probably gonna be more mad about me eating on her couch than she is about me doing drugs all right hot cheetos i really just want to taste these i'm really not gonna eat a lot of these i think that much don't feel like that's enough what if i end up like i didn't take enough and then like i don't even notice y'all i don't taste it at all but these are good like i honestly haven't had hot cheetos in a minute because i don't really eat chips like that like when i eventually do want chips i do end up getting hot cheetos but i really don't eat chips like that so these just taste good i don't think maybe because they're hot you taste it a lot less had you not told me not to eat all of these i probably would have eaten the entire bag of these hot cheetos okay [Music] i haven't had hot cheetos in a minute y'all these are good and lastly the big sour patch kids i think i'm gonna do three he said don't eat all of anything but he said i could have a few so i'm thinking three they're like this size you see that they're like this size this tastes good they don't have a wee taste at all honestly i don't feel like any of these really have wheat taste like i know it's in here so i'm looking for it but i legit feel like if you just said it on the counter you would not like pay attention to it guys this is going to be so good just for the simple fact that i don't eat things like this like i really don't eat candy like that i really don't eat chips like that i really like you know my weight gain my weight eating came from food honey i'm like one of those people that be like oh i want a midnight snack but i want some ribs it won't be no like simple snack all right last one yo this one looks like two in one this last sour patch so i did three sour patch about a little palm full of hot cheetos and two cookies so i'm gonna check back with you guys i'm also actually video chat my friend so hopefully it doesn't get again when i'm on my conversation but we're gonna see so wish me luck i'm gonna see you guys in a minute so it has been 30 minutes so right now it is 206 i took the edibles whatever at 1 35 so we're 30 minutes in and i don't feel anything the one thing though that my best friend i actually told my best friend i was doing this video right before nicki if you're watching this hello she just um messaged me on instagram and she was like girl don't take more like less is more so we're 30 minutes in i'm just going to check back in an hour i've literally just been on i was let's say facetime but i'm in i'm team android right now so um yeah on video chat right now so um i've just been checking in but we'll see in 30 more minutes so at 2 35 we'll see if i feel anything um and then again at what's after 2 35 305 we'll check again um but yeah so i'm just going to keep checking in with you guys every 30 minutes and see if i feel higher um i don't know if it's gonna work for me i just feel like when you haven't smoked before maybe like my body's like especially because i'm one of those like whatever i really don't care about being high and feeling this and escaping the world i'm like i love my life i love my job i love everything that's going on with me and my life the disrespect on video chat but whatever so anyway um yeah i just feel like when i'm a person that like doesn't i guess care about it or really believe in it or want it to work i'm like i wonder if it's just not gonna work for me because my body's just i mean i've legit just been watching tv and on video chat so again we'll check back in all right so [Music] i originally told you guys i was going to um check back in at 2 30 5 2 35 all right so it's 4 42 right now and i'm like i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little bit of a second like everything nothing's funny nothing's funny okay anyway what i was saying is i said i was getting checked back in at 2 35 it's 2 42 and i just can't stop laughing because i was on um i was on video chat and um i was eating this mango and a fly was in the kitchen on the floor and it literally like jumped like a frog and it kind of threw me all off guard but um since that happened it's just been like everything's funny i don't know how to describe it other than like get so lovey it's so weird because like i think i might be high but i can't i keep saying that i'm not high so i can't okay no it's like i can't get anything out like what the heck okay it's weird because like i'm i'm here and i recognize like what's going on but i don't know why everything's like funny okay everything just got really funny and i'm freaked out because i have to legit drive to get my mom so my mom's at um i dropped her off this morning and i have to go get her and i'm like i don't know like i don't know it came on in a matter of like 15 minutes because when i definitely looked at the clock and i was like oh there's eight minutes until i have to tell them if i'm feeling high or not and um then everything got funny and i was like oh shoot like legit that hit me really fast i didn't even know if i was still recording or not okay the feeling of high i don't know like i legit walked upstairs to get my charger and then i couldn't focus and i felt my brain was like not focusing um but yeah the most thing that i noticed the most the thing that i noticed the most was just that my heart i've been able to feel my heart like like my heart um i can feel it like i can feel my heart through my body the main thing that i feel like i just i'm talking a lot more and i feel like my thought process is just like this all over the place i don't know i don't know why that's like a feeling people would want to get because like while i'm feeling this right now i feel like i'm right now i'm on an even mindset i'm understanding i'm recording youtube video and then i need to stop talking because i'm on video chat and this is supposed to be like a short explanation and i just can't stop talking but i recognize that this is what i'm doing right now like i'm i am doing this right now but um i'm just gonna check back in with you like but i just don't know if i like this feeling like i am acknowledging that i'm recording this i'm acknowledging that it's for a reason but my brain is just like going on everything but um yeah so i'm going to check back in in about 30 minutes we'll see i've been recording for five minutes i feel like that's a really long time it's a really long time um so my next check in i'm gonna make it try and try make it short and sweet and yeah talk to y'all in a little bit hey guys right now it is 3 51 and i definitely feel like i have experienced the high i guess i didn't think that it'd feel like this i don't know like genuinely i felt like the entire time all i've felt like is actually i'm gonna look at myself just because it's helping me focus a little bit more looking at something um but i feel like i didn't expect it to feel like this i i just felt like i kept saying things that were so honest and i was like oh like i should start you know being quiet and it just was not i would not stop talking so yeah everything um was cool it just i guess this is just not how i experienced or thought i was gonna be experiencing it it's just really weird i don't i actually don't like it and i don't know why people get high like i would not want this feeling again i don't know i guess i thought like high like when i see people they're like chill you know sit back and share whatever like they feel good or like i guess some people get high and get like hype but i just feel like i feel so outside my body and like uncomfortable and like i just felt like i kept on saying things that i didn't want to say for the past hour which had been eating talking on the phone and then i got off the phone everything was funny a minute ago like i did not i guess that's when i noticed that i was high as like my brain just doesn't feel like it's fully functioning how it should function right now um and then all of a sudden it got really sad like five minutes ago like i don't know it's just like a sad feeling but i don't know if i'm sad because i'm like i really wish i didn't do this like like that might be why like i'm kind of sad about that like i was having a conversation with somebody and not able to understand like what was going on i mean i get it like we were having a conversation but like some of the conversation i just felt like i don't know like i was definitely talking and saying things that were like overly truthful and my mouth was moving but i'm like shut up like stop talking right now um and that's not a good feeling like when you're when you're aware that you're not coherent enough for the conversation you're having i feel like that's i mean that's i don't understand why people would want to feel that maybe just feel outside your head i don't know if like your person who doesn't really think much then maybe getting high will make you think more but i feel like i think a lot and i'm very focused normally so to feel very not focused and scatterbrained and looking at everything that you know pops up um i don't know like that feeling i don't know i guess that's why i've never done anything like this or done anything like drug related it's because i feel like if there's no reason for you to be doing it then don't do it like if you're watching this video even though like i'm recording it to show an experience don't think it's cool or like this is fire like this is not i don't know i guess it was like a funny video idea but i also wish that i didn't even do it like i don't know i just feel really sad i feel like i feel like that sadness is just me like realizing that i just shouldn't have shouldn't have done this um but yeah so it is three three it's 3 56 so um i thought i was going to check in at 3 35 i think last time but um i think i'm going to check back in around 4 35 like 4 30 or 5-ish just see i mean how i'm feeling then ultimately like it's really weird because all i'm thinking is how long is this going to last like i don't know i just don't get why people do this like i mean i have definitely um i guess they say that you should do it with someone for somebody to babysit you i was on video chat i mean no one's in my house right now but um i was on video chat but i just felt like i don't know i don't i don't i don't know i felt like once i got off the phone it was when i noticed um i don't know more aware of things like the way things felt in my body and i don't know i just don't like this i don't like it i feel like looking at myself in the viewfinder is helping me focus but i feel like i don't know my brain is definitely just like why did i do this that's why you don't do drugs kids it's honestly not even the hype that people made it this isn't like a good feeling like being high it's like i like being calm and coherent and you know not feeling outside my body and i guess a lot of people do it to get outside like if they're not happy or they want to feel a boost of probably serotonin and serotonin that's um in your body that like releases you to be happy um i don't know like this doesn't feel like that it just feels like a little bit like i'm outside my body and i'm um not myself and i actually really enjoy being naughty in my my daily life so um i don't know i wondered like if edibles like the high that you get is like different from when you smoke i don't ever plan on smoking like i don't know if you've ever been to the bodies exhibit we have it in atlanta um but you can see what a lung looks like healthy and what it looks like when it's been um smoked through and i just don't want it in my lungs like i smoke before but i'm like i would i even stopped doing that because it made me feel light-headed um but yeah i don't get why somebody would want to be high i ended up taking off my lashes and stuff because it like legit felt like they were 200 pounds like they were irritating on the eye and then i like ate this mango and put water all over my face and then wiped to where the inside of my shirt i'm sure has like brown from my makeup and i was like oh shoot i have makeup on but yeah it's four o'clock i'm gonna check back in around five let's see if i'm still high hopefully this doesn't last too much longer because i don't like the feeling and i want it to be over with but um yeah we're gonna check back in an hour and see how i feel i might take a nap just so i can like maybe sleep it off i'm hoping maybe i can drink it through maybe the food just has to like get out of my body but i don't know guys i don't know but i just want it to wear off already i laid down for about an hour i did not um i didn't go to sleep but i laid down for about an hour i couldn't like my mind was still racing but i feel a lot better just laying down um i can feel it coming down really weird experience i feel like i'm like a little hot and i'm talking with lisp which is i don't know but yeah that was my first time doing any kind of thing it is now time for me to go pick up my mom i just feel tired now um but yeah weird experience don't do drugs kids i feel like now knowing the experience i would never do it again so i thought that my last snippet video i guess was going to be my last video but i'm actually feeling a lot better right now it is the 7 50. so just now at 7 50 i'm finally feeling better and like myself and like my brain is clear i went to go grab my mom and i was honestly like really hungry i mean while i was high on the edibles i ate two mangoes two apples um a baked potato um what else a coke um i feel like i have something else oh and this like um shrimp and broccoli like stir-fry or whatever with some ginger sauce like oh and a bowl of frosted flakes so i don't know like i thought that you only got hungry when you were high on like smoking i didn't know you actually got like high off edibles and still wanted to eat stuff i never knew that was a thing but yeah i ate a lot while i was um highly edible before i got to my mom i did go ahead and stop at taco bell and i did guys i was trying to go ahead and make that like a laxative because i figured if it's an edible it's something that's in your stomach and it needs to get out of your system so tmi got it handled and since that happened i now feel a lot better um when i went to go pick up my mom we've been sharing a car for the past like a week or so um until she gets her car next week but excuse me um i literally when i pulled up to her i hopped in the passenger seat like mom's like why didn't you get out the car to like get in the passenger seat like i just need to get in the passenger seat so pretty much i um let her drive and just kind of like drove away and um go ride over here i just went ahead and went to sleep so i feel a lot better i didn't really go to sleep but it was more like relaxing closing my eyes and like now that it's out of my system i feel like i feel a lot better um i did not like the feeling guys i don't know how people do it like i know people who do edibles all the time people smoke all the time like i don't know if that's the feeling you get but i did not enjoy it i don't like feeling outside of myself i like to be clear-headed um so to feel like i was drugged like that's what i mean it felt like that um it wasn't a good feeling i was like i don't want to experience this again i literally remember um on the way over here all i was thinking was yo i need to like get rid of these like i need to flush them on toilet give it to a friend something like they have to go not flush them down totally but you know get rid of them um likely i'm gonna give them to a friend rather than throw it away because it was sixty dollars but i am just not interested i'm not interested in getting any more trying different flavors like i just did not like the experience um i felt like my brain was really clouded and heavy and it was almost like i'm kind of atd so i feel like every time when i'm thinking my thoughts go everywhere anyway but i can still organize them like i'm used to it enough that it's like i can organize thoughts in my brain but when i was high on the edibles it was almost like i could not control my brain hopping on a trillion different things and i was on video chat and i felt like i was saying things that were like brutally honest and i'm like yo why is this happening right now like it was like my mouth was moving saying things like shut up shut up so yeah i didn't really like that feeling i don't like not feeling in control and i definitely did not feel in control while i was high on the edibles um they tasted good we're going off taste i'd say 10 out of 10 they were all really really good but i'm just really thinking about experience i don't know if it's how you're supposed to feel but i just remember feeling really disoriented and my thoughts were not coming up straight in my brain as well as the fact that um i was just really confused and would not stop saying things i'm just like be quiet and then directly after that i got really sad um and disappointed in myself that i did it how long does high last night like it peaks at two to three hours so i was like i think i'm peeking so i literally was with my eyes closed but i was paying attention to everything like the fan um how it felt up against my skin i felt like i was um breathing extra heavy i don't know i just was not it was not comfortable and i just was not happy but i am glad that i experienced it i'm glad i experienced it alone i don't know if that was good or bad thing but yeah we're never doing that again hopefully you guys enjoyed it and give this video a thumbs up for me and my experience and yeah that's gonna be it for today i just love you bye", "aSO-ZBoJ0DQ": "I am gonna be eating one of these very excited these are like hair on that there's these are CBD gummies and I already opened it says here it's a full spectrum organic cannabidiol l-theanine Piper myth this something or others some other thing that I can't pronounce and some other thing that I can't pronounce no THC and no marijuana but my body hurts I don't want to get high so let's try this what's in here oranges in a red so this orange one also tiny look at it can you see it mmm Harel serving size one gummy ten milligrams per gummy let's see how I feel later hello everyone so it's been a little while since I took the gummy and maybe I would say like 20 or 30 minutes but I am like super tired right now and I think it's only 8 10 p.m. and it's too early to go asleep but I think that I'm gonna brush my teeth anyway because just in case I fall asleep I don't wanna like fall asleep without brushing my teeth because that's just weird and gross but I'm gonna try to stay awake for a little bit longer but I don't think that I will be and I will be super upset if like I go to bed soon and then wake up at like 4:00 in the morning or something but tired alright so that was pretty much it for this video thank you for watching and I will see you guys later", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "CuS8zdDf4Ro": "hey everybody hey guys Justin and Jennifer here with Ravi yoga and wellness so glad to have you joining us today we want to share a brand new product that we just got into the studio I guess it's been maybe a couple of months now months it's Smokey's gummies edibles they are actually out of Oregon and this company Smokies started with a THC product a product that includes THC and they only recently just started having CBD products on their lineup as a result you don't see terribly much information on their website but that is why we wanted to do this review it's really funny the the salesman you're really good of an away the salesman gave me a call it was a random maybe Friday afternoon and wanted to know if we wanted to carry these in the studio and where yoga and wellness studio so I thought no I actually no I thought no we don't need any more gummies and he said no no let me just send you these I'm telling you as soon as you've tried them you'll buy them and he was right they're good he sent me five different varieties and four gummies and one hard candy we still carry all of those in the studio and they were so good the first one I had is a different one that that we will review later the first one I had was so good I couldn't just eat one ga - no I ate all of them I one of all this so I basically had no beauty function the hard candies only had 15 milligrams so there was I think it I think I did the math it was like 85 milligrams so I must have had only four samples anyways I was not high because there is zero THC I did see it let's show them that there's that on the back corner there's zero THC so I was a high but but let me tell you ladies I did not care no should I think you're the rest today I was like what is wrong and then I put in a huge order because I love them and so does everybody else so in this bag you get ten gummies that are 25 milligrams of CBD each the nutrition labels right here on the back there is about 2 grams of sugar per gummy so it's not too bad for those people out there that are concerned about sugar and bean gummies they are 25 milligrams and each gummy right here well I'm just reiterating it there that's a logic of me CBD love all the gummies are gluten free they're not all vegan friendly they do have some vegan friendly options and we carry we have so couple of those flavors in the studio though we also have some sugar-free options as well yep that's true but today's review is on the watermelon flavors not just watermelon it's sour watermelon so I'll just take it from the team so you're gonna notice like when you open they come resealable which is really nice oh my gosh and I'm having trouble getting it open this might be a sign I did not I did not and they're little bitty squares and they're super delicious I actually really like the sour kinds of candies and so this is like a holler back to like the lemon heads or what are those super sour candies that the kids love these days anyway so they're a better sweet tarts but they're gummies but these are gummies in there there's no that's our daughter she just went potty okay so we will have to finish this review very quickly so this um you'll see a little bit of the sugar on the outside it tastes amazing you can eat half of it and then you get like half of the CBD but we preferred all of it so we like to eat all of it yep and if you got our website they said they're revamping their website so it's really because of the THC and because the laws in Oregon have changed to where they can't market gummies anymore because of kids obviously so the website will be updated in the next couple of months is what they said that they're a little bit behind but I wanted to show you the website a little bit they also said I actually talked to our rep on the phone today here is here is the about page well let me see if I can show you my inner I'm only as fast on my internet so as you can see it's a really nice website it's really pretty the problem is the about page is pretty it's it's pretty bare-bones right now they do not offer the third-party test results they do not offer any of the like ingredients list and you also can't buy the products online from their website yet however you can buy them from our thrive hemp store website thrive hemp store calm we should be able to keep the inventory updated there I hope and if you ever have any doubts you can give us a call at four to three to nine zero to three to six again this is in the US we can ship inside the US once you start shipping overseas it gets a little hairy I believe I know that several other CBD companies do have trouble trying to ship overseas so if you're interested in trying a really good it's absolutely delicious gummy it has 25 milligrams of CBD isolate it is not the full spectrum it is a nice lip we absolutely love the Smoky's brand CBD we sell a whole bunch of these things have actually kind of over passed our other brand that we had in the studio and so we absolutely love them and think you should try it out the sour watermelon is awesome so is basically every flavor so as a result of that we're gonna like review every flavor so that we get to taste them that's right so if you like this review or have some products you would like us to review send them to us yeah yeah and leave us a note below let us know what you think of the Smokey's CBD gummies with 25 milligrams each and if you want to buy some check us out at thrive hipster calm see you soon buh-bye thanks so much",

friday so hopefully you're having a good start to the weekend it's about three o'clock in the afternoon i'm done working already thankfully so we got a gummy review from true leave coming right after our unboxing so make sure you stick around for that i have tried them so it'll be a little mini review um so let me get back to where it was if you guys haven't subscribed make sure you hit that button sunday we're going to do our 420 giveaway our big giveaway so make sure you subscribe for that make sure you're on the video on sunday whatever else i put with it but it will be the giveaway uh leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know what you guys are smoking on i got lucky and picked up a little member berry today you guys know i love that [ __ ] all right i forgot to grab one thing give me one second all right it's in this box here so just give me a second all right so i was perusing on a line the other day um looking for some stuff on instagram let me toss that back in there i've been looking for uh marbles what they call them you guys know i got this terp slurper off a waist for like four bucks uh and they usually cap them with a little marble and then they stick a like it looks like a pill in here like called whatever they call it and then some smaller balls in there you can do that well like i said of that 60 bucks i spent five i'm not even sure if i like a tarp slurper yet so i've been trying to find a cheap one i run right across the uh stone back glass stone bat glass he's out of ohio um and he had some marbles on there let's get this open and see if i can find a knife and i dm and him and ask him you know what price he had on one um you know he sent back some questions and i said i just want something cheap i just got a turf slurper i want to try it and he gave me an incredible price on them could not pass it up so i was like what else do you got but like i said he's a medical i believe medical patient in ohio he does have two kids around two years old age so he's talking for a little bit um but he's got some nice glass i think there's something there shouldn't be that many oh yeah i think i got three marbles okay so i will put a link for him down in the description he does have an ecstasy store or este whatever you want to call it so this is going to be one of the little balls here and like so as soon as we get done with this we'll do the review of the other stuff um but these are the ones he had laying around that he didn't uh they didn't come out quite so good i think they look great oh it looked like there was a hole in it it's not it's just a spot now he said he he polishes them a little bit but they might be a little dusty um he uses like a wet polish but i mean look at that's a nice looking little marble there and that's not even the best looking one i don't know what that is and i guess all i thought there was only two marbles looks like two marbles and something extra there now this is the one that i just thought was beautiful like a swirling planet or something it's got some mainly blues in there but it's a little darker on that side so that's what like a little tint of yellow and orange in there in certain spots but just nice let's see which one of these fits are slurper haha see just like that so the smaller one fit the big one fits too but the smaller one fits a little better so i have to ask him what size that was so now we got a thing for our banger this looks like it's a pendant and i didn't order a pendant so he must have threw that in there as a bonus let's see what this is oh yeah check that out nice little pendy some glue back there it's like blue and green that's nice all right i think this one's my favorite one now he does have another one i won't tell you how much i paid for the balls because he asked me not to um but that was after i didn't tell him i was doing a video until afterwards after everything was said and done the payment was finalized and everything then i told him i was going to do a youtube review on the stuff and he said don't mention the price of those because it was a good price now this is gray it does have like a greenish tint to it but this was like 22 bucks guys he has another one that's more blue and it's more blue and purple up here and he said he's had it for a while too i've seen it on his instagram today he said he'd take us less for it also but look at that 22 bucks for a hand blown he blows us in his garage he's been he's been blown glass oh and it sits i wasn't sure it was going to sit up but it's got that little leg right here on the side little foot which lets it sit up now the carbs on the wrong side for me i preferred on that side but that one this wasn't a custom-made piece this was something he had laying around that's why i got him as cheap as i did now if you ask for something custom it's probably going to be a little bit higher but like i said i was like what else you have laying around that you can throw in the box tonight with that stuff and this is the stuff he had laying around but like i was saying he um i believe he's been blowing glass for a year now um he just started doing it on his own three months ago i'm not sure if he lost his job because of the covet or if it's just a move he decided to make oh nice now this thing he let go for eight dollars guys again we got some green glass a little swirl of orange here on the end and i couldn't believe that for eight bucks so i was super super stoked about this you know i like my dry pipes yeah nice the glass isn't real super thin and like i said this is blown by a guy right here in or not right not in florida but you know middleton ohio wherever it was ohio it's a little bit further up north i think in ohio but if you're looking for you want a hand blown piece of glass that's not everybody else is going to have reasonably priced like i said he's not doing big fancy stuff yet give him time i'm looking at this stuff i'm thinking he won't be far before he gets there um but if you want something reasonably priced that looks good it functions hit him up um i know on his ssc story has a lot of pendants but he does have pipes and other stuff like that you can hit him up in a dm on instagram or something like that ask him to send you pictures of what he's got or give him an idea what you want i love that little thing i've been wanting a little sherlock for a while i've got a few other ones i really just don't care for and like i said threw in a a free pendant when that stuff was already super super super cheap it was so cheap that i threw an extra five dollars in to help cover for shipping because i almost felt like i was robbing the dude um like i said these two alone that was 30 bucks by itself these two 22 and 8 30 bucks you cannot beat that right there so like i said i'll leave the links down there in the description for him you're not only supporting a small glass blower but you're helping a father support his kids so keep that in mind if there's something you've been looking for give him a holler or if you're just like me you just like to collect stuff give him a holler like i said he's got another blue one almost identical to this one except for his blue here and more purple with the multi colors up here as i'd say this is blue and orange or white orange probably probably the dominant colors in that the other one looked like it had more purple where the orange was that was more dominant color but still sexy looking when it was real close for me to pick between the two of them it's hard for me not to get both of them to be honest all right so like i said i will leave links the first ones that jump on and see it give me a minute to put the links up i'll put a link for the essence store and i'll try to put a link for his instagram on there too um so we got some gummies today from true leave we will talk about the ones we got from cure leaf we still have some of them we haven't messed with them too much now you see they're in a ziploc baggie i did that so these wouldn't dry out but i'll show you that didn't help much they'd dried out they're kind of crusty they're not that old yet you can see where it's turning real white that's where they're getting kind of hard and crusty um these like i said had a a real bad syrupy kind of taste to them the flavor wasn't bad but the aftertaste in the back of your throat was like you drunk had a bunch of pancakes with syrup but the flavor wasn't bad now let's move on to the ones you guys are looking for and that's the ones from true leave i was able to pick up two of these today or i got guava passion fruit that was the only flavor they had it's the one they come out with today now these are 100 milligram package but you're gonna get two packs with five gummies a piece i opened this you know it's a long car ride home it's like five minutes from truly um these are nice they're a lot softer another thing with cure leaves they was one of those gummies that was real hard to chew so these are only five milligrams true leaves are ten so i'm thinking i'm somewhere around 50 milligrams i would have to eat two of these i tried six one day and my jaw was sore from cueing so much these i would only have to eat five and i don't see my jaw hurting they're more of a softer gummy um to where these are more like eating a steak you know what i mean you have to chew on them for a second the flavor on true leaves there there's no aftertaste on these so one night i thought i had some you know like a fake sugar aftertaste like a sweet and low or something now i haven't experienced that with these but i've only ate three of them so far i ate two on the way home and i ate another one a little bit ago it's got more of like a pineapple like the tart lemon they're a little bit more sour strong flavor not so much on the smell like when you open these you can smell them and it had pretty much a mild flavor these you can't smell when you bite into them the flavor just kind of explodes in your mouth i really like these i even thought i felt something just from the two right off the bat almost which was kind of weird now you will adult i don't want to get too far into this you will need to get an edible recommendation from your doctor here in florida to get the edibles so don't forget that some doctors you can just call up and get it with nothing at it i heard a couple other people said their doctor charged them 20 bucks so it's just going to depend on your doctor you have to call them find out but i wouldn't wait too long i would try to get on there and get that done that way if something does come out that you would like to try it doesn't run out while you're waiting on your doctor to get your recommendation in there and then you have to wait another two or three months for it to come back out again so keep that in mind but i was impressed enough with these and like i said there was no they didn't say there was a limit they said i get as many as i want it so i got two of them uh i'm gonna go back right now and if they're not out i'm getting two more so i was pretty impressed with these i'm gonna do um a whole pack here after i get back so that'll be 50 milligrams which is nice they've got and i guess that's the universal sticker there was nothing actually on the gummy take that out and show you but see it's real soft it's still got some density too but when you bite into it it kind of you know it's one of them softer ones about the only way i can explain it it does have just a little bit of sugar coating on the outside i think or something but not much yeah i guess there is a little bitty you can't even hardly see it there's a little bitty stamp like a diamond i'm guessing that's going to be the same as that one so um now i know the website said it's select locations my location wasn't one of the select locations that was listed but i went and they had them because when that first popped up it said every location but the ones it excluded the ones that was on there the first time two days ago and then it popped back up saying only those locations but like i said mine had them so they're not showing up on the website you just have to bite the bullet go in there i waited 30 minutes got in and out i think i got there like 10 40 10 50 this morning i was out at 11 20. so we'll see when i go back if it's any longer i'll post on instagram if i had a long wait or anything so you catch me over there i'm going to upload this one finish smoking this and go back and see if i can get some more so like i said guys if you've been looking for some new pipes i definitely say check out the stone bat stone back glass um real reasonable price uh and nice looking stuff i can't i don't see anything to complain about you know like i said for a 22 sherlock i don't see nothing wrong the hole is not off center it's not gigantic um i see no chips no breaks in the glass no air bubbles i mean there's air bubbles in that of course but you know what i mean not a bunch of air bubbles in the glass no stress on the joints or anything like that where it's bent so yeah i like it same thing with this it's simple it's elegant it doesn't have a lot of crap coming off of it the hole is pretty much centered um that's pretty yeah i'd say that's pretty much [ __ ] perfectly centered um it's not super huge so he didn't screw up the holes or anything like that neither one of the sides not super huge there's no rough edges the mouthpiece is nice and big so i'm pretty impressed especially for the price like i said eight dollars man and you know who blew the glass so go check him out i'll leave the links down there hopefully you guys have an amazing weekend i'm going to try to do the g-pin connect tomorrow for a saturday and we're going to do the giveaway on sunday so if everything goes at plan check back tomorrow for g pin giveaway on sunday and then hard time what we'll do by monday so hopefully everybody's smoking on something good and as always keep on toking my friends till next time", "agLIlV_RBrU": "hey there so i wanted to do another video again i got so many messages from people interested in these cannabis drinks like i knew that that was a market i knew people are interested in that but a lot of people messaged me so i just wanted to do some more videos and content on that and last night actually i was messaging these folks that work at tonic i was just messaging them through instagram they were so nice and one of them was telling me like that they have different ratios of thc and cbd so if i wanted a more cbd focused one to be like for the daytime they have that you know all kinds of stuff different flavors so along that i wanted to post another drink from them um this one is much much stronger so this is the tonic beverage that i got at the dispensary and this one's a hundred milligrams whereas the one i had yesterday was 25 milligrams cbd 25 milligrams thc so literally five times stronger so for me like knowing this information knowing that this is a hundred milligrams i just know right off the bat that i can't drink this whole thing in one sitting or one day to be honest um so what i've got here is it's really nice that if you can see there's like little demarcations to tell you okay if you want just a little bit this is how much you should take and it's like got lines to mark it and a little see-through strip so you can see you know where you're at so that was incredibly smart because i was like all right well i can just measure out how much i do want you know so i had 25 milligrams right here and i just poured that into a cup and really really like this so this one is a mango pineapple flavor there's no cbd in it so it's a little more psychoactive and personally like i like the more light milligrams of of thc because yesterday was a really nice experience for me i had that one tonic seltzer and then the rest of the night i drank regular sparkling water like perrier bubbly you know other things so that was like my night but if i had this i would want to make sure that i hydrated a lot lot more because it's like pretty concentrated you know like like you need some water to get that feeling good one thing that can happen with cannabis beverages and i've seen this happen is people will drink only this right they think it's an actual beverage like i'll just drink this this is almost like medicine you know it's like a flavorful nice way to drink it but you need like an actual drink an actual beverage so consider that and i tell people that with gummies too like yeah it's great to have gummies but buy yourself some just regular gummies and eat those too like don't eat gummies that are infused with cannabis is like a main snack like that's not their point but that's just my opinion so again if you buy this super super good but hydrate yourself um this i believe was 25 milligrams or i'm sorry 25 at the dispensary so 100 milligrams for 25 bucks so i would definitely buy this there's no taste of cannabis it tasted like uh like mango popsicle juice if that's a good description um so i was really surprised by that like whoever makes this and formulates this it has come a long way since the ones that i had like many years ago like on our honeymoon my husband and i went to colorado and had different you know drinks there and things like that and they did taste a little cannabis but this was also back in 2017 so things have really come a long way since then but yeah if you're interested check this place out it's tonic they're made by a company pts progressive treatment solutions and this one right here is called their pure thc infused beverage all right hope you have a good day bye

into this video I want to you guys to subscribe like comment and share this video um this video is going to be a video that um kind of gives you guys how about like an idea of what I use to help me deal with my anxiety back in January I suffered my very first like severe anxiety attack which also led to a panic at hot um which I had to be rushed to the hospital I couldn't breathe I really didn't know what was happening in like guys I was talking to the nurses and you know everybody they kind of you know knew the symptoms and you it was so they didn't want to medicate me but to you know speak to a group in one so before that happened I was taking a product called just CBD they were gummies they were featuring gummies I think there were about like 250 milligrams for CVD I believe I don't have the continuous with a lot of them um so I was using those those helped me a lot with like sleeping just getting through the day I'm I normally take one in the morning and then take one at night from what I was going to bed um and then I switched over to the vape CBD I know in some areas um vaping is banned I'm in my state it's the e-cigarettes um when choosing you brand for vaping and I know like I said everyone's gonna be like oh baby it's dangerous I think this um being able to find a brain that you trust um with their products and you know what's in it they're transparent about it with something big going into it um I have a smoke shop in my area in downtown Boston in the cold smoke city shop I will link them down below they also sell just CBD products they sell the gummies but they don't so be the they being or the cartridges um so I wanted to show you guys a little haul of items that I got now do you also want to clarify in this video this is not a sponsored video by just CBD these are thought of my own products just brought my own money and so nothing you know was sent there's no sponsorship in the city I'm not being paid for this this is my own opinion my own thoughts on the brands as a whole so without further ado we're gonna jump right into it and we're gonna open these little bad boys I did split it to make sure everything was any in make sure I had everything that I got in it so we're just gonna jump right into it so the first item we are going to pull out is a date juice I got this in the flavor mango mango ice is the flavor and it's a hundred and it's a hundred milligrams and we're gonna open it and see what it looks like on the inside so this is the big bottle that it comes with and this is like set for a pretty good decent price for it I believe it wasn't check step inside so these were $15.99 each so I have this flavor like I said it's the mango mango ice in that flavor and I spend on the side of the box um it does give you the where it's talks about it being um tobacco free conveniently need for your e cigarette vaping devices for intense sources and like I said CBD does not replace going to your doctor if you do take medication continue to consult your doctors on that me I just don't want to be medicated so like I said I do the gummies and now I'm like I said I'm switching over to the the oils I can so take it with me so I'm not carrying on this big bike like jock of gummy so it's kind of like another convenient for me I'm gonna see what other goodies I'm having here we also have the pineapple Express and this one comes based off of the Navy find out for sports if you have not seen it so it comes like this as well the same jar just different flavor you see it looks like a fair way to open it there we go you can smell it too so that that was also $15.99 I got three different flavors on this one is watermelon og time I want to get like flavors um if you do follow me on instagram you would have saw that I posted in a story I'm all plus the story in this video somewhere on the screen um I've gotten a pen from Busey so I have an Uzi pen the cartridge on top comes from panda sticks I believe that's how you pronounce it I will also link that pen in the cartridge down below if you want to go purchase those too I got that ez pen in that cartridge first because I knew this was coming and with everything going on I did not know if I was going to receive anything I'm via the mail but everything was still running normal and I got it within a good decent time frame so this is what the I said watermelon og looks like in this big bottle and I love the fact that the bottles are big like these are very big bottles for the price that I got them before like I've seen like I said in the smoke shop I go to they have like bottles smaller than this for the same price so I love the fact that these are big bottles they'll last me a while and I'm glad I got the three different flavors that they did I love the that I have so I'm really glad I got those and then I have a disposable cartridge it's like this is the watermelon so the Sigma C of OG 1 for it so this one is a disposable one this one is 200 milligrams for these cartridge let me open it so it looks like and then from boozy I did I do have an order coming from them my main include them in this video but it's this is more of a just EEE video because this is the main products that I'm going to be using like I'm not gonna go back to the Panda stick cartridge Luzi I'll keep the pen just cuz I have so I'll have the pen so I had two different pens so I also gun pen from just CBD but I'm just sticking to just CBD I'm not switching I'm not doing anything like I said I enjoyed the brain as a whole their response to customer service is really good like things like it's not like you're not waiting a whole entire day to hear back from somebody if you have an issue on a product I mean you can get a response right away so this is the and I may switch over to this one today this is what the pen looks like if I can get ever get it out hopefully by the end of this video I can get it out for you guys and show you guys what it looks like and put it on the pen so we're gonna sit this off to the side real quick so what they're also like I said I did order a battery so this is what the battery looks like um theirs is a 5-10 VV twist battery um the Uzi stick I have is also a 5-10 battery so I can also use the cartridges from just see beating on that pen in the future but like I said I did order 3 of the cartridges from Louise because I did order an Uzi pen so like I have three pens now so I have the first uz one be just CBD one I just showed you and then there's another one coming from Uzi so they each have their own cartridge and I can grab the Izzi pen and she goes it looks like I want to get this pout oh yeah my Lu Zhi ping it's like a little metallic like rainbow fish color the other one is a Rastafari so it has a Jamaican colors and this is the cartridge up top so the cartridge up top is from panda stick and like I said I will link it below and the stick is from and the battery is so easy so that is that one so I'm ordering so I ordered another battery in three of the cartridges to be able to fill because the only thing with just CBD I did not see and even I missed it but it's okay that they don't have like the cartridges sold on their own like he does like it was he has the ones which we can be filled with liquid so just CBD didn't have those and less like I said I missed it and I didn't see it hopefully in the future they do release some like that so we're like individually in the art empties like this one is if I don't think I can get the cap off for this one I can try but I so this is what this one looks like is the like I said the watermelon flavor we're gonna do a test to see how it tastes and like I said as I know people's concerns are she like be safe and I am like I said I'm not walking around like every hour gaping I'm I normally do it in the more like in the morning when I wake up I do about two to pups that's it um and then that night same thing two puffs that's it so I'm not like so because the guy was like oh this cartridge should last you you know only a couple of days like this has lasted me like almost a week and I guess I can show you what it looks like when everything goes down but has lasted me I pretty decent amount of time because I'm not pulling on it and I keep it my pen stays on 3.3 v so it does not leave that area so it does not leave you can see it on the bottom it does not leave that smart so like it's on the lowest of the low so I'm not puffing so much so this is what the pen looks like and I love that piece and these have a lower voltage so these this one starts at two point two point zero B this one starts at three point three in the highs that it goes to is four point zero which I love so I can definitely put that on a smaller voltage I'm sold it like I said so and then this is my charging port that will go into it like I said I also have another the same thing came with this one that was e1 mix and I love effect you just twist and it comes on so these are the two that I have like I said this one is just CBD which is labeled is label sorry about that my camera dies I'm gonna make this really quick so these are the two that I have and then the last item I don't know like there was a certain thing going on but they sent me a free a free item I don't know if I mean it's like I never tried this so this is there just and it's a body soap I'm so I'm down there to really try this in the flavour of cherry pie and it smells really good I open the box I like what I'd like smells really good I didn't know this was even in there so I'm kind of a little free treat to try it so you guys so I'm definitely I'm going to try this come to night and see how I like it and see how it worked like fields and they said it's created for all faces and all skin types to enjoy to him him Ronnie so so it's handcrafted body so label and sing it with it I'm not the lighting looks different in the camera looks flipped in a different way please excuse me I kind of switch over to my phone to film the remainder of it so yeah so this is the soap duck I said that came with it um this one I did not purchase on my own um this one was sent in the box I don't know if it was like a free gift and he spent so much I said I opened it it was in there so thank you just see beauty for this one um but like I said I'm so proud of everything that I had like I said the stick the bat the flavors and I definitely would have you guys posted on how you know I'm doing with them and like I said I love them all to death like the company in itself is all is a good brand um I hope they do come out with more flavours um I hope that they do come out with just the cartridges on their own I'm not pre filled with anything so you can just order it all together as weight on one but yeah if you are interested in any of the products or have any questions you can also definitely shoot me and leave a comment down below or you can also screw me ng M I will link all the products down below that I have and that I got from them in the description box down below and also I will link their website so you can definitely check out Jesse needy and like I said I don't have any negatives like I loved everything like everything that I've had so far from them so like thick dummies I loved they were amazing so I do you know I said ordering more dummies from them like I said they have sugar-free gum means they have to dry fruit they have all different types for anyone looking and if you want to know more information about CBD oil and CBD and how it works I will definitely leave like clips in in like at the end of the video where you can go to and check it out and get information like advise you to do your research on any brand that you try where is his oils and dummies anything um like I said they clearly say on their site that they do not none of their products continue vitamin E which should be all do by me II was what was in a cigarette that was killing people and causing lung issues with their products like I said the Panda stick I checked on their site too as well they have listed that they do not use vitamin E in their CBD oils I'm CBD everyone's like Oh CBD you should high it sweet no CBD does not get you high CBD is part of my marijuana plant but it's not the part that gets you high so you're safe if you are worried about being drug tested you can definitely lecture they definitely recommend you to let your employer know beforehand that you do take CBD or CBD so then you know exactly what's going on and you're not going off by any weird surprises that come your way like I said I thank you guys for watching this video hope you guys enjoyed and like I said let me know down below if you cop any products that I have and thank you for watching hope see you guys in my next one you", "ztvQhTfAVgY": "hello everyone welcome to wheat's the marijuana review show where we help you wonderful fine folks make sense of that crazy maybe now remote place you call your dispensary uh we're out here in beautiful sunny long beach today trying to stay as healthy as we can out here in the pandemic world don't worry i've got my mask on me um but we're gonna do even with this pandemic raging one of our favorite patented wheats reviews and today we are taking a look at a company that's quite big uh one that i don't think i have reviewed anything uh from yet but one that i'm very excited very much looking forward to giving a try and that is one of the many weed companies with the name canna that's right this is canna cannabis infused gummies k-a-n-h-a not the c or k-a-n-e-h of canaco or c-a-c-a-n-n-a of many other cannabrands all these are their 100 milligram gummies pretty standard issue um they are 10 10 milligram gummies so instead of the uh 20 doses you get the 10 in here which i normally prefer indica mango flavored and uh from my experiences with canna their gummies are usually pretty tasty too uh their gummies are quite affordable they're usually a little bit cheaper than uh like the plus gummies or steezy they come in usually a couple dollars cheaper i think i picked these up for 13 at a dispensary in long beach about two dollars cheaper than most gummies that i see in this area um and that indica mango gummy taste sounds really exciting so i'm going to try to open this up with one hand here and we'll get this review started like all of our wheats reviews uh guys the way that they're going to work is i'm going to eat this whole product not necessarily all in front of you on the camera here but i will eat all 10 of these gummies this is gonna be a little bit uh rocking here excuse me you just look at me this way for a moment hello child proof packaging there we are oh wow i could smell them the second that bag opened not the weed smell no weed smell just that that is very very very mangoey uh smelling wow that is a crazy mango scent uh here are the gummies themselves these aren't cubes like a lot of the gummies are these are little pucks very very sugary pucks that's a lot of sugar on it uh so let's give it a taste no weed odor but a crazy amount of mango scent my dog's pretty tired here i'm playing some frisbee oh wow yeah a little bit of um weed taste there at the end but early uh in our taste experience it's nothing but overwhelmingly sweet candy mango flavor uh but i mean that in a good way these are pretty good they go right down uh they're just coated in that mango sugar um so yeah in terms of flavor um no problems with the cannaba cannabis cannabis canna cannabis infused indica mango gummies um real good especially for that 13 price point but the taste is the smallest most insignificant part of the uh edible review uh the most important the signature thing about all edible reviews is it is it gonna get you high and for that you're gonna have to wait just a bit me i'm gonna polish these off over the next i said about hours so and then uh about two hours after i have that last one i'll come right back here and let you guys know if these can of gummies are as good as we hope until then stay safe stay high stay [Music] healthy hello folks i am back it has been two hours since my last can of gummy and the question is can of these make you high uh and the answer is yes they definitely can um these are pretty good uh i think their quality is maybe just slightly under that of like a plus or a steezy or something in that range uh but they are a little bit cheaper and they um hit almost just as hard tastes pretty good um all in all the canna is pretty pretty good uh value so if you see the canna and they're a little bit cheaper than some of the other gummies give them a shot unless you have a really big preference for one of the other brands as long as these ones are a little bit cheaper uh i i think they're going to uh you know this slightly less uh [ __ ] i should just start over holy [ __ ] i'm sorry to me i guess and welcome back to weeds guys it has been about two hours since my last canna cannabis infused indica mango gummy uh and i am very happy to say that uh my joyful journey uh was [ __ ] hello everyone welcome back it has been about two hours since my last canna indica mango gummy uh and my journey was as joyful as advertised uh these are pretty dang good um they are i would say just beneath the top sort of tier uh edible gummies out there uh they are cheaper i've seen these as i said at the beginning of the review routinely uh two or three bucks cheaper than their competitors um i would say they are not quite as good as again those like plus or steezy kind of gummies but they're so close and that price is is is a you know a nice enough discount that the trade-off may certainly be worth it for you um so uh yeah very happy with the can uh canna cannabis and views indica mango gummies uh really like that lion guy he's pretty cool looking um i also uh just now noticed that they are the winner of the most accurate accurately formulated edible by the sas the prestigious sas wow man uh i wish i had known that they were the most accurately formulated editable uh as awarded by the sas beforehand um because i would have you know done nothing different with that information uh speaking of doing nothing additional with any information let me share with you a little cherry on top little something extra that you can enjoy with or without your weed uh both of these though i would say uh probably gonna be a little bit enhanced with weed it's a two for one today uh i'm gonna uh give you the cherry on top of a two for one video game both from the same uh studio which is i believe annapurna the movie studio but they also make video games they had two that came out last year that are both great i think they are both available on ios and switch i played them on switch uh they are called donut county which is sort of like the inverse of a katamari dimashi where you uh met you start as a whole and you make stuff fall into a hole and then the hole gets bigger and then you can have bigger stuff fall into the hole which makes the hole even bigger so that even bigger things can fall into it it's amazing donut county the other one is called sayonara wild hearts very dumb name uh i mean it's kind of a cool name but it's also kind of embarrassing to say sayonara wild hearts out loud uh but it is uh sort of it embraces the cheesiness of that name in the game itself it's kind of impossible to describe both of these games take about 90 minutes to play um and uh they're both available super cheap check them out donut county and um sayonara wild hearts and maybe while you're checking those out try some cannabis canna cannabis infused indica mango gummies it may make them even fun more fun funner more funner until then stay safe stay healthy stay high and we'll see you guys for the next review bye", "obJwJv5JPzg": "[Music] what's up boner biters and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary decided to do a little bit of traveling today and buy travel I just mean about a mile away from my place here in beautiful Signal Hill California Long Beach right down there is looking a little hazy today so not quite the view what I was hoping but really I was here because I have a new camera that I want to play with so if the sound sounds terrible that's because it's just using the camera's native microphone and I suck and if the image is terrible it's because the sun's right there and I haven't looked at a few finder so we're just gonna do this one rock wild guys let me disturb hello guys and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I am sorry if I sound a little shitty I'm testing out a new camera that does not have an external mic so it's just the little microphone inside the camera today my apologies also I'm sorry if that sign sucks I don't have a viewfinder right now but what I do have for you guys is a really elaborate package one that I'm sure I'm gonna have trouble opening it is district edibles cannabis infused gummies indica raspberry hundred milligrams and as you can see this is some pretty crazy packaging and I was like these two little hooks here got a slide open I don't know we'll try to figure it out um I have had some luck with gummies recently like plus plus is great so my opinions on gummies are starting to change especially as like the shitty players leave the market like ed appears or infused creations I know they're still out there but they're not as present as they once were so now it seems there are a lot of legitimate gummy makers so I'm looking forward to this and guys I did do a little fad right before I took this bit or went on this video here so that way you are sure that I'm getting a hundred percent of this THC coming in so let's see if I can get this open here let's see it has some directions lift cap while pressing side tabs well it looks like one of the side tabs might be broken so well this is a bad scheme for for our guys at district edibles if they require such fancy packaging but their packaging is broken how are you supposed to get into the good stuff oh boy yes so this one is broken so you cannot get into it which means I'm probably gonna have to get some scissors for a crowbar because this is pretty solid plastic pretty shitty job there district edibles on your packaging I mean come on beer we all just want the weed yeah I've almost gotten it I'm just gonna break the damn thing tada we did it guys as a family as a team and here are our goodies that we are rewarded for all of our hard effort on the inside these 10 gummies right here in the back they say we are things like orbiter and gravity check and booster who knows weird little gummies they're kind of plush shaped and green as you can see and they've got just this little standard of lumen on packaging on the back of the top and guys like all of our edibles don't worry we'll be doing all 10 of these maybe not all 10 on cameras and won't bore you to death but I'm gonna let you know how they taste and then I'm gonna come back to you guys two hours after I finish the last one to let you know how they're actually because that's what we're so here we go taste test number one for the blue raspberry district animals and their shitty now broken ass packaging okay in terms of edible taste definitely has a cannabis taste still has that blue rat sour e blue raspberry taste not the worst edible I've ever had not the worst gummy I've ever had either but there is a strong cannabis taste to it which has me a little optimistic that it's going to be pretty poached but if you really hate cannabis tastes definitely want to give these ones a skip because they they have it for sure so here's a close-up shot of their little + or diamond dirt whatever you wanna call this cross shape do what second same as the first yep fairly strong cannabis taste but it goes away pretty quickly it's not that over overpowering style of cannabis taste either these are easy to get down they just pop right up just do them up and that guy is gonna do it for this first half I have seven more of these to get through which I will do in the next 15 minutes or so and then I will come back to you guys once we're all said and done in two hours but you know how we're actually feeling so thanks for watching wheat guys and I'll see you in just a bit deuces hey jerks welcome back two weeks it's been Oh two and a half actually I think closer are three hours since I last checked in with you and I am still talking district edibles blue raspberry indica and guys original intuition is correct in this new legal world of edibles in California gummies are pretty good now you can sort of safely by gummies that are securely vetted and lab tested all that good stuff I think a lot of the bad actors are gone um just because I don't think you can go buy a big bag of gummy worms at Costco anymore slather a couple of milligrams of oil on it and call it a product anymore that just doesn't work in this world for both good and bad so the district 9 or the district to start district 9 the district edibles is actually pretty good the taste wasn't too bad there was a decent cannabis taste to had not the cannabis haze was decent is just flatly pronounced but I am actually rather high I got up to I would say I almost even hit an eight for a second maybe that's because I was playing some Red Dead - and everything just felt a little bit more euphoric in that moment anyways but regardless I can tell you these are pretty potent I picked these up for 20 bucks in the dispensary in Long Beach which is about the going price of any easily and between this and plus it's pretty much a draw for me they're both now legal edible brands basically the same format each I think plus has five milligrams these have ten so these are about as strong as like the cushy punch hundred milligrams or the plus hundred milligrams so I don't have any problem recommending them I just think they're packaging sucks it's unfortunate that this one happened to be broken but you know it shouldn't break so that's one downside but other than that actually really really liked the district edibles I keep forgetting that name I keep forgetting that name so guys that is gonna do it for this review I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on a next review this is", "JdISM7UWDaQ": "[Music] the matter one edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are not taking my advice and we are looking at a gummy edit pure for the first time we're looking at up here I've actually had people tell me that ed up yours is their favorite gummy and that is a gummy that is actually potent I guess be watch weights before you've seen in my other gummy reviews you know I find them a pretty lackluster to be honest I never really thought one to be as potent as advertised so I come to Ed appear with as cautiously optimistic as one can be excited but not overly you know I've got some reservations so this is a two hundred and fifty milligrams edible the watermelon belts from Ed appear it cost me I believe about about twenty dollars so it's an expensive edible expensive gummy edibles so hopefully that means it will be more potent as I said never had a head up here before I had had several different gummy brands so this is the first time they had a bunch of different gummies they're from Ed uh pure I picked up a bunch to do some reviews so look forward to those in the future and if you've never tuned in two weeks before the way our abuse work is I'm gonna down this product here this time I think I'm gonna just gonna eat the whole thing in front of you guys cuz it's only five belts and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review how you feel not so much how it tastes so without further ado let's open this bad boy up and give it a taste and it looks like okay packaging is easy to open which is always nice so here we are here here's the little rainbow belt or the excuse me watermelon belt there are five of them in here each with 50 milligrams of THC or so they are as advertised here we go mmm that is rough those do not taste good there's a heavy we tasted that and guys if you will excuse me I forgot ahead of time as with all my gummy reviews I like to have a little bit of fat before I eat the gummies because I believe the fat is a good vessel for the for the THC to sort of be impacted in your bloodstream in your liver and so forth so uh if you excuse me for just a moment I'm gonna go grab some fat and I'll be right back I'm back with a spatula and some Nutella let's get some fat in me before I even need more of these gross OHS mmm now that is a good taste who doesn't like Nutella just gotta get a little bit more of me all right that's ingesting so you guys can see I will be ingesting these rainbow belts use me watermelon belts under optimal conditions now let's go ahead and eat a couple more here those are terrible Wow Wow it is like eating liquefied weed oh boy man that means they have potent okay guys well I am going to finish the last three of these here and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how these are feeling because that is the most important part of any edible review not the way it tastes but the way it makes you feel so guys with that I will see you in two hours peace guys it has been two hours since I had the head of pure watermelon belts and I'm not sure that they're going to change my opinion on candies or gummies but they are more potent than the infused creations or voodoo sours that I've had and reviewed in the past so that I definitely feel something so that is certainly an improvement over those it's still just not as potent as other 250 milligram a tea bowls that I've had just doesn't compare to tons of like brownies cookies whatever sort of in the confectionary genre but I do want to give better pure credit for being the most potent candy that I've had so far even if it's not as potent as it would be in similar milligram form and like a confectionery product and they taste it awful they tasted straight-up disgusting just just like weed I mean weed in a gummy form it was just really gross but again so if you really like gummies or candies go with the ED appear over infused creations or voodoo sours because these are definitely stronger for sure but for me I think I'm gonna stick with confectionaries however I do have a or at appear to review so we'll be sure to get those reviews out to you as well and let you know if those products are more potent than the watermelon belts until then guys thank you so much for watching wheat and we will check you out on the next review peace hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "HtaG8WmgrFk": "three amazing items left hopefully on the dish the dankness here colors pedro sweet sativa hawaii heartbreak pre roll and this shall we WOWY chocolate ten and ten so let's shuffle it that's pretty good shuffle there we go come on disc a dankness give me something good to eat look at that I got it that's pretty good I guess it's chocolate time chowie Wow eat chocolates it's legal edibles here we got this shall we Wow a milk chocolate coming in at a meager ten milligrams of THC but also ten milligrams of CBD so I never get into the CBD I never found any good use for it or anything anyways I thought I would get this just check it out with something a little different because those bang ones I had they were ten so this is a 10 with also 10 of this so we'll see if it actually does anything I have no idea so I'm just reading the back here it's got some little instructions here says the balanced chocolates are made with 10 10 and 10 each piece can be split into two squares to enjoy with friends what yeah right fucking a bunch of people all sitting around on a 10 milligram fucking chocolate bar are you kidding me we recommend starting with just one square but then waiting to feel the effects before having more while you wait you could invent backstories for Street strangers anyway I don't understand what that thing is talking about that's all crazy but it says start with one square and there's two squares or yeah two squares well you know what fuck that I'm gonna start with two bars because fuck that here we go open it up here Nano somebody my tolerance is just way too high so I figure two bars should give me an idea see there's one kind of neat actually not melted which is nice in Alberta right now they had to recall chocolates or something because they're all melting and I can't sell them at the moment which although I guess that would encourage you to make your own and while making their own you'll probably make them way stronger and for way less money so you probably are gonna hurt them so there we go two of these shall we Wow he's you know what should we take a look with a microscope here we go up close on the chocolate with the microscope [Music] that's neat you can see like the grooves you can check them out the grooves where the letters are see that it's getting super close-up on that look at that I'm getting a top-down view right on top pretty cool huh it's going close still cool I guess it's still cool I don't know these things look ok let's break it open OOP looks cool looks like chocolate so yeah I guess I'm gonna have to eat these fucking things and we'll see how it goes okay well here's number one holy that one mm-hmm not bad [Music] hmm nice tasting chocolate very nice tasting chocolate they mean a cool thing no not really though so this will be neat to tell because I do have a pretty high tolerance I make my own cannabis oil all the time and I have it every night I've had it every night for like three months so my tolerance is up there so this would be a good indicator how this stuff is for people with a high tolerance I would say high edible tolerance not high smoking or vaping tolerance but high edible tolerance so I'll be cool [Music] anyways I'll be back need is too of course but I'll be back I'll let you know how this is I'll come back in like 45 minutes or something do like the other ones there I'll check back in in a little bit so it's been 50 minutes and say these things and I do feel a little something but it's so light they almost don't know if it's even anything it's like it's like if you're sitting here and you think you hear a knock at the door so you go over in your check and then you open the door like you look around there's nobody there so you come back and sit down and 20 min 20 minutes later you're like did I just hear a knock at the door and you run over you look again nope nothing there nobody's here so that's what it's like so far for these fucking things and you know how much these cost there were seven dollars and 20 cents each so this is like $15 what it seems like now is like fifteen dollars thrown in the garbage because this stuff is absolutely pathetic fucking shit but I will give it another 45 minutes I'll be back so I'm back here with the spend another hour so I have two hours after I've eaten these fucking things ten milligrams THC 10 milligrams CBD these are seven dollars and 20 cents each so this here is like $15 I pretty much just threw right in the fucking garbage so this stuff here is absolutely pathetic is severely underpowered severely overpriced I'll rarely say this but do not buy legal edibles they're not worth it they're fucking garbage you can make your own stuff way more you can make way more potent stuff for way less using stuff that you buy off OCS I do it myself like I'll put a link here's a link right here check out that that's how I make my oil my cannabis oil and it's way better so much better than this garbage and the funny part is I make it out of my garbage like I make it a vape scraps not even you know it cost me nothing to make it really so what the fuck is the point of these things I have no idea I don't think I'm gonna buy any more legal edibles maybe I'll try the candies the gummies I haven't tried those yet but anyways that's it for now two things left on the disk of dankness you like checking those out and I hit the subscribe button and the the Bell there it'll tell you when they come online but for now that's it for the whatever you call these things these cherry pieces of shit absolute garbage anyways see you later have a good one everybody", "LMTzxpmUDlA": "hi everyone you all are having a big day today okay retake hi everyone I just kind of wanted to make this video I'm going to be doing an eyebrow tutorial not really like a tutorial like I am NOT a new guru I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing kind of like an eyebrow tutorial slash edible review slash me just [ __ ] around so I am getting ready because my brother is performing down on sunset today and I have to get ready because I'm going to go and support him Josje oh sure my eyebrows or something that's like really important to me like in high school if I didn't wear makeup at all I at least had my eyebrows build it that's the most important thing your eyebrows shape your face like there I just can't stress enough they're just one of the most important things as far as your makeup routine so I am going to be reviewing I have some kiddo candied pineapple flavored sativa gummies I have never ever tried this before so that's kind of why I decided to make a video on this because since I haven't tried them before I 150 percent honest opinion on them as far as flavor goes as far as experience and all these things I really personally I have a pretty high tolerance for someone my size and weight normally I consume around like 20 to 30 milligrams depending on the edible I know some people take like 1,500 I'm not rich for myself I'm just trying to enjoy myself I just want to live up to my eyebrows how is that not something that everyone so I got these per recommendation of my pleasure I was like I need medical it taste it and that's going to be infected a hundred milligrams of THC and the entire thing each piece is 10 milligrams there's 10 pieces so [Applause] okay we're just gonna pour some my hand and see how that goes okay Oh baby we're gonna go for four is a good number I'll try to pull myself we're gonna messed up a little bit by getting pineapple I don't know why it's available in our shower they're pretty sweet they taste good don't get me wrong but I just don't think I that was it for me [Music] - now they don't taste like wheat okay don't get it twisted it tastes really really good just makes me when structures eat one two three dummies okay guys so I'm going to tie myself 45 minute they not 45 minutes I'm going to be doing my foundation I'm going to do contouring pretty much going to be doing everything besides my eyebrows a little buster [Music] so I went to the and they found I found cotton candy this is honestly the best thing that could happen I started getting hired like 2025 minutes and it has only been significantly up from there I'm supposed to be doing the eyebrow that's right I decided to sit down for this because when I was getting super high I was just like enough this sucks why not set make things easier for myself so I have this product it [Music] my bread my powder Brett brow powder duo who's just so hard to say I've used this quite a few times ladies this little end it's like a as you can contrast I forgot it has an angled edge chicken the spoolie side so [Music] okay there see where the angle is handy now [Music] I'm so into this eyebrow right now it just goes to show how good the eyes I mean so just happy and like just having a good time I hate pizza right before the comic and and oh my god it only took me like 10 minutes to my favorite so evident the good thing about like doing your eyebrows is you can just like go back in there as long as you have please blend it out later so don't be afraid to say this is so sad immediately is dark the very bargain it's okay hope you find one we'll see what happens with this one okay let's get it [Music] - like I'm Kris [Music] maybe the tail is essential Oh [Music] okay so now this is also a very crucial step you have to outline your eyebrows with like get this [ __ ] together I promise that's a huge issue me out there she's gonna have faith in the process okay [Music] my [Music] so we're going in on the top crusty dusty trusty PT blender this is honestly a really important step because it just changes everything it makes it look so much more [Music] [Music] it really is just like life-changing just like it's a whole different I really like this really wise [Music] [Music] so the answer was bullet that's all see the continued struggle so I want [Music] it has work point to me and I see supposedly they're made with all-natural ingredients they definitely tastes like pineapple there since me and they were so light but I expected them to a little bit more sour just because for some reason I know I thought there were sour gummy is a sentiments so they're made with agar locust bean gelatin glucose cane sugar closed strings citric acid capsule and not just it contains you know food allergies whatsoever however are not vegan they don't stay organic they're definitely not kosher but they need all the requirements like their lot tested free of metals [Music] Oh two hours later everywhere yeah I think this is better than I know that there's CVT in years [Music] one of the best combinations you can do and I can I [Music] really like they see this on the party [Music] [Music] [Music] wait huh is purple [Music] this is like a cute I hope you enjoy this video as much as if you know did I enjoy it though you know when you guys thought in the video under the honking

"hello stoners and stoners welcome back to stone alone today we're going to be talking about some [ __ ] today we're doing a strain review on a blackberry kush so i picked up some of those humboldt farms this still wasn't cheap but in california i would say this is on the more affordable end of things before you know there was top shelf but now there's exotic shell [ __ ] it's just getting crazier and more and more expensive with delivery and everything came out to be about 60 dollars this is in indica i gotta say the nose on this the smell was amazing in the bag it lingering out you know i would say this is a blackberry smell but i don't think blackberries smell very much you know like i've seen them in the wild and this is a very kiefy flower like i said i only have crumbs left but it's a [ __ ] on a keefe so i'm gonna blaze that up real quick [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] very much this uh this tasty taste maybe i should search up this strain so lethally says herbal peppery and citrus pain management thanks to its body high effects it's a combination combination of afghani and blackberry nice it says it has a hashy jet fuel taste and aroma that is balanced by sweet berries nice nice nice relaxed happy sleepy euphoric and hungry i will agree that uh i got this hungry feeling from it i'm still feeling a little cerebral high i'm feeling a little goodness up there but it's not making my mind a race i'd say very good balance definitely been getting very high off it it's crazy seeing this level of weed again seeing just the [ __ ] ton of trichomes that is on here it's completely keefed up so many little pestles all right listen we gotta pay the bud tender so we got a sponsored segment the ganja berries wait a sec seriously thank you to ganja berry because otherwise i would not have been able to afford this weed these right here are actually made out of real goji berries from goji berries you can pack up to a gram and a half in here it's tasty and it'll have that slow burn best part these are actually pretty cheap i'm gonna open one right and you can use code stoned alone for another 15 off devlin check him out show him some love because that is how we acquired the cannabis for today's room jumping back into the blackberry strain cannabis infused dark chocolate bar with a hundred milligrams of blackberry and i'm gonna pull up the effects on that because it is a different strain blackberry is a mother strain of the blackberry kush so this is cool because i don't even realize ah it is raspberry cough crossed with the strain black domina and it's a buzzy and relaxing my tolerance has been pretty low and when i ate this hundred milligrams of course it started off a bit by bit like you know i'm really i'm just gonna eat one piece it's like i'll eat a few more pieces i'll eat the five pieces and then i you know eat the whole [ __ ] thing so before corova a different company used to sell thousand milligram [ __ ] bars and it would be like this giant scotch-a-roo thing i guess that's what you would call it and uh the whole thing was super strong so that [ __ ] was definitely the bang for the buck but i do understand why they cap it at 100 milligrams because i ate the whole [ __ ] thing you know and with munchies it's like you know it's a chocolate bar like obviously i want to eat the whole [ __ ] chocolate bar it's like really hard to just stop at one that [ __ ] is strong and there's so many memes about it that's the classic [ __ ] like oh these edibles and these edibles ain't gonna do nothing and then you know getting laid out by it it kind of tripped me out because again this is described as a relaxing high as a euphoric high but at just the highest dose like this it feels so strong in the head is like it doesn't really matter what strain it is it feels like this kind of sativa meltdown what's funny to me is every time this happens it's like getting too high or like you know even tripping or something it's in the moment i almost don't realize what's even happening because i was hitting my delta eight cartridge and i was just like damn i'm so [ __ ] hot i'm like this is crazy and then i was getting so high that i wasn't even thinking that i wasn't even realizing i'm just like what is happening like am i dreaming right now and like i just completely forgot that i even ate edibles i just wasn't even thinking about that i'm just like what happens like am i in between days am i in yesterday am i like about to go into tomorrow it was just uh it was really funny like being on that level so i just took a nap and kind of waking up during the nap and being like oh [ __ ] right i'm [ __ ] on edibles and i feel like psychedelics are almost easier to ride because in a psychedelic it's like it's crazy but you kind of ride with it and it'll change into something else it'll kind of like you know turn back around it'll loop but with an edible it's just like oh [ __ ] cause you know of course it's still just weed but it's just like a lot of input in the brain it's just like i wasn't able to just ride with it you know i was trying to go with the flow which is kind of like super powerful like trying to just sleep through it but then you know it's like halfway between the dream world it's a good time but it's just uh it's strong waves it's harder to just kind of like you know dissipate into it it's more just like definitely the blackberry edibles are very good smacked i was chapped i was very [ __ ] high and then i picked up some weight afterwards my uncle and i are convinced they're like is that edible you ate that weed and that's why you know like you got fat tasty stuff when i didn't know what weed i was getting and you know it still happens for sure that is one annoying thing is when it becomes super racy and you don't even know you just hit it it's like oh [ __ ] i like the strain because it is not that i find that sometimes with sativas it'll kind of like burn me out and then i'll actually kind of crash from the sativa and be very tired later later on so i'll pick a sativa because i'm like oh it's very energetic but then it kind of has a crash to it i like this indica i'm not feeling you know the gear is turning super fast i'm just feeling a good body high i'm feeling you know baked i'm feeling warm and generally that's what i'm looking for what i want to smoke you know as close to that as i can get that body and kind of hot great one i feel like for just chilling watching movies and [ __ ] for me like doing the editing not going too wild with it blackberry crossed with afghani kush well again shout outs to ganja berry they're the sponsors show them some love it's cool seeing these new companies pop up and this is definitely a fresh thing let me know if you want to see more strain reviews it is fun to delve into it because otherwise you know maybe i wouldn't have specifically looked out and tried some blackberry so i'm glad i did and this was a fun little experience especially having both the herb and the chocolate also yes this is the herb that has appeared in the stoned alone movies the upcoming detective trip as well as back in usa and this is a strain that i would recommend and come back to because it's very chill i'm feeling fantastic and i just finished it all so i would definitely love some more i enjoyed smoking this weed eating this uh chocolate i'll be seeing you around in the next time ciao and uh you know maybe hit that subscribe button if you will stay tuned for the movie", "QImpKpJ-QZE": "[Music] what's up poopypants is welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today's review is a bit of a classic which means edibles and today we are taking a look at spacejam cannabis infused sour gummy space drops and their handmade vegan cannabis treats so the box here is about all the information you want to see on it we've got lab tested results right there made then batch number all that good stuff and at the front we've got our milligram each eight point seven to perserve per serving for eighty seven point seven two milligrams total it was advertised as a hundred milligram edible but it looks like it only has eighty seven point seven two milligrams of THC oh this is a gummy of some kind but I'm not really sure exactly what they are sour gummy space drops let's find out together guys elevate your being with Space Jam okay so here we go inmate oh [ __ ] [ __ ] there are little drops just in a thing that looks just like this some paper Hana in there there's not much to it there as you can see the drops are in there let's give them a taste it was a pretty sour definitely definitely some cannabis taste to it gummies usually do not too bad it's better factious sour flavor and this sort of sugary salary crystals you can see there do a very good job of masking this THC I like the flavors quite a bit um it's pretty good they're a little chewy a little sour but all things considered this is a pretty fine tasting little gummy edible maybe it's the fact that it's made with premium ice hash water hash whatever the hell that is so guys I'm about to go see a movie this new one with Melissa McCarthy that doesn't look like a Melissa McCarthy movie as soon as that movie's over with and don't worry guys with all our reviews I'm gonna finish all ten of these drops gonna go see this movie gonna come out about two hours or so let you know what I think of the movie and more importantly what I think of these space jims cannabis infused sour gummy space drops I think I got all those nouns and adjectives there alright guys I will see in about two hours thanks for watching weeks and I'll see you in just a bit [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been two hours since I whoa no that's a lie it has been actually closer to four hours since I've had a space gem cannabis infused sour gummy space drops uh I finished up my movie and the title of that by the way was can you ever forgive me with Melissa McCarthy true story weird movie but what you're really here for space gems they're pretty good guys I actually really like the taste of them for gummies they tasted pretty good uh they have an excellent sour sort of snap that really matched the cannabis flavor and then most importantly they got me pretty high um this isn't the top tier gummy brand out there right now this isn't like Plus which is truly amazing but this does proclaim to have a little bit less milligram \u00e4j-- however and I neglected to mention in the first half it is actually a little bit more expensive this time uh this one cost me 20 something dollars whereas the Plus usually run about 15 pre-tax so this was a little bit more expensive for a little bit less of a high and I actually really like the way the Plus tastes as well so my recommendation to you is if your dispensary has both plus gummies and space gem try with the bullet stick with the plus but if you're looking for something a little different and this is the only gummy they've got I'd still recommend space gems again it's got a great flavor not a lot to eat not so much of a fan of the packaging as they almost all spilled out on me but they are a little pricey and they're not gonna get you quite as high I don't think it's the plus but still pretty good so before I bounce with you guys today I actually want to share with you a little cherry on top a little something and not weed related that you can enjoy throughout your week and this week I actually want to share with you the camera I'm using I picked up a GoPro Hero 7 black I've been using it to shoots in these videos finally got a better microphone on it and I love it it's great it's actually worked really well just as a little point and shoot camera for me for shooting reats videos and it's the hyperlapse stuff there are the hyper smoothing whatever they call it has been fantastic I've loved shooting some montages with it really cool really like the GoPro Hero 7 black and very strangely I was as I was deciding to do this as an endorsement billboard right up there so you know maybe that's what they were asking me to do I don't know all right guys well that's gonna do it for this cherry on top that's the GoPro Hero 7 black and that's gonna do it for this review the space gem handmade vegan and cannabis treats thank you so much for watching guys and we will see you on the next review peace", "ZLpZxkFB2-8": "[Music] what is up my friends and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary uh and on today's review I've got the spatula the wheat sworn spatula and the trusty jar of Nutella that means that we are reviewing something that does not have fat in it because THC and fat go hand-in-hand so we're reviewing today we are taking our third look I've reviewed two of these this type excuse-me of edible and past Oh or I guess you would call it an ingestible cuz it's not necessarily edible per se so we are taking a look at th C capsules medicinal softgels today this is our look at the pro canna THC plus hundred milligrams 250 milligrams soft gels as i said i've reviewed two caps in the past both of those were 300 milligrams one was pretty good the the if it was delta-9 yes the delta nine capsules were good I enjoyed them they were a little expensive I believe they cost thirty bucks for the 300 milligrams and then there was also I think it was the gold caps which were also 300 milligrams which were 50 bucks I believe and they were completely terrible they didn't do anything at all to me so I've got a hundred milligrams this time so less than the others but this was a more affordable price I guess linearly it's the same price as the delta nine as it was ten bucks for the two of the hundred milligram pack so you know it's the technically the same price but certainly a lot better price wise than the gold caps pretty simple little packaging here just a cardboard box with some you know directions there on the back advising that we consult a doctor before taking pro kanna don't know why doctor is capitalized there let's go and open up see what these look like uh-oh they are weirdly shaped so here we go here is one of the capsules right here in this little package they're ugly little capsule first let's do a little bit of the good old and Nutella my favorite part of all fat-free reviews is getting a nice scoopful a Nutella yum yum yum yum yum yum who doesn't love Nutella heartless folks that's him okay so that should hopefully be enough back for now and let's go ahead and plunk this in forgot to bring my handy trusty Arnold Palmer tea with me so I'm just gonna have to dry chuckle I swallow that's the word for it so let's do it three two one down the hatch got one more here three two one down the hatch okay well so I've had both the pillows now that's 100 milligrams of THC or so they say now in my body with the requisite amount of fat to help activate it now all we're gonna do is our for me I'm gonna wait two hours for you guys through the magic of editing it'll be just a couple of seconds and I'll let you know how these pro can uh THC caps are hitting in just about two hours so thanks for watching guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] alright guys I am back it has been two hours for me since I had the pro canna THC soft gels and let's do a little ocular test Whitis [ __ ] snow I don't know I want to let me say this right off the bat I want to love THC capsules I love the idea of them I love something that's discreet easy to take doesn't have any calories with it way of ingesting THC but these suck these didn't do anything for me I I mean it's I don't feel high at all nothing so in terms of what I have tried these are down there with gold caps they're not as good as the delta-9 obviously those got me at least you know somewhat high this is just a real [ __ ] product I don't know if it's on me oh and this time I also try it with fats I had had people in the bat before asked me like well maybe you need to try it with fat which I should have done anyways tried it with fat and still no result um I feel like I could you know if I was if I was a gymnast I feel like I could perform gymnastics if I was a mathematician I feel like I could perform some differential equations but I'm just a stupid idiot and I still feel like I can function as a stupid idiot even after two hours on the THC plus from poke pro canna man again guys I cannot articulate enough I would love for these to be the magic bullet you know an easy discreet portable way of getting THC with into your body that isn't either smoking vaping or having to consume something with a lot of sugar and calories I keep hoping for it I I don't think I'll be going back to pro kanna next time I have to review but I think I'm gonna keep trying to find that magic capsule out there to see if any of them work I'll do a couple more maybe maybe they're just not for me maybe there's something about mean that they just I just doesn't work as an ingestion method I would love to hear from you guys if you know any good capsule brands or if they work well for you please let me know leave a comment below or send me an email at wheats at wheats reviews.com and let me know what you think about these capsules because I'm trying to find a great one I'm hoping to find something that you know I can take with me to the airport something I can you know take with me into a concert you know that's not going to draw any attention to itself but so far of the three I've taken this I don't know if it's necessary worse than gold caps but it's not definitely not any better so far if you definitely want capsules stick with the Delta nine they're still not great they're still not my favorite way to ingest THC but definitely skip out on the procane a total dud of a product look at the [ __ ] back there that is the category that it's in and I am now just rambling so with that guys I am going to sign off from this review and that is going to do it for pro canna here on wheats thank you so much for watching guys and we will see you on our next review peace", "EI2FrKdifbk": "[Music] we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I've got a fresh look at that ooh that is pretty to look at a fresh jar of Nutella and pancakes love Nutella if you didn't know a fresh jar to tell us and that means we are gonna be reviewing some gummies that's right guys we're back with more gummies I always know I'm telling you to be wary of gummies I'm weary of gummies and I'm wary of these gummies so this was a 500 milligrams worth of gummies don't worry I'm not eating all 500 milligrams today we're just gonna do a test to see if there any potent whatsoever I picked these up for 30 bucks at my dispensary so a very good deal if these are in fact 500 milligrams worth of gummies I doubt that that is gonna be the case this is the canna MX brand taste innovation only the finest quality there are 50 gummy bears in here in total with 10 milligrams per gummy bear so we are going to do 20 in total for 200 milligrams and we're gonna do our review on 200 milligrams of the canon mix in total canna MX canna mix I'm gonna go with canna mix is how you say that it's spelled canna MX all one word unless so again 30 bucks for 500 milligram gummy edible is a great deal if in fact it works but there are a lot of red flags chiefly the price you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles second the packaging this isn't cheap easy to make packaging it's just a sticker on a ziplock bag always a bad sign to we're almost always a bad sign I've had a couple of good things come in cheap packaging like this but not a lot um and just the fact they're gummies that's also usually a bad sign I have bad luck with gummies there are a lot of people unscrupulous folks out there making gummies that aren't worth they're a damn and I'm hoping that isn't gonna be the kids that can of MX we're gonna give him a totally fair shot so I have Nutella just to uh turley completely boost my of getting any kind of tolerance she's taking a little bit of extra fat with the gummies just to help process that THC so here we go let's open them up give the taste test the smell test all that fun stuff so you can see the gummies in there they look like pretty plain gummies they don't have any coating on them they don't have anything additional on them it smells both intensely fruity and intensely cannabis ewwww so here we go nothing on the outside they're not sticky or anything like that I'm just gonna grossly dip it right in Nutella get some fat going here there we go mm hmm well I didn't really taste any cannabis but that might be because I've got the Nutella on it but Wow okay a little bit of cannabis taste on that one okay let's just try one clean here there's a slight cannabis taste to them but really these are on the less cannabis II and of gummy taste that I for gummies or less cannabis II tasting gummies that I've had also a bad sign this is not gross tasting like the etta pure infused creations which I find really hard to stomach although I don't find those to be any good whatsoever so I'm hoping that doesn't mean that these are gonna be bad but we'll have to find out so I've eaten four already I'm gonna do sixteen more and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review you don't really care about how these can be Bears tastes you want to know if Kanna MX is something you should be buying in the future so guys I'll see you in two hours to let you know for sure thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been two hours since I had the canna mx-5s quality 500 milligram gummies I only had 200 milligrams of them but there's not 200 milligrams of THC in there i am i high at all i'm like a - maybe somewhere in there don't feel pleasantly stoned I feel like I had to join an hour ago yeah [ __ ] Ken MX and their gummy bears it's a load of [ __ ] these aren't potent at all another crappy gummy and another crappy gummy company all the telltale signs were there that she priced the sticker the she packaging oh and all kin of MX no do not spend your money on these guys if you see them stay far far away I do have some of their chocolate bars to review maybe they'll be good I have seen where chocolate bars are still good and the gummy brands are bad where when people have both like um we get a flavor ex their chocolate isn't bad but their gummies are terrible so we'll see but as right now just pass on the gummy bears don't waste your money and [ __ ] these guys for you know where's the lab tested result where's the nutrition information where's all that good stuff it's not here because they don't want you to know because it's just gummy bears they bought off the shelf and infused maybe some cannabis in there possibly who knows maybe I'm just high because I smoked like two hours ago and that's what I'm still feeling not feeling anything most boy I this is like our sixth dud review in a row or something maybe we've had a string up they might not all come out in the order of duds in a row but I have reviewed a bunch of doodoo back to back to back I am really looking for a diamond in the rough a pleasant surprise I was hoping Kevin MX was it gonna be it I gave him a fair shot but definitely do not gonna be the gummy bears from them so final conclusion if you see Kanna mx4 now avoid everything I'll review their chocolate if their chocolates good I'll be sure to let you know we'll assess them fairly but for right now there's no reason to buy any of their products because if they're gonna rip you off with this it's more than likely they're gonna rip you off with other things so sorry to be a bummer guys I really wish we could have had something more fun for you but at least we know not to mix it up with Kanna MX or something so guys thank you so much for watching this review I appreciate you watching as always and we will see on the next review peace", "ULaV_ZP2b3Q": "[Music] hi friends welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another thing from canna candies there our first lollipop the grape medicated lollipop hundred milligrams of THC as rated by SC labs which is always great to get that little reminder that has been officially rated and it does have the THC as promised in there thanks the good folks at SC labs as I said this is my first lollipop not my first candy I've had hard candies from Canada candies before and in the grand scheme or scope of candies they're not bad I still wouldn't necessarily that wouldn't be my first choice for edibles I'd still stick with the confectionaries as always but the kind of candies are far from the worst types of candies so the lollipop I think cost me seven bucks at my dispensary which is a pretty affordable for a 100 milligram edible so let's just go ahead and open up and give it a and give it a taste here this is the first time you've ever tuned in two weeks the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this lollipop and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review not necessarily so much how it tastes so here we go we've got our big gourmet lollipop purpley black give it a lick how many to get to the center one to our you know things yep it tastes like a great bali pop without a lot of flavor and just a hint of weed exactly what I thought it was gonna be not great not terrible pretty much what you think it's gonna be as well think of a mild flavored grape lollipop with a bit of an earthy aftertaste except not as bad as sounding as that and that's what it's gonna taste like but guys without how hey how's this gonna make me feel for that you're gonna have to stay tuned and I will see you guys in two hours I'll be back right here to let you know how I'm feelin thank you so much for watching see you guys soon peace hi guys my dog squid here and I are back to talk to you about panic and ease Medicaid and lollipops the hundred milligram great flavor here I and I'm I'm kind of hi about what I would expect for a hundred milligram at all not a lot of red in the old I boss but again it's only 100 milligrams and I'm feeling about what I would think for that maybe a little bit lower probably just because it's a candy and those don't tend to hit me as hard as the confectionaries um but I don't I'm not dissatisfied with it it's again right in the sort of wheelhouse of what I was expecting didn't taste terrible I'm moderately high and for a candy it's it's one that I can recommend and it's pretty cheap bet like I said I think it cost me seven bucks so it's affordable it doesn't taste terrible and it got me pretty it got me a little high so it's what I was looking for what I was about what I was expecting if you're in the mood for a lower dose edible or if you're a new smoker and you want something a little bit higher dose that you can sort of media it out over time maybe give the lollipops a chance especially these ones from can of candies I can verify I and SC labs can verify you know they'll it will it will get you high and it doesn't taste too bad so that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I really appreciate you tuning in as always we we'll see you on the next review and thank you so much for watching peace okay hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "tXMt1Q1-YLc": "these rolled up to Lamar you so if I buy it going on one of my late night but I got souffle fleet they put it on spin move that we go be like s adaboost so without further ado it's a close-up hi Bert Club and get some little bird emojis flap in the comment section taking a look at base edibles they look at these dank gummies and these have 802 THC content of 500 milligrams for this entire package now each dose is about 3 pieces and that gives you about 50 milligrams of THC now eaten well ingesting cannabis is blade different than smoking it when your liver has to process it it gives you a way different hide then when you inhale it's a total body high where I'm smoking it gives you basically just a head um docena says that the appropriate dosage for these is different for each person and been conditioned so freebo taking these willy-nilly make sure that your you know how much they take for whatever problem you're taking them for if you're just using them recreationally still use caution when using or consuming these won't get take a look at some of these out the pack so let's get somebody's out this pack I got over here these are the gummies look like you can see inside here they have a blue one right here I see a blue one in this pack so there's no not really telling what colors you're gonna get um they're coated with like a looks to be like a sugary thing they're pretty soft like they're room temperature so there Gummy's guess if you froze on these stiffen up a lot I'm going to guess we'll eat the green one why not eat the green one and see what that tastes like so just pop this thing I see how we do I burped about to take one of these dank gummies now I have already took one earlier and I can feel fill it slightly I've been smoking all day but it's a very different kind of feeling and it's more of a relaxing feeling I will probably go to sleep right now sleep all night wanna try this bring window you know hopefully it'll uh increased my abilities sleeping Mike I don't typically sleep too well but I'm hopefully tonight these will help me crash there's a very slight cannabis scent from it it smells more like candy than cannabis not sure this is I want to say this might be Apple but also it also might be a line I want to say a Pluto John taste this sugar sugar doesn't seem to have that much of a cannabis taste on it and must be more inside the gummy so I'm gonna pop this in give it a couple chose and see if it tastes like alright that was a very nice apple taste didn't have a nice cannabis undertone to it too very chewy gummy unless you could kind of help with the texture of it yeah we'll check back this is a cold minute no all right berth up almost forgot check it for me for me it'd be very relaxed deep fry sleep forever right now gummies I mean it tastes real good got a nice cannabis tasting [Music]", "3jGouD-hQ60": "[Music] friends love movies the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I've got with me bakery fresh goodness that's right guys we're taking a look at odd on clearance from rouse for a dollar forty nine double chocolate love [Music] that's right guys we are taking a look at straight from the Ralph's bakery about 24 hours old and I guess so actually about 48 hours old because it's already 24 hours old because that's why it was that the clearance section we're taking a look at the double chocolate loaf cake but that's not true at all we just got the duckling double chocolate loaf cake here because we are doing another gummy review it has been a while since we reviewed some gummies so I figured it's time to dip our toe back in gummy land and take a look at cushy edibles watermelon rings contains 320 milligrams I picked this up in my dispensary for 15 bucks so 8 L of a good deal which should be red flags sirens blaring what do we have here shitty packaging just stickers on a ziploc bag an exaggerated a lot of milligram \u00e4j-- Oh gummies obviously gummies are already outside of a few examples look at flourish look at occasionally cushy punch or tiki killers uh we've got exaggerated mode grammage and a cheap price so that all tells us that this might not be as good as advertised we're gonna give them the benefit of the doubt and hope they're amazing but who knows when you see too good to be true pricing shitty packaging and gummies it's usually a recipe for failure but as I said we will give them the benefit of doubt and cross our fingers and hope that they are going to work so why do I have this double chocolate loaf cake well just to maximize my chances of getting high I like to take a little bit of fat before hand there's something to help process the THC in case it hasn't been properly managed so people bite of the double chocolate loaf I have a feeling it's gonna be the best tasting thing in this reveal this is dollar 49 at Ralph's on clearance it's still really good that's my dog nard hurting it real name's noop that corner okay I can upload a for now let's open up the packaging whoo these are stinky and ugly they're very green these watermelon rings look at how ugly that is it is just green all over if they're trying to win the contest for most edible looking most like looks like it has wheat in it they're doing a pretty damn good job but again it's not a contest about how it looks it's about how it makes you feel but before you have feel anything you got to try to taste it and I have a feeling I'm not gonna like the taste of these so here we go that's kind of weird it's like then what it doesn't that's kind of a neutral weedy taste but it's not terrible it's not as bad as at a pure infuse creations with their awful bitter gross after tasting this isn't that bad but the weedy tasting part is like the sugar on top it's quite odd each one of these claims to be a 20 dose 20 milligram edible really doubt that very curious again they're not great tasting but they're far from the worst tasting gummies have ever had I'm really intrigued by what is on top or whatever process they're using to get the cannabis infused it's really strange really strange you've never had an edible quite like this so guys well now I'm more curious than I was before when it comes to cushy edibles watermelon rings handcrafted in Los Angeles we're just gonna have to do the wait-and-see approach because I'm not sure so guys I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know for sure exactly how it's going I'm gonna finish off this whole bag there's 320 milligrams we'll see and I will let you know exactly how we're doing thanks so much for watching weeds and I'll see you in just a bit peace has been 2 hours since I had the cushy edibles of watermelon rings and ooh I don't it's definitely not 320 milligrams and we kind of knew that ahead of time and that's a huge strike against them exaggerating their potency but they're not totally devoid of potency I'm certainly a little high I'm kind of in the five ish range and I just don't know about the taste it wasn't disgusting but there was something very off-putting about having the sugar coating be the thing that has like the is cannabis infused it was it was very odd tasting wasn't disgusting but it was disconcerting in some way so I don't know I don't know how to articulate it exactly what does say lab tested on it again which is you know of course they're gonna say that oh it is infused coconut oil I'm seeing that now it must be the sugar that's infused I didn't I totally it's it's it's I'm confused by this one cuz she edibles because of this it does have some potency and it's affordable I got it for a pretty good price I just don't think it's as potent as they're saying and it's not gonna get you out rage ously hi I do have another cushy edibles to review and I am certainly going to review it so I would say hold off for now don't pick up any cushy edibles we'll see what the second one does if that review is favorable or you know negative whatever the case may be that's gonna be our final determination but for now if you see him at your dispensary and they are super cheap and you like gummy candy maybe give it a shot but I think I would tell people to hold off for now and the C for the second review if they're gonna you know prove to be good or bad hopefully we'll get a new termination in one way or the other alright guys and that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds thank you so much for watching I'm sorry I was a little bit wofully here I just I don't want to tell you to rush out and pick these up because again I don't think they're as I don't think there's 320 milligrams in there but they're not without their merits either and they just have a very odd taste sorry thank you so much for watching and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "cf9uSYlnJqE": "hey what's going on everyone jay ping here again with another west coast weed tour review today i'm going to be reviewing a product from one of my favorite edible companies on the west coast smokies we're going

little more there we go all right all right so she's the sticky one we've got a nice chewy gummy here it tastes to me like the sour patch kids the watermelon candies this is exactly what it tastes like like identical it's sweet you can taste a little bit of the cannabis on the inside of the gummy which i really like for me i use edibles to sleep i use them to go hiking as well and i like knowing that the cannabis is in there i feel like when you can taste it it affirmates the high a little bit [Music] i love it flavor is on point flavor is on point i'm thinking score out of ten aside from the packaging i hate i love how it views i just don't like it that it's in the bag i'd rather much rather be in a plastic container or some other kind of container but you know for me this product is almost a perfect product you know no gelatin made with pectin it does say distillate on it i think this is a 9.75 for me out of 10.", "ARVSswHjBDY": "you want gummy bears I got gummy bears you want CBD I got CBD you want CBD gummy bears I got CBD gummy bears what's up guys at your boy big J coming back at you again today from big Co TV where you watch decide in vain and today as promised I've got gummy bears all right but I've got gummy bears with CBD in them alright and they are amazing I've been using these two weeks ish I mean I've been using CBD on and off for quite a while alright and it actually works wonders for me for a lot of different things but we'll go into that in a minute these things they taste good they work well and it's an easy form for you to take your CBD that's what that's all I can say if you haven't tried CBD you truly need to try alright it's not a gimmick it's not you know you see all these wonder drugs if you're one of those people like me that don't like to go to the doctor you don't like to take the prescription stuff you're not a big fan of over-the-counter of this over-the-counter that and you just want something natural to help ease what you got going on try these alright just trust me and try these so without further ado let's go ahead and check out the bottle alright so here you go we've got the Big Daddy pack of CBD FX gummy bears as you can see CBD FX help gummy bears the 60 count oh yeah the Big Daddy does contain full spectrum CBD they are gluten-free non-gmo and vegan all right which is cool you got a you know there's a lot of vegan folks out there these days a lot of people that can't do Blut inand all that stuff you can still have these alright you can still have these that's cool trust me it's cool ingredients organic cane sugar organic tapioca syrup water organic seaweed extract natural flavors and colors organically grown CBD rich hemp oil gummy bears contain no corn syrup no animal gelatin no artificial sweeteners which leads to guilt-free indulging never tasted better very true these are delicious the statements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose treat or cure any disease always consult with your physician before use underage sale prohibited that's what I was talking about earlier the FDA hasn't said you know the FDA of course being the FDA says that you can't make claims you can't do this you can't do that about CBD because they haven't studied it so all I'm going to tell you about is my own personal experiences with these but we'll get to that again cannabidiol CBD is CBD FX is naturally occurring in the industrial hemp plant and legally imported and produced very important it is legally imported and produced CBD FX does not sell or distribute any products that are in violation of the u.s. Controlled Substances Act the USCS a hashtag feel the difference will roll around a little more supplement facts a serving size is two gummy bears so basically there are 30 servings in here 16 calories per serving so that's 16 calories for two gummy bears no fat 3.6 grams of carbs 2 grams of sugar 20 milligrams okay of hemp per serving and 10 milligrams of CBD per sir roll it around again and bang we're back to the front now for my favorite part I'm gonna go over some facts and eat a couple of these alright guys so as promised here it is got my facts sheet now just so I can make sure I'm telling you the right stuff so on the bottle you saw the CBD is legal that is used inside this product you may have looked and went well why is CBD legal you know I've heard the CBD isn't legal done it up let me go over that okay our products are exempt okay meaning CBD FX's products are exempt from the CSA and DEA s drug scheduling practices which classify whole half extracts as schedule one drugs because extracts from the stocks of European grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice and that is where the hemp is grown that these guys use to extract the CBD it is grown the biomass is over in Europe their product does meet the standards of the 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp which means it has to contain less than 0.3% of THC in the gamete or in the product period in the CBD oil period and again they only use CBD that is derived from a European biomass so that's how it's legal it is also non psychoactive and non psychoactive hemp was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 so there are your working facts now let me tell you a couple other things that are also some facts these things are freakin delicious alright the red they're my favorite color alright they taste like a fruit punch slash cherry I mean they're delicious so pop the cap you're gonna have a little safety seal I just normally yeah I just shut my thumb through here they gave me a couple bottles of these but I figured to show you your fresh bottle so pop it open and really they are little gummy bears I mean they look just like gummy bears and they basically tastes just like gummy bears except with a little pop so there you go it really is just a little gummy but I mean you know what I love these things so now that the FDA which you can and what you can't say let me roll that around so you get a nice glamour shot there since the FDA has determined what you can and can't say I'm just gonna tell you some personal experiences for me again I've been using CBD on and off three years what it does for me and in particular the CBD F FX products what they have done for me I used to be the guy that goes to bed let's say 10 o'clock at midnight I'm still up why cuz my brain won't stop okay it won't turn off I'm just going going going going going sit there flip through social media think about work think about this think about that couldn't shut my mind off I popped two of these half hour hour before bed I'm out and when I'm out I mean I am out don't wake up in the middle of the night no tossing no turning just everything just shuts down that's nice alright that's what I use it for also I work in a warehouse during the day yes that's right I am NOT the YouTube famous you know YouTube superstar I have a day job um and a work at a warehouse I do a lot of walking around you know up ladders down ladders all kinds crap I come home I am sore alright pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away okay after a workout at the gym pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away I mean it's not it's not a super drug but it takes the edge off for me okay other people you know say they use it for anxiety and stuff like that I don't really know if I have anxiety but I will say when I do take them it puts me in a just a nice mellow mood but it's not anything that you that you aren't functional you know I mean I could eat these in the morning before I go to work put in eight hours all day and still be totally fine doesn't make me drowsy even though it does help me fall asleep but the reason that helps me fall asleep like I says it just helps me turn my mind off so that being said I highly suggest you try something like I said if you're like me you don't like all the over-the-counter crap you think a lot of stuff that the doctors give is just you know blah blah mumbo-jumbo because they want you know Big Pharma wants to show some pills down your throat try these all right just try them what's the worst that's gonna happen it doesn't work for you okay sorry you know but I'm telling you most of the people that I talk to they've tried this it works for once you find out how many you actually need okay just because it says take two too might not work for you you might need four you might need six okay try it don't just write it off if it doesn't work the first time okay trust me just give me a favor and trust me on that it does work it really does I wouldn't I wouldn't I'm not the snake oil salesman all right so I'm just gonna be done trying to convince you hopefully you take my word for it and try some if you do want to try something check the description below you're gonna find a link directly to the big co website takes drinkler to the product buy it okay put it in your cart send it to your door try a couple gummy bears you know take the edge off guys just take the edge off all right so until next time it is your boy big J for VAP Co TV where you watch the side of a pan I am power

hard-earned dollars at your dispensary and which ones are utter junk and today we are talking about one of my favorite companies when we haven't had a chance to review a product from in a while because they haven't had anything new coming out but now thanks to the new regulations here in California that make edibles be a hundred milligrams max and ten milligrams per serving Korova one of my all-time favorites has come out with a brand new line here they have the Korova Saturday morning mini cookies ten milligrams per cookie at it for a hundred milligrams total so ten cookies in here at ten milligrams each it's a huge package it's so much bigger than their normal packaging which is crazy its its massive and it was only ten bucks but then again that's a bit that's more expensive than their one hundred and fifty milligrams cookies that they used to have that were just single cookies but it's big packaging because it is holding ten little mini cookies in here I really like the packaging it's very handsome I really quite like it a lot it's got the new props on there keep refrigerated bla bla bla bla bla but shows you know it's compliant with them new regulations and then here on the back it's got it finally has nutrition information corroded before I don't believe actually had nutrition information on their packaging but they do now and it's got like the ingredients and all that fun stuff on there and now they have this child resistant packaging that is very tough to open because I've tried opening one of these before and they're quite difficult to open especially if you've not encountered it before I'm super excited to try these it actually I've been wanting to review them for a while they've taken me some time to find they're not in available and a lot of dispensaries yet which is odd because you know supposedly next month is when these regulations take effect although I believe you have until July to like get rid of your old stock of stuff but yeah I assume you'll start seeing these everywhere soon but I've been wanting to review these for some time because I assume they'll be as ubiquitous as kirova in no time so here's that obnoxious child-resistant packaging you have to place one thumb in the middle of the zipper and place one thumb into the back panel zipper and pull gently apart it's easier said than done you know what I'm just gonna cut into it because I hate it I hate the child-resistant label packaging I'm a child I'm too down for it dumb child here we go here are the mini cookies ooh they're handsome quite like them aesthetically they look a lot like the full-size versions don't have very much of a weeds odor chewy and kind of crunchy but good nice pretty good very little canvas ace if any at all I'd like it just as much maybe even a little bit more than their 150 milligrams Saturday morning cookie it's great it's got the rice krispies in there good cookie good cookie taste it's a little bit chewier and crunch here than I was expecting it to be but it's not bad it's not bad not a bad combination at all i I'm not dreading having to eat nine more of these so guys I'm going to finish the rest of this bag off I've got a lot more to get through and then I will be sure to let you know how I am feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review process I'm probably about two and a half three hours or something on my way to go see a movie and as soon as I get out of there I will let you know how I'm feeling thanks so much for watching wheats guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] alright guys I am back it has been two hours since I had the kirova mini cookies medical cannabis Saturday morning cookies 100 milligrams THC 10 cookies and I am more than pleased to report that kauravas unrivaled potency is in still intact this is a strong hundred milligrams in these 10 cookies here in fact my only complaint about it is and it is a complaint well I guess my two complaints there the packaging sucks I don't like this child restraint and packaging because I'm I'm stupid I'll fully grot to that and you know I'm not I'm an intelligent person but it's annoying it's hard to open even trying to follow the directions it's not like the childproof pill bottles that are very easy to take off that's a minor complaint the big complaint is it's a lot to consume for one person I know these are designed for 10 servings and they really are because it's a lot to consume it's I mean you can see how big this packages and it's packed to the brim with those cookies it's for our calories of cookies which isn't a whole lot but at the same time ten of those little mini cookies it's not a insignificant amount it certainly feels like more than one of the normal size but still I'm gonna recommend it especially for this new wave of products that are coming in that are going to be these ten milligrams servings of ten servings each this is probably going to be really great III heartily recommend it if you cannot find if the any of the other Korova still lying around if your dispensary is only prop to 1/5 compliant grab these you'll be happy you did if not go ahead and stick with the original batch because that's gonna do you better but but these are a fine replacement it's not the end of the world for edibles but you know it's not it's not going to be the same same world we remember anyways guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching thank you so much and we will check you out on a later review peace that's okay", "uwlphjFS8Hw": "[Music] the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking our second look at cushy edibles and we'll see if they come under our new two strikes and you're out role here at wheats we don't have time for that [ __ ] third strike so that's right guys we are taking our second look at cushy edibles and we are looking at another one of their three hundred and twenty milligrams the first time we reviewed their 320 milligram watermelon rings this time it is the gummy bears there are 32 gummy bears in there in total with 10 milligrams each so if you watch my first video you will know that I was skeptical about their claims of having 320 milligrams in this package and I seem to be vindicated at the end when I wasn't as high as I expected to be I was a little high sure but not not three hundred and twenty milligrams worth so this time we're gonna come in even more skeptical and if they indeed fact if they in fact are are exaggerating their potency claims will will put the fire to them so uh one strike against them that we talked about last time was their price I think these were priced at like 15 bucks which is insanely good value for a 320 milligram gummy but I don't think they're 320 milligrams so like after my last review I decided to do a little bit uh to do my due diligence I guess and because they do claim to be lab tested there they do have the audacity to claim that I decided to search them out so I found their website and lo and behold they have a tab for lab results and I clicked that excitedly and thinking I was gonna have to forgive them but then it looks like it's actually oh they only have two lab results posted both for products tested on November 9th 2017 and neither one of those products are in edible flower that they also sell so they have gotten something lab tested but not these edibles which is really really deceptive of them so that one's for your deceptive practices but if these gummies get me outrageously high you know we'll forgive and forget so let's let's see here let's go ahead and open up this package also I found these gummies to be last time oh and these seem to be the same case there's definitely cannabis odor in there these are covered in this weird sugar that is it's like where the cannabis oil is infused it's not like any gummy I've ever had before or edible gummy it's when the infusion is in the sugar it's weirder it's not as bitter as like a net appear or infused creation but it's it's certainly not as bitter it's not as bad tasting but there's something off-putting about it anyways let's go ahead and give them a taste these are about the exact same again not disgusting and there are certainly worse edibles out there but whatever that coating is is just it's not pleasant and there's a lot of it so it's just a little disconcerting and it's very oily as you may or may not be able to see so that's something to look out for if you're really sensitive those kind of things and that guys is gonna do it for this first half of this review here I'm gonna finish off all these gummies unfortunately and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to let you know how I'm actually feeling do you see if this product is worth its weight or not thanks so much for watching weeds guys I'll see you soon [Music] Oh guys I am back it has been two hours since I had 29 of the 32 cushy edibles gummy bears I could not stomach the last three I am sorry if you consider this review incomplete my apologies I got 90% of the way there literally it's just that the closer you got to the bottom the more drenched they were in that sugar oil combination and they just got disgusting I mean just disgusting again it wasn't a bitter taste it was just an oily waxy nasty gross gross gross gross gross and that's the least of its problems the most important part of its problems is it's not potent there's there's there's no way there's 320 milligrams in here as a matter of fact I mean I feel less high than I had with the watermelon rings granted I've eaten a little bit less but I feel a whole number point less high than I did before I feel like maybe a 3 right now somewhere in there this is just a bad product Cushie edibles shame on you for lying about your milligram egde shame on you for your stupid story that you have online about what a cool brand you are looking out for the customer and yadda-yadda you got a bunch of horseshit well you know what I'm sorry I said all that I would love to talk to you guys if any one of you wants to come on wheats and talk about your products and and and tell me why I'm wrong and maybe show me the show me the batch that got lab tested so I can see for myself that you actually do what you say and I would love to talk to you guys and I promise I'll be I'll be fair and and equitable with you so I'd love to have you on email me wheats reviews at gmail.com or wheats at wheats reviews calm hit me up on Twitter Facebook whatever I'd love to talk to you guys again give you a chance to to you know have your own to have your sake because I think that's important too but my say is they're bad I think this is a bad product from a dis reputable company I'm sorry but I think it's true Cushie edibles mega pass from me mega mega pass gross taste and misleading milligram egde Oh bummer bummer bummer bummer another we've had like four or five bad ones in a row I feel like who well it's um gold we'll strike gold soon we'll find we'll find that diamond in the rough I'm sure here on weeds but we've had a string of bad ones but that can only mean good things ahead and that guys is gonna do it for this review here on weeds thank you so much for watching sorry I've been such a downer on this review I it bums me out when I have to bum anybody else out but you know I do what I can alright guys well whatever that means thank you so much for watching weeds and I'll see you guys soon peace", "egNB5MXTmmc": "[Music] hello squid the marijuana reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another drink Dixie elixir that's hard to read as Dixie there di xi\u00e8 elixir there are half and half lemonade NT th C infuse 100 milligrams so I reviewed a lot of drinks here on wheats and I find them to be pretty good there's some really great ones out there cannabis quenchers awesome Jasper's amazing there of course some Dead's out there but on the whole I do like the drinks so I'm really looking forward to this Dixie elixir half and a half a pretty cool little bottle here it's got a wrapper on the outside I kind of like the idea is that the cap there at the top if you want a dose the cap is designed to help you dose appropriately helps you decide like you know oh what's 10 milliliters blah blah blah blah blah what's it what's a dose of course we're going to ignore that and just drink the whole bottle in terms of half and half I love me some Arnold Palmer's which is what a half lemonade half iced tea is love love love them so I'm hoping like this the drinks in terms of taste are all over the map sometimes they're really bad like as Aspen but that means they can produce excellent rewards like zest and sometimes they're not too bad but they often have this really bitter aftertaste and I find that to be pretty often the case with the drinks I'm having trouble getting it off which is you know par for the course for me we're almost there keep peeling this plastic layer off until we eventually get to the goods oh boy there she goes okay there she is all defrocked there's a little cap that you can pour it in so on the back we've got our ingredients and our nutrition information I sadly don't see any lab and testing results but that's okay we're gonna hope that it has 100 milligrams in here it says shake gently before consuming which is what we shall do I assume this opens like a childproof lid it does handsome looking bottle there down the hatch hmm it's okay definite cannabis taste to it more tea than lemonade taste it's not too bad um it's only eight and a half ounces so I'll be done with it in no time again there is a slight cannabis taste to it it's not as bitter as the cannabis quench reserves ASP but but it is there so if you really hate that cannabis taste you might want to pass on this one but for me I'm uh I'm I'm I'm David it's again it's not as bitter as some of the the other brands out there hopefully it means it's still gonna be nice and strong so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I'm gonna come back to you in two hours like all of our reviews to let you know how this Dixie elixir has landed thanks for watching weeds guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] Dixie elixir half and half and it's pretty good it is in the oh it got me to about a six I'm about a six right now 400 milligram edible that's not bad and one that only costs eleven bucks which I think I neglected to mention the first half I'm pretty pleased with it the taste was good for a drink it wasn't outstanding tasting and it didn't get me crazy high but overall it's a pretty good little product one that I'm pleased with if you pick if you see it at a dispensary near you and you're looking for a drink and they don't and you don't want to get completely [ __ ] up the Dixie elixir might be the product for you I think I might try another one in the future see how it goes for me but overall this is a it's gonna give them my own thumbs up for me not a not a ringing endorsement but but far from uh from a negative review so uh that's gonna do it for this review here guys a nice short and sweet one but before I go and share with you a little cherry on top something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily we'd really did something I just love that I want to express to you guys and hopefully you will dig as well and this week uh it is going to be Silicon Valley yay there's a little Dinesh in a little guilfoyle now normally I'm very much against these little pop vinyls I think that's what they're called these things just seem like capitalism gone amok but well here becomes capitalism run amuck I think I got in flight two for $5.00 at Gamestop and I was like well III have to have a Dinesh and Gilfoyle so Silicon Valley uh-huh on HBO great great show by the legendary Mike judge of beavis and butthead and king of the hill and office space the movie so it's a great show about that Lampoon's Silicon Valley and I just culture hysterical in its fifth season right now on HBO check it out if you haven't I'm sure you've heard about it from people other than just me and that guys is gonna do it from the cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat thank you so much for sticking around to the very end guys and we will see you on the next review peace", "mdRGicxzPIw": "all right so this isn't something i'd normally buy but i picked up a uh chocolate bar from true leave and uh it's you know uh it's only 100 milligrams so i'll end up eating a whole bar i'll probably do 150 at a time of my uh rso but uh i figured i'd just go ahead and open it up and see we'll see what i get here hmm doesn't seem to want to come out let's try the other end okay it comes taped oh i see there's little child proof tabs [Music] thc well they really don't want you to get into these so 10 squares 10 milligrams each let me go ahead and try a sample here hmm okay that's a decent dark chocolate oh yeah slightly fruity like a lot of darks are well uh i'll eat at least half the rest of the bar and i'll put something in the description thanks a lot", "DKyoJGC4krs": "what's going on ladies and gentlemen in YouTube I'm here to do an unboxing of cushy punch it's a cannabis infused gummy ok so at first glance you'll see that the dose is clearly stated what it's made from full-spectrum cannabis oil on the side you can see that they are allergen free and kosher so if you have a lot of dietary restrictions this might be the product for you also has ingredients organic cane sugar organic just kidding Oh probably is I don't know the whole thing is 10 doses altogether 100 milligrams and one milligram a CBD ok well let's see let's just open this bad boy up and see what we got alright oh this is upside down alright it looks like it comes in a blister pack and it is in fact 10 gummy pieces single dose is recommended as you can see this gummy does not come separated it's a little oily I'm actually getting a lot of oil on me and honestly I since I only paid ten dollars for this I am gonna eat the whole thing and get back to you guys in an hour Bon Appetit and let's get into it hey guys I'm back it's been an hour and I'm here to do a review of the cushy punch gummy this is the 100 milligram okay so yeah not even an hour in and it hit me man I am [ __ ] stoned definitely something that's worth $10 at bottom $20 edibles that I've split in half and like they haven't gotten me this high before a lot of $10 edibles themselves from other companies haven't gotten hi before another thing I didn't mention was the taste this actually doesn't taste too bad for being as small as it is usually the small candies taste like absolute [ __ ] this one was actually pretty good I will say I am actually very impressed because I smoke every day and this this has got me really faded you know there really isn't much else to say this product is pretty good I will be reviewing more in the future but if you want to check this out they're cushy punch calm I've got this in Southern California so yeah look forward to seeing you guys in the next one let me know in the comments why I sucked or you know just roast me for whatever let me know how I can do this [ __ ] better so I can do in the next video alright peace out guys", "zaml88FpweU": "all right what is up everybody Jacobs back with another video for you guys quarantine video I've been staying at home that's about it some exciting [ __ ] for you guys this time though we got some sour patch dummies right here 500 milligrams straight to the dome you know we're doing them so it's like I believe it's like 10:30 in the morning so I'm gonna be in candy in the morning but which I don't like but I feel like this is gonna be a really good high so I wanna like have it last the majority of the day instead of like taking it like later in the afternoon then falling asleep like halfway through the high or some [ __ ] I don't know got these for $25 from the not from like directly from a dispensary but from a friend of mine so yeah there's a pretty good price I think if you were to go to like a dispensary or something they usually charge $10 per hundred milligrams so kind of a good deal but yeah I'll show you these guys again know if you can see right down there 500 milligrams yeah 500 huh so yeah let's dig in so that's pretty cool just like I don't know little sour patch kids they don't look quite the same the sugar is kind of weird it looks wet and another thing it says on the back here five servings per container serving size one piece but there's like just way more than five pieces in that I don't know if you guys can see but we're taking doesn't taste like weed at all it's a lot better than that nerd rope I had that [ __ ] was like I don't think I like nerds I don't know but I did eat like a banana like I think an hour or 45 minutes ago just to sort of like activate my metabolite I don't know but oh yeah and something else I forgot like I figured like people would just figure did I do it that way but like I keep like I got a lot of comments on the last one I did like the nerd rope the nerd rope 400 milligram edible I think it was there were a lot of people that like just thought that video was like one video or like one time I think like I just got a bunch of like comments that were like you know edibles take longer than 10 minutes to hit and I was like well you really think I've like a weed Tube channel and I don't know the edibles don't hit immediately after you eat them so I mean I don't know I mean but just this isn't gonna be the whole video like I'm gonna check back in like an hour two hours whenever I start like really feeling high and that's gonna be me then later so alright cleared the whole bag we're out of these shits so I'm gonna check in and like last like an hour maybe two hours maybe three hours however long this takes to take effect yeah I'm gonna take one more head of this [Music] little baby hit but yeah I'll check back in with you guys about two hours or so so peace alright so check him back in guys it is now 2:30 so it's been about three or four hours and I am [ __ ] high I'm so high like I just feel like good and like cozy like I don't know in movies right now I'm on yes man with Jim Carrey shit's hilarious but yeah I just been chilling and I had two bowls of cereal but ya know how feelings [ __ ] good this is like holy [ __ ] this light that I have for the lighting like he's really [ __ ] bright yeah I would definitely recommend these who these things are [ __ ] dope they smacked me in the face cuz holy [ __ ] I'm I like him actually like I don't know I feel pretty good about him at least right now edible you know just kind of chill cuz yesterday I got like I drank so much like an I passed out I'm so tired and I threw up it was just like a horrible day so this just yeah it's a lot nicer everything like I don't know everything I look at like specifically focus on like looks very like clear and like clean but then everything else behind it is it like such an intense like a blur well yeah I'm just really chilling you know like this I like I said this is definitely a [ __ ] fire edible I [ __ ] with this i 100% recommend it but I'm other than that I have no idea what to talk about I kind of just want to know getting my [ __ ] back get in my bed and watch this movie so yeah I'll take one last rep I haven't been smoking too much we're hiding actually I had a couple reps of this like I think three hours in or so not too long ago he's dying but I did that because I was like kind of feeling the body high a little bit but I was just like nervous that it wasn't gonna be intense enough for whatever reason sometimes he sings some like a [ __ ] hit or miss but yeah so I smoked and then I like got really high and yeah I think I'm like getting maybe close to like the full effect I don't know how long this will last but I think usually the potent ones are the more potent the longer it lasts so maybe it's still building up but either way I'm just trying to chill out so I hope you guys are smoking I hope you guys enjoyed the video [ __ ] sour patch dummies stay high stay lifted stay quarantine stay clean and peace everybody", "wDEe9C5786s": "[Music] you show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking our fourth look third look at a syrup lien that is I think the kids are calling it lien these days which i think is a take-off of when you used to do scissor with codeine in it this is not codeine this is just weed just good old-fashioned THC straight from the earth the good stuff none of that none of those opiates or opioids or anything to get you addicted so this is a pro methylene liquid syrup two fluid ounces watermelon flavored and it proclaims to be 600 milligrams of indica THC I guess they're saying it has 1200 milligrams of syrup total and half of it is indica of course we're gonna be doing the entire bottle 600 milligrams is a dot I'm not gonna do 600 milligrams right from the get-go although I'm pretty sure this might be another scam so I picked this up very cheaply I think it was 35 bucks for a 600 milligram syrup which is a very good deal if in fact is true but let's take a look at this bottle and just see what kind of red red flags just sort of pop off look how cheap it looks just a gross little cheap sticker poured out on there you can barely read what is you know what's on there because the printing is pretty awful shake well every use it's very muddy muddy is the adjective they use fair enough in THC We Trust so again this little bottle it proclaims that 600 milligrams hc' but I am skeptical because of the price because of the size because of the packaging all of that leads me to believe that this might actually be a another scam but I am certainly hoping to get quite high off of it and I realize I probably should have brought something to drink with me in case this thing tastes truly wretched which it might very well so let's go ahead and take a look at this Pro methylene liquid syrup let's shake it very well because it's muddy now it suggests that for a beginner to do half a teaspoon it says for an expert to do 2 to 3 teaspoons or 4 Club meanies whatever the hell that means 4 to 7 teaspoons which is what we're gonna be doing I have no idea what Club MIM is is maybe you guys can help me figure that out come on let's focus camera there it is 4 to 7 teaspoons tablespoons rather Club em I am eyes II don't know all right so our muddy stuff is shooken oh it smells really bad and it looks really gross look at the top there ah oh it is muddy as they said it is muddy well maybe I should go get something to mix it with [ __ ] it here we go 3 2 1 down the hatch see how much we can get down ooh ooh we got a lot of it down we got most of it there yak it's actually not super super gross it's not good tasting by any stretch but I'm gonna finish it off I'm gonna give my second self a second to let that percolate through my stomach and then I will be back to you guys like all of our reviews I'm coming back to you guys in two hours to let you know how this promy Faline what a dumb name is actually hitting because that's the most important part of this edible review you don't really care how it tastes because you're gonna CAC it down no matter what it does if it gets you high so we'll find out soon guys I will see you in just a bit thanks for watching wheats see you soon welcome back to wheats guys it has been two hours since I had the pro me feeling whatever it's called I don't need to say their name anymore because I don't need to give them any advertising it is a bunch of gar [ __ ] 600 milligrams my booty look at those eyeballs white as the winters snow I fell feel roughly infinity more times hi doing a cannabis 100 milligram syrup than that six hundred milligram syrup from Pro methylene and my buddy squids here to join us hey squiddy so yeah do not give them any money just like I thought it was a total total scam an absolute trying to fleece you for your money there's nothing in there it tasted terrible at the bottom because there was a lot of like ground-up plant matter or whatever in there it was disgusting I don't know what it was probably wasn't actually weeds I certainly don't feel hi disgusting I at the very bottom tasting does didn't get me high at all an absolute it's like I took $35 and lit it on fire an absolute travesty of a product do not buy it if you see it at a dispensary tell them not to carry it because they're just doing their customers a disservice by carrying this [ __ ] that is Pro methylene I think I'm not going to look again because I don't want to if I have it wrong great they don't need the they don't need the endorsement they don't need the free advertising but I wanted to share with you some little message of positivity something something something to look forward to so I even though normally in these quick short bad reviews they don't come with the cherry on top this time I think I'm gonna go with a give you guys a little cherry on top a little something that you can take with you uh something to enjoy over the next week or so just that can be enjoyed with or without weed something that will just bring a little bit of a joy or a smile to your face so on this cherry on top I want to just recommend a youtube channel that I like quite a bit and that is PBS is eons PBS's eons PBS has a bunch of really great like science channels that all range from about seven to fifteen minute videos and all kinds of different topics Aeons is a great one talking a mixture between geology archaeology paleontology and a bunch of other cool subjects and topics all sort of rolled into one giant eon uh I think that's that's right alright so yeah check that out PBS is eons ye ons and just search for that on YouTube you'll find it it's a great thing to watch well hi just let the videos rule and and learn some cool stuff and that guys is gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats sorry it was such a shitty one we've had a real run of losers in a row here but good things ahead I'm so guys thank you so much for watching weeds and we will see you on the next review peace", "h-6YwrWLcZc": "[Music] hi friends welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I'm gonna be a basic [ __ ] in two different ways I'm gonna be your basic [ __ ] because I'm reviewing your most basic of edibles your Chiba choose that's right your Chiba choose I believe this is their deco dose 100 milligram edible and it's America's favorite edible according to High Times on the back is certainly not my favorite edible this is the second time I reviewed a Chiba Choo I found them to be too expensive for what you get the first time I reviewed them I didn't find to be terrible I found it to be good tasting and it got me a little high but overpriced and I assume this is also going to be overpriced for a hundred milligram edible I do like seeing on the back the lab results and I do like seeing the nutrition information the ingredients you can see all that on the back there which is really nice and in the second way that this makes me a basic [ __ ] in addition to getting the most basic edibles is its PSL flavor that's right guys this is the pumpkin spice latte hybrid hundred milligram at th C Chiba two so when you compare this with your favorite Starbucks latte or take it on its own which is what we're gonna do I've never actually had a pumpkin spice latte I'm not sure I actually like pumpkin spice anything but you know we'll give it a go I assume Chiba choose are gonna be one of the casualties in the New Age of edibles that are coming out soon because they're not dosed in the 10 milligram variety so there it is that's all you get for your money in this little tiny rectangle right here this pathetic little rectangle is your full of your monies every cent of it goes in there and let's see if we can actually get this caramel out out losing any of it there it goes there it goes so here is our dose PSL flavored pumpkin spice latte Chiba choo we'll pop it the whole thing in hmmm very basic no it's good it does have a slight weed taste to it um but the sort of cinnamony taste of the pumpkin spice helps mask it but there is a weed taste to it it's not overwhelming but there it is there just to let you guys know but overall it's my kind of edible small discreet I think it weighs 0.3 four ounces and it only has 44 calories in total so kind of like that that's great small and discreet but guys the most important part of the edible review it's not about how it tastes it's not about what kind of packaging it's in it's not about any of that kind of stuff it's all about how it makes you feel and for that guys you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer for me I'm gonna come back to you after I see the death of Stalin so I'll be back to you guys in about two two-and-a-half hours to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching wheats it I'll see you guys soon peace guys [Music] it has been well more than two hours since I last checked in with you talking Chiba choose here and I gotta say I enjoyed the movie way more than I enjoyed the Chiba choo not that I didn't that I find some value in this pumpkin spiced caramel hundred milligram from Chiba choo it's just I didn't find as much value as I do from a Kanaka or akarova or any number of other edibles out there it's I'd say it was 100 milligrams yeah I felt like it didn't feel that strong I say again to beat a dead horse here as a can of Quahog milligram err but it felt pretty strong it's just for that price I could have gotten to Kanaka cookies easily for the same price as this and while this is nice and discreet I really like the fact that I don't have to eat as much that I do getting to you know or I can't go cookie it didn't taste incredible there was a cannabis taste to it still so it wasn't like it had this amazing flavor either for me this is going to probably be a pass going forward with Chiba choose this is our second hundred milligram of that we've reviewed from them and the second time I found them to be okay at best so I think I'm gonna tell you to skip the Chiba choose going forward unless you really really really want something small and discreet and even then there are other options out there like punch bar that are gonna get the job done but one thing that I am going to recommend and I'm gonna use it as our cherry on top for this review here is the movie I just got out of and that is the death of Stalin by [ __ ] Armando Iannucci anoche something the guy who created veep is what you need to know his brand new movie starring sexual creep Jeffrey Tambor looks like a sexual creep Steve Buscemi and just about creepy people so go check it out it's hysterical and also very very disturbing that is the death of Stalin playing in some theaters near you I hope go see it I laugh my ass off and I was also very very disturbed which is my favorite experience in a movie theater thank you so much for watching guys and thanks for sticking around the end of this cherry on top and we will see you on the next review peace", "2wDYRJvP8EQ": "hi guys just in yes yes yes we've got this review it's the one that you've been waiting for guys peace would love to each and every single one of you out there yes yes it is the one I've been waiting for more than anything as you guys know I have not had many edibles meda balls candies and lots and lots of cakes and that's of the thing basically I have never had gummy candies so yeah very very nice nicely packaged looks just like authentic three hundred milligrams of infused candy THC trolly sour bright crawlers so yeah and then there's a disclaimer on the back medication in this package was distributed with local state into in initiatives regarding medicinal cannabis laws it may be legally obtained only by a qualified patients keep out of reach of children and pets so guys yeah my pets will not be having this yeah the lovely lovely packaging I will do these are alive as well I just have not tried them I'm gonna do a video first so I'm gonna do a video of me eating them and giving you like a taste sort of review on them what they're like what they taste like and then what I'll do is I'll go off and I'll have a walk for an hour I'm gonna wander around tang and then I'll come back and I'll stick the camera back on again and then you guys can see the effects so I want to do it this way because I'm a little bit scared because I've not tried B so I'm gonna test the water a bit fair so I can obviously put the camera on take one draft let the effects of take fact see how it affects me and then come back on what I don't want to do is put it straight on a live stream when I haven't tried it before because I don't know I was going to affect me I don't know what I'm gonna do so I'm gonna try it first and I've got others and to be able and to go back to and obviously do do you actually on the livestream so I will be still all alive tonight but obviously with a break Eve in between so I can actually see how these are actually affecting me cheers guys but still baking out here snores really really really bacon oh God sweater right yeah let's get on with these met balls of gummy candies so yeah really really nice guys I'm impressed with them let's just undo them proper seal do like my sweet so it's obviously gonna go down Wow nice oh look at those ah I look at these guys so yeah they do look like the the real McCoy to me hey you want to get them mixed up with normal sweets which you let's be honest let's see what it tastes like you can taste medicine them like can't work out is it the sugar let's infuse it all of it is infused there you go that's quietly she probably everything yeah I mean I'm a regular smoker so I think to be honest with you I'm giving it the packet and then we'll just see what happens but 300 milligrams I should be alright and they were dosed too probably so you can feel the effects of an edible is probably what just over 100 milligrams is it light light light effects yes nothing they say it's da ting keep out of reach of pets that is you - you're on a gurney da ting well they takes very fruit a it just tastes like normal sweets once you get into them but initially when you first put them in your may you can taste a little bit of green on a little bit and medicine a little bit of cannabis I think there's something in the sugar there's something in the sugar and once you take the sugar off there but it just tastes like a normal gummy sweet guys yeah dying nice Joe say hi one of them one of them all right so point look a bit less by eight in a pack oh this is about 150 milligrams I've had so far damn all of that one Oh they're very very easy to read very very boys and they just look amazing they just a proper to know all these pilots coming through now Oh like said different sort of a route through your site you're watching me get munched oh they they are really really really like these guys you're getting that you actually proper THC infused yes yes laughs bring us back 200 milligrams I'm a girl lock up to three now yeah that sugar definitely tastes like sauce in here right good thing sweat him yeah so I have a pong with you in a minute you get your palms out mix a dab site yeah Oh it up on them on so I will go off in a little bit and see are these Phil oh my god well taste-wise for stoner absolutely loves sweets [Applause] let's say quite its review you sing right get to the last one no guys just get work sugar you want to walk that way I'm sure the sugars infused get it all get all right bombs up guys here goes nothing cheers well watch

marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and today we are looking at a product that we have kind of sort of looked at before but in a smaller form factor we are taking a look at another product from canna Co their PB&J blondie again but this time instead of the 250 milligram we're gonna take a look at the 100 milligram to see how that hits to see if it hits relatively as strongly as the 250 s and 500 s that we've looked at before I thought it was probably good to make sure that we've got the entire gamut of Kanako's products covered so I went ahead and picked up a hundred milligram err as well now I already know how this bad boys gonna taste I'm pretty sure I know how it's gonna taste it's gonna taste excellent and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get pretty high still even though it's only 100 milligrams that's just sort of the magic of a can of coke so here we go oh you can see the hundred milligrams come in this sort of baby blueish color they all have a different color corresponding to their potency we hunt 100 milligram is this nice blue here alright well I'm gonna go and open it up eat her up and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the way our reviews work and that is also the most important part of the review process so here we go it's a handsome product there that peanut butter swirl on top the jelly oh my god the blondie let's give a bite as advertised that really is blondie batter swirl with peanut butter chips and raspberry jam topped with peanut butter frosting and peanut butter chips all those things are true taste very good but guys how is this bad boy can make me feel for that I'm gonna have to wait two hours and you're gonna have to wait a couple of seconds and I will see you on the other side of this break to let you know how we're feeling thank you so much for watching wheats guys and I will see you soon peace okay guys I am back it has been two hours since I had the Kanak OPB NJ blondie and I am extremely happy to confirm it is as potent as I was hoping it was gonna be this is the most hundred potent hundred milligram edible I've ever had for sure in terms of just 100 milligram edible this thing hits like a hammer tastes great man I know I've already had the 250 milligram variety but even the 100 milligrams variety here is is almost does the trick for me I'd be a tough to decide between which to pick for me but it's great if you see this at your dispensary near you grab one you'll be happy you did you'll be you'll be quite high for quite some time and you'll enjoy the taste as well well guys that's gonna do it for this review here on week's happy to have another homerun here from Kanak oh and we will see you on a future review that will hope is just as good as this one piece great hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "X4O60iQXJho": "[Music] 500 milligram lead cereal bars for 12 bucks 300 milligrams of bags of chips for 10 400 milligram breakfast cereals we breakfast cereals for $11 and not only that but all the products are pretty tasty too this is just a small sampling of the great value you can expect from lol edibles and nearly ubiquitous edible manufacturer here in Southern California sounds too good to be true right well that's because it is welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana edible review show where we do our damndest to help you make sense of your dispensary this is a show where we try to save you from throwing away your hard-earned money on dud ass edibles and speaking of gun ass edibles today we're going to take a deeper look at LOL edibles where LOL presumably stands for lies on lies we have reviewed a variety of LOL products on wheats and so far have found them to be all greatly exaggerating their potency LOL edibles conveniently does not have an independent tasting testing laboratory rate their product or if they do they do not display it anywhere on their products packaging or on its the website without an independent testing body there are seemingly free to make up whatever dosage they want to put on their packaging and while I certainly cannot prove at this time they are exaggerating their potency my extensive experience with high potency edibles leads me to believe that they are full of [ __ ] so one of the cardinal rules of edibles is you get what you pay for with a few exceptions and we pay $10 for an edible that claims to have 400 milligrams of THC unless you see that independent laboratory verifying those results I would be pretty skeptical of that claim and lol edibles is the king of these shitty shenanigans an another tip-off that they may be less than honest is the taste of their products they usually print is pretty great but a 500 milligram edible should taste at least a little terrible these don't why well most likely because they're lying about how much THC is actually in the product let's compare them to say a 500 milligram kuroh an\u00edbal the kirova product will likely cost and double the lol edible or more and it will taste far Wars and while this might sound weird to say that's very much a good thing two hours after eating an lol a 500 milligram lol edible I'm stone-cold sober like a lifetime lifetime teetotaler but two hours after a 500 milligram Korova edible and I'm [ __ ] over the moon and probably under my covers passed out asleep so let's go back and talk about their website again it's [ __ ] laughable and that's four tabs products about contact and order there order tab seems to it seemed seems to be in good working condition which makes sense because I see this [ __ ] everywhere everything else on their website though god damn what a [ __ ] show the products tab only Keynes contains a small sliver of their products and the pictures look like they were taken on a crusty iphone 3gs by some bored seven-year-old the contact tab of course doesn't do a goddamn thing it's a completely dead link no way to contact them on their contact me tab my guess never worked they don't really want you to contact them they know you're pissed at them why don't they want to hear from you and actually if you really really really do want to get ahold of them just look at the bottom of their page and there's a link to their email and Instagram so you can contact them there psyche those are dead links too they just want you to think that they're able to be contacted but they don't really want you to know they're your feedback because they know they [ __ ] you they know that they're lying to you and they know that you're pissed they don't want to hear from you and finally let's talk about that about page that shows up on their website here's what it says on I quote the medical cannabis industry needed a well respected brand of edibles that patients can rely on for quality and reliability while tasting great lol edibles aims to take the industry by storm by providing great customer service and amazing products you can find LOL edibles throughout the Los Angeles Orange County and San Diego regions at fine reputable medical dispensaries ask your dispensary for LOL edibles today what a load of [ __ ] horseshit let's take that sentence-by-sentence here so I agree that the medical cannabis industry needs a well respected brand but lol edibles sure as [ __ ] ain't it they have the audacity to say that patients can rely on their quality and reliability they also brag about their customer service you know the one you can't actually reach out to or get in contact with them in any way shape or form so guys ask your dispensary the opposite ask them to stop selling these products tell them they are inadvertently ripping off their customers or maybe intentionally ripping off their customers I don't know the only true thing about that sentence or excuse me about that about page is that you can find them throughout LA and Orange counties as unfortunate as that is so I've tried the majority of the Ella Buhl's products but not all I will confess I've never tried their boob cubes or G bars but you know what at this point I never will and I don't care if they're actually good these guys have taken enough money from the pocket of consumers wheats will never review any of their products again their name is lol edibles but the only one are laughs the only ones laughing are them and they're laughing all the way to the bank let me just be totally here to click totally totally clear here to wrap up do not buy any lol edibles products do not let your friends buy their [ __ ] tell your dispensary not to carry this [ __ ] garbage leave them a negative review on weed maps and let's all work together to put these scumbags out of business thanks guys so much for watching this review and we have nearly 200 other reviews and our archives a tweets reviews.com so please

to say real quick about these way there's another review of doing about about the sweet and sour candies I wanted to do this one these are called watermelon candies and they you know they taste like watermelon varying got very sugar-coated type stuff you know comes with the standard thing they will tell you what kind it is indica oh I forgot the other one was indica - these ones are absolutely delicious these tastings is like watermelons um you can taste the cannabis taste in it but I don't care because medicinally holy crap these are awesome I need about four of them and I was doing pretty good I'm not gonna again again I could ate more and got completely medicated but it was okay um it just proves that these are pretty consistent pretty strong I always kind of liked the small touch this is why I'm talking about this company here I'm not sure where they are um everybody always says the bay but that's probably good chances they're from around the Central Valley or or one of those areas so I just wanted us a quick review on this one is that these are absolutely freakin delicious the watermelon candies I love them additionally they're freakin awesome the ingredients unfortunately the number one ingredient is corn syrup right you know again a lot of these sweets there's not much you can do about that the second one is sugar but the third ingredient is cannabis so that means that's a good thing as this there's more cannabis in this thing then there is a gelatin which is pretty awesome because that's what the mainly made of I'm just supposed to contain about 13 to 15 milligrams per candy I ate I can eat eight five and was doing pretty good again usually when I eat them it's between three and five and that's again if you really wanted to get you know screwed up I guess this is the word for it then seriously medicated then yeah you can get a whole bunch of them and you'd be doing good the consistency is pretty awesome every time we've gotten these is my good these are 30 bucks a bag for this I'm sure through the distributor they don't cost that much but that's usually what the price of going through a co-op is or dispensary but anyways for sure check out this product if your co-op your dispensary has it this is pretty awesome so again share subscribe and do all that other good stuff love a piece of chicken grease", "_y9pnyu14sE": "[Music] huh what

wheat sweets on vacation this is a wheats mini-review and we are coming to you from Denver Colorado today our first trip out of Southern California and we are gonna look at some of the edibles here available in Colorado but first a mini rant Colorado I'm afraid in comparison to Southern California you do not hold a candle when it comes to edibles so for example I've got the Dutch girl caramel waffles I believe those are a stroopwafel this is a hundred milligrams of THC and it cost me $23 so roughly if you go milligram two dollar ratio about 300-400 percent more expensive than what you get in Southern California but I don't want to judge too harshly this also is Dutch girl stroopwafels promises to have feel it faster with n.ex.t technology whatever the hell that means they say nano extraction technology and that you fill these edibles faster than traditional edibles now if you guys have seen weeks before you know we traditionally do 30 60 120 pip updates not gonna be the case on these sweets vacation review I'm just gonna eat these bad boys come back to you guys in about two hours and let you know if we're feeling anything at all so here we go without further ado here is the product open up here and it's a little waffle cookie a little stroopwafel if you ever seen these German type cookies this is what they look like mmm smells delicious smells like a caramelized little Stroup cookie stroopwafel cookie but let's give it a taste no problems on the taste phone I apologize in that regard Colorado but for $23 is this gonna get me [ __ ] up I'll let you know guys in two hours thanks so much for watching we'll catch you back on weeds welcome back to wheats wheats on vacation here I'm back talking about the Dutch girl caramel waffles the stroopwafel it's been just a little bit over two hours and I just wanted to come back and tell you guys how we're feeling so for one hundred milligram edible I'm feeling a little high not especially high but for for something it's 100 milligrams probably right about on target but for the price I am not familiar with the Colorado market as well as I am the California market but I'm gonna guess that's probably right in the wheelhouse of an average price but these things are delicious so wheats on vacation if you find yourself in Colorado looking for an edible and you've got some money to spend and you like the way things taste you like your caramel waffles don't be afraid to pick up the Dutch girl it's good it's just not gonna put you in the hospital which is also good because you don't want to be in the hospital either but it's also not gonna put you in your bed so with that being said thank you so much for watching wheats guys and we'll check you guys on the next review hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be

marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today's review is a good old-fashioned classic because we were taking a look at edibles and a classic edible kind at that the cookie we're finally digging into big Pete's here I've heard actually a lot of really good thing about big Pete's so I am excited to give it a try but that's a lot of calories in here haha just look at the nutrition information [ __ ] um so this is the mini cookie model which seems to be the biggest model out there for edibles in California I'm gonna say pioneered by Korova I don't know if that's actually true um that's where I first saw the the first time used some to use that model was kirova so 10 cookies 10 milligrams of THC each because that is what the regulations are you can only have ten milligrams max per individual serving and then you can only have ten servings for a total of 100 milligrams for any legal edibles so this is a big heavy ass hunk in bag of cookies there's 700 calories in total we've got a really wonderful packaging here great information lab testing results right there on the back nutrition information ingredients dosing instructions everything we even have a little story there on the back which I won't bore you with I'm just gonna take a peek right right out of here now uh okay good for you big Pete not that interesting so uh if you've never tuned into ones before unfortunately I'm gonna eat this whole friggin bag of cookies um because that's the way we're our room edibles reviews work is I eat the whole product to review the whole product and let you know how I feel about it two hours after I finished the last one of these cookies really don't have to eat 100 calories worth of cookies right now but I do it for you guys so uh I actually figured out how to open the childproof baggy on this one goomy I'm learning smells in there ooh they smell really good actually they smell like really really good peanut butter cookies there is a little bit of cannabis odor but they smell great here we are we've got the little lattice work on the top for the peanut butter cookie it looks good god damn this is great there's maybe a little bit of canvas taste but this is a good peanut butter cookie it's a lot softer I mean it's not soft but it is a lot softer than the the other mini cookies there's ones have the more Chips Ahoy brittle II thing and this is a little brittle but it's suddenly a little chewier than the others and it's great it's got a great peanut butter flavor just the right amount of crunch whoops mmm well if I have to eat ten of these at least they taste pretty good right okay chewie on the taste front guys I can tell you these are great genuinely surprised I mean I've heard good things about him but that [ __ ] was unexpected how good that was um so big thumbs up there but really guys what we all want to know is anybody can go get a mazing bag of cookies for the 20 bucks with these costs you want to make sure that these [ __ ] expensive ass cookies are gonna get you really high and for that guys you look to stick around for just a second and I will be back to you guys Oh in about two hours or so after I finish off this whole bag see you then [Music] big Pete's welcome back to wheats guys it has been about two and a half hours since I first checked in with you and I am ready to check out because big Pete's is a big ol win and the potency column look at them eyeballs red as can be man I loved big Pete's guys the cookies tasted excellent this is on the top level of hundred milligram potencies I mean this is about as potent as it gets great packaging I mean look at this you know tons of information not and not terribly ostentatious do not feel like you're spending extra money on it big Pete's man this is a huge thumbs up I could not be more happy with this the only problem is I have not yet thought of a cherry on top so I have to sit here and think of one for a second cuz I can't leave you guys without a cherry on top with something this exciting right that would feel rude I got it I got it I got it I'm gonna share with you guys a novel that I share with a lot of people that I quite like that I think have good taste like you guys cuz I think you guys all have great excellent wonderful taste is the most successful book I've ever recommended to people in terms of like batting average of them loving it I met a hundred percent right now or a thousand batting a thousand try not to mix metaphors holy [ __ ] that's a lot of build-up for the book which is then we came to the end by Jonah no not Jonah Joshua Faris Joshua Faris I think that's his name if we're not I'm going to be embarrassed great novel it's a weird novel that's told in the first person plural meaning they say like we and us instead of I and him or her and it is about the dot-com collapse an office that's like an advertising firm for dot-com companies right at the end of the dot-com collapse it is hysterical is so funny it is very poignant and it is sort of has come around to being sort of relevant again today with the shape of the tech industry so again that was then we came to the end that was a really long cherry on top and I just plucked that one out the sky love that book love big Pete's and their indica cannabis infused peanut butter mini cookies 65 million thumbs up way up in the sky but-but-but-but boom guys oh love you big Pete's I'm not a crook oh I don't know what's going on I'll see you guys on the next review", "kjWKarTcMuk": "[Music] well hello friends welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we are YouTube's preeminent marijuana edible review ship again only because we are the only edible review show on YouTube so today we are taking a look at another product from TKO edibles we are taking a look at their s'mores krispies I've been reviewing a lot of krispies recently this one looks pretty good from the outside a lot of marshmallow a lot of chocolate a lot of crispy a lot of um so um this is I think the fourth or fifth thing we've reviewed from TK edibles this is my first hundred milligram er I've never quite liked the taste from any of them but I've always found them to be rather potent so I am hoping that this one tastes better it looks better than any of the others but we shall find out good and open her up and give it a taste here that is better tasting than any of the other TKO animals it's not great incredibly thick incredibly chewy well Arviat room it's not bad I actually kind of liked the taste of it very little we taste whatsoever I'm not bad at all thick and chewy if you can imagine it's like almost like graham cracker in there which I guess it makes sense for s'mores brownie or s'mores crispy and then the chocolate and marshmallow I like it quite a bit but guys as we always know it's known about how it tastes it's about how it makes you feel and for that I want to see you guys in two hours to let you know how this bad boys heading [Music] [Music] well guys it has been 2 hours welcome back two weeks has been two hours since I had the TK oh hundred milligram s'mores Krispy here and I got to say for a hundred milligram edible I feel pretty high I feel pretty pleased with it as in edible the best tasting TKO edible I've had so far and for 100 milligram ER as I said I am feeling rather high I mean not outrageously high by any stretch but higher than it was expecting - for a hundred milligram edible it doesn't feel that much different than their 160 milligrams to be honest so yeah I'm pretty positive on the s'mores crispy from TK oh maybe my new favorite product from their sin terms of taste and potency and they're pretty cheap - I think this cost me six bucks at my dispensary so this is a pretty worthwhile purchase I think so if you see the TKO s'mores crispy at a dispensary near you and you're looking for something that's not gonna get you send you to the moon something a little bit more low dose feel free to pick one up it's pretty good and with that guys I'm gonna sign off here thank you so much for watching this review here on

alright so these are the drops these are lime drops and these are 50 milligrams of THC each I got two of them so we got 100 milligrams total which I already know I already know some of you me be viewing this like hundred grams as [ __ ] that's just done a lot that's weak sauce yeah okay I agree with you but really quick just to let everybody know 50 grams is the limit here on our edibles in the state of Oregon okay so if your recreational 21 and up you have a limit of 50 milligrams now you can buy multiple you can buy you know five six seven of these you know what I mean but you're still limited to 50 milligrams and it's kind of rather expensive to be honest for just 50 okay I mean these were like 6 or 7 bucks a box for just 50 milligrams you know what I mean so you can see how that kind of adds up alright but anyway so these are a lime jelly okay both of these are a lime jelly and I believe they're just bite size let's see here a point or 0.8 percent or whatever 0.8 grams percent grams of sugar and no fats no no cool all right lime essential oil oil and cannabis extract and cannabis deprived terpenes okay okay this is balanced okay so right here let's see if I can show you guys this better right there they tell you the so if you just take one of those little slivers out of this that's five milligrams so if you're trying to dose yourself out they got a little dosage chart right there as soon as you open it up so you can get ten servings you can cut out of this five milligrams each serving okay for a total of 50 milligrams all right I don't know why I keep saying balanced on there it says balanced balanced like what the [ __ ] okay great you're balanced I'm not at least I'll try not to be here we go [Music] [Music] super line like super lime like holy [ __ ] that is a rush of lime flavor it's very nice it's got this covered in sugar so the code of sugar really adds to it it tastes great it nice and soft it's not like a hard gummy I like it this is a vegan product it does say vegan right there so if you are somebody that is vegan this is going to work perfect for you okay [Music] hmm you kind of get that taste of cannabis right there at the end the aftertaste you can you definitely taste a little smidgen of weed in there but overall it's got a nice flavor it tastes really good it tastes just like a candy I mean it tastes like a lime gummy candy and it's really good it's not bad um I actually like this product I actually like it I'll give it a thumbs up I give it a definite thumbs up I would definitely recommend it and the reason I recommend it is because you here in Oregon since it's 50 milligrams for each meaning if you want more you got to buy more so when you're buying more if you're buying ones that are like huge chunks of candy or huge chunks of chocolate or whatever the [ __ ] that's a lot of sugar that you have to [ __ ] intake just to get the milligrams that you need okay or what that's crazy okay I'm not trying to be diabetic so the fact that it's bite-sized the fact that it's just one little quick all right and I got my full 50 milligrams that's awesome I love that alright so let me know about your guys's

"all right you guys welcome on back to home vacation I'm now on this iPhone 10 iPhone X trying to get iMovie downloaded right now and trying to come to you guys with some slightly better content hopefully starting this weekend I can get the tripod up I don't really have a lot of extra product to be recording about but I'll have a weekend to like figure that out anyways anyways let me give you this review here of khiva bliss watermelon lemonade you know there cannabis infused gummies edibles five milligrams per serving twenty gummies per package so it's a hundred milligrams for the total package hundred milligrams THC no CVD um I just mentioned that every time though just so you know because some people prefer to have some CBD in their in their edibles in their products this one's called bliss so another Kiva confections another Kiva product I don't know if you guys recall but originally these were in a plastic bag packaging it was kind of like a thick plastic with that kind of shiny aluminum type of like glossy coating on the inside they recently upgraded to these Camino I guess in Spanish it means like way or path or something like that you know this information let's just pause it here for you it says one gummy see that this is one interesting thing it says one gummy 3.6 grams of you know all these other stuff they've got the serving size is there the sir this wind I mean it says this the gummy is 3.6 grams total calories it says pursuing for one gummy it's 10 calories each so this whole thing would be like 200 calories if you just went out and ate the whole thing um I wouldn't recommend that unless you know what you're doing um got total carbs 2 grams total sugars 2 grams fat none sodium none here's some ingredients for you organic tapioca syrup it's got sugar gelatin malic acid natural flavors such AG acid cannabis extract fruit and vegetable juice 4 color natural terpenes coconut oil and car carnauba wax carnauba wax so I'm guessing that this carnauba wax is the potent active THC type of ingredient um I'm gonna have to look that up and confirm it for you guys because I don't know you can look at all the warnings here heed as you please or you know keep it safe um so let's let's open this again so I'm gonna read this whole thing but go ahead and look at it if you want to so for me this is somewhere between like a hybrid and and the indica it kicks in strong last night I had two pieces of it so that's a total of 10 milligrams it comes with this plastic thing to keep pieces from sticking to the top of the jar and so it tells you what to do we at least two hours before the full effect start with just one piece they're good guys they taste delicious which is one issue with edibles man I wish they wouldn't make them taste so bingo Mike why don't they make them taste like medicine like cough drops or something like you make them like delicious gummy is of course somebody's gonna want to eat a freaking hundred hundred milligrams worth of these things it doesn't matter if it's too much like they taste good um so let's look at a piece here you see they're kind of like one piece is like one diamond shape square shape like this um you see how they have this little like mark in half for most of them I don't know why I'm just guessing maybe that's for dosing maybe people don't want a full five milligrams maybe you want to and a half milligrams because I remember the ones in the in the bag packages were the same um so I noticed like when I open this and I've had this for maybe two days now um it was you see how there's like a little bit of a piece that's kind of like broken or something um man didn't count them but I've eaten a few already I just have one today I had two yesterday doesn't really matter which direction this thing goes um in the jar it is a push push pressure to open so once I close this I can't open it with one hand it's a good product I like it it tastes good it's potent so I'll say the first time I tried the bees and this isn't like a brand new ingredient or anything that they have or anything like that but the first time I tried these when they were in the package like in the little bag package they were um I mean I still like them um I think they're still just as potent I don't recall if it was called bliss before but I know they have like indica sativa hybrid CBD so it's interesting that this one like they're naming them something different now that's also interesting that that that wax that we see on the back here with that ingredient it's also interesting how it mentions like that amount of it's it's interesting um it's also interesting that there's no CVD and it um but yeah so let's let's talk some about about the impacts of the effects of this it's it's potent so it's strong I would say for myself the first times I tried this it was just like other keep of products of edibles every piece is the same potency for the most part if you try to microdose it or cut up the dosages from the five lower down to like two and a half or maybe like one or so milligrams it feels exactly like what you think it's gonna feel like even when you're just cutting up a piece you know it always feels pretty much the same um the difference is I've noticed which really isn't on on Kiva's end it's more in my own end the difference is I have noticed is that when I'm like the first times I had I had these it was just kind of like average work day come home afterward popping out a bold chill you know um added an interesting impact last night though cuz when I was clove in nineteen and coronavirus stuff I've been kind of like stressing out and not really noticing it cuz I'm still going into work I have to go into work and you know I work at a mental mental health spot so uh I'm I have to be there and so it's interesting that um it was yesterday that I had like the highest anxiety and it was like I had one of these you know I got off work had one of these by about an hour and a half I was in my car on the phone had already eaten two of these so I had ten milligrams in my system for maybe like an hour and a half prior and um it was strong it was delicious it was good um but when it started kicking in probably because my anxiety was so high and because I hadn't really slept good in like two three days and because I have probably quite a bit of caffeine inside of my system it was not pleasant and I don't think it was because of the edibles I think I was super paranoid I can explain last night to you a bit like I'm here in California in Southern California there's a terrible rainstorm last night thunder lightning rain like like wind and out here that doesn't even happen so not only was a sleep-deprived highly caffeinated from just all of that catching up and having a late work shift last night and just like drinking some you know I drink and I drink some of this yesterday I don't drink the whole thing on warrants but I drink like half of it maybe and then another much sparkling much of uplifting kind of drink it was and it I drink maybe like a third of that so I was already like well into like 50 or so milligrams of caffeine I'm lacking sleep and I'm very sensitive to caffeine anyways I probably usually have like 10 milligrams of caffeine but yeah I was like over 50 I was probably 60 70 milligrams caffeine that's a lot for me and then lack of sleep and the stress was always Kogan 19 and then I started finally just like talking to my friend about it and then I was like shoot like just kind of opened up a whole can of worms there can but opened up a whole can of worms there of a lot of stuff that I hadn't really been thinking about or talking about or opening up about it was just like dude just kind of pour it on out of me and it was pretty intense and then I right after that trying to go to sleep and feeling highly anxious and super paranoid and then the freaking storm and and the reason why I mentioned where I live is because we don't really have storms like that here um everyone knows that we have Sun and a lot of it and that's what we're used to and that's what I love and I I don't mind rain I know we need it and all that but I mean gosh that was a little intense and then you know trying to sleep and the loud thunder and the flashes of lightning and I'm like oh my gosh like Cove is 19 and like we're all gonna die and like I was I was struggling um but I don't blame Kiva I blame myself um but I just want to mention that you know for people who might be on the highly anxious end I'm I'm kind of like the on edge kind of end of like super stress high strong feeling maybe this I mean I think it'll relax you but it kind of depends cuz I noticed when I have edibles in a high dosage with a lot of stressors under my belt and then caffeine on top of that even if it's like from an earlier time of day like that that's when I've had the most negative impacts and I've probably had maybe one huge experience and maybe 2 to 3 other experiences that were kind of similar to this one I'm explaining like where it's kind of like you know like heart rate and like just kind of like I can't tell like am I supposed to scream or cry or you know just fall asleep couldn't fall asleep because of the weather and like geez but yeah um I'm just kind of venting but yeah this this is honestly all that aside all the paranoia warning aside and talking about my own personal life I would say this is a good product it's still a good product different packaging different same brand for those of you who might also be familiar Kiva makes a chocolate bar that is mom it is good I recently tried the true one I was like a true it has like cinnamon and sugar like oh man yeah it's it's good and these are good to you I like that they have different flavors they don't really taste like we they kind of taste like fruit punch um they're soft the as you can see that I don't keep them in the car I don't keep them anywhere hot where it's gonna melt so that's something I'd recommend keeping in mind they might um but yeah I kept it kind of I keep them kind of in a bag that I take with me like if you want to call it a purse or backpack or whatever like yeah good body hi good cognitive hi almost felt like it like a hybrid at the beginning it kind of kicked in strong it's kind of like you get a little bit of like mental energy there and you notice your muscles and body relaxing and then then like probably like an hour to two hours after it actually kicks in so maybe on the 4 or 5 hour mark for me anyways that's when I start getting the drowsiness in and starting to feel a little tired um and just kind of eventually just suddenly fall asleep without even like knowing um so I've probably mentioned this before I always recommend before having edibles you know first thing if you're in your house go ahead and set your alarm for the morning before I do that before I sit down like I put down my stuff and then immediately set my alarm from when I'm waking up in the morning cuz if I don't do that um you know I'm never gonna set my alarm and I always wake up before my alarm anyways but I'm just mentioning it to you guys who might need to know that yeah but anyways guys thanks for thanks for listening thanks for watching this I don't know how this video even got to nearly 15 minutes but you know I ramble you know I kind of make these videos Wellstone so check out check out these edibles check out a lot of their products not just this one check out the other ones too they're they're good they're solid thanks for watching guys bye", "2VNYCOaQFSY": "[Music] hopefully 71 the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on this web view we are taking a look at the final product to review from a cushy punch their 100 milligram sativa variety flavor is strawberries the strawberry 100 milligram sativa variety of cushy punch we've looked at their 200 milligram TK o which I found to be kind of lacking and then we looked at their 100 milligram indica and in an experiment we also look at the 100 milligram hybrids and I found both of those to be not too bad so I hope that this is on the better end of the cushy punch I hope it's as good as the other two 100 milligrams I found those to be much better than the 200 milligram sort of surprisingly I would just go with 100 milligrams in terms of cost because I think it's about just about as potent as its 200 milligram brother so without further ado let's going to open this up and eat her down and what's gonna happen after that guys after I finish this I'm going to come back to you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part about the edible review not necessarily how it tastes but more about how it actually makes you feel so here we go looks like a like a little jam packet or a little jelly packet or a little butter packet it's got four little blocks in there and after we get it plopped out you can see it with its four a little squares but we're going to ignore the little squares there just plug the whole thing in my mouth and one go mmm not bad definitely a little bit of what we taste so much better than the infused creations or the what's the other one I can't remember the name off the top my head but any of those ones that are just like the gummy bears with the basically just like THC oil sprinkled on the outside this is a lot better this is more like the flourish although I don't think it's quite as good as the flourish so now that I've slurped it down I'm gonna wait two hours to see how I'm gonna feel you guys however have to just wait a couple seconds I'll be back right after this break here and I'll let you know how I'm feeling see you then it's been two hours since I had the cushy punch that's the name of it the cushy punch should sieve a hundred milligram THC strawberry flavored gummy here and I gotta say this might be the least hi I've been from one of their hundred milligrams it seemed like the hybrid and the indica hit me more that might just be because I've heard this about um because she punched before that they're not the most consistent some are code and some aren't and that might just be the case with this sativa I'm not not high just more at like four four and a half somewhere in that range instead of the six five and a half six is the other ones so a little bit less than before but again that just might be this particular batch where it might be that sativa doesn't quite hit me as hard but it still is better than my original impressions of could she punch way back when when I had their TKO at the very very beginning I still don't think it would be the first thing I reached for at the dispensary but it won't be the last thing I go for like my opinion used to be so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching it as always and we will see you on the next review peace okay", "xtj3v5cex8w": "[Music] and we won't [Music] hey yo everybody how y'all doing outbox house back at it again another new video so this time actually gonna be a little bit different normally you

did i take and [ __ ] whatever and i was looking like yo i don't know i just kept [ __ ] eating like i don't [ __ ] know how many i [ __ ] ate and then like they [ __ ] told me that you know it was some [ __ ] pot cookies and i was like yo and i thought like by like bro back then like i smoked but not enough to where my body could take that [ __ ] 15 minutes later i was [ __ ] tripping balls i was [ __ ] sweating i was my heart was beating out of my [ __ ] chest like i was [ __ ] scared like i was freaking the [ __ ] out and man just [ __ ] that whole night was a [ __ ] [ __ ] show after

section as we take a look at today's edible today we're looking at these I guess the watermelon pieces and this is from the cannabis candy company oh this is actually gonna be my first package of anything from now says this 300 milligrams of THC this is a tea but ain't you know that that's my favorite out of sativa indica because it's the more creative kind of uh hi um however when you take edibles it's a different experience than smoking we wanna do is you wanna get could eat out the pack see what these two mile I see if they smell like candy if they smell heavily we then will taste you wanna see oh if it tasted the same let's get these things out the pack I see they look like all right bear cub that was not the easiest package to open well we did get it open finally on these gummies have a nice sugary coating they don't really smell too much of a cannabis they kind of just smelled like Borden on candy I'm going to you gonna go ahead and see what they taste like huh man see you see if they got like the more cannabis or more of a candy flavor 300 milligrams I guess for this whole packet I don't know how strong it cannabis taste will be but let's find out all right Burke up about to uh try these edibles and see um how much of a cannabis tasted you know it doesn't smell like like smells like candy but not but there's a back layer smell on it makes them not like smell the most appetizing but my steak room temperature it's a nice texture I'm not really din I'm a deep Canada's taste I'm getting more like a bunch ill or a fish you watermelon flavor plus our to toss harbor and not really like I'm not tasting today like stepmama TV this is Joey do you in the Mitzvah the aftertaste ain't even a relief it would like like a lot of cannabis flavor they'll do intoxicating the fact that this product may be delayed by up to two hours oh so we have to taking these you might have to wait two hours maybe I I'm already hot because I've been smoking all day um I guess I guess

milligrams of THC I'm tasting THC um I'm not tasting green apple at all there a little bit of sweetness but not not green apple I would say just like taste like maybe like a corn syrup or Oh like little sugary you may have some people I would say just ignore it so well this has been here because it takes usually like an hourish you start to feel it but I have another right and I'm gonna smoke

here but I'll be back okay so it's been an hour and a half and as you can tell these have kicked in my eyes feel so heavy and like I just feel really relaxed and you don't feel like doing too much like you know thank God I did everything earlier cuz I would not do anything like that on this I your whole body like it just makes you feel relaxed I like this is like an oh my [ __ ] like that's my rating of it it's it's very good um yeah you get like a little bit thirsty but you also get like hungry so I got try them these are my favorite um like for a licorice I like I like this one I don't like the one that it's all twisty it's like a little bit tough and it has like a weird taste to it I don't really like that one I like the nibs or the you know how you can get the licorice that's all Brown you could probably watch a movie on this um more like hmm more like like those action suspense drama ones my son is bright um yeah it's uh just like the Owens is good I didn't taste the green apple though but it doesn't matter because it feels good like you feel good you don't feel like doing much but you feel good like read watching TV movie not cleaning or laundry or anything like that this is the stuff that makes you feel like you know after you shower and like you know everything's done so and you're you feel like like sleep is gonna be really good but it even feels better when you have like wash sheets and stuff on the bed well I checked that this is what that makes you feel like like we wanted to get into a nice clean bed and just ah watch TV here just lay there and think I wouldn't recommend reading a book because I don't think you would get very far well that Sun is bright yes good eye you know what Lola's hard candies from campus know they're really good like they like I've tried other ones from a different dispensary and they weren't good at all the ones I can abysmal there uh mm-hmm you just go there and get them like it's it's good stuff [Music] and by like can I do that Sun is really bothering it's really bothering me down d'arnot all okay there I don't know that'll have to do um was I talking about them mmm I don't remember well with the can of the Canada's no like they never let me down they just a face cell is it was very good so you should go there I don't understand why like people are so against feeling like this you don't there's nothing wrong with what you're feeling you don't you know what's going on and stuff I mean I don't understand that so like what you know think it's Saturday why I like smoke a joint and do edibles like what's wrong with that it gives you like you know time just to relax that's what I think it just you know that's what it does for me and if you didn't want to do the animals and you know there's the other there's other ways of doing it but I feel really well like I feel like you want to get comfy I'm in the chair with the I watched all the the what do they called the throw blankets today and like we have quite a bit so but those are like there's always soft and stuffed you know and you hang them outside and they have that outside smell and I just I think that's what I will be doing after is getting one in or two of those blankets and just watching something TV or something and covering up with the pie cake I'm just just chilling I should have brought something else other than these nibs I can't get the munchies do I feel paranoid yes yes as in I wouldn't answer the door at all continue doing whatever it was I was doing stuff feels really good good like [Music] I don't know how to describe it I really don't I feel like um I'm just really good like um not like good like yeah I'm not be but good like as in relaxed and I guess at peace like just really like you're enjoying stuff like you have time to enjoy stuff that's how I felt also any aches and pains and it helps with that it helps Brooke like everything I can can't think of a thing that it wouldn't help with subjects we were sad you'd be happy after if you were when I was a kid okay so the way I'm sitting on the bed I'm one legs just dangling down and I'm ever like when I was a kid I used to always think there was something something under the bed that hurt you know I grabbed my knees my feet probably for my ankle I remember him I remember like I go I got so bad that at my parents house the hallway and off to the right there was the bathroom and then there was my room at the very end of the hallway was a closet and on the left side was my parents room and my brother's room and everybody it you know had to go get a drink of water or something and my bed was never close to the light switch so I don't have to shop the light go like at the beginning of the hallway run as fast as I can and just get like step into my room and you'll leap across onto my bed because I thought there was something under that was gonna grab my feet and then I get that I you know it's probably like I know it's nothing but I still get that feeling sometimes and it happened while I was doing that so that's why I told you I don't remember I was talking about before this and it's probably not gonna come back to me either but hate when that happens [Music] that's good I would like I highly recommend it it was like I took it I 530 so he's hired at 5:30 I kicked in like seven ish maybe a little bit after not much and it's oh I can't hang on okay and it's going on 7:30 right now so like you're gonna feel like this for a while so which is good that's what you want you don't want to like this just to go away cuz I would kind of sock right now it just uh makes you enjoy stuff like TV I'm getting comfy and you can get come because you're not a lot you're not even like pain if you have pain my eyelids feel so bad over my eyelids feel so heavy like they just you just feel my eyelids feel tired and even when they look tired right I think that they look happy you're loving they're loving it my eyes are loving this if they're tired and they're just I think people did this like if you really look at yourself I think you can maybe like and some people see what kind of person they are when they were work to be on this maybe not though I don't know I'm just I'm just thinking of stuff and say you know to you guys [Music] I'm not very comfortable sitting the way I am but I don't want to put my foot down there yet so the marinated hard candies cannabis bomb well worth it highly recommend it I didn't taste green apple but um you taste like I tasted the THC and like something a little bit sweet here and there really just makes you feel relaxed and a little bit thirsty and like a little bit hungry but not bad like you don't know you're not gonna like eat meat eat just like something here and there my rating of this is an oh my [ __ ] um you just feel like relax and you don't feel like um doing anything like like physically you don't feel like doing anything watching a movie yeah things like that yep that's what you feel like doing um and your eyelids may feel okay I can't sit like that any longer your eyelids may feel heavy but it does not matter cuz you still feel happy and I think that's everything I don't I don't know what else to talk about so that's it that's all bye", "G0jD8cPWg-s": "[Music] [Music] what up YouTube YouTube YouTube YouTube this is where G smokes this is the only review video an edible review video of nature's greatest watermelon white chocolate one for those of you unfamiliar with Illinois laws I'm fairly certain that edibles can only be a hundred milligrams and that is the maximum allowance for any edibles apparently so unfortunately we really cannot rate this on the scale of one to ten in terms of potency so that will be out of the question but we will be rating it there's a how it tastes the presentation the delivery how fast it takes to thicken and also overall my general thoughts and I've actually never had an edible from this company I've never tried an edible of medical marijuana edible from Illinois dispensaries yet so this is gonna be my first one I'm really excited and without further ado let's get this thing pop open it's smells just like watermelon that's crazy again this is a white chocolate wanna know and bar you guys want to see the back here's the back I'll do a nice little zoom in for you [Music] total THC content is 100 milligrams total THC a is zero and comes in this fancy four-piece looking barn look at that guys it's just smells I gotta live it smells just like watermelon like that artificial flavor a lot watermelon regardless well well and has got green swirls through it now that's still presentation I like it I really I really think it looks just what it's supposed to smell and taste like and looks super watermelon II super kind of fake almost but I like that fake watermelon flavor anyways so here we go without further ado the one thing I have to point out is unlike a lot of chocolate bars these don't have the milligrams on them which is something maybe maybe something nature's grace can work on they're just blanks blank blocks and I know that so impatient prefer to have the milligram and the dosage on there terms of the flavor you can taste the wheat in there it's really good this is not a strain specific chocolate they do not give you what's in it you don't tell you what kind of strain trend uh ground whatever was used to create this Keef what-have-you hatch so my assumptions will be that it was probably made with trend some of the lower great stuff just to maximize your profits which is fine as long as it works and tastes good and we're gonna be the judge of that in a little bit I'm gonna get back to you guys after one hour after eating 125 milligram piece of this chocolate I'll let you know my overall thoughts what I think are strong overall it is in terms of daily consumption and is it worth the money and I'll Dee's I paid $16 for for the entire hundred milligram bar but typically they're $25 apiece I actually got them on that's the only reason why I'm reviewing them because otherwise I really stay away from edibles no Illinois I feel like 100 milligrams for 20 bucks and Ava's just not worth the money at all I've definitely had some strong homemade edibles that are like way beyond that that would just put you on your body with that being said I think the overall taste is really good it tastes very very very watermelon and that mix of baked green and pink flavor it's really prescient but it's good that's kind of like Jolly Rancher watermelon almost the there's almost zero taste of weed in there now you can tell there's weed in there but it's very faint and I think that's what they were going for it's extra sweet I got shit-faced alright again like I said I'll get back to you guys in one hour and let you know what I think about these as my final thoughts and also my through 10 score for now just chill back and hang tight smoke on something showing something drink on something if you got it stay lifted and we'll drive [Music] three hours later what's up what's up you guys and we're back it's actually been three hours since I last talked to you and in that three hours I decided to see two more pieces so I'll just 75 milligrams of this 100 milligram chocolate bar and here's the final square that we're gonna eat right now I love the taste these are gate keys all day delicious what are my final thoughts and my rate well honestly if it wasn't for the price of retail price of $25 for a hundred milligrams my overall score would be like a 9 out of 10 I think they're really good flavor wise taste wise they're very creamy they're very milky they have that artificial Jolly Rancher flavor that I love so no complaints there and overall I love that you can almost almost almost not taste the weed in there it's it's almost not there so really well done really walled me in every wall code however giving that value is important to all of us $25 for a hundred milligrams is so now where is it I mean I literally ate the whole bar today in a matter of a few hours and I'm not even there you might as well have taking your money bought some flour smoked that flour and still feel higher than I do and have some weed leftover first is hitting the entire chocolate bar granted even if I ate it all at once I doubt it would do anything as a longtime smoker and Big Daddy it's not gonna do [ __ ] so what's my actual rating one through 10 on this I give these edibles six point five out of ten if there are $10 there would get a much much higher score in my book but currently for the value and the price on them and what you really got out of it versus just getting flour or getting concentrates or hash it's just not worth it just not worth it and with that there's the would you smokes and I'm signing out stay lifted yeah I'll see y'all on the next one [Music]", "EL43NmsfKWw": "what is up my fellow earthlings i am the duke of dabs here just to bring you some more cannabis related content in regards to my channel this channel is dedicated to medical patients and people 21 years old to recreationally smoke thank you for joining me today today we're just going to be doing a little bit of a review session a I know it's Monday but I've been kind of throwing around a couple of ideas maybe but for right now I'm just gonna do a impromptu kind of review on this now as you can see here I the true infusion brand here these guys are gonna be gummies tinctures you name it they come in both indica sativa they have some hybrids they have one two ones which means it has a little bit of THC and CBD in it this one is purely THC there are ten milligrams per gummy the nice thing about these the gluten free they're also gonna be very low on all of your daily stuff it's like sixteen calories per so the entire bag is about a hundred calories yada yada the people who are concerned with that kind of thing dosage on those is very very steady I would say I've eaten eight whole bags of these and even at just like 50 milligrams you're feeling like you're you feeling some of the effects definitely coming on in regards to having a gummy gummies digest a little bit differently then I'd say like chocolate or a soda in that regards gummies kind of have a little bit of a longer digest time to them but once they start taking effect it's pretty golden this particular batch that I had here on both of them they're gonna be banana cream flavored and blueberry flavored but the strain that goes into it is going to be purple Bubba so it's a definite high THC indica that will definitely bring about more of a body pain relief kind of feel to it versus a more cerebral uplift that a sativa would give this would be more for pain management rest you name it that kind of deal just relaxing true fusion has been one of my favorite brands so far they're one of my definite go twos when it comes to Arizona medical they are an Arizona company they originally started out doing mostly the CBD infusions and then they kind of started dabbling with the THC and yeah they really come a long ways in regards to the products they've always had pretty good products but now they've just surpassed pretty much what they were doing originally so without further ado I'm gonna go ahead and get one of these guys opened up here just to kind of give us a nice clear view upon opening the bag you have a very strong banana flavored it's not gonna be very big here for comparison sizes I'll show ya the that's a quarter golden quarter it's about a little larger than a quarter so the thickness on it it's like a Lego in brick the smell of it instantly you can tell it's banana flavored first taste of it tastes like banana runs nimma jaw a little tingly there that one was the banana now I've tried the banana before I've always liked blueberries a brand new flavor this is the first time for both of us here oh yeah it's got a very blueberry hint to it these have a nice resealable bag to them so you can keep your products fresh blueberry same size same shape consistency same fruit smell okay it almost tastes like a blue otter pop so the taste on these guys there is a little bit of a weedy taste to it which it's not too bad it's not gonna be like other edibles that I've eaten before that chocolate bar that I had in the previous videos more weedy than this is but these guys are nice little 10 milligram doses here so two of these bags 200 milligrams at our location they're only $12 a bag for a hundred milligrams I mean it's a pretty good deal it's need a couple more cuz I'm gonna have a aftermath do what these guys do go ahead and take another blueberry we're sitting at about 30 milligrams now 40 50 six day we're going to go for about 80 seventy very gives you dry Josh they're like I'm very gelatinous consistency they're not gonna be like a super hard gummy but they're not like super stretchy either you can see it final 180 let's go bigger girl let's just add 20 more milligrams on buy big or go home I mean 100 milligrams it's not too terribly large or the dose but still large enough to make your average edible use your 100 milligram Cheers all right so we got those edibles down pretty pretty fast I'd say I see that we're only about nine minutes into this video here and we've eaten about a hundred milligrams so I'm gonna give it probably another 40 minutes or so I'll snap back over here to this video section once again I'm do cubed ABS just medical patient video channel thing if you're new here please mash that subscribe button we want to be a fellow earthling not a peasant to poop soup so yeah I'll be coming back to make a follow-up video after math video to this one I've really got to go to the bathroom right now and trying to kind of contain myself so that I can make a nice outro here but once again guys if you are in the Arizona area and you're a medical patient please try out some true infusion gunman's if you've never tried them try out their tinctures I personally give it the Duke seal of approval so I mean I've been in the industry for nearly three years now and I can tell you I like to sample out my products and you know what I'm telling my patients so that I'm not giving them you know false hopes or anything along that lines once again I'm not and when I say patients I don't mean I'm a doctor or anything I I never claim that I'm a doctor I'm just basically your friendly neighborhood naturopathic pharmacist essentially that's all I do is I dispense it out to the public who have medical cards so it's about it anyways we'll be coming back in about an hour or so with a follow-up to these bad boys and the 100 milligrams and how we're feeling in the effects and I'll catch you then peace", "vfI9eGircGg": "it's your buddy Jack and we're reviewing emerald sky wildberry cannabis infused gobies I've done a review for their indica and sativa licorice which I liked a little more and for some reason I think is just a little bit stronger but I believe I got this for 12 or 13 I think the liquorice is like 16 or 18 so the liquorice is a little more expensive but it's probably just because the cost of the candy itself and they both say a hundred milligrams maybe it's just mental what I've tried those already like I said to two threes usually when a sweet spot I had three of these the other day and it didn't seem quite as much as the liquorice still solid don't get me wrong emerald sky does it right but um cool stuff these taste great they get the job done and they opened up I got the little thing you put your finger right here to open and you press one way I am and we got four four of these left I was gonna take three but I don't want to just leave one hanging so I have all four yep that's cool a couple of stickers in there that's a good look I'd like a logo the bear for from there let's keep it a solid hour and a half come back see what we're thinking to round this review out see in a little while so it's about one hour and 40 minutes later and they're pretty mellow for form of the pretty mellow calming nice indica but still I believe they're not as strong as the liquorice pretty good though I would go liquorice over these though you", "vGPBTghmi4k": "so I'm steak inedible before I lay down and it [ __ ] woke me up and I'm blasted right now so look I'm gonna

don't", "zUHDLPbnYBA": "good afternoon and welcome to episode 7 of the ganja geezer it's a very sunny afternoon here in Colorado at convenient I just looked for 20 p.m. so for 20 I'm going to do another review today and what we're going to be reviewing today is a product called the blue kuduro pick this up last week as a buy one get one i'm going to try the hybrid version of it today so combinations teva indica and this is made by a company called MIP manufacturer website dub dub dub deep blue kudu calm I'll put that link down in the description 100 milligrams in this bar and it's kind of when they described it to me it's kind of like a tootsie roll so the ingredients on this are chocolate organic vanilla extract organic tangerine flavor oil powdered sugar organic coconut oil nonfat dry milk cocoa powder light corn syrup and cannabis and again there's 100 milligrams in this little nut log here there's a technical difficulty so what I'm going to do now it's also know also here it says new and improved recipe and then I've always loved new and improved always implies that it was old and lousy before so I'm going to take this thing and it doesn't seem to be really very packets friendly here so I'm peeling off the end it's going to peel back I'm probably to take about a fifth of this it's kind of crumbly it's not like a toy Tootsie Roll is kind of like a compressed brown kind of crumbling off as I check yeah it's kind of nasty so when I cough about that much little knife down here I'm very soft softer than a 20 cut off the end here got your rather unappetizing little compressed now and avoid instead of the circle so let's pop this in the mouth and see what happens the very weedy very very weedy and taste nobody would eat this and I realize it's not just a chocolate brownie or chocolate fudge it's got more of a consistency of fudge and then a tootsie roll it's not nearly as chewy but again a heavy heavy on weedy taste and 100 milligrams per log so that would and I pay ten dollars for this now to be fair i got this buy one get one at the giving tree it was a the buy one get one day for selected edibles there but i'm going to evaluate this based on its actual list price so that would give it am milligram per doc milligram to dollar ratio at ten so that's not very good that's Louis one of the three that I've reviewed so far that's it for now if I think of anything else up tomorrow when I come back and give you the evaluation for the actual pain relief and effects I'll let you know well it's next morning now this is the recap of the review of the blue kuduro the 100 milligram hybrid version that I took about a quarter of the roll last night so that should have been around 20 to 25 milligrams and let's recap the taste and consistency well this ain't no tootsie roll you know this kind of way it was described to me at the dispensary this Mort tasted like a dry fudge with a serious ganja funk I mean it was a really strong there's no way you can miss it the aftertaste wasn't bad but not good I've said the consistency was the most unappealing thing about it it kind of tasted like dry dry really dry fudge just like a Elmo sandy taste so with that I have to say I have to give the edible rating of this as six so taste rating on this of the four of them out of the four rating from my scale I give it a six now pain relief this is the high point of this um little long goodie this worked really better than I expected based on its reported milligram content within 90 minutes I was fully medicated and at that peak I experienced a serious body effect I mean it was a significant body effect I could really feel that the pain relief was excellent felt a little heavy in the body but not in an unpleasant way and also a very solid head effect a very lightheaded fat and solid had effect nothing that I couldn't handle it wasn't like I was unable to comport myself in public I would say this hybrid definitely lean toward the indica side of the scale based on amount of body effect but overall very very good lasted also for a very long time the head effects were gone within four to five hours and the body fix lasted until after I fell asleep now so that was 6 plus 6 7 plus hours and woke up this morning felt very good was able to do a three mile mark with a mile walk with minimal discomfort after the way I felt yesterday that was saying something I have to give the coup du roule to some hybrid cooter roll a 9 rating on pain relief so very very good third part of my I'm rating scale is side effects as I said I got a significant amount of body high and that made for some couch lock not bad i mean it i was very very relaxed actually sat through an episode of american pickers and I hate shows like that so I kind of tells you i might have experienced some couch lock but i was stable still able to read in function i was also able to go out into a couple errands so I was not scared to go outside or didn't feel uncomfortable so I'll give this a good solid raining of 84 lack of side effects very good and value this is where it gets hit again this is 100 milligram role for ten dollars that's its list price now I said before that I got it as a bogo the buy one get one at the giving tree so instead of 100 milligrams for ten dollars i got 200 milligrams for ten dollars but that's a sale price and i only go by a retail price for the rating so at the retail price of 100 milligrams per ten dollars it gets the rating at the ratio of 10 milligrams per dollar and that's the worst i've done so far and i'm going to have to give that a value of six on the scale alright in summary that means that you had a 64 taste a 9 for pain relief a sick an 84 side effects and a 64 value that gives you after you / for a ganja geezer rating of 7.25 but actually you notice there it's a 7 I decided that as subjective as these are you don't I'm just going to round down if it's below point 5 on the scale I'm going to round down if it's above point 5 on the scale I'll round up so the actual rating will be a 7 well that's it for now that's a review of this next maybe not next time but I had to mention here that I had a low kudu sativa role which I will be reviewing the future i'll probably do it in a much shorter format maybe just actually do the effects and not the unwrapping and everything just to say how that worked out but until then i'm going to say goodbye and stay medicated you", "tIVQ7Lwq5-s": "what's up youtube welcome reefer ross here and uh today got a little bit of a different video for you guys i don't normally make videos like this um but today since i had no weed to smoke and no dabs or nothing like that i figured uh why not make a nice little uh edible video for you guys so as you can see there two chocolate cookies um 200 milligrams thc in total so they're 100 milligrams thc each hybrid um but yeah so i figured why not since i don't got anything to smoke it's been a while since i've made a video too it's been about two weeks now because i've just just had a lot going on recently and um been trying to secure funding for my uh glass blowing because i needed to upgrade my equipment unfortunately because the torch i got is just it's good to make like small little like dabbers and beadwork and stuff like that but unfortunately for making like bongs and rigs which is what whenever i go into smoke shops that's all they want is mostly just bongs and rigs and spoon pipes um but my torch isn't big enough to handle that yet unfortunately so i got to upgrade my torch which the torch i need is like 1200 bucks so i'm trying to secure funding for that uh but yeah so i figured why not in the meantime since i don't have any uh weed to smoke and i couldn't go and buy more weed um i had some edibles so why not get get an edible going for you guys and show you guys what that what's that yeah what that is like oh it smells super chocolatey it smells like a brownie actually so we got one little cookie there nice looking little cookie it smells good it kind of smells like a chocolate mint cookie a little bit like a mint oreo or something but i guess let's take a bite here definitely has a bit of a weedy taste to it not too strong though actually tastes pretty good it's actually a really good cookie so i'm not usually one for edibles i usually prefer getting high um smoking but i figured for you guys on the channel today why not try out an edible of course it's got a cat hair on it already perks of having cats but i have one cat but he sheds like enough for three cats i swear always cat hair plus i just picked them up so i probably have cat around my hands it's got a bit of a weak taste to it but as someone who likes that wheat taste in their edibles it's pretty good i know some people don't like that taste like my cousin she hates that weed edible like the weed taste in the edibles but me i like it but i've also eaten a lot of edibles all right cheers guys i'm gonna save the other one though i'm just gonna eat the one for now because 100 milligrams that's pretty good so that'll probably get me pretty baked but so i'll probably end up pausing it stopping the recording and i'll come back in a few hours when it's like really hit me and settled in when i'm nice and baked um so i hate the edibles around 11 15 ish in the morning and it's now just about two i am definitely feeling nice and stoned i'm feeling good i'm just vibing you know chilling and uh yeah and i ended up looking around and i ended up managing to find the last little bit of shatter so i i was gonna take it off camera and i was like oh [ __ ] yeah dad and i was about to take it and i was like you know what i gotta take it on camera for you guys because i was like i'm gonna hop back on camera in like 20 minutes anyway so i'll just save it right and so i had it and i saved it up for you guys but yeah so off that edible right now like i haven't had anything to smoke i'm just feeling good i'm vibing i'm feeling nice and chill uh i feel like my eyes are a little bit more more closed you know a little more shut uh a little lower um but yeah other than that i'm

flavor reviews it's already been revealed it's not really much of a reveal but if you can guess from the colors in the background you'll be right sour watermelon warheads is here see if we can focus on this there you go i'm not very much of a sour sour person i guess some people would say i'm sour on the internet [Music] welcome to price plow but in terms of flavors i've never really been a big sour person um if you remember watching the uh burn video where i did the sour watermelon burn with with mike oh i didn't handle it very well wow but at the very least you might enjoy watching me pucker up i don't know if i'm gonna enjoy this one but we'll see so without further ado let's crack this one and get it got a little bit on the lens right there clean that up cool well i can smell it already definitely watermelon definitely sour i don't think i need to tell you guys all about the uh active ingredients in this one if you do want to learn more about the active ingredients you can run over to the previous one where i talked about in tropical mango and gram of alcar amazing hologram of touring you watch any of my pre-workout videos you know that i love touring it's incredible for all things athletic related neuro factor 100 milligrams this stuff is amazing and lastly estrogen very interesting data to be coming out soon on what uh estrogen can do to help increase the bioavailability of some other ingredients that you may not have considered already or if you actually can even go to the sirs episode where we have dan on from goes we talk all about the formulation the creation of the product so let's send this one down the hatch oh that's a lot of citric acid and malic acid i mean i could drink a couple of these if i want really needed it i've got a couple in the case that i got to drink it's not my favorite it's really sour it's just not my thing i mean i'm gonna finish this one be honest with you because i like the effects but in terms of like good flavors the citrus the tropical mango they definitely win for me now i thought this is inaccurate it's very accurate it's a little sour watermelon warhead i'm just not a warhead person i'm not a sour person so if you like sour watermelon warheads this might be for you but it's not really for me so exciting still love the authentic collab i'm still gonna finish it but you won't catch me drinking a ton of these in any case guys i wanted to jump on you real quick throw this together if you guys give you my authentic review and feedback i obviously am biased because not only do we have a business affiliate relationship with ghost i've been friends with dan for quite some time um play call of duty with him and ryan pretty often uh there's no uh hiding from the fact that i do support their company very heavily i think they do great things for the industry i think that these authentic collaborations that's really carbonated by the way these are really heavily carbonated i'm just a big fan of what they do to legitimize our industry to elevate it and bring other brands and industries into this one just like this bringing candy into supplements uh we are biased but i think i'm biased for good reason they're good people they're doing good things for us and they're helping all of us out in any case if you have any questions about ghost you can go to pricebot.com ghost lifestyle or you can just ask me below because i'd love to talk about the brand with you i love to talk about the product with you um like i said before there are full dosages on the bottle um if you want more information on that you can go to our my previous video on the tropical mango one or you can go over to the service castle we talked with dan himself thanks for sticking around for this pretty short video this one will be under five minutes which is pretty nice um just an honest thoughts on the flavor it's not my favorite but it's pretty accurate to those warhead flavors so thanks so much for watching and have a great day welcome to price plow [Music] you", "dRCWeLKTTyw": "hey YouTube this is grant Smith from Colorado I'm coming at you live from the mile-high and I am just going to do a quick review here of another edible medical marijuana product here and that is the sour gummies by a company called wana I am not familiar with them this is my first experience with their product and so these are sour gummies really not sure I think that yeah they're about 10 milligrams apiece in terms of THC per and apparently it was made I don't know you got all sorts of information about the plants they used in different trim apparently they use some trim I tore this package up like an idiot so anyway these are what they look like and you know if you're into gummies and you're into that whole thing that's flavor and that texture you would really like these the flavor is great I'm not really the biggest fan of the texture personally so sorry one sec here we are you know here if you're a gummy pen you will enjoy them if not you probably just you know like me you'll be able to tolerate them and you know I'm certainly not trying to knock this product at all because they definitely tasted great again I'm just not a huge fan of the actual gummy textures so you can see they're covered with you know crystals or whatever infused I really don't know anything much about this particular process but this is what they they look like you know standard candy and that's ten milligrams of THC infused within this and that's a pretty good deal you know it'll get you a good little buzz going on and you know if you have a high tolerance level you may want to eat a couple of them if you don't well um I'm sure one will do it and so you know just again I just wanted to remind you all out there that if you're not you know here in Colorado or California someplace where you can kind of get these things with a little less you know going to the street kind of deal you know you may you may not really know how to use them right and so I just want to help everybody out there you know if you get your hands on this kind of stuff just remember don't go overboard with it you know you'll enjoy it so much more if you don't eat too many at once you can really make yourself sick and you know regret doing it if you just tear into them like that so anyways hope you guys are out there having a great one tonight and if you would like me to review anything or have any questions or anything like that if you want to see anything let me know and give me any suggestions that you've got thank you for watching and be safe out there alright peace", "H5f073sUB6k": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to week two the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on this review we are talking my favorite company on the planet we're talking canna Co another one of their 100 milligram erse one that I've never reviewed any of their this this one on any level before but I'm excited to do it because I love these kind of things and that's Kanako's 100 milligram lemon bar that's right 100 milligram lemon bar from canna Co super super excited I've loved every single can of coke product I've reviewed I've loved every milligram egde I've reviewed from them 100 250 and 500 although the 500s are definitely too strong for me to do in one go but I've done it before watch the video yeah so I'm super excited about this as I said I love love lemon bars too so I'm really looking forward to this one let's a look at the back of the box here I've already opened it up just a little bit to make this a little bit easier on me as we've got our back of the package here 440 calories for the whole thing the pure experience and lemon bar says on the front here delicious sugar cookie crust layered with lemon filling topped with vanilla icing and finished with refreshing lemon zest sounds awesome let's go ahead and get right into it here just a second and here we go here is the lemon bar a handsome product if I've ever seen one there's the sugar cookie crust the lemon filling and that baller-ass looking vanilla icing it's big it's very big much bigger than I thought it was going to be it weighs quite a bit it feels quite heavy let's go ahead and give it a bite there's a quality lemon bar mmm good crust get billing good icing no real cannabis taste what to me to speak up at all almost completely devoid of cannabis taste just a good lemon bar um all right guys well I'm gonna enjoy polishing this off and I will see you in two hours or actually I'll see you guys in just a couple of seconds but I'll be back in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching Wheaton I'll see you in just a bit peace hi guys it's been Oh actually a little bit longer than two hours I must confess I accidentally took a nap in between this review which might have tested the power of the product of the Kanak Oh a lemon bar 100 milligram that I felt it necessary to take a nap in between the the review there I enjoyed the product quite a bit I loved how it tasted absolutely left how it tasted and it got me up to like a solid six half maybe from a hundred milligram at a bull which is just I mean it's just ridiculous it's incredible as all kind of coat products seem to be I love them all this is definitely no exception for me I love love love the lemon bar 100 milligrams even at 100 milligrams it got me really really high so I'm completely pleased with it oh I believe it cost me ten bucks at my dispensary so an utterly affordable edible as well if you see one at a dispensary and you like the lemon bars do not hesitate to grab one you will certainly be happy you did that is again the Kanak Oh lemon bar 100 milligrams thank you so much for watching wheats guys and we will check you out on the next review peace I'm not gonna throw that at this camera", "F9LVcVeFH1Y": "[Music] everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are looking at a brand new product from a brand new brand we are looking at county bushmaster Cowie Bushmaster the pot plant peanut butter and THC hundred milligram I believe it is a granola bar gluten free long lasting all-natural the Bushmaster bar on the back we've got our ingredients and our nutrition packs which I always love to see on edibles I like granola bars well I should say I like granola bars that are designed for you know like 10 year-olds kudos bars the things that are basically candy like kudos or Quaker Oatmeal granola bars so I'm hoping it's like that but we shall see I'm not as big of a fan of the granola bars that are actually healthy so this is the first time you've ever tuned in to wheats the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat some measure of this if it's not too big the whole thing in front of you and just don't want to bore you with eating the whole thing and I'll come back to you guys then in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review all right so let's open this up give it the smell test give it the taste test see how it works here oh boy know a lot of nuts it's a very nutty looking for an old bar mostly just peanuts no real marijuana odor to speak of you can see the peanut butter and chocolate there you've got some a lot of peanuts some almonds some other things not a big nut fan but I'll do it for you alright so this is the Kalli Bushmaster plant peanutbutter THC let's give it a taste well it's very cute it's gonna take me a while to do this I don't even like nuts but that's not terrible um and the peanut butter binds it together really well we've got a nice taste that chocolates wear on the top is good um yeah that's not bad at all um that's really surprising I don't like peanuts I don't like almonds I do not mind the taste of this and it's got wheat in it which is are usually somewhere it makes it taste terrible to begin with so on the taste front if you are a fan of nuts or granola bars definitely a positive for this one definitely on the plus side um well I'm hope they're not gonna just hold me in front of you because I'll be helpful like six minutes two minutes down but I would have come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling and sorry for talking with my mouth full can't really help it I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how this is hitting hopefully pretty well so I will see you guys then thank you so much thank you so much for watching weeds see you guys soon peace guys it's been 2 hours since I had the Kali Bushmaster pot plant peanut butter THC granola bar thingamajig and I am pleasantly surprised I'm pretty high for a hundred milligram edible I was pleasantly surprised with the taste I think this is an impressive little package Wow and I think it was rather affordable I think it was seven or eight dollars I can't remember the exact price but I thought it was tasty surprisingly potent my eyes are rather red for a hundred milligram edible guys I think this is a little hidden treasure I just happen to see these at a dispensary behind the counter hidden behind some other bigger products and I was like oh I'll try one of those and I think it's a real hidden in pleasure or a hidden treat III don't think it's that big of a brand maybe it is I don't know but I haven't seen it anywhere of a ban this dispensary so I think it's a small brand but if you see it at a dispensary near you and you like granola bars give it a try it's it's really good I'm I'm pleasantly surprised I just now noticed that their logo is eat your greens I get it okay but their products are really good or this product is really good highly recommended okay that's the Kali Bushmaster pop plant peanut butter THC comes highly recommended thank you so much for watching weeds guys we'll check you out on the next review peace hello and

the first time I'm actually trying it and see you can see and yeah kind of smells like tree but I really don't taste it first so I'm not sure on me I don't do the math on how many milligrams of each edible blood smear try one hmm oh it tastes exactly like carpaccio and as umezaki heard that I've seen in other videos that either actually met little blocks mmm he's exactly like starter packages so

marijuana edible review show I only say that because I think I'm the only marijuana edible review show I'm sure if there was another one it would be the preeminent one because it's hard to have a worse one but what are we talking about here today other than how bad we are we are talking about gummies that's why I've got my Nutella and spatula here so that's what this is for this is for fat this is for fat for the real review the infused creation sativa strawberry apple sour melts strawberry apple sour melts what a weird combination don't even understand what the Apple is supposed to be in that strawberry Apple sour belts 300 milligrams of THC this will very likely be my final review of infused creations they've all been bummers from the get-go and if this one isn't doesn't pick up or it doesn't change my opinion in any way that will probably be it for infused creations and we can go ahead and write them up so I've got my fat here just with the gummies I like to ensure that I eat them under optimal conditions so I take a little bit of fat beforehand and I like to do that in the form of Nutella because I'm a red-blooded human being and I like Nutella like everyone who should creamy chocolate hazelnut evening delicious now for something a lot less creamy Nutella II and delicious this all of infused creations gummies we've got a strong whiff of it just as soon as I open that package have that very recognizable gummy weed aftertaste that very bitter a very astringent yeah makes you want to rub your tongue on sandpaper type of taste and I can already smell it coming out of these so I'm not looking forward to it this is smell strong boy does it smell strong I do like sour bells traditionally but I'm pretty sure I'm not going to like these anyways let's go ahead and put it right down the hatch let's stop bitching and complaining and just go ahead and eat it well oh my god that is terrible that is so bad oh [ __ ] me oh there's no like sweetness right on

strawberry apple sour belts from infused creations and they are terrible boy are they terrible they taste terrible I'm not high at all totally stone-cold sober I feel like I wasted my money on these total total waste of money thankfully not does not cost a lot for the infused creations I believe these only cost me nine dollars which is really affordable for a 300 milligram edible the only problem is I don't think there are 300 milligrams of THC in there because I am NOT high at all not even as I said I yeah yeah nothing to say about it nothing nothing kind to say about it if you see it at a dispensary near you pass totally avoid it actually go and tell your bud tender they should not be stocking these because it's just an insult to their customers sorry to get so real with you guys and

your dispensary I've got my trusty spatula and my trusty thing in Nutella why do I have these you might be asking if you have not tuned into one of these before it means I am reviewing gummies and the reason I have this Nutella is so that I can have a little bit of fact before I eat these gummies I find that having a little bit of fat in your system before consuming gummies enhances the high of that gumming so let's just take a little lick of Nutella here the best part about any edible review because who doesn't love just some freaking Nutella all right that should be that should do it for my fats now what kind of gummy are we reviewing we are reviewing lol edibles candy I have actually had a couple people asked me to review this I reviewed one lol edible product in the past that I did not like very much the Elwha edibles flamin hot cheetos this here is a candy it is blueberries our belts Meghnath be gorilla glue glue hybrid so you can see on the back they've got a plea to add them on social media they've got a missing lot ID batch number and best before date not on there so we don't know if we're gonna be doing okay says do not mix with alcohol first time I've ever seen that I don't exactly know why you shouldn't mix the two other than you don't like getting crunked but uh who cares I am really hoping this lol edibles redeems not only lol edibles which he's a really dumb name I mean it's just a colossal II stupid name I'm hoping it not only redeems them but also gummies in general if you've never really seen weeks before I have never been a huge fan of gummies or candies I finally get you less high than the confectionery edibles but maybe this will be the one that turns it around we shall see alright so let's open this up here these blueberries sour ropes alright that is a strong weed odor very strong you will smell that from a distance away as I think so be careful opening this somewhere in a closed area where you don't want people smoking weed because that has a very strong weed odor as do these ropes themselves these look a lot like the Buddhist hours which I've had in the past and reviewed hmm there's a considerable weed taste to them not overwhelming the sourness definitely helps not as sour as the Buddhist hours but still pretty sour with a stronger weed flavor so hopefully that means they're more potent than the the Voodoo sours Oh sure if I mention this this is a 300 milligram animal should should be pretty potent but then again gummies your mileage right back again fairly strong we taste but the sourness really helps them overcoming with it all right guys so I'm gonna finish these here off-camera I'm not gonna bore you to death eating you all these things here in front of you and I will be back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because as always that is the most important part of any edible review all right guys please please please wish me luck let's hope these are better than our gummies in the past and ll WA edibles in the past and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know the results thank you so much for watching weights we'll see you soon peace guys I am happy to report that while not perfect and while not my first choice in any of the categories lol edibles the candy blue ropes blue berry ropes blue gummi ropes are are a nice little revelation they are not the most powerful 300 milligram edible I've ever had they're not the most tasty gummy I've ever had but I would say they are probably my new favorite gummy I am I do feel quite high not as high as I would be on a 300 mm gram confectionery edible like say akarova for example but that's a comparing you know something with like the best of the best I guess it's substantially better than their flamin hot cheeto knockoff that I had a while ago so you know it might be a combination of lowered expectations I was also a little tired going to this review so that might also be contributing to like my feelings of being high but overall I'm I'm I'm pleasantly surprised I know I used that phrase a lot but this was a welcome surprise I I had two strikes going against it one being lol edibles which I had a bad experience with and being a gummy which I've mostly found to be disappointing and I found it to be okay so that's you know that's good that's good I would not probably buy this again but if you are a fan of gummy edibles or if you really like sour gummies this is certainly better than the Voodoo candies I've had which are 375 milligram anibal's you might want to go and pick this up but for me it's it's a nice little surprise so thank you so much for watching weeks guys that's my dog walking in and we will check you out on the next review peace hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "nUlkBjwEBsc": "yo what is up guys that playing togar back here again welcome to another video man we're back filming back on my phone instead of the iPad my iPad is kind of [ __ ] out right now so it's whatever I can stick with the phone I like it a little bit better anyway west of the hassle so today's video guys I got a edible review my favorite edible it's the flavor X watermelon sour belt well they're not called sour belt but it's just built this is the packaging I would show you that apples inside and everything but I kind of ate it all and I'm just going to give you my experience and my review and should you get it get should you even you know try it out but before we start off the video man I do have a bowl loaded so I got some alien OGE loaded up we're gonna be using my big bong cuz the bubblers dirty and plus I keep knocking it over [ __ ] annoying but this is the only no G already took a bat rip and I put some fresh stuff on top but hopefully you guys are gonna be smoking along with me I was going to get hit on my babe but not today man so anyhow guys hopefully you're having a good day and yeah let's get this video started with uh take this first hit and hopefully you guys are smoking along with me if so let me know what you're smoking on cuz I'm always curious to know what you guys are smoking on um while watching the video and let's get dis sesh started man so Cheers so yeah guys so today we're gonna be reviewing the flavor X watermelon belt this is a 250 milligram package it contains with 10 belts each belt is 25 milligrams each and to tell you the truth it had really good taste really sweet it was a bit sour at times but one of the better gummies that I've tried and the California cannabis market like there but yeah man [ __ ] almost aired out here for a second but flavor axe is a San Diego company and I do live in San Diego so it's pretty cool hometown company at least that's what I was told Dendi the research but I know they do have a production factory down um down in San Diego though so you know I don't I don't know if they started up in San Diego that they do you have a factory here um and yeah guys like honestly best best tasting gummies didn't taste like cannabis at all like super sweet but it tastes exactly like watermelons didn't taste anything else I didn't get any weed back taste to it or anything like that um I I had to like the downfall though but like the downfall to it I had to eat a half a bag to really feel something but my tolerance is pretty high cuz I do smoke every day and I do eat edibles on more than a couple of times a week so I do have a pretty high tolerance so um if you're like a rookie like looking in on this like don't eat have the don't be a [ __ ] [ __ ] you know cuz you'll be [ __ ] throwing up and you're gonna be regretting it and you wouldn't like edibles at all like you want in try it and try one again after experiencing a edible overdose it's really shitty it's happened to my mom a couple of times funny enough but uh but yeah I don't don't be that a don't be that a smart guy that chased you uh eat half the bag or the whole bag and just think oh don't feel anything okay do not do not be a [ __ ] like that man that's all I got to say but yeah man like I really do recommend this product this is like a really shorter like video I guess not really but yeah like I read into everything like this time around I read the packaging there they are lab tested and they do follow the new guidelines for the edibles if you're an outsider that's not in California if you don't know what I'm talking about back last month June not July 10th or July 1st they passed a new law which is like the new phase going into the recreational and medical market for the cannabis market here in California everything has to be free packaged everything has to be lab tested and yeah there it's much stricter like compared to like Oregon like I see origin like they so have like they're so using the pill bottles now it's in fanciest jars and they give you in the legal dispensaries anyhow they give you a smelly proof bag and everything and it's child locked it's to prevent kids from it's to prevent [ __ ] the kids getting into the [ __ ] my cat [ __ ] tried to pop in the video popped in the video again so sorry about that but a dude come on this she's a dick anyhow yeah so it's really different here I've been kind of looking into like other states and stuff not really finding anything but just like comparing but it really does seem like California's a lot stricter with the whole marijuana thing compared to everywhere where else but yeah man honestly I'm gonna have to give the edibles a 5 out of 5 I'm sorry for kind of rambling on about the whole California cannabis market but I just to give you guys insight of like what's different and hopefully you guys learned something new about it if you're you were interested in knowing how the market was here but five out of five I would get them again and it was only 20 bucks - I did not mention that I only paid twenty [ __ ] bucks for this and hell yeah I would pay for it again cuz it's cheap I don't mind paying twenty bucks or something that gets me [ __ ] up like I'm pretty sure if I take like a month off like tolerance break man and and I eat least like I'm pretty sure like a half half a belt would get me pretty ripped but I do have a high tolerance and I don't know when the next time I'm going to be taking a tolerance break to be honest but but yeah guys I'm going to take one more rip and be out of the way the next video is going to be string review of alien og I might have that out later today or probably tomorrow which is I'm recording this video on Friday the 24th so the 25th tomorrow you'll get the video and if you have it already man make sure to click on the post notifications because I do post every Monday Wednesday and Friday and I occasionally do upload on Saturdays Saturdays can be like more of like a once in awhile thing but since I haven't been uploading that much and I took like a month off like I figured that I would pump out as many videos as I can and yeah guys so I'm going to take one more bong rip [Music] do you guys have a problem always losing your lighters when um when you're baked or just in general because I have the biggest problem and always lose mine let me know down in the comment section below if you have the same problem but uh yeah guys going to take this last rip and go and head out upload this video and probably get ready do you record the nlg video in a little bit who knows so geez but yeah guys till next time stay baked peace", "xoDYHfKn23g": "welcome to wheat skies the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and if you're a long time then you know that I often talk about going to the moon products taking me to the moon going to the moon and back being over the moon moon moon moon moon moon moon moon well today guys we are actually going to be visiting the Moon Moon cosmic cappuccino that is 250 milligrams of THC we've got it right here the first time we are reviewing anything from this brand the Moon whoops again the Moon brand the cosmic cappuccino I'm not even really sure what this is to be honest I'm not even really sure what this thing is maybe it's some kind of cappuccino flavored wafer I I don't know I don't know it's gonna be a mystery for us all we're all gonna find out at the same time and I hope that like the product says it does take me to the moon and back it's Moon megadose chocolate bars is the name of the company and it's been cosmic cappuccino and on the back it says intergalactic milligram \u00e4j-- that's fun so uh if you've never tuned in to wait weeks before the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this product and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review all right guys I can grab some scissors real quick I'll be right back we'll open it up and give it a taste all right here we go trying to get it out all right here we go here is our wafer or what I assume is a wafer there is a strong weed odor to it let's give it a bite not a wafer just a long skinny chocolate bar with a cup of key no flavor on my cappuccino I mean cappuccino thank you Arrested Development it's good good quality chocolate liked it quite a bit perfect melting point it had a strong cannabis scent but well there is a cannabis taste to it it's really not that strong it's not that bad at all quite like it in fact well guys I'm gonna finish off this cosmic cappuccino looking forward to it and then I will come back to you guys in just two hours selecting a homegoing but for you guys will just be a couple seconds see you then peace [Music] welcome back guys it's been two hours since I had the moon mega dose chocolate bars with their intergalactic milligram \u00e4j-- and I gotta say unfortunately I am not at the moon I am more like at the you know sort of the International Space Station somewhere in the stratosphere definitely not on the moon certainly not on the moon and back it's not terrible I don't want to suggest it's terrible I'm at probably a for me maybe a 5 somewhere between a 4 and a 5 you know like that kind of level of high this was a $15.00 edible so you know you can't complain too much for that price that's a little worse than average but not substantially so I did like how it tasted tasted great there was just like cannabis taste but the rest of the chocolate was nice and smooth and creamy and had a great cappuccino flavor but I'm just not as high as I was hoping to be with the moon megadose chocolate bars here I was I was certainly hoping to be you know somewhere in outer space but yet I am still terrestrial what can you do alright guys thank you so much for watching wheats I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on the later view peace", "lb9T3hj74JA": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at a brand that I have seen taking long beach in Southern California by storm and that is Miss Mary Jane's edibles and we are reviewing their cookies and cream cake pop both the first time we're reviewing a Miss Mary Jane's edibles and a cake pop period these are very popular Mary Jane's is very popular I've seen her everywhere her mug and smile and face I don't know how much more we'll be seeing her after all these new rules take effect but for now we'll review what products they've got and hopefully they get to survive the upcoming at apocalypse so handsome packaging here on the outside nice little cardboard box but well labeled well decorated nice packaging I like it quite a bit it shows what the product looks like it's got the ingredients and my favorite thing to see it shows the lab rating from SC labs 100 milligrams of THC and here SC labs you know you're always getting a quality product when you see from them I've never actually eaten the cake pop period before I know what cake pops are I assume that they're like cupcakes with a stick in them I've never had one edible non edible anything in between so I'm kind of excited about this and I'm excited to give this Miss Mary Jane's a try I hope its ubiquity means it is it is good but that SC Labs has already got me pretty pretty pretty hopeful so here we go packaged in there as well there's your little cake pop in an additional little wrapper and this wrapper looks like it's gonna be annoying to get off here let's see there's got to be an easier way to do this but I'm gonna make it difficult there we go finally got it okay oh [ __ ] I just broke the cake pop up a little bit it's a little delicate so here is the old cake pop let's just do it in one cuz it's about break oh wow wow nice delicious wow that's incredible I loved it the taste was incredible no cannabis taste whatsoever good moist cake I know some people hate that word I'm sorry good what's a synonym for moist good vaginal secretions cake that's [ __ ] up to say to this good cake good icing no cannabis taste love the taste of it now the most important part how it's gonna make me feel for that we're gonna have to wait two hours to see for sure and I'll be sure to come back to you guys in two hours to let you know thanks so much for watching weeds and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] welcome back to week guys and we are talking cake pops from Mary Jane edibles Miss Mary Jane's edibles this hundred milligram are here this multiple award winner I liked it I liked it quite a bit I love the taste of it really really enjoyed the taste that it was truly excellent and it got me pretty high not outrageously bad a you know somewhere in the average sort of 5 range mid mid still pretty high from it these and oh it's been longer than two hours which you should articulate it's actually been closer to four hours we got to dinner with some friends I got lost track of time but I'm still high four hours later from this but never got outrageously high at any point and as I would like to reiterate one more time I thought it tasted in credit no cannabis taste whatsoever and it's definitely a hundred milligram er in terms of potency so thanks SC labs for verifying that and again it's just a nice little package I think I neglected as well to mention the price I got these two for fifteen which is a pretty good deal 750 each for 100 milligram edible it's not bad especially for one that tastes as good as this one does so guys I think that's gonna do it for this review if you see Miss Mary Jane's cake pops or at least the cookies and cream one yeah maybe give it a shot I think he'll be happy that you did I'm gonna do another Miss Mary Jane's review in the future just to make sure everything is a-okay but asked right now that's going to be a pretty good endorsement from me so guys thank you so much for watching wheats and we will see you on a future review peace", "us89zun3omk": "[Music] guys these are only eight dollars for 100 [Music] milligrams", "uODdpLsRE70": "against some Smokies cannabis infused peach Fruit Chews that somehow came from California with me and then I'm here with my boss super chronic who runs the talking hedge we're gonna do a little live taste test hey will you open that for us what do you think of their packaging Rob breathe the gist then it look nice like it's resealable mylar Frank won't you eat two of those start there eat one hold that one taste not too sugary it's got a good chew to it mild on the melon what kind of what is this it's a cannabis infused peach fruit soup peach well I guess it's kind of peachy like it's fairly mild yeah alright so you're eating 10 milligrams you get another one there that's ten milligrams what are twenty milligrams can do to you will you even know no all right what would we need to find out you want three more no I'm gonna really well I had a hundred so maybe 200 okay okay so from a flavor perspective though what do you think the flavor was good there's a very very slight hint an earthy tone at the end I think that's the oil okay they could probably pump up the peach a little bit but I'm pump H pump up the peach yeah I'm glad that wasn't overly sugary though it had a good shoe - a good texture good product your name for the record Jason all right so I have a little thing I'd like you to do for me so I come from land far away first tell me about their packaging what do you think of their packaging Smokey's cannabis infused peach fruit cheese looks nice right looks tasty right and then would you be qualified to try one and tell me if they're awesome I think so would you see that fellow experienced in right tasty so I'm I mean it Horton across state lines right I've run them you know Canadian yeah yeah no in this case California that's California yeah we think yeah yeah isn't it pretty yeah yeah yeah would you like to try one nice and then how do you think that that look ranks against other packaging like how are they doing just from a look perspective a style I think is pretty good is it attractive to children well it's at a 21 plus store that cards are very efficiently so I don't think that matters all that much Oh brilliant answer I dig that all right and then you are qualified to answer this stuff aren't you yeah they dig it all right so it is the talking edge your cannabis business podcast hey brother thanks for contribute right", "GlNRlD6udeA": "the heist but he's back he's back after an hour yes yes guys he's back he's back are you doing are you doing so roughly an hour late it's being literally about an hour and three minutes day but feel the effects I feel the effects very very nicely actually it feels lovely it's not overpowering or anything like that I really really enjoy it it's nice I don't think the 300 milligram sweets were quite enough for me I have quite a high tolerance to cannabis as you guys know you've seen more smoke but yeah you really really feel a nice effect from this like I said it's not overpowering I don't want to sort of - don't mean I'm not gonna sort of an uncomfortable position or place or anything like that I just feel really nice I feel good I feel like I put some games on I feel like I've got I'd be fighting for a walk I could be absolutely active scrappy-dappy-doo being stop it nor pussycat but yeah I feel I feel really good I feel really really nice on her I don't feel salt down all over or anything like that lovely I'm not see it's only it's only just being just over an hour and it does say quite clearly on the packet may take up two hours so delay by up to two hours okay so I'm probably not in the full of the effects as of yet anyway so it's probably a little bit more time I would say I think I'm just on a gradual buildup in a minute but I would say that after about half an hour I started to feel something which like so I didn't on the other packet of sweets at all I didn't it took like the full hour before I started getting the effects of it so it works a lot quicker but I'd probably put that down to me doing it first thing in the morning I'm not having anything to eat as of yet so so for me personally if I do have any of these sweets again I'm going to try my best to probably take them first thing privy inside you and I mean unless I've got loads of em and then I'll just wash them like anything but yeah if you just use them as medicine then yeah I think first thing in the morning for me works the and I'll be interested to see actually how long it lasts as well so be out feeling nice and feeling nice and I'm nice and relaxed nice and mellow nicely stoned in my body yeah just like not overpowering my vision feels a little bit like it's going a little bad times when I move my head's so definite strength to it but I personally think that I could eat a couple of packets of those no problem and it would be OK for me to do that I would recommend you guys do that obviously if you don't smoke a lot just you know mean they'd split up into 50 milligram pieces so it's really really good to go shoo just because I've taking a whole pot don't go do that please you know me know your body know your limits but for me it not problem been smoking quite a lot of years to be fair my tolerance is up there so but I think of ninja had taken for example that packet of sweets I think she'd be really really feeling it bang so a tolerance a little bit lower than mine Oh see I am the main smoker cheers guys so still on the black cheese loving it though does it make me feel like I want to stop smoking which is which is good although sometimes about as it was it's like I can't touch the smoke for hours but now I feel a right of your eye not a particularly high dosage for me but gets really good guys [Music] you're quite chatty as well I'm always chatting you know that my job really over chat in a minute nice pecked on me I've had a bomb since the last bomb over so again it's been an hour since all that bomb definitely like to try some more of these better bores I [Music] definitely like to probably get to a position where I can maybe have a couple of packs of em and see what they feel like but left me for me I've still got half of my speaker left which is just oh no I think I only have one mil of it or whatever it is but there's about half of it left night so starving hungry I'm gonna make a famous Ryan fecal pizza okay I will save a little drop of it just for the for the fecal hot chocolate cause I didn't want to do a thick hot chocolate as well but I'm gonna do yeah I'm gonna do a pizza with some Pico on it which is what like so Ryan eats it and he recommends it and I thought well do you know what that sounds really good last time I got it all over my teeth I've tried it in there's other ways you can do it as well but I think that defeats the way I really really really like the idea of that so I will try that I will try that definitely so I've seen a few people do the Pico pizza so yeah it's made me think hmm lot lot easier way to go down and a lot sort of safer in your body because you're digesting it with food at the same time lovely a little bomb well I'm a rocket oh dear cheers guys Cheers yeah I feel it [ __ ] lovely I feeling lovely nice they like say it might affect you differently if you take a packet about if you're like a one joint add a person and you know you you're not make particularly a heavy heavy smoker maybe you're not a smoker at all maybe that's the reason why you'll you know you're taking metaphors is because you don't like smoking so I would just say start with a low dosage and then just just build yourself up after an hour you'll get to feel whether you're comfortable or not and then obviously you can you can take another dose and so yeah don't do a packet in one go please please guys one love I'm fashioning I've been trained for this [Music] lovely Peter [ __ ] noise noise a cocktail - Peter [ __ ] lovely [Music] become picture here we come you'll be on the live stream do their life garibai straight after this pretty much as soon as the pizza sketch [Music] Wow what can you say to that cheers guys cups tea on the go you know how we roll in the am one huh let me feel really good I mean ready if I was gonna rip you know give him a proper sort of a review is sort of mark then I mean Oxley the pack her packaging tell accent the sweets himself really really really nice I like the fact that you can dose by having the eight sweets which are basically fifty milligrams of peace they sell I think that's brilliant really really nice really really nice of fat not quite strong enough for me but for some people that might be really really strong so yeah probably set by an eight out of ten on though so a ten on sweets by would like soy two packets will certainly see what the sweets and the feet can do together with the black cheese you will see what sort of stately and getting me into today though shall they so yeah peaceful nerve thank you very much for watching this video and I will be back very very soon because I'm gonna be doing a live stream in the next 20 minutes so peace will learn seriously noise just ate some more meta balls and got stoned yes yes hey attend for the chuckles one love one love [Music]", "KVKmLQ4HwZ0": "hi everybody so today I'm going to be doing a review on the medicated hard candies this one is great so it's a hundred there's the 100 milligrams of THC right there it's from cannabis no I did the blue raspberry one before and I I didn't taste blue raspberry at all so hopefully this one tastes like grape I'll take them all why not so open and all these flippin things I can never okay always stuck together but it's not just so like I'll show you what they look like Thanks so they look like this like usually come like this these ones are because of the heat but they they come like this so they're 25 milligrams each you get four blocks which equals the hundreds milligrams I'll just a little piece so they look I broke it off as I was talking they look like that just little little cubes so it tastes like a little bit like grape and that was probably add I can taste the grape in these okay I can still taste the the THC but overall the grape flavored hard candies from Canada's mom are good that's like sometimes you get a little bit of THC and the rest of time it's grape so it's just about 6:00 p.m. right now this usually takes like an hour and a bit to kick in usually I'll be back alright told you guys know when it kicks in you know all the good stuff but so what I'm gonna do actually cuz it takes so long I'm going to roll a joint and I'll smoke that while I wait for this to kick in and it should be decent ah-ah-ah I'll really join up and smoke that and come back and let you guys know [Music] all about the hard candies from cannabis no okay I'm back and as you can see this stuff has kicked in so I smoked it what I told you guys I was going to roll the joint I smoked the gorge and if you want to see that part you'll have to go and watch the video before mine or yet before mine in its video I smoked it so I took I took this at 6 and I want to say like around seven ish I could start to feel it and it was like oh this feels good and then so then I was like you know what I'm gonna wait a little bit just to see if anything is different or so I waited and I was like so lolling around because it's 8:30 right now and this stuff is I didn't realize how strong the scats and like you feel good but you don't want to do anything like you're like everybody I would recommend you take a shower cuz the shower feels good if the reason I took the showers because I wasn't feeling very well and cuz I just kept on getting stronger and like I tried to sit down and relax and that didn't help and then I was getting like these pains like it was like really really deep into like that the area where sometimes it's painful anyways and yeah like I didn't feel well so I took a shower and that that helped okay I feel like better like I don't feel like I'm gonna throw up cuz that's what I felt like I'm not really sure why but like if you were to do this at somebody else's house um you might as well bring like your pajamas or something cuz I think you wouldn't be leaving yet BRE thirsty on this this is a this isn't oh my [ __ ] like this is really good get in cannabis Mel cuz their stuffs good yeah you really don't feel like doing much like um you're in the shower for like a long time and it's like really hot so that you know that feels good whatever but then it gets to the point that there's like too much Steve in there so you know whatever and then you just feel like doing like nothing but you may want to find like a good place to sit or lay in watch TV or just think about things or just really do nothing I wouldn't recommend like reading a book cuz I don't really think you'd get far you me at this point in like I'll keep busy but like if you were to read a book I think right now I'm like if you started to you would you wouldn't get very far like you would you would have I could forget just talking about oh okay if you're reading a book like you may get maybe ten minutes and then you probably fall asleep because this stuff makes your eyes like really heavy like they just like they feel like heavy hit down here like I think anybody could tell that you were high because there would be no hiding that one not only hungry or anything thirsty yes but like I'm not hungry or anything so that's good because I think if you were to eat a lot on this right now just because I mean probably like not feel very well like you'd probably throw up or something yeah and the grape um the grape flavor yeah I think it's good I so far that's the only one that I've had actually tasted like what it said cuz usually like I say I could just taste the THC in it oh I am so thirsty what's relaxes you I find to like your I think if you had like sore muscles you know from doing whatever running or I don't know just it kind of like eases everything like it just kind of like your muscles don't feel all like like in a like in a ball like however like that they feel more like you know just like they're just relaxed so if you have pain regarding that this would take it away if you have like just general aches and pains this would be also the stuff that you would like to sit down to like this is the stuff that if I would like to be sitting on a porch and like in a porch I say in on Auto Parts I hope to god I didn't say invited yes sitting on a porch like you know like the farmland type of stuff I can't like a great big it's like I'm just meadow way out there and you can just sit in your rocking chair and just look out into the meadow um this would be the stuff to do it on because you may find like it would be peaceful because you wouldn't be around like neighbor you wouldn't have neighbors and stuff and I think that would be something good for people to experience you may find like a peace with yourself or something like that I don't not really sure so just walking away yeah I don't even I don't even know what I'm gonna do but I have to stay busy because I will fall asleep everywhere looks so comfortable yeah you're not like this high isn't getting any like lower whatever it's not decreasing it's just there like it's it's just there where like no matter like you tried to think it off or just like it's just there like your whole everywhere your whole body is high I guess which is a little weird and I never thought of it like that but I guess so right because that's so I don't know unless it I don't know maybe I just want to talk about stuff I can't um what else what else does this make you feel like doing mmm if you had a lot of time on your hands and you wanted to redecorate your say living room or something the base would be the stuff to do that because you'd be so concentrated on how you know everything looks and how blends in together and stuff like that this is like the stuff that I will say to that you would want to say if there was like one Christmas thing that you did by yourself you know I don't think putting up the tree would be that but if it could be maybe you'd anyways or whatever this is the stuff that you would want to want to do it on because you'd be doing that but then you have like a lot of thoughts just about things and hmm I don't remember what I was talking about so I will have to start I need a subject which I have no idea what it is you feel kind of like exhausted on this like you just you know such a hard day Wayne you did have a hard day but if you didn't have a hard day this stuff makes you feel like you had like just an exhausting day that's good seeing them like like now like it's getting closer to 9:00 and you're hungry like it's a little bit there now but it's not like you need to like be something really good and you're you may want it but then you may wait like Oh see I told you it makes you I feel tired and your eyes really worried I couldn't imagine doing like anything real like like I know there's people hide like drink and drive and I know there's people that do other drugs and drive including lead or edibles and whatever but I don't know why you would drive when you feel like this I mean yeah you would be cautious but I don't know I just I don't know I to me that's not a very smart thing to do but you know just my opinion and um so anyways it's an oh my [ __ ] that's what it feels like to me that's like a whole review of it right there you get it at cannabis no I the package is not here but it's the medication hard candies grape yet four cubes and it's each cube is 25 milligrams of THC um makes you feel like doing nothing I'm very happy before like you get to this part I'm still happy I just feel more relaxed if that makes any sense I can relaxed and I'm happy relaxed not like well yes you can be pissed off and relax because that doesn't even make sense like I'm mmm I think I just need to somewhere I think so that's that's everything that's I don't that's everything I don't have anything else to talk about get a cannabis

already enjoyed I think let's see how much I got left one two three four five six seven eight eight left it's 40 milligrams I have enjoyed 60 milligrams and I've taken those at night this is a nice indica helped me to sleep let's see I think the first time no each time I had six for my head seven either way I've taken 25 to 35 milligrams and I feel it's consistent it's good I do recommend the Camino I recommend all Cuba products they deliver potencies their flavor is phenomenal they do that they nail that however when I buy again personally we're good look at this that's a fair amount of gummies one two three four five six seven eight here a lot at eight oh yeah I think I did actually anyway that's a fair amount of gummies to eat but that being said everybody's tolerance is a little different you know my tolerance is less than some more than others I know people who can eat a lot more edibles than me I know people that if they had half to a quarter of this they would get late and probably fall asleep so with all these edible reviews this isn't me talking my experience is how much I take what works for me the most important thing you can do for yourself is experimentally but you know take a couple see if it works that's what I did at first now I know my sweet spot is like 20 to 30 ish depending what I'm doing if I just want a nice little kick nice little feel calm down I have to but right now I'm go for two for five that's thirty milligrams of delicious wildberry indica it reminds me of those Welsh's fruit snacks the wild berry ones I don't know if you've had those flavor is really good I really like their packaging too on this one especially got like a pink Scott pink outdoors got like water running trees it's supposed to transport you to what did I say California state of mind overall five stars because it's a legit product but personally I don't know if I'll buy again just because I have other edibles I like a little more nothing against them I'm definitely gonna get the sativa however I think it's like a pineapple habanero something like that maybe the mango habanero something with some spice in there which I'm excited to try because I love spice I love mixing sweet and spice but I'm going too long here I'm gonna come back to you in about an hour and a half talk to you when uh these indicus kicked in I will label Oh get ready for bed and

badass anyway I've even finished the episode and I knocked out after six of these it was like a 15 hour work dad maybe that play part in it but like I said the previous two times I've had the you know 25 to 30 it did the trick it mellowed me out i chilled for a while the hay woke up ready to get it feeling great today got a couple truebloods meetings one for the true buds tank top I am excited about and then another one with a local cannabis company and I don't want to save their name because we haven't really committed to anything but should have some fun videos coming through that soon I'll catch you guys on the next one I do give this five stars I do highly recommend it and maybe pass out got Java that's what I want with an indica especially if I'm eating it late at night like Sam

time wheats fan you know what that means it means I'm breaking my cardinal rule today fellows because I am reviewing yet another gummy I always say don't be a dummy don't buy a gummy but today for you guys it smells good though you can smoke through the packaging I have purchased yet another gummy because people told me the flourish flourish F flourish gummies are really great and that I will actually get quite stoned off of them so this is a hundred and fifty milligram edible it has been rated by the SE labs which means that you know it really does have 150 milligrams of THC in there like the packaging a lot very fancy packaging oh so if you haven't tuned in two weeks before you probably wondering why I happen to tell with me well that's because I like to have a little fat with gummy edibles as a good way of ensuring that the THC hits your bloodstream so ask us where if any gummy review I always take a little spoonful and Nutella or spatula for and until a beforehand so that way I can take the edible and your optimal conditions and with gummies you want to be doing this under optimal conditions alright so here we go mmm great every time so I got my fat in my bite let's open up the flourish again really fancy packaging look at that that's so cool well shiny we that we so we gotta open up here and it's in four or pyramid-shaped chunks this is the mango hybrid flavor hybrid being the strange some kind of hybrid we'd strain mango being the flavor oh it smells great smells like mango let's give it a taste almost choked on it well that tastes a lot better than a lot of the other gummi edibles this tastes a lot better than like it appears or infuse creations any of those it has very little weed taste I mean it does have Sun but but totally fun mmm very jelly like a jello like texture kind of hard to chew in fact all right guys well I'm gonna finish these last two cubes here and I will see you in two hours to let you know if this SC or excuse me flourish h1 50 mango

it's been two hours since I had the flourish mango 150 milligram edible and I think I finally found the gummy for me maybe it's too early to tell what just a sample size of one I don't know if anything's different about me but man this gummy it's not perfect I'm not the highest I've ever been at 150 milligrams but I am high I am definitely high which is a lot more than I can say for even 375 milligram gummy add or candy edibles that I've had in the past and certainly higher than that I like how it tasted too I tasted pretty good um I like the packaging and I kind of like the high it's it's it's it's more of like a body sort of high whatever hybrid strain and it's kind of great pretty happy with this I've got another one to review of their 300 milligram errs coming up and I hope it is twice as strong as this one if it is I will be in seventh heaven guys I might have finally found the gummy out there for me whoever recommended the flourish gummies thank you I'm glad I tried this and I am definitely looking forward to giving the 300 milligram a shot as well fingers crossed it's not just an anomaly or a fluke and that these are really the the the real deal in gummy land but I

"[Music] we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I am super super super excited because we are taking another look at flourish the first time we have taken a look at flourish in almost a year we are going to be reviewing their new flavor their hybrid grand-jury n-- gummies so a mixture of tangerine and cranberry really excited about this if you've seen in my florist reviews before these are my favorite gummies hands-down there are no gummies that come even close to the magnificence of flourish I love them love them love them a lot and I hope that this cran Jurina gummy does the trick as well so this is a 300 milligram edible picked it up for the leave $20 at my dispensary so a pretty good deal for a 300 milligram edible and it is for show it is a if it's like any of the other so it's gonna be tasty and it is going to be potent on the back here you got everything you want to see you've got your nutrition information your ingredients all that wonderful stuff there on the back this is a hybrid variety so it doesn't tell us what strain but this is a hybrid strain that they used so let's go ahead and open it up here and take a look at what we got oh it's different than it used to be this is not the way they used to have a package they used to have a package in one thing now there are four individually packaged gummies just like this still in there ziggurat shape let's go ahead and open up this cran doreen hybrid here and give it a taste new smells wonderful smells so good hmm now there is a slight weed taste to this one which I actually encouraged by means that there might be as all of that milligram \u00e4j-- as promised but it still tastes really good good solid fruity flavor like the texture like everything about it mm well flourish hits it out of the park again when it comes to the taste texture packaging all that love the packaging love this little box love it all but the most important part is it still gonna get me high cuz it's been a year who knows if they've changed the formula what the case may be for that guys you're gonna have to wait two hours oh no you're not gonna have to wait two hours I'm gonna have to wait two hours I'm gonna come back to you guys and let you know exactly how this flourish cran Doreen 300 milligram has landed I'm gonna finish those other two pieces off and for you guys it'll be just a couple of seconds so thanks for watching wheats and I will see you in just a bit several hours since I've had the hybrid flourish 300 milligram cran Jurina gummy and I am pleased as punch to say it is as potent as it ever was another knock it out of the park homerun sports metaphor for flourish I really like this one real quick it didn't have the most cannabis II taste of any of the flourish gummies I've ever had then again it's a 300 milligram edible certainly that potent at least in my estimation I got me up to like eight and a half somewhere in that range or maybe even a little higher and that was actually spread out over about five hours I only had about the first half of it over two hours and then took the second half two hours later just in the circumstances I was in it has sustained me there's 300 milligram edible has kept me high for about going on about five hours now so really we're impressed with its longevity with this flourish again just the taste outside the cannabis part was good I like the consistency like the like the texture of the gummy it's so much better than at a pure or infused creations even with that slight cannabis taste in terms of that bitterness that awful as cerebral cannabis tastes it's not present here just a slight cannabis taste and I'm harping on it too much it's just I surprised me I've never really tasted any cannabis in their products before but there was it was here but it lets you know it's gonna be as potent as it is I really really enjoyed this one another absolute - thumbs up for flourish for me sorry I've been rambling a little bit but before I go I want to share with you guys my little cherry on top something that is not necessarily weed related but could be really weed related that you guys might want to check out and on this cherry on top I want to share with you an excellent movie from 2017 one of my favorites from 2017 and that is Briggs bbear starring Kyle Mooney of the Saturday Night Live Fame he always plays this sort of dorky guy long kind of curly hair anyways it's the story of a guy who lives in a fallout shelter and every day gets a new tape of his hero Briggs B bear who tells him a different story and adventure about his galactic life and it's about this kid's obsession with this bear that he knows brings B bear and I don't want to spoil too much more because the movie goes in unexpected places and it is easily spoiled so if you are at all interested in something and this probably goes pretty well with weed to be honest so if you're interested in something that's gonna be a little bit different than most movies that you've seen be sure to check out brings to bear I want to make sure that it let you know that this is one of the most optimistic heartwarming movies I've seen in some I'm there are adult situations and language and all that in there but this is not a cynical mean-spirited movie even though it does feature some again adult situations check it out again Briggs to be there really really enjoyed that one and that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you making it to the very very end guys thank you so much and we will see you guys all on the next review peace", "fLw9gFWrVAc": "[Music] [Music] [Music] so you", "BzQ9i6EeCZQ": "all right so boom this is the official Twain 20 guy on how to safely consume weed edibles or any year for that matter because this is time that's advice you know I'm saying so I find that consuming edibles I eating it it's a lot more natural and has a less health risks than smoking anything you smoke and inhale into your lungs as the potential to affect your breathing cars in such as bronchitis and just overall get lungs see lungs other basic necessity of life right but at the point to note that not all edibles are created equal and being knowledgeable of the dosage level that you take is crucial in order for you to actually enjoy and have a good experience rather than be one of those people on YouTube that gives a story time about their worst experience of marijuana [Music] three hours later welcome back to no song edutainment yall already know what's going on subscribe to channel cuz I'm a fun guy I'm a cool guy I go through my day pretty normal like I'm a normal guy I'm a swell guy I'm a nice enough guy I'm a cool kind of guy I'm a pretty groovy guy I call this honest entertain you make you laugh but most importantly educate you on a variety of subjects that make you learn something they can apply it to your own personal personal life so mister my research the general consensus I see for a serving one serving of an edible is about 10 milligrams but not all will be dispensaries created equal like I said before some of them serve a bit more some of them aren't as precise and having each in each serving wrap individually so depending on where you get it from one serving we have a bit more THC than you might expect usually if it does have more THC than the 10 milligrams like limit it should have this image or however you wherever you see this image on the box right there but in the meantime products with too much THC must have these warning labels so I've told you why edibles are better than smoking or vaping me but how and what do you do to actually enjoy it safe so I got about five different steps for you to follow if you listen to me if you listen to me just listen to me you will enjoy your edible experience simple because I know it all I just played so most places require or from what I've seen research most states and my keys most provinces in Canada require a limit of ten milligrams of THC in a serving of edible but my suggestion Prasad is to tone it down a bit more and actually do five milligrams as your basic reduction to an edible cookie gummy bears or whatever so number one is important to read the packaging carefully so that you don't overdose or not overdose you can't really overdose on wheat but you can definitely take too much this easy there go anybody take a tab hallucinate you finished our trip the trip but chill out I got a heartbeat I can't feel [ __ ] so no longer do you have to play Russian roulette with your dosage amounts there's now a legal dosage of ten milligrams as your basic level of attaboy experience but if it isn't made at home then in that case be extra careful with how much you're taking in a given set or given serving size so especially if you're new to cannabis or you don't take it regularly it's important to dip your toe in the water a little bit before you dive in headfirst rather than taking the recommended ten milligrams take instead to five milligrams and then wait another two to three hours before you take another serving size just so that you are easing yourself into the whole edible experience and you can actually enjoy the high rather than you know some of the other stories I've seen on YouTube and even if you are a veteran cannabis user you should also implement my foot dosing which is start with five milligrams or even you start with the ten milligrams wait two or three hours and then add another one why should you do this because it gently stimulates the body's cannon but receptors which results in an increased high or increased mood productivity creativity without the sudden high effect that you might get if you were to just like consumer all I was in fact Oh Oh cookies very important to me I mean I love to me but they mean much more to me Tommy so the high is a bit more noticeable noticeable and more enjoyable like is you're kind of like on a roller coaster type of thing rather than already being at the top right so you're gently taking yourself to that peak or a high rather than just as soon as you get to the rides everyday at the top which is not ideal so again five milligrams as your basic level especially if you're a beginner and then every two or three hours just gradually take another serving size just so that you can safely and enjoyably each edible our number two is important to consider your tolerance having a low THC tolerance makes you susceptible to negative side effects of taking too much weed or taking too much THC such as paranoia anxiety and dizziness definitely without a doubt it's better to have an underwhelming experience than an overwhelming experience where you are shaking your you panicking whatever it is it's better to be disappointed than to be on the other spectrum if I'm gonna say okay do what you want you an adult but take heed take heed all right one word is good enough for the wise so he was so it's your first time trying a screen or not well since you interacted with marijuana in general don't try and keep up with the veteran smoker so don't try keep up with the rest of the crew just go at your own pace because there's it's not a race I see alright I got this off like that got the sauce little ketchup those sauce little ketchup thank you keep up with them because people that consume meet regularly already need a higher dosage to get their desired high effect and this is why I say it's important to take weed tolerance breaks the tolerance breaks for weed are important because it allows you to get higher for a longer period of time so your high or not it won't be like twenty minutes it'd be like two plus hours or so and you can get high on a small amount of weed which results in savings yeah I put it all together see it and trying to save y'all money I'm looking out for you looking out for your pockets so take means haulin sprigs periodically so that you can continue to not need a higher dosage and that your high can also last for a longer period of time simple so number three it just be patient like I said be patient with the THC and how it how long it takes to affect you depending on your metabolism and your body fat it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two or maybe even a few hours so these snacks are not like your regular snacks at the grocery store or the corniche story these aren't regular snacks that you can - to eat as you're watching a Netflix videos or Netflix shows or movies whatever it is take heed to the serving size and be patient for 330 minutes any for 30 minutes to two hours if you feel the pips this is the moment you feel the effect is when you can like perhaps take another one but even at that let it right out for a bit on number four you want to be mindful of your stomach's contents so the more food you have in your system the longer it will take for weed to get metabolized in your bloodstream and take effect however in empty stomach I lost with the edibles to activate Kruger so just keep it just keep that in mind when and if you are eating edible did you eat already because if you didn't it'll take effect quicker and if you haven't eaten already before it then start with half a dose or what you usually take or what you want to take just so that you know just you can slow yourself in micro dosing same as the same thing micro dosing is the wave don't just jump in and if you drank alcohol beforehand alcohol can increase the THC blood concentration in your system so it's important to use caution if you're mixing alcohol with edibles and number five just this is more of like the nurture you know they say nature is the nature this is more of an immature type of thing it just be mindful of the environment like are you around people that you or as you care about you want people that care about you right and are you comfortable around these people so if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or long much more it's better take it at your home with your loved one or parent or francica with it your brother sibling romantic partner whatever it is just be around if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or just in general you are taking a new strain it's best to be around people that you actually are familiar with and you actually care about just to that part of for you to experience some type of anxiety or panic attack or just seeing a familiar face will keep you a bit more grounded if you did end up eating so much but again the more experience you have the more likely you are to be comfortable the easier it is for you to be comfortable in different situations or different environments but yeah so my kudos take it easy five milligrams or as your basis for anything for the most part and then just gradually increase your high once you start feeling the effects and its best it's always better to have an underwhelming experience then an overwhelming experience londo and take these five steps into consideration you will have a very enjoyable read hi and again have other videos above or edibles from

have a bulged disc between c4 and c5 the amount of pills that they have tried me on is ridiculous I'm on currently on naproxen 500 I'm on a muscle relaxant you name it I I'm just tired of the pill so I'm gonna try this for the first time and see if this helps at all okay so get off okay so I opened it it is that's here let's see okay like chocolate actually tastes really good so I guess it takes up from 30 minutes to two hours I'll let you know I'll come back and let you know if I feel anything or do I have to take another one let's hope this works okay so um it's been like an hour and I feel something in there my legs a little bit jiggly right now but other than that the pain in my back I will say it's going away like it it's probably still there is just going away like I can't it's not a thumping feeling anymore [Music] so it's like 1 1 square which is 25 milligrams and for me it's working good like downstairs I was thinking I should shut off my phone and restart it but I guess I did and when I went to record this I didn't understand why the phone was turning on and so I just had to I just had to hit the button on the side and wait for it to start up and so that happened at home and my arms really sore from holding this but it's like nice to be pain-free and okay well this is all for now else to tell you that you feel really happy like thinks that you think it sounds like [ __ ] up in your head like you're gonna say it sentence and like I don't know did you say it so um my eyes feel real tingly and my heart I can't feel no gum it's just a little bit scary okay this time that's it only thirsty oh yeah I'm thirsty I feel like I should get into a comfy like a comfy space or a comfy place like the chair or something and don't you sit down there and then I don't know see what happens okay um so one thing I'm noticing too is my eyes are like glossy and I don't like that and there's people in the house all they're probably know something so I'm gonna wait until they come upstairs and when I hear them come upstairs go downstairs and buy it's getting dark out so they'll be see my look okay um so like you get good laughs and stuff like right now I'm trying hitting like a little paranoid I don't know what's up with that but I really think that like I should just say what you know like I'm feeling and then probably I don't know just like sit somewhere like works in darkroom or something or just come upstairs like it bad cuz the heart is like hmm and I feel I should talk like kind of quiet because seems like the thing to do um and you're really like your body seems like it's a really sensitive to everything my back ache it's it's still like I said I don't feel it at all seems like you had a long hey you come home good a squirt of that cuz you feel better from [Music] and it seems like a good thing to I get do cuz you can hide it like you know like some people say Oh going home to have a beer and if you didn't want people to know that you like drink beer you can not say it or um somebody that did this well yeah like somebody calls you oh I'm just having a piece of a chocolate bar see they wouldn't even know which seems pretty smart thing to do my fingers there but oh well because that arm hurts like that's I said some sort of things are sensitive I still haven't had gotten the drink from before some really like I'm and this and then I'll get a drink and sit there with my blanket on and oh yeah like when you walk things too early like like you're walking I'm not saying you're not just like it's not it doesn't feel normal feels like it feels like a little better like they had a key bones in your legs you probably wouldn't feel the achiness okay so it's like now I'm going for real like you know what I probably do this again good thing I only ate one no Jumanji - oh okay may need to call night when one or something cuz you probably get really scared at one point wait I'm scared but I'm like oh like you know if the cops came I would just [ __ ] hide but like if you talk to you you wouldn't you'd be so scared you would even move where you are and then they you know no way you're in there and the house okay so why can't say into next time because what if there is no next time or like Oh smoking chocolate bar number two and Oh like have episodes smoking charcoal smoking another chocolate bar now I don't remember why I say mad cuz it's totally good [Music] I was talking about Chuck burn so like this should probably be a good night adios and I can tell you the area didn't you know country I'm in so nobody knows okay so I'm

guys ever since I made orange jello I've been dying to try different variations and this watermelon jello that we're making today is perfect for summer I'm Megan I'm passionate about finding ways to make life with kids easier in the kitchen so let's both our ingredients you'll need a whole seedless watermelon coconut water and unflavored gelatin so the first thing we need to do is slice into our watermelon make sure that you're getting a seedless watermelon so you don't have to find all the seeds so I'm going to take a really heavy knife and cut right through once my watermelon is sliced I'm scooping all the flesh right into a blender so I'm going to bring it down and I'm just gonna use a spoon to do this with but I'm really gonna dig in here and get everything out so I've really scooped every bit of watermelon flesh that I can out of the watermelon you'll also notice that there's some pure watermelon juice left behind and what I'm gonna do is to put that right through a strainer into my container so I'm going to dump it in and then I'm going to use a really high-powered blender to puree the water mine once my watermelons pureed I'm gonna pour it through a strainer and that's because I want a really pure juice so there's not a lot of texture in my jello my juice has been strained but I want a very very pure juice otherwise the texture is not quite right in the jello and I experiment too many times so I know so what I'm gonna do is dump out the dregs of this into my sink and then restrain it through here until I have about two cups my juice is finally ready and I'm going to combine it with my gelatin next now I am using a grass-fed gelatin today because you guys commented in my orange dollar recipe that this is the kind I should be using and I take your comments very seriously so it's what I'm using today I'm going to sprinkle it right in my pan and to it I'm gonna add my watermelon juice and finally I'm gonna add a little bit of coconut water this is because even though the watermelon juice has been strained it's a pretty thick juice and this helps send it out I'm gonna let this sit for about two minutes for the gelatin to dissolve before putting it on my stove I'm gonna turn the burner on low and whisk constantly for about five minutes my jello mixture is all melted and next I need to pour it into my container my vessel which is my empty watermelon what I'm gonna do is Pat it dry because I have found that if you don't have a really dry really clean that watermelon the jello just kind of slides off it tends to do that anyway but this really helps it stick a little bit more you can see that I put my watermelon in a bowl that's so I don't have to hold it while I pour my jello in all that's left to do is let your jello set in your refrigerator for about four to six hours my watermelon is out of the refrigerator you can tell my kids gotcha before I was able to show you guys the final product but I hope your kids love it as much as mine do it's a true testament to what a fun summer treat it is thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye guys", "uiIngIkdFJw": "who it is oh it is hot hi all my little scrimps is it hot

DON'T FORGET TO LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE!", "iJwdqt7ebmE": "yeah here we go here we go again what's up yo back with another review today Oh edible gummies Mira Mira specifically Rob hots sour flavors I believe this is a relative new relatively new flavor for them I'm not a million percent sure even close to sure if it's on the REC side if it's not now I would imagine it will be soon so diving in the flavors we got inside here blue raspberry grape and green apple I don't know I had to look at it I actually know the flavors of jelly me anyway that's pretty much my favorite flavors enjoy ranchers and other candies so that was a super big plus for me I'm not really a huge tower fan so I'm really hoping they're not especially a sour yeah I was gonna enter a picture probably already did or I am now so we're gonna dive into what one thing to keep in mind is the brain all right we go is that the milligrams posted on the bottle or on the container are not necessarily the exact amount that are in your specific bottle your specific bottle will have a separate location where it is located exactly how many milligrams are in there I will insert a picture of it but it's I just keep smearing it you cannot see it at all anymore but I know that this bottle says 500 milligrams and it has 467 point 6 4 milligrams in it meaning each piece is not 50 milligrams but 46.7 6 milligrams per gummy it will always tell you the specific amount of THC that is in and milligrams that is in your container but it's not always exactly what's on the bottle sometimes it's more though I had another bottle of greens but I ate before I could review sometimes it's more the greens were 500 and something milligrams so each milligram or 5/10 I think or anyway doesn't matter because it was 51 milligrams per gummy i remember that specifically so sometimes you're getting more sometimes getting less if you're really a budget conscious person and you want to really maximize your bang for buck check out the different flavors and see what milligram is the highest of the actual bottle that you'll be purchasing we're gonna move on to the scent also it doesn't say whether it's a hybrid or indica or sativa so that means it's a hybrid most edibles are pretty much hybrids anyway I'm to get a edible specific video posted so keep an eye out for that because I'm gonna give like tips tricks all kinds of different information about edibles specifically that you can apply across pretty much all edibles sauer sorry I'm getting a little bit of the grape but I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys these two are the two that I'm gonna be eating and one of them is great the reason these are the two that I'm gonna be eating is because I licked the [ __ ] out of them getting the sub nail photo and specifically the purple one is the one that I started with so it got the most saliva on it so I'm not sure if that has affected the scent that I'm picking up the most in here I'm like rotating something like the blue raspberries up on top I still kind of get great more than anything else behind this hour cuz this hour is the first thing that I smelled so that's a little bit concerning for me but when I was licking them I didn't taste a lot of sour however in the photo you can see there's a lot of like more there's a lot of rocky material that's only on one side from what I can tell because the green one too it didn't have any on the bottom I'm thinking that's the sour so I would imagine that you could dust that off and they wouldn't be sour but tact tactically they are I'm gonna grab one that I haven't wet because that they're more sticky Wow they're mean Wow I'm having before but they are they're very soft and compression they're definitely gummies cuz they're a little bit sticky but let's see yeah they're a little bit sticky my fingers are a little sticky after that but I could be because I was also handling the ones that I licked so we're gonna let see my fingers do not feel sticky at all or the like least amount like to smile if anything so now we're gonna squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze it is sticky yeah it's sticky and that's one that was not licked but it's not super bad cuz now after I've done it a few times it's pretty much not sticky anymore so a little sticky but you'll be able to like dust it off and no big deal as long as you don't like continuously looking and grab it and grab it and grab it that makes it sticky alright let's ride let's ride so I'm gonna be doing actually 150 because I'm gonna try all three well I was Jenni myself so harshly I'm like oh you're not getting quick enough that I couldn't actually think about adding up the numbers so it actually may be more like 135 levi's I am going to put the sour directly on my tongue with this one and then the other way on this one and whichever way I like the most I'm gonna do for the blue raspberry because that's my favorite and the apple looks like it's not got a lot of stuff on it so [Music] okay I push the gummy off to the side to just deal with the sour but it's really not bad like you can see my face with like a little bit but when it's really sour it's my faces all kinds of you know I am definitely getting a great flavor I would say that there is a mild earthy flavor to it I mean hash has a very very attached distillate has a very mild cannabis flavor to it but I'm picking that up so it's not but I I mean any edible honestly any edible is gonna have the slightest flavoring whether it be hashey or earthy which this is a little bit both I'm getting it's interesting you know I'm getting the earthiness of the you know cannabis component but which is in distillate but I'm also at the end getting a little bit of the tang or the dryness maybe that's it of the hash flavor if you have smoked hash or gotten it on it and like licked it and stuff you kind of know what I mean you the smell like honest if you know what the smell is you kind of know what the taste is so they're green apple oh and as far as I continue to talk the flavor I'm left with is a very mild grape kind of a again there's it's not really necessarily earthy at this point it's an off great like it's great but just like a little okay solid metal that straight-up tastes like Ukraine Apple the end part I got a little bit of sour and as I was coming out of it it tasted like a sour green apple so that was really nice not quite as much earthy flavor in that one I just think maybe the green apple complements or goes with the cannabis ever slightly so more than the grape so more I'm not really tasting the green apple anymore it was strong when I was eating it but it doesn't really have a leftover flavor and blue raspberry [Music] whoo Smiley's an idol I ate a boy okay that was delicious it honestly reminds me of a blue Slurpee but I I honestly don't think I've ever tried a Slurpee ever but it's what I imagine a blue raspberry a Slurpee tastes like blue raspberry otter pop that's the closest that I can relate it to cuz it's not quite blue raspberry Jolly Rancher but it's blue rounder blue blue raspberry otter pop so it's a little duller than a Jolly Rancher but still nicely blue raspberry we're popsicle I swallowed unexpectedly during that so some sour got in my throat so it's not the best feeling and I did just eat on three so I'm imagining the flavors gonna be a little ol kooky but I kind of maybe I just want it I feel like I have a remanence of blue raspberry in my mouth but I might just be wanting it so much that its existing you know for the placebo effect so flavors oh dude I didn't get any hash from that no earthy no hash maybe because I like that flavor so much or it goes better with it I don't know but it tasted delicious so that you know as far as overall experience I appreciate that the sour is not super sour I almost think there's gonna be people who are disappointed but it's not super super sour but I thought it was a nice mild level of sour what yeah I still get the grape more than anything in that particular whip waft I wonder if it's because I was also thinking it was gonna be so much more sour that I smelled this no I smell sour but it's not as strong it has before that's so funny anyway I love Rob hot gummies I've had them pretty consistently there's definitely other companies that make really good gummies but Rob hots from what I've experienced so far seems to be the best thing for the [ __ ] and having good quality like great quality gummies however I did want to mention gelatin and glucose syrup is in here I don't know how that relates to either vegetarianism or veganism all right so the milligrams are definitely affecting me at this point I'd say I'm Spacey relaxed [Music] I'm frontier I was more minute early and now I'm more relaxed and I think when I get to doing the video editing it'll be easier to focus than trying to pull thoughts out of this brain it's more just do versus think which is wonderful my hands are so dry my knuckles oh my gosh I need to get more lotion I have to go okay I just needed a quick thing yeah yes I would recommend rabbits gummies I would say pretty much overall at this point different flavors you you're gonna like and not like so that's gonna be a personal thing but overall I think that Rob Potts does a good job with their gummies and the sours were delicious and not super sour and I really like that I hope you guys have a wonderful rest of your day", "sc1kF88_7zM": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you", "_qLXHN_lvhA": "quick video on how to make sour candy gummies you'll need one box of jell-o three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin which is about four bags 1/4 cup of corn syrup half a cup of melted infused coconut oil 1/2 a teaspoon of gore gum 1/4 cup of kool-aid any flavor and half a teaspoon of citric acid you also need a strainer that things spatulas molds and also a fan spray get a bowl of ice-cold water you need 1 cup of sugar 1/2 a cup of corn syrup and 1/2 a cup of water and this will be for later to make the gelatin you'll just need 1/2 a cup of water you will add in the 4 packets of gelatin so the full box [Music] make sure to stir everything thoroughly and then we'll just set it to the side until we need it later now you're gonna put your quarter cup of kool-aid or you can use water in the microwave for one minute [Music] now I'm going to get my jello and my kool-aid that I got out of microwave and pour it into a double boiler you're gonna stir until the jello dissolves on medium heat once it's all melted together then you're going to add your 1/4 cup of corn syrup again you're just gonna stir until it all mixes together you're then going to add in your half a teaspoon of citric acid and then mix that together until that dissolves [Music] now once the gelatin is squishy and firm you're going to add that into the mix [Music] you want to break it up into little pieces just so that way it dissolves a bit quicker stir until everything is melted and make sure the water from the double boiler is not boiling you do not want to burn the jello once everything is melted you're gonna put your half cup of infused coconut oil you want to mix that thoroughly now you're going to get your Gore gum and a strainer if your mix looks like this it's because everything is not mixed thoroughly so you'll want to get a whisk and now help everything just mix faster and more evenly now you're going to add in the gore gum and what the gore gum does is an emulsifier that allows the coconut oil and the water to mix evenly so you want to add that onto the top and then mix it until it all dissolves once that's done you're just gonna put the heat on low and then put it to the side while we work on the candy syrup side you'll need another pot you want to get a ziplock bag and a pan spray let's pray the Pam inside the bag and this is so that way the gummies the mixture does not get stuck inside the bag you also want to get your molds ready and also put some Pam spray on that as well turn on the stove to medium heat you're then going to add your one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and your half a cup of water you're gonna want to mix this thoroughly until you see that the sugar has all dissolved [Music] now once you've seen that the sugar has dissolved you're gonna turn the medium up to medium-high then you're just gonna continue stirring until it starts boiling Wow that's boiling you want to make sure you stir your jell-o gelatin side periodically so it doesn't thicken as you can see it's starting to boil and you want to make sure again that you just scrape the sides of it so the sugar does not get stuck once the candy syrup starts boiling you want to make sure it reaches a temperature of 260 degrees now that has reached 260 degrees you're gonna take your pot turn off your stove and just immerse it into the cold water until it reaches 240 degrees once it's reached 240 degrees you want to place it onto a cold surface not onto the place that we were boiling on so that way you can cool down a bit and then you're gonna add in your jello mix into the candy syrup [Music] mix everything thoroughly until it's all one color and you see no bubbles let's sit for about five to 10 minutes until cool so that way you can pour them into the mold then grab your ziploc bag cut a hole in the bottom corner also grab a bowl and this will be so it's easier for you to pour in your jello mixture pour the jello mix inside the bag and then grab a spatula to get everything out I [Music] personally like this method better just because it's easier and less messy then you know refund refilling those syringe or squeeze bottles as you can see there's a little white in my jello mix that just means that I do not mix it long enough so it can be mixed evenly so again you want to make sure it's all one color no bubbles and you don't see any white in your jello mix just so that way you can get the best results these are still gonna taste good but just so that way you know you can get the best results for these gummies mix everything thoroughly a hundred percent [Music] now that I have everything in the molds we're gonna put this in the fridge for about an hour and a half after an hour and a half you will then be placing them in the freezer for about an hour an hour and a half again now for the sugar sour mix it's one cup of sugar and half a teaspoon of citric acid pour your sugar in the bowl then if you want them a little bit more sour then put a little bit more than the half teaspoon of citric acid and then you're just gonna mix it up until you have a nice even sugar sour mix once you try out the mix if it's not sour enough just add a little bit of citric acid at a time just so that way you don't get an overpowering sour taste get some parchment paper so we can place the gummies on now you want to get one tray of the modes at a time when you take them out the freezer so that way it can be an easier faster process taking them out and then sugarcoating them you can either do one at a time or you can do multiple I do multiple just because it's faster just make sure you place them separate from each other so that way they don't stick together and then all you do is shake it up and then you have a evenly coated gummy and then you'll just want to continue this with all of your gummies [Music] these molds I actually got from Amazon I searched up weed molds and as you can see they have these nice emojis on them the other ones have these weed leaf plants on them so they look pretty cool if you want to check them out I can link them down below in the description just so that way you can find them easier and you actually get a pack of six with a little syringe as well so it's a really really great deal so my phone actually died after this part is like cut I coated them I cut them up and as you can see there's nice little squares and I actually ran out of molds and I use an ice tray so I use these heart-shaped ice trays so if you don't have any candy molds you can use some ice trays just make sure you coat them with Pam's so that way they don't get stuck and it's easier to push out [Music] so now that I'm done coding everything this is the last part the hearts this is how they look up close they look delicious and they taste delicious too now I'm just going to be placing my gummies into my bags so with the emoji ones I put six in in a bag these square ones I put seven to eight in a bag and the heart one since they're bigger I put four in a bag and this is how they look so I'm gonna continue doing them with all the other ones and I'm just gonna fast forward [Music] now that I'm all done this is how they all look like in their banks and then I just store them in the freezer until they're ready to eat so I hope you guys enjoy this video if so give it a thumbs up let me know what you think in the comments and also subscribe to my channel thank you guys [Music]", "pv82IEKMyxk": "guys Laver here I got a hundred milligram Medi bear bye I don't know who but Cheers hmm 100 milligrams of THC tune-up real [ __ ] good Sam are you chewing up the bagging case to be a Joe in it we pitch our winterized he definitely did some beer chilling it now oh yeah", "gy47dkoOlU0": "hi I'm Shireen the founder of my pain centre your number one research or tried and trusted CBD products all the products we sell I use my parents use and my friends use we don't sell any product that we haven't tried or that we use in our daily lives so visit us at my pain center calm hey one of the questions we've been getting a lot lately which makes sense due to cove in nineteen is i'm new to CBD where do i start and that is a great question there's so many products right now out with CBD in it it isn't hard to know like what is the best place to start do you start with gummies do you start with an oil do you start with tea do you start with honey do you like there's just there's so many things there's coffee there's bath bombs there's lotions there's shampoos there's soaps i'm gonna give it to you real easy if you are new to CBD and you just want to try to see if it helps you whether you're struggling with sleep anxiety stress or pain I will recommend gummy bears start with the gummy bears or any sort of edible so chocolate almonds peppermints but make sure that the product actually has CBD in it meaning if it is being sold on amazon.com technically they're not allowed to sell products with CBD in it so just be careful where you're purchasing your CBD from now if you are having pain I'm just gonna caveat this from the gummy bears if you are having some sort of pain in your body that's like localized so you're just hurting like right here in the back of your neck or on your hand like just right here this is hurting I would suggest a cream you don't really need a CBD gummy unless for some reason that pain is keeping you up at night then you can also in conjunction use the CBD gummy now you're probably thinking okay well on my paints intercom there's like ten different types of gummies where do I start so all the gummies are pretty similar we just offer different taste profiles to fit our customers need so we have a five milligram gummy a 10 milligram gummy 20 and then 25 the most popular place to start is a 10 milligram gummy now here's the thing with CBD there is no set dosage that I can tell you is what you need everybody is so different it all depends on your weight your body genetics what you just ate what you're using it for how out-of-sync your body is so for example our bodies are like cars and we have to tune them and if you haven't tuned your body in a while you may need a little bit more CBD in the beginning to tune your car but it really doesn't matter about you and your you could have a partner and one of your partners could take a 10 milligram gummy and feel the same effects that you would need to take a 20 milligram gummy for it just varies like that so I'll give an example like I'll take a 10 milligram gummy during the day like if I'm about to like step into a really intense meeting or I have to get on the highway right I mean right now it's not as bad getting on the highway but I'm in Florida and we have a highway called I 4 and it's just a hot mess and so if I'm getting on i-4 I'll take a 10 milligram gummy I have a customer that's 280 pounds and if he takes a 10 milligram gummy he falls asleep he gets drowsy and that is a side effect of gummy bear or any CBD if you take too much of a CBD product like it's too strong for you one of the biggest side effects is drowsiness so when you first start with CVD I was highly highly highly recommend you tried in the evening before you go to bed and not when you're operating any heavy machinery like a car so I start I usually tell people start with a 10 milligram if you do start to think you're feeling drowsy you can always cut it in half I take ten milligrams during the day for random things and then I'll take a 20 milligram gummy at night for sleep if I really want a really amazing sleep I may take a 25 milligram gummy so I'll just show you quickly like what the gummy bears look like so you know so these are these are our 10 milligram gummy bears this is just like a regular gummy bear that you would find like Hasbro gummy bear the ones at the movie theaters we sell these in a regular flavor and a sour flavor sour bear flavor as well and those are really good they taste like sour patch kids our 5 milligram gummy is also a sour patch it's a sour patch kid that's a 5 milligram gummy we've had some parents use those on their children for like a DD or anxiety I'm not advocating that you should use them on your children but I'm just saying that if you do want to use them on your children start with the 5 milligrams you'll also see like we have watermelon gummy bears and these are these are 10 milligram gummies as well just like the regular bears but they taste like watermelon so like I said each gummy bear just has a different flavor profile and then we have a 20 milligram profile gummy bear and then these are our 25 milligram gummy bears so these are apple rings tastes just like an apple ring smells like an apple ring we also have these in peach rings those are delicious too those will put you out I shouldn't say that they put me out I don't know if they'll put you out so it's just all about trying and testing so like I said I suggest a 10 milligram one see if it works if you're feeling more relaxed but it's not really putting you to sleep then take 2 at night you can take 3 at night if you want to as well and then once you figure out how many you need then you can come back and get a 20 or 25 milligram gummy as well so I hope that helps I didn't bring them here but I should have but we also have chocolate almonds those are 20 milligrams so if you prefer something sweet at night or something sweet during the day just be careful you don't have too many and then we also have a peppermint and our peppermints are actually butter mints and those are 50 milligrams and they have a little melatonin in them too so those are really great if you really really struggle with sleep and you really want to be knocked out but I'm gonna caveat all of this CBD doesn't work on everyone everybody everybody is different right how they react to CBD so I could be telling you a 15 milligram peppermint will put me out for like 6 7 hours it may not work on you and that's just something you're just gonna have to try CBD and see and I can't I can't tell you if it's gonna work on you or not so give it a try though I mean you have nothing to lose everything is 15 percent off on our site right now during the coronavirus chaos because we understand everybody is very anxious and stressed out right now and having trouble sleeping I can attest to that and just yeah let us know if you have any questions hit us up support at my pain center calm you can send us a DM on Instagram Twitter Facebook my pain center and we'll talk to you soon take care of have a good weekend and stay safe guys stay safe I don't know what I'm doing I'm sorry", "vLm9VAXFl6I": "and so I'd still take my life in it a fruit roll-up what's up guys welcome back today I have yet another gummy video for you guys and I'm very excited about this one because I think it's going to make a lot of people's lives a lot easier and it is going to be delicious today we're going to be doing a little experiment making gummies out of two ingredients store-bought gummy bears tincture or coconut oil so I just bought some gummies from bulk barn any gummies are fine and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to melt these down and I'm gonna add to some of them tincture and to some of them coconut oil and we're gonna see how they're going to turn out I think the ones with tincture will turn out amazing the coconut oil ones I'm not so sure about so let's try it out and see how it goes PS these are like the best gummies ever they're the Albanese brand you can buy them at a lot of places and they're so good they have like the best flavors the green ones and the white ones are my favorite so I'm actually not going to use them for this recipe so I'm probably gonna eat them while I'm melting them first step is to sort your gummies you don't have to smoke them if you don't want to but I want all my colors to be separate all right let's do this so I separated my gummies into yellow and orange purple and then my favorite ones just to eat while I'm doing this and we're gonna melt them and then add in our ginger and coconut oil and see how it goes I have no idea how long it's going to take us to microwave them so I'm going to start with like 15 second intervals and just check on them and then we'll find out how long it takes to melt them without over putting them I don't know so start with these great ones here there's a total of 13 gummy bears in here and they're just regular sized right there I mean they're a little bit bigger than like kuriboh gummy bears um but they're pretty standard so I was going bears and you guys can even see that okay so I'm gonna check on them in about 15 seconds and see how warmed up and melted they are so that's 20 seconds and they're starting to melt but they still need a little bit more so I put it in there for another 10 seconds okay so this is a total of 30 seconds pretty much melted and good to go I'm gonna add my tincture into here for this amount of gummies I'm going to do 1/2 a teaspoon of tincture so it's just room temperature you don't want to have it like really cold or frozen because it will affect the heat from the gummy so we'll just put that half a teaspoon in so there it is and let's see how well this stirrer is in if it doesn't stir it hopefully you guys can see that can you oh you guys can't even see that there we go so hopefully that stirs in well and if it doesn't we are going to add some lesson and lecithin into this to help combine it but I think that there's enough things and the gummy bears to start with that we shouldn't have any issues getting this to emulsify or combine or whatever you want to call it so that looks pretty good and then we're just gonna put these into a mold the same way you would with homemade gummies and let them sit and we will move on to our next batch so this is quite a bit thicker then they're coming mixtures so it seems like it's kind of hard for the little syringe to pull it up so that's one a little bit of an issue here so let's see yeah see we can't really soak it up so our options would be to microwave it more so it gets more liquidy or to add more liquid but I do not want to add more liquid so I am going to put it in the microwave for another 10 seconds okay so that was another ten seconds for a total of 30 are sorry a total of 40 seconds and I think they should be good enough to be able to put into our molds so I have about half in the mold then it's being a little bit trickier to put in that I thought it was going to be I'm having some trouble like getting the the dropper to like suction it up and that's because it is really thick so again I'm going to put it into the microwave for another 10 seconds and warm it up some more now if you had a lot more going there zero melting I'm like I did it this won't be as much of an issue because the heat will contain itself because there's a larger amount because there's such a small amount that's getting cooled off quicker and thickening faster and also like my dropper is like has a limited stuff to suck up so that won't be if you're doing a larger amount but it's not hurting anything by putting it in the microwave for just like 10-15 second intervals you just have to make sure you work kind of fast so let's throw that back in okay so looks a little different now I guess it just melted a lot more it's a lot more liquidy and put these interim moles okay so I put the purple ones into a molds now let's try some more but with the coconut oil let's do the yellow ones one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so we'll do thirteen of them just like we did last time and then we're gonna microwave this I'm going to start it with 40 seconds okay here's our 40 seconds melted they're nice and liquidy still might be a bit of an issue with the syringe dropper thing but if you have like one of those bottles you can dispense them with that'll be like way easier but let's add in the coconut oil so I hope you know what nut oil is what I expect to be the most difficult but I think that there's already less lecithin in the gummy bears so the oil should be able to emulsify pretty good but we'll find out so let's have it half a teaspoon of coconut oil okay we got our half teaspoon let's mix that in so so far it's actually mixing in really well that's all something I do for gummy bears with tincture instead of coconut oil because they I think they taste better but I know that most people you should just have coconut oil on hand the texture is a little bit different with the coconut oil I'm going to put that back in the microwave for another like 15 seconds alright so I did another 10 seconds I thought 15 might be too much all right now let's put these in their molds it looks like it's a lot harder using these so I'm gonna use one of my squeeze bottles which will be a lot you hear well I guess I should say hopefully it will be a lot easier you can see that like the coconut oil's making it like that doesn't like stick to the sides of the bottle that much I'm actually very surprised how well the cup oil mixed in oh my god that's so hot oh god it burns okay so don't touch hot melted candy because it is really hot and it hurts okay and this is cooled off a bit now that I've changed the bottle so hopefully it comes out okay if not I'll put it until I got a hot bowl of water or something look at all that gelatin or gummies sitting on the top there and I gotta get him down I'm just gonna leave this to sit upwards to get this to come down guys it's just it's it's too sticky this didn't really work that well either I'm gonna take the metal cap off and I'm gonna put it in the microwave just like this hopefully that works okay I did it ten seconds in the microwave it still doesn't look like it's gonna come out like this No okay this is not working either see another way that we can get this into the mold I mean like it's still gonna taste delicious I'm probably gonna have to eat a lot of this like just peel out of the bowl and stuff okay my plan was to cut a hole and squish this through but I don't think that's gonna happen well let's let's try see oh it's working okay I mean it's a little hardened now Oh No okay this is not working very well okay so the melting of the gummy bears and adding coconut oil didn't work very well I don't know why it seems like it almost got like harder like I now I'm just wondering if I like I microwaved it too many times like I don't know it just it won't come out really it's too thick to come out of anything so I'm gonna make another batch with the tincture just to test that out um again and see it's like it's definitely going to work or if it's user error and I mean it still I'd still take my get it a fruit roll-up it still tastes good if you wanted to you just melt them and then I mean this is really good little easy to get through oh look but you could just melt it and put it onto like parchment paper or silicone and peel it off after and just cut it into strips it's like the same thing it just won't be in the molds the actual gummy product mixed really well - coconut oil it tastes amazing of course you just they just happen to make sure it's pretty making the mold so still work very good I'll be snacking on this later okay let's do some more with the orange gummies and let's put some more tincture and then this time 1112 where do we do 13 or 12 I remember 30 I think and you don't have to do 13 so it's just the number I'm doing I don't know just - just what it is I'm doing and yeah you can just use whatever amount you want obviously you're really good okay let's microwave this you've got 30 seconds we're gonna do double the tincture so one teaspoon instead of half a teaspoon see this looks like it might have been too much tincture too much liquid and they might not set but you could always add more gelatin but I have a feeling these will set they'll just be a lot softer but if you want them to be able to firmer you could just add a sprinkle of gelatin a little more liquidy consistency as will definitely be easier to put into our moulds hopefully this one works a bit better I think it will we just got to act fast I mean using a dropper I probably would've been fine I don't know why decided to use this because it's such a small amount coming out already there we go oh yeah that's perfect oh and also just FYI if you buy these bottles which are really great for gummy making when you're making larger amounts not like this much died by making the tape it comes with like this I don't know if you can see that it's really really small and the gummy mixture is usually too thick to come out so I just put a different tip that's a little bit wider on there to make sure it can get through this was really difficult to use with such a small amount that I had so use a dropper if you have one this is usually my go-to option to squeeze things into molds but because there is such little amount when I squeeze it it's not really doing anything whereas if there was like this much gummy make sure when I squeeze it the pressure would push it out but because I made such a small amount obviously it's gonna be a little bit trickier I will just eat this out of the bottle later I'm just going to put the gummies that I need into the fridge probably for like 20 minutes alright guys I'm back but it hasn't been 20 minutes it's been two days so I took the gummies Oh after 20 minutes and they were not nearly hard enough I couldn't even really get them out of their molds so I put them in the freezer for a little bit like about half an hour and once they were hard enough I popped them all out of their molds and just left them on some parchment paper but they still were a little bit too squishy and too like corn syrupy so I left them out for a day and they were still a little bit too squishy Tomo for another day which is where we are now so it's been two days and they are perfect so if you guys make these just leave them out on a piece of parchment paper for a couple days depending on how humid it is wherever you live it might be a little bit different like it's not very humid where I live at all um so they dry up pretty quick but if you live somewhere very humid they might take a lot longer to dry or they might even not work for you in the first place so I'll show you what they look like so both the purple and the orange ones turned out very well you can see they're sticky obviously because they are sticking to my fingers so they are a little bit stickier than like a regular gummy but they're they don't really stick together in the bag because I've let them dry out for a few days so the purple ones had half a teaspoon of tincture in them and the orange ones had double that amount so they had one teaspoon of tincture and I thought they were gonna have a lot of issues but they're totally fine yeah they turned out very well and they taste just like the gummies did before I remoulded them last thing just to clarify um my gummies with the coconut oil didn't turn out only the ones with the tincture worked for me I don't know why the coconut oil ones didn't work if you guys know why please let me know because I'm very curious so yeah guys these turned out fantastic I'm super impressed with the results I definitely am gonna use this method many times in the future um going forward what I would do is for every 10 dummies I would do half a teaspoon of tincture so you can just multiply that by however many you want to make in total but based on what I've seen with these with half a teaspoon and the regular teaspoon they both turned out so you couldn't probably get away with using a little bit more but if you're looking for a starting point I would go with ten nine bears and half a teaspoon all right please let me know if you guys try this out I hope you enjoyed the video and let me know if there's any videos you would like to see I hope you guys enjoyed this video please

infused gummies named with all these companies aren't weight cannabis infused that is and this seeming to be the new enclosure du jour for all gummies going forward uh first and foremost these are the best tasting gummies I've ever had edible gummies for sure possibly even just normal gummy candies these are excellent uh and they are pretty damn good too um I'd say they're maybe not quite as strong as the plus gummies that I've reviewed a couple of which I really really liked but these are not far behind at all and they taste so much better than the plus gummies which don't taste bad to begin with it's just that Keva they have some witchcraft they they have some witchcraft and they can keep that nasty cannabis taste at bay nothing all cannabis taste is nasty but it's usually really gross in the gummies but not here and so it's still pretty potent today got up to about a six or so for a hundred milligram edible not too bad not too bad at all so I definitely enjoyed my first experience with kiba's and Kamino line and I yeah maybe three or four flavors and I look forward to reviewing them all because my boys at Kaiba dog and that guys is gonna do it for this review really positive here so anytime we have one of those positive reviews we like to put a little cherry on top a little some extra that you can enjoy throughout your week that isn't necessarily weed related doesn't need weed to help you enjoy it on this week it's something a little bit different I don't often endorse food but this one is such a good deal that I thought I had to give it a shoutout and that is imitation gruel not so not real gruel real gruel is you know it's it's okay but you pay extra for it the imitation gruel is amazing it's got a very sludgy texture a kind of would you describe it as kind of an earthy may be a dirty taste a dirt dirt a posture or dirt - white kind of tastes you know it's it's great um and according to Krusty the Klown nine out of ten orphans can't tell the difference so we are talking Kiva wildberry Caminos super thumbs up and imitation gruel Krusty the Klown says nine out of ten orphans cannot tell the difference and this guy totally agrees imitation gruel check it out I don't think you can actually find it it's from The Simpsons so maybe that's what my actual cherry on top is The Simpsons the good Simpsons not the bad Simpsons so season 9 and then stop Wow that went a long ways for that but I appreciate you guys watching thanks you guys are wonderful just such good guests and wonderful conversationalist so we feel like we have a real dialogue here you and I the audience so thank you so much for watching weeds guys I will see you on the next review I don't know why I said that so inquisitively goodbye this is taking forever goodbye", "dWqZNuhMZME": "hello and welcome to another try it video I'm Alice Ansley and we are going to be making gummy bears it's actually pretty pretty easy we are going to put some liquid and some cups and then we're gonna put gelatin and put them on the stove and then put them in the molds that's pretty much all you need to know but I am so excited because I'm gonna be making watermelon coming bears and we're gonna be adding some food dye to them and then once that's done we're also going to be making some oddly different ones I have some coke a couple other ones that I have like super excited to dry okay so first things first you need your molds I got these on Amazon and they were like ten bucks which is great super cheap super easy to get they were here in one day with my prime shipping and that's amazing so we have those then you need a measuring cup we have a measuring cup it has all the labels on that but it was just great we are going to do the watermelon juice so what it calls for is 1/2 a cup of watermelon juice so we're just gonna try and figure that out I'm really bad at cooking so this is going to be a super fun [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so now that we have our liquids we are going to do two tablespoons of gelatin I put the gelatin in here you can get your gelatin at any local store but let's go ahead and put two tablespoons full of gelatin in these things [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so here's the final test so we're gonna I'm gonna tell you what these flavors are now and then we are going to try them and I will let you know how they are so this is the watermelon ones this is the watermelon juice ones that you saw made that's the beginning of the video and then this is kombucha I'm not exactly sure flavor kombucha but it is kombucha this is dill pickle and this is a garlic so we're gonna try them all out and then see how that's going I'm actually really nervous okay so first is the watermelon it's not bad it's not bad it's Arizona watermelon juice so it's it's a little lighter than normal like actual watermelon juice that's good I like it okay this is kombucha I love kombucha not a lot of people that kombucha my dad hates gonna butcher let it look Kabuto so what's frying you can't really taste anything there's not really that much of a flavor yeah it's not bad I'm kind of just taste like playing gelatin there's a little hint I'll let kombucha but you can't really taste about it okay no pickle this is dill pickle oh we're gonna try this I'm worried I'm not sure how this is gonna taste but we're gonna do it actually that's amazing I love this and I can taste like dill pickle I also use like real pickle juice straight from the jar but but it tastes it it's so good I love it I need to make more of these because they're really delicious okay I am nervous okay I was like what is something weird that I could make and make it look non-threatening since that's why I made it blue so that it's not threatening but this is garlic garlic gummy bear this is freaking me out I'm nervous about this one okay first of all I'm guessing that the kombucha actually does have a flavor because I literally bit into this and all I tasted was just nothing it was just chewy nothing and then all of a sudden out of nowhere there's garlic flavor just smacked me in the mouth and now it's like I'm gonna eat another one that was disgusting it's so gross but I'm gonna eat another one just just to confirm that flavor like I can taste I can taste the garlic now it's on my tongue and it's gonna be there forever I'm never eating this ever again and I've made so many of them I don't know what I'm gonna do okay huh No haha no no oh no no whoo oh gosh okay that's gross okay okay here I'm gonna have another pickle under the pickle ones are really good they're really good I'm gonna try this one more time I have too many flavors in my mouth now yeah I mean it's not it's not bad but it's not good you know it's the the kombucha one is a little you know it's like I think I could eat these you know I could continue to eat these Wow I could pick I could Wow I could continue to eat these but they're just not something that I would make all the time yeah they're all right I like watermelon this yummy okay so hit the subscribe button hit the notification bill commonly you

the latest craze right now all the kids are eating it everybody's buying it and do you know what I'm gonna share with you my simple version of it because it's so easy to make you're gonna need a bag of gummy bears and this is the party size it's twenty eight point eight ounces and you can use whatever gummies you have at home I also have these sour watermelons like GE but you can use sour patch kids you can use lifesaver gummies whatever kind of gummies you have use it anyway powder is basically plum powder it's a popular thing here in Hawaii and they have different brands as well but this Brown seems to be the popular one here you're also going to need lemon strips the Jade Brown is my favorite one if you can't find that they have different brands I found these as well they're called Rocky's and they also have local kind snacks some one that you don't want in don't get this don't get the lemon peel because this actually has seeds in it and you don't want that in your candy we're gonna also need one lemon juice from one lemon and just a little bit of sugar as well so let's get started the first thing you want to do is go ahead and blend your lemon strips in a blender the consistency that you want and you want it really fine and shred it because this will help to quote the gummy bears at the end when you're ready for alright so next you want to go ahead and juice one lemon and I have this little gadget here alright so I have my lemon juice and I actually measured this this is equivalent to two tablespoons of lemon juice so you want to go ahead and pour that in a bowl you also want to add one tablespoon of sugar two teaspoons of leaky moy powder and you want to go ahead and mix this until the sugar is dissolved completely so the sugar has completely dissolved at this point you want to go ahead and give it a little taste to see if you want it sweeter and if so go ahead and add in another tablespoon of sugar but I kind of like it this way because the gummy bears is already sweet and the lemon strips have sugar in it as well so I'm gonna just stick with one tablespoon next step is to add the entire bag of gummy bears go ahead and give it a good mix and make sure that the gummy bears are evenly coated with the lemon syrup [Music] here is a close-up of the final product you can see that every single gummy bear is covered with those lemon strips and that's just how I love them and I also went ahead and put the gummy bears and these little plastic containers cuz I'm gonna just give it out to family and friends anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this easy recipe give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below and feel free to share my video if you want to anyways thanks for watching guys and I'll see you guys next time Aloha", "rWlLvvCVPX0": "why settle for a plain and boring chapstick when we can have this awesome watermelon tinted lip balm inspired by ira tran there are a few things that scream summer to me more than a watermelon and you guys know that i'm addicted to lip balm i gotta have it with me wherever i go take a lid of an eos plus a black non-toxic crayon and an exacto knife carefully cut small chunks of crayon and place them into the lid put one teaspoon of coconut oil in one of the containers in the other two you can put a smaller amount about half a teaspoon of coconut oil to color up my lip balm mixtures i'll be using non-toxic crayons since we're making a watermelon we need red white and green colors first take the red mixture and pour it into the lid leave the red color to slightly harden now let's proceed with white take a little plastic wheel that you find in the middle of every eos container and screw it on the watermelon lid grab the green lip balm mixture and pour it on top leave it to cool down completely to speed up the process you can pop your watermelon lip balm in the fridge or the freezer when it's all set take the bottom part of the eos pop it on and we're finally ready to check how this watermelon tinted lip balm turned out i still have to show you how to create epic bonbon lips take a lipstick of any color and pop it on your lips i'm actually using an eyeshadow pen because i don't have a lipstick in such a dark blue shade grab a boom boom and cut away two triangle pieces these are the parts that we're gonna use for our bonbon lips all we gotta do is apply some lash glue on each of the triangles and stick them next to our lips like i think it looks nice if you match the color of your lips to the color of the wrapper how unique and cool is this bonbon lip hack we're gonna transform them into a cute little cupcake apply some bright pink or red lipstick on the bottom lid you can also just use a lip liner as me this will be our cupcakes liner the top lip will represent frosting so take a white eyeliner or white face paint to color it white to give this cupcake some detail dip an eyeliner brush into a light pink liquid lipstick and draw vertical lines all over the bottom lip this way our cupcake liner looks even more realistic time for the sprinkles you can use real sprinkles and glue them on using a bit of eyelash glue or you can simply draw them on i chose the easy way and the lips turned out awesome let's kick off with an awesome galaxy lipstick made with gummy candy this lipstick is absolutely spectacular and makes your lips look like a real galaxy i am completely obsessed with it so here's how you can make yours put about half a teaspoon of coconut oil into each bowl here comes the yummy part where you get to choose your favorite gummy candy to mix into the lipstick i decided to go for sour gummy warm so yummy and a gummy bear it is totally allowed to taste some too for the color take a violet and blue non-toxic crayons for even better face crayons yes girl you gotta put some glitter into this lipstick because without stars there's no galaxy let all the ingredients melt completely the candy will dissolve last so be patient when all the ingredients are melted take your lipstick container and alternately pour in your blue and violet mixture to get a lovely marble effect let the lipstick set for a few minutes here's our finished result isn't it beautiful i didn't just make one galaxy lipstick but two on top of that i made two lipsticks using three colors i pour one of these into a lip balm but i know i know it's kind of an obsession but these really are so much fun to make see how nice and pigmented this lipstick is you can make it using any other color too next we're making an awesome cotton candy lipstick out of love hearts love hearts are super yummy and they are sold pretty much everywhere in the world so i had to make a lipstick using these put half a teaspoon of coconut oil in each of the melting pots add three little drops of beeswax okay let's now give some color to our lipstick mixtures take an old eyeshadow that you don't use anymore and scoop out some pigment i went for blue and pink finally it's time for the star of the show which are the love hearts these little candies don't melt so i found another way to incorporate them into our lipsticks put a few love hearts into a food processor or a coffee bean grinder grind until you have a smooth powdery texture like confectioners sugar give it a little stir to combine all the ingredients get your lipstick pot ready and all that's left to do is to pour your blue and pink lipstick mixture in voila we are all done see how nice and pigmented my colors are you can make your lipstick more or less pigmented by adjusting the amount of eyeshadow you mix in i also made one in a lipstick container how pretty this one is great if you want the pink and blue to apply randomly on the lips while with the pot you have more control dip your finger on lip brush in pink and apply it on the lips where you want that color you can create epic lip designs that way i love this diy because it's so creative and different you need an old lipstick a pencil and a small piece of baking paper pull the eraser out of the pencil sparrow now roll a piece of parchment paper around the top part of your pencil like this secure it in place with a piece of tape and set it aside for a minute make a double boiler take a piece of lipstick and place it in the glass container optionally you can also add some glitter but remember to use lipstick great or edible glitter wait for the lipstick to melt give it a little stir and pour the mixture in the lipstick mold that we've made earlier i like to pour it up to a quarter or half an inch above the pencil end finally we can unwrap the parchment paper to reveal our awesome lipstick pencil i think it turned out so cool and i love all that blue glitter you can tell how much i like these lipstick pencils by how many i've created look at this galaxy inspired one so gorgeous you never know when a cute guy will walk into your classroom and these lipsticks will have you ready at all times i'm kidding with or without lipstick you're just as beautiful you know those cool lollipops that color your tongue well i got an idea if they color your tongue they should also color your lips so i tried it and it works if you wrap the lollipop on your lips for a minute or two they will get all colored up of course this goes for only one thing we gotta make a diy tinted lollipop lipstick for the packaging it's best to go for something rounded like this pretty disco ball lip balm and the lollipops come in a bunch of different colors i decided to go for the most wearable one which is red some cutting pliers or just strong scissors and snip away the lollipop stick like that pop the lollipop into your container and if you like you can even glue it down with some edible glue if that's not the world's best lipstick then i don't know quick and easy to make super cute tinted and edible quiz candy is the perfect sweet treat for creating diy makeup products especially lip glosses it comes in so many delicious flavors and colors plus it looks super shiny which is exactly what we need squeeze a small amount of this yummy glossiness in a little pot for this one i chose the strawberry flavor which comes in a very light pinky red shade but i want to make my lip gloss super red so i decided to drip in a drop of red food coloring remember that little goes a long way here so you really don't need much food coloring to make the color super vibrant the last thing we have to do is to pour our deliciousness in a lip gloss container you can use a bottle of an old gloss or you can buy these empty containers online for very cheap here it is a beautiful super shiny lip gloss which smells amazing and tastes even better it will give your lips a beautiful glossy red tint plus you can have it as a sweet little treat i love how you can make this in all the possible colors i also wanted to try the berry flavor here i squeezed the candy directly in the lip gloss bottle to make the color brighter and more potent i added a drop of blue food coloring mix it up or shake it a little bit and you get a gorgeous bright blue lip gloss i can't get over how amazing this diy is these candy glosses are seriously the best and comparing to usual glosses they're way more affordable are making rainbow lipstick out of lollipops this recipe is perfect if you need to upcycle your older lipsticks and we're also adding crushed lollipop for the perfect fruity scent and taste make a double boiler and put in as many melting pots as you need to melt different colored lipsticks i have four so four little glass bowls for me you can also melt your lipstick in a microwave if you prefer take small amounts of each lipstick color and put them into melting bowls now we can spice up the lipstick with some can take a lollipop or any other hard candy put it in a plastic bag and crush it with a hammer add the crushed lollipops to the melting lipsticks i like to combine colors of lollipops with colors of lipsticks so red lolly goes to red lipstick and blue one goes to blue lipstick give all the colors a good stir to help the lollipop melt alright we can now put all these colors together into a pretty rainbow lipstick i started with yellow then red orange and violet and again yellow and so on until the lipstick container is completely full leave it to cool down for a few minutes and you're finished i also decided to make one lipstick in the pot since i don't have four arms to pour in all the colors at once here's how you do it place an object i'm using a knife under one side of the lipstick pot then pour in your first color rotate the pot for 90 degrees and pour in another color repeat these steps for the remaining two colors and there you have it an epic lipstick wheel how cool is that i had to make two because i told you obsession again these lipsticks are super creamy and pigmented which i like i wanted to have fun so i used all the rainbow colors and created these cool rainbow lips the easiest way to make them is using a lip brush [Music] why wear a plain lipstick when you can rock this epic polka dot lips they're super simple to make and they look amazing grab any lipstick of your choice and apply it on the lips as usual i went for classic red but literally any color will work to make the white dots i'm gonna use a white liquid eyeliner take a bobby pin and dip its deep in the liquid eyeliner now you can easily make the perfect white dots all over your lips bobby pin works like a stamp what a great trick right if you don't have a white liquid eyeliner you can just use a black one or even the usual pencil liners i like the liquid eyeliners because they're very opaque and make the dots really vibrant", "ppi0khS0s_8": "you want to taste this at your gas in it's pretty sour okay oh my god you better water everyone I'm Claire I'm in the v8s kitchen and today I am making gourmet sour patch kids this is not my best category of candy but I like sour okay that this will look like children that makes these more disturbing than I remember well I remember mmm they're good they they just crossed over into being not good it's like person was pretty good second one's pretty good third one would probably still be okay and then a four hundred bad I love the like mouth salivating sour coating it has a very chewy texture the coating I'm 99.9% sure is an extra sugar and citric acid and that's it so there's no flavor in the coating the flavor is the gummy part itself they once oh they're hugging same thing deserve it sighs fire I don't love sour and flaky these are really weird I don't hate it but they don't like it wow this is a big bag I don't know what these are these are watermelon sour patch kids but they're not in the shape of kids they're in the shape of watermelons they're good I wish they were more sour not really sour extreme sour I'm super excited about this I love sour oh wait okay now it's happening oh it's good no no what red is you don't like that I love that oh you are not gonna like the final one then don't have the only flavor than that Oh what are you kidding Delaney oh my god you did the best one the watermelon wrong I read love codes via regular ones you eat a whole bag cut your toe oh yeah like sandpaper example yeah just keep going up it's like a chemical exfoliator here ones last time you had one not that long ago actually so my younger child Cosmo is actually coming to work tomorrow because it's summer and camps are done and he is a sour aficionado he fancies himself like a real sour like he'll eat a whole lime oh wow the most important thing about it is the texture it's right now perfect chewy I know perfect it's very hard say that right now can we just talk by the shape real quick yeah I don't like that they're in the shape of first I mean they're supposed to be the shape children yeah why why are they called sour patch kids there has to be some character what what do you want in the shape of watermelon that's your job all right we're gonna clear this off and I'm gonna take a closer look how I used to carry through this when I worked in a restaurant I always get yelled at so you at least line them closer thank you all right we got some we got a Roy Roy Roy jib you've red orange yellow green blue I'm gonna know that yellow is lemon and orange is orange but green blue and red tick who knows could be it's anyone's guess I have the best idea ever let's trace Cosmo and use his shape I think will be very fun also I don't know how I'm gonna do that I want to taste each of these components separately it's really only sweet there's no sour flavor at all and some vague fruit flavoring I'm gonna taste another crystal coating I can say definitively citric acid and granular sugar that chewy texture I know it's gonna be difficult but there's really just one task everything else is just kind of assembly and is not so challenging time for my favorite part reading the ingredients sugar shocked invert sugar corn syrup modified corn starch are Taric acid citric acid natural artificial flavoring yellow six red 40 yellow five blue one sit yeah we gotta do some research to the computer this has they were originally created under the name of Mara's men in 1885 they were renamed to Sour Patch Kids likely to capitalize on the popularity of Cabbage Patch Kids makes sense oh my god okay this wait this would be a article from two years ago how to make oh okay how to make citrus candy tastes like sour patch kids candy so this is basically about a pastry chef who was candied such as peel and then tossing it in a sugar citric acid mix and candy peel does have that kind of chewy texture it's a really interesting idea a method that I'm thinking about in my head to take a combination of citrus peel and green apple and that may be the dehydrator and like create something like a pet a flea which is a natural like fruit gummy and see if I can get something close to that texture I don't know that's gonna work but it might come close enough and be so radical that we are just impressed and well it just kind of what Cosmo says but it could work I don't know what the process is gonna be yet in my mind I'm thinking of two main components one is candied citrus peel and one is green apple jelly which is what I used to start gushers and I'm gonna start by making the green apple jelly I need three and a half pounds of apples I and now I need seven cups of water I'm leaving the peel seven feet all intact the first step is to extract the pectin from the apples so I just simmer them in water all right I can't make green apple jelly on account of there's no gasps it's me bitched out to get me okay I need thin sheet metal like real thick okay let me back up I need to make my own cookie cutter yeah I'm gonna no no I'm gonna take a strip of metal and bend it into the mold that sounds great to maybe be an angle these have been cooking for 40 minutes the idea is that the pectin has been released from the fruit so I'm straining out the solids because I don't like clear jelly I just want the clear liquid with all the pectin in it that's what I should do is let this sit overnight and this will keep straining in the fridge and tomorrow when we come back add the sugar cook that down and then don't move on to the citrus peel but I have no idea that's gonna work and it might be a complete failure so I don't know I'm gonna reserve judgment until tomorrow I feel like it's day 1.5 yeah thank you I'm thinking that I can make like a patch of flee from the pith of the citrus which is very very very bitter but through a series of LAN ching and cooking in a sugar solution it becomes soft and also sweet and that some of the bitterness is taken out the question is how to get something that is the texture of citrus piss into something smooth and punchable I don't know I don't know I'm not gonna work but let's try it in this pot is that apple mixture that ice cream last night and now I'm adding sugar and this is cooking down and it will feel very firm while the apple jelly is cooking I'm going to break down my citrus and start to take cream peel off oh my god hi hi Cosmo when's the last time you had a sour patch kid for me it's been a little while oh yeah this is Cosmo your mom told me cause one that you really like sour so I'm gonna try to make them even more sour than sour patch kids one thing I think would be cool with a homemade version is if we really make the shape more lifelike so I thought maybe we could use your outline as the shape to cut the sour patch kids too and I don't have a plan yet it's just an idea so might not work you were just doing now all right so that's good one that's good there's a profile [Music] the ball awesome this is my apple jelly I'm gonna do I want to do a test on this I have some plates in the freezer cuz that's on your test for this set so when I run my finger through it it's supposed to wrinkle see it wrinkle it's done and now I'm gonna focus on my citrus I think that I would do I might do a lime flavor a Meyer lemon flavor and the lemon I might do cherry cuz we have some cherry juice I'm gonna try that what I need to do now is blanch all of these separately three times in boiling water three times three it's kind of a process this whole thing might not work and I might have spent the entire day of working on it for nothing [Music] click so once it's boiling I'm gonna bring it over to the sink drain the next step is to juice the citrus fruits that I've left over and use those as a flavoring Cosmo give me a hand punch and hop up right here you know there's a little step store for you so you can just start throwing the limes at the top right there then this oh now I know I'm ready three yeah I didn't know you have to do all this this thing is like a real high-tech kind of gadget I'm in against two-thirds of a cup I don't know I feel like I'm doing it wrong awesome that was fun thank you for your help let's see where we are I have all of my blanched peel and I have my juices and zest feeling it very organized at least I'm going to get this in a food processor and chop it up into little bits it smells so good I'm adding the lime zest I'm gonna add all the juice that we have and now the equal weight of sugar so 160 grams sugar okay now I'm gonna get this over onto the stove as I cook it the sugar will dissolve they become sweet and translucent and softer I have no idea what's gonna happen I don't know if it's gonna work best-case scenario is I get a very set very firm very delicious paste that I can spread into a layer and it sets and I've like made sour patch kids this is a wild stab in the dark hot-hot let's my nephew boom mmm oh my god but ashes good right like it's bitter but it's a nice bitter sweet tart balance it's very limey good right all right cool all right I'm gonna add to this some of the green apple jelly what a pretty color right who knew this gonna turn into this color I do not it hasn't fully set that you can see even now it's really really thick so I feel good about adding this as just a boost this is already getting very very thick that's one drop of leaf green gel a mint green yeah it's not that far off the texture is like it's rubbery in a good way and I think it's because of that it's gonna set up pretty firm so we have to just wait and see oh just like a lonely chicken hanging out excited to check out the green the green slime it's just like those discrete pieces of Peel so it's a little granular soothing minute toss this in some citric acid a city so sour to sour oh it hurts my teeth oh I'm gonna try cutting this into pieces and then dehydrating the pieces Bragg got a new dehydrator that he told me I could use but he had something in there so I have to make sure is he here what's he even got in there oh he's making fish jerky I didn't want this to be in with the fish it smells we have to get the old one I think Ivy's in here on I guess medium high just where it is now this is like old reliable this dehydrator it served us well and gourmet meats it does its job it's just bulky and clunky while this is dehydrating I want to try I want to try actually the cherry batch that I'm gonna make with the lemon but I'm gonna use a different assembly method where I basically blend it first before I cook it at a server solution to try to get it very very smooth all right it's pretty it's pretty smooth it's obviously much smoother than before so before I did 50 grams of jelly to about 160 grams of the toilet link it matters whatever this is on its way this is to really reduce down I don't know if Lucario is gonna do anything it's not gonna be the same this is cherry flavor that we've used it's not the most natural I'm more concerned by the texture which is still pretty bit see but definitely get cherry lots of good lemon flavor and not really terribly sweet at all this is going going to go into the fridge thank you so everything is sticky and it itself off and what I have left is the Meyer lemon peel the issues so far our taste and texture which is all of them but now I have to address the toughness of the texture so I think I'm going to pressure-cook it in some water to try to soften it to the point where I can really puree it she's gonna go on high [Music] I'm gonna feel these now cut I think that actually worked really well now I want to blend it to get it really smooth very hot so they try not to burn myself looks pretty good I mean it's a puree there's a little texture to it but other thing looks better than before oh no something got in it what is that oh what's happening I also have another idea I know I was talking about how I don't want to do that cooked sugar thing but this texture this is something you get from cooking sugar to a certain candy stage what I might do is add to that like a cook basically cook the corn syrup and combine them and let it set this is nice and thick I like made caramel okay taking this out oh god oh god I need floss okay okay so the sugar got too hot the corn syrup got too hot and then there just isn't a lot of volume in this bowl and so it the paddle was picking up the sugar before it could hit the fruit and start to incorporate but I think more than anything is the temperature issue Oh God okay I want to try this again basically and incorporate a couple of changes to mess it overall as a parting thought let's check on our lime mixture in here Oh a little bit of Bounce do you want to taste this yeah you can just you don't have to eat the whole thing don't ya right it's like sweet bitter sour the textures kind of weird it's like there's lost like little pieces in there I don't know about that math but but yeah thank you I think if this works it's like true innovation and that's exciting but it's also big if I'm proud of my method overall if not the result it's day three two and a half technically you it's really wet it's not really super elastic it just is it's more brittle I do have to work on the texture significantly today the flavor I like so I have to obviously come up with a different method this time last time I finally graded the zest juice them so I'm skipping all that to save time and I'm just going to do the citrus hats whole [Music] here's all my plants citrus when a pressure cook them one at a time so first I'm going to start with the limes I'm gonna go 15 minutes and the pressure cooker on high sorry you know someone needs a step look at this on high okay it's very fluffy just does that work a lot of air into it you can see how smooth it is but there are still some particles in there so I'm gonna force it through a fine-mesh strainer into a saucepan this is called a chinois this is a really useful tool for straining thick mixtures like this should I taste it real quick it tastes really bad it's gross but there's no sugar in it it's like eating a whole lime that you blended so I want to add fresh lime juice because I wanted to have a fresher lime flavor and then I'm going to add sugar cook this down like I did on day 2 I could be spending hours on this and have it not work it's not an ideal while the lime mixture is cooking down I'm going to pressure cook my remaining citrus here's everything I'm gonna just set this aside here is my cook down lime mixture it's very like congealed split pea soup that's good the sweetness helps balance it out a lot going to do the cook sugar and mix it together so the sweetness will increase on day two I cooked only corn syrup I'm going to do a mixture of corn syrup granulated sugar and water this time because that didn't go so well I'm gonna cook it to 260 Fahrenheit so I'm looking it we're close it's okay that's ready all right so I'm weighing out 200 grams actually we're gonna add some of this oh wow oh yeah it doesn't look fully incorporated maybe try adding a tablespoon of corn starch see if that does anything sometimes corn starch is just the answer is the cord search will help absorb some of the moisture honestly I do feel like that looks better I think the corn starch sort of found it and like not emulsified it but just brought it together I'm surprised the mixture doesn't seem to be firming up I expected it to start to harden much faster okay well it looks pretty weird it's not as smooth as I was hoping I'll check back on it in 10 minutes or so just to see what the texture is okay so it didn't I wouldn't say that it's set I would say that it stayed very goo like some help adding hard sugar to a firm mixture it became wetter it seems like I've defied the laws of physics here I really don't get it I didn't really think was gonna work so in some ways it's what I expected but I was hoping that it was gonna work so I am also disappointed so now I don't know gelatin code the gelatin route and see what happens I think I might have to do some research yeah well I think I'm gonna Google so one thing I've found on this website a little bit down the road when I have an actual thing to perform into Sour Patch Kids once you have the cut pieces of in this case paddock we this just soak them and enough Everclear to cover before you roll them in a coating of sugar is that ever clear desiccates the candy forming a leathery skin on its surface that will keep the rolling sugar from turning sticky and syrupy for several hours I guess I wasn't aware that Everclear is the brand of alcohol I just know it's a very high proof they sell basically just grain alcohol which is 190 proof that right Everclear enjoys tremendous brand recognition and a loyal and near cult status following that's the description what are they gonna do like give like tasting notes like the grain alcohol that was the only tip I've really picked up from that let me do a proper test with corn syrup the fruit the fruit juice to get everything to spin and and the apple jelly because I want everything really well incorporated before I start to cook it down so this one I'm going to try lemon instead of water I'll use some that cherry juice and the new plan is put everything in the blender and then cooking I like this plan better all right I'm going to take this over to the stove and once it reduces down I had a thermometer in this mixture it cooked down a lot and then I turned it up then I walked away and then it kind of burned and it also never got up to the right temperature so I think it is a failure let's just see so I want to pour this out of the pot so that I don't scrape any of the offensive burnt pieces with it it does not look good this thing will be soaking for a while Asha is kind of pretty I want to quickly try to whisk in a little bit of food coloring I'm gonna put in just like a drop of cherry flavor do a 1/4 teaspoon of citric acid smells very cherry Oh remember next time not too hot what is it he's burnt what a tingle okay made me feel like I was gonna pass out for her sighs I think there I put I put too much cherry flavor okay maybe that's it I also burned it a little but the bitterness is also that it's whole lemon in there oh that explain it does that make you feel better that makes me feel better but maybe it's gonna be great you know maybe like dust it with sugar stamp it out call it a day call it a day [Music] texture is not right rota help me but I'm afraid that I'm reaching the point where I have to scrap three days of work and start over how are you gonna shape it I'm so far from having decided on how I'm gonna shape it so it's more sugar no no it's not very sweet so bitter and sour sour bitter it tastes like cherry cough medicine kind of doing great though you're definitely on the right track don't show this part dude I just don't think it's gonna work I think that this whole thing is a huge waste of time it's so hard don't whisper I mean I'll do you want to trade can we trade do you want to smell like this it's not that bad well so where are you at right now what's going on I seem discouraged son I have no I have nothing to show you it's just one failed batch after another are you doing wrong I couldn't even tell you oh I'm so sick of eating steak it's so great to have a little fruit there you go you're gonna feel great okay I will try really go in there and fries can we if I try it we'll see what happens okay yeah what we you're oh you're on deep fry I don't really want to do that what's the next one [Music] we're trading places yeah there you go [Music] couple to talk to yourself I'm a lefty juice they're gonna know oil all right ready Oh God Oh God thumbs up okay ready it's hot over there [Music] thank you thank you [Music] I'm feeling like brakes are very important when you hit a road block and it was good to go over there and be a meal for five minutes but then I came back here and I still don't want to do it so it didn't really help the texture is so wrong with pureed citrus it's like maybe that's just not the way to go I think I have to just scrap this plant even though I did spend two days cooking with citrus and try a version I don't know try version of just juice just lemon juice I have limes here already cut I might as well try lime so maybe what I'll do is juice apple jelly sugar corn syrup let's start at 240 and we can always increase okay try to pour this out onto the parchment certainly the texture is smooth and they slide it onto a tray up in the fridge I feel good about that actually all right look at this mixture it's definitely different than before I mean this is the opposite the problem I was having like this has a dramatic sort of pull texture will try pectin I kind of forgotten what that texture of like stretchy sugar is like and it's not what we're going for I'm innocent mineral let's see they goo [Music] no the goo is still goo you said you were about this okay well after nearly a week in the fridge it has not firmed up at all it's still mush I don't act I don't want to look at it this new method using mostly sugar and corn syrup but then also gelatin and pectin in combination it sounds like a generally sound method to me but it does involve drying them and some of the resources I read said you can do that in dehydrator so we'll try that and we're also going to try that grain alcohol idea to really dehydrate the outer coating what's not ideal about this method is that it does rely on flavoring agents like flavoring oils not a more natural fruit derived flavor but it does let me introduce juice so that's that's a bonus Oh Concord okay that could be fun yeah you know a great flavor a sour cherry flavor and then I can do the other the citrus flavors red yellow orange have to get a mixture of sugar and corn syrup into a saucepan this mixture is just sugar and corn syrup and a little water to encourage it to dissolve and that's it then my Petri net gelatin measured out and I want to start hydrating the gelatin in the fruit juice I think I'm going to start flavor-wise with grape so this one this one will go completely solid it's already on its way all right where our 270 I'm just gonna pull this off you we can keep talking this just has to sit here what is this just some cooked sugar oh very good it is happy birthday that's the gift you can give me yes my gosh mytilini have fun happy birthday so I'm adding my citric acid by gelatin mixture jeez and now my food coloring I'm gonna add a little bit of eggplant and a little bit of the other purple so the idea here is that the heat from the sugar syrup is melting the gelatin okay now I'm gonna pour it out onto my parchment you can see it's definitely starting to set up already Oh God okay [Music] I'm very glad I greets this parchment I'm just trying to cut strips approximately whatever this is by whatever this is I can't I can't remember what the sizes were these I'm going to put in the dehydrator I shouldn't see what's happening in here what happened so that happened what happened was they melted because of the gelatin I think we have to put do it cold but put them in front of the fan in the fridge in the walk-in it's all up here maybe if I put it yeah yeah this is a good spot so the other thing that I want to try is I want to see what happens when I put some of this mixture in that grain alcohol that we got so this is Everclear 190 proof grain alcohol it's going to pour a little bit of this and I'm not exactly sure what the chemistry is unclear if it drives it out just on the surface to create kind of like a skin or if it really dries the whole thing out but let's let's try it I don't know the dream of a sour patch Cosmo is going getting further and further away there are certainly no kind of prefab silicone molds that fit the bill we're better off just punching them out look no do you read math man it's huge if you look at overall area yeah this one's bigger but it's not crazy this one is the best one so far this one is maybe perfect it already looks like me a little person I just have to thin out those arms really does little your ghost the only thing left to do is make more of our sugar mixture so I think I'm starting with lemon orange maybe I'll just it's like hockey puck of pectin and so basically I want to bring this up again after I add the gelatin into the saucepan and agility I have a feeling it's not fully dissolving all right citric acid maybe one drop of cherry flavor one goes to super red food coloring that looks pretty good let's look at the cherry such a firmer now so I just popped it out I want to try punching out some of the shapes oh my god it's so bouncy I can't even press this down into it oh there we go let's do that a thousand more times it I made it it's the sour patch penguin oh it's not that bad well what if I hold on I have such a good idea well I just figured something out which is the reason sour patch kids have no arms is because all of these limbs want to stick to themselves and each other really bad so I think if I continue to make these I have to start soaking them immediately in the green alcohol so that the outside dehydrates and then they become less sticky so I'm just gonna go ahead and make a couple extra flavors to have around me to taste this will now go into the fridge well it's still doing that lemon is good this one's good well this is coming down let's go into the walk-in and just check on the ones they're drying okay I'm gonna try they are very chewy they still you know they're still pretty springy but overall I think I think the step of drying it is a good one and maybe I should leave all of these batches in the walk-in with the pan on them overnight thank you all right it's now been several hours in the grain alcohol they're really not sticky at all on the outside so this is a great technique I think for making sure they don't stick together once these three new flavors are set I'll pop them out of the pans I've put them on a sheet tray and get them in the walk-in to really dry out and then tomorrow the plan is to cut them so if them in alcohol I think and then coat them in the citric acid mixture and then we're right and then we're done all right so it's hard to tell if they've really tried out or if they're just really cold they feel very firm more I think the orange more than the others I want to taste the orange the orange one looks really good I think maybe the best one yet and it is doing a little bit more of that whole flavors good it seems like the most successful batch yet the flavor is better and then this is the first one I made the sour cherry you get a nice pull but not like a crazy long stretch I don't think that I would gain anything from making anything over again I'm really happy with these so I want to focus on cutting out shapes you want me this is Cosmo as I can get we did this like weeks ago when I thought I was gonna be better at this so we're going to just take a few liberties and say that this is the shape I don't even like the shape though I'd almost rather do this one and make them really big it's just so much easier to punch out something this size you know I forgot to grease it it's not bad I think it's kind of cute it looks more like a baby all the sour patch kids are just gonna be the larger kind more like this one all right now I'm going to into production mode cutting all the shapes getting them in here - as I cut out each one I want to start soaking them in the grain alcohol because it will prevent them from sticking to each other so while these soak I can at least put together that's our coating so that's one part citric acid let's try two parts sugar know that I think it's good we're gonna go with this I'm just wondering if I should try to flavor the coating for each one I feel like I haven't done my best work so far and maybe this is my only opportunity to to impress alright so I'm gonna make three different flavors of the coating lemon orange and cherry I'm just gonna get everything in the dehydrator in small bits and then once it's dry I'll pulverize it in a spiced friend hopefully nothing bad happens try enough I think I'm just going to add all of the lemon to one here's orange give it a little taste but really so I'm ready to start the coating Oh [Music] these little guys it is an enormous size [Music] do they need double coats well done that was orange anyway okay finally done with all the coating I my three flavors I think they're done and I think they're done because I was told they have to be done because we don't have time to let them dry for a week so Oh Cosmo will love these they're extremely sour not even that sweet on citric acid there in the end I am proud of the relatively clean fruit flavor of each of the colors maybe those are that's like at your own risk it's quite sour the only thing that's left is to have people taste them hopefully they'll be kind and not too harsh yeah they're huge this might be like the resurface I think of the more than that you want to weigh I'm in sea nine point eight grams that's a lot all right let's see what one of the big guys 55.8 it's like you're getting a deal yeah exactly I love a deal now I've had a Linea a cheerio sour yeah it's really sour too much on the coating this is like a little sharper okay like adults hour this feels like good I'll take it big sharks are the flavor of this is fantastic thank you no I did the best I could you really I just wish I'd done better that's how I feel every literally every day oh they're done but they're not good they're very very welcome Oh so to send one home to Cosmo with our sincere apologies tell them that I struggled so hard when it came time to cut them you delivered on her on the more sour but yeah yeah yeah actually not a bad texture I like further to service you do really they have like a gingerbread man oh that was the cutter I used good to make them nice shape nice color great job thanks bro - thank God for rota okay final thoughts trying to keep it positive next time we have to do a gummy candy I do feel like I learned a lot this was just sort of like very repetitive and I wasted kind of three days of time on that weird citrus peel idea so this one was frustrating but now I know more for next time I think Cosmo is really gonna like these because they're so so her and maybe I should have tempered that citric acid coating but I know that I at least have one true fan and then as Cosmo and that's the important things to have pleased the people who already love sour patch kids is great I never want to see them again here's how you make gourmet Sour Patch Kids combine 1 cup sugar 3 tablespoons of water and 3/4 cup corn syrup in a small saucepan and bring to a boil starting to dissolve the sugar stop stirring and clip a candy thermometer to the side and cooked at 290 degrees Fahrenheit meanwhile bloom 50 grams of powdered unflavored gelatin in a half a cup of sour cherry lemon or orange juice then stir in 15 grams of pectin stir this mixture into the sugar syrup along with a pinch of salt then stir in one and a quarter teaspoons of citric acid and the corresponding fruit flavor oil or extract until smooth pour the mixture into a greased parchment lined pan and chill until set punch out shapes using your cutter and soak the cutouts in grain alcohol to dehydrate the surface place on a rack and chill uncovered in the refrigerator until very firm and chewy dehydrate lemon zest orange zest and dried sweet cherries in a dehydrator on high then grind into a powder combined with citric acid and granulated sugar to taste coat the sour patch kids in the correspondingly flavored sour sugar are you ready to try the sour house mom kids yeah this is really good would you say to sour nothing in six hours", "vKUalt7mcmA": "hi guys I'm back it's Nikki and I have another CBD oil video for you guys today CBD oil CBD products I have tried my first CBD product a few weeks ago over a month ago and I kind of got hooked a little bit a little bit not too much so I had recently ordered another trial of CBD so with all the CBD stuff I tried I tried the vape I tried the gummies I tried the honey and that's it that's the all the CBD stuff I try so out of all those I tried I really enjoyed and felt the most effect out of the gummies it gave me the best effect that I know so that's what I wanted to do I wanted to do a test this is an experiment I ordered two different types of CBD I was just gonna get the gummies but then I decided I saw this syringe oil that I wanted to track that it look so interesting so I went ahead and tried that so let me show you so this is from where's this from I think diamond CBD this is like one of my favorite CBD spots now to buy stuff because they have good promos and they have coupon codes and their stuff that actually works for me with like like it doesn't make me feel weird and it manages pain when I want to have it or I feel good so bubble wrap and box well I got relaxed gummies CBD a few sour bears a hundred mg and a daily boost CBD oil granddaddy purple a thousand 500 mg that's a lot let's just open the gummy seemed to come in these packaging for some reason always comes in this packaging so there it is it's a relaxed sour bears I love the sours I love the sours extreme strength extreme strength CBD a hundred mg's per pouch so 7.25 mg per gummy so this whole package is 100 mg s alright and alright it's it oh so they have take one two three gummies once or twice per day so you could take up to three gummies up to two times a day or as needed alright the amount of time it takes CBD to start working is up to 90 minutes so alright how long does the effect last up to eight hours and this is the other one this I thought was really interesting I wasn't going to get anything but the gummies for the test but look at this this is let me let this let me look at it daily daily high strength daily boost terpenes formulated that has a 500 mg granddaddy purp daily dose fully loaded with approximately 50 mgs of broad-spectrum CBD 18 plus this literally says 18 plus place up to 1 ml under tongue may cause drowsiness okay 1 ml up to 1 ml so this whole thing is 1 ml so you can place up to you can put this whole thing under your tongue Wow so here it is this is what it looks like it's a syringe it's literally a syringe it's awesome so here's a syringe and I thought like before I ordered it I was like wow you inject this and yourself the CBD but actually you don't you inject it under your tongue 1500 mg s 100 mg s it doesn't say how long this will taken it back to but like I said this takes 90 minutes I want to open the gummies up I'm gonna do a testy testy oh oh no unfortunately I'm gonna have to open this whole thing because I knew it it felt like it melted this didn't happen before I don't know if those my fault or their fault but it got squashed melted it melted it melted look at this I'm gonna eat it I'm gonna need half of it half of it should be like right there still taste go mmm maybe I should do um CBD ASMR hard to eat like this should I do this whole thing the recommended dose for chronic pain I like the face ID so I got time it I guess this is 20 mg for chronic leg pain uh-huh I'm to eat the whole thing I'm gonna be greedy I'm scared mmm I'm a candy person that's it's good very fruity I'm almost done I know it's not good to talk when you chew but okay I need to talk I don't want to stick here I'm chewing your face say anything so I'm gonna time it see I feel hmm mind you I ate breakfast it's like I had breakfast at like nine o'clock I ate some Farina like hot cereals that's it it's almost 12 o'clock it's 11 55 ohms so 11:55 a.m. I didn't eat lunch yet but I did eat breakfast so it's not on an empty stomach keep that in mind should I eat it in the morning but maybe next time I can do CVD of an empty stomach what is my syringe sour sour power I don't want to take the whole thing I'm torn I'm scared I don't want to take the whole thing this 15,000 M jeez I'm gonna do this I'm just gonna do this I'm gonna do the whole thing those teddy bears how was the how was it it said think I'm OD'ing this is seriously how 14 I just ate 14 gummies so that was only 100 mg okay sounds 100 mg so if I take this whole syringe that's gonna be how much was this one if I take that package Plus this is going to be 1600 M geez hold on let me look online and see if that's okay punch it 10 mg the CBD your body can only absorb before tea so I guess our body 1 absorbed that as much as what we're taking in syringe myself don't feel too scared there's no reviews no reviews I'm starting to feel something I'm starting to feel something and it's been 5 minutes so I think this thing's kicking in as soon as five minutes with a light breakfast a couple hours after a late breakfast I think I'm gonna do this but under my tongue okay oh oh oh this tastes like um frickin licorice oh I hate licorice mmm I don't like it I don't like it I don't have water Oh put the whole thing squirt [Music] this is disgusting look I did it oh I should've did that one first messed up my lipstick yeah now's disgusting I don't have water nothing nothing so like I said I feel like I felt the hmm I feel interesting I can't believe I did 1600 M jeez okay let's see let's come back in an hour I'll come back in an hour and update you on how I feel I think right now I'm going to do my fashion Nova on bagging unboxing so if you want to see me do fashion noma like right now I'm gonna in this video and I'm gonna do my unbagging of the fashion Nova that I bought if you want to see me do fashion Nova I'm bagging on CBD then I'll put a link down in the description boom I'm starting to feel it already I'm gonna go ahead and do my fashion Nova I'm bagging and if you want to check that out and see me unbag on 16 mgs of CBDs then be my guest I'll be right back in an hour and update you on how I feel in the meantime okay bye see you later whoo hi okay so guys it has been an hour and a half exactly an hour-and-a-half 90 minutes so I started taking the CBD gummies at 11:50 okay I started feeling it a hundred milligrams I started taking that I started feeling it now actually I took the gummies I took the gummies at 11:50 a.m. and the whole pack 100 milligrams and then I took the syringe the syringe thing a hundred thousand five hundred milligrams after that and then five minutes at 11:55 I started feeling something and then starting at 12 o'clock is when I did my fashion Nova I'm bagging video and it just was like I just felt like I was doing too much like I felt like I was just doing too much and I was just I wanted to talk more and be more lively like more like this like you know who I am right now I don't I think I'm just more like mellow and just like thinking like what the heck is going on I don't know I didn't even see the video yet but when I post it you know obviously you can check it out check it out if you want you don't want to that's fine but it was just like I felt like I needed to like lay down and just relax and stuff like that as for pain management I feel like it could do it's like could do pain management thing I you know I took like 1600 milligrams so I personally didn't have any pain really but I don't want to give myself pain so I don't want to give myself pain to just see if I could remove the pain so I just documented how I felt so is that it it could get taken to effects up to ninety minutes I guess it depends so for me it took an effect anywhere from five to ten minutes that's how fast it's such an effect for me with the light breakfast a couple hours before so it's like two hours before I had breakfast and then I took this and then I did feel something I hated I hated this syringe I really hated this this tastes disgusting I'm still have it in my mouth like the flavor it's like an earthy and earthy licorice I hate licorice I really hate it I'll never get that syringe again but um thousand oh but I do like the gummies even though it melted I really did enjoy it and that was it it's been an hour and a half and it said it should last for eight hours after this I guess I don't know I feel okay you know I'm still here I've been taking that much I'll you know like I thought I was taking too much I was scared if you see before but I'm better now so guys I survived 1,600 mgs of CBD edibles and I feel ok I feel good after an hour and a half I go back to normal I guess towards the hour mark I started to feel normal so let's say five minutes I started to feel something then 10 minutes hit me from 10 minutes to 30 minutes or so maybe 40 I was just like in like this height of the moment and then like after the hour mark I started winding down from feeling a certain way and then an hour and a half I'm back to where I was before and it's supposed to be still in effect so like I said if I had any pain I guess I could give me more like information but I don't so I guess if I have pain I pray I don't but if I ever do I will try this to see how it manages the pain that's it I don't know if this was any help to you but if you enjoyed the video then please like and subscribe to me because you guys are awesome and I love everyone who subscribes you guys are awesome thank you so much thank you so much for watching I hope this is so interesting or if not just like I don't know just thank you thank you so much I'll see you next time bye [Music]", "QD1hKePzEXI": "- What happens when

candy perfection now these bouncy bytes have a surprising origin but it's one that's being challenged all the time like groundbreaking gummy geniuses we're gonna give you something to chew on right now and I'll connect its general knowledge we can go on and on about all the things about gummies that make a swoon it's no secret that people love bright colors and playful shapes and studies have shown that bite-sized foods actually lead to greater sense of fullness and satisfaction but if we're being honest it's the texture that makes gummy so appealing we humans love to chew and that's actually good for us too but you might be surprised to discover where gummies get this magic texture from pigskin technically it's a material called gelatin gelatin is a food ingredient that's made from the protein collagen and collagen is especially common in the connective tissues of mammals including their ligaments tendons and skin when gelatin is boiled it becomes a thick viscous liquid this is odorless tasteless and clear that makes it extremely easy to color flavor and sweeten when the hot mixture gelatin pigments flavors and sugars reaches a desired balance it is then poured into molds and allowed to cool and then I'll pop your gummies thanks to the gelatin the cooled gummy is now that perfect mixture of firm and soft some people feel concerned about an animal's role in making gelatin for gummies there are two ways to look at this if we are going to eat animals then we really should be using this much of the animal as possible now since gelatin makes use of parts of the animal that would normally go to waste this makes a reasonable argument in favor of candies like the gummy candy makers have also started creating gummies without gelatin using substances such as agar P starch and pectin as a gelatin substitute you can now buy and enjoy vegan gummies and the recipes are getting better and better all the time and exactly how do I know well right now thanks so much

video i am nervous and excited so if you're new here welcome i do all types of content cbd vlogs not as much recently and now apparently we do delta stuff here too and she's returning what's up hey how you doing welcome back so today we are going to try moonwalker delta 8 and we have both gummies and a cart so we have the gummies and in the blue dream berry and then we have the cartridge and the sour lemon haze so today's video is not sponsored i finally remember to say that at the beginning of the video but i was sent these items to try out for you guys so the gummies come with 25 and they're 25 milligrams each and then it has all the information the ingredients and the calories on the back and it also has the qr code to see their website and then the cartridge is in sour lemon haze and i believe it is one gram and then it also has all of the information on the back and the um cartridge says it's 800 milligrams of delta 8 thc both of these are 100 legal most u.s states don't quote me on that and then their website is just moonwalker and then it's moon wlkr.com if you want to order them um so it just came in a normal package i always have to tell you guys that in case you're scared of like somebody else seeing your package and wondering what it is but it came in a normal brown box they came together wrapped with bubble wrap and then the only other thing in the package is the receipt it also comes with the notice to law enforcement and then like the information and everything so you're good to go with that um guys i'm being so serious because i'm so nervous you guys know i prefer cbd delta 8 is literally like a once in a while thing for me but i'm glad to try it for you all right so the gummies are originally 49.99 but they're on sale on their website right now for 39.99 and like i said there's 25 in here of 25 milligram gummies and then the cartridge it's also originally 49.99 but it's on sale right now for 39.99 um i'm getting information from their website so i'm not sure um if these will be on itself for long so if you want them go ahead and grab them so we're going to start with the cartridge because i'm just going to test it and try it out because i am going to be doing both of these at the same time this is obviously going to take longer to kick in but i just want to taste the flavor and everything for you guys because the other delta eights that i've tried um so yeah the other delta eights i've tried have all been different flavors and i've never had sour lemon haze before so when you take out the package so it comes in this little really cool container it's like hard plastic and then it has the twisty top at the top to open it and i'm struggling opening this who knows why all right there we go and then when i open it i smell lemon so that's exciting it really does smell lemony all right and then it just has the rubber stopper at the bottom we are going straight into this video um no wasting any time today while i do smoke i'm going to let you guys know i finally signed up and opened up my patreon right now i'm working on i'm working on transferring a lot of my content over there and downloading and re-uploading and things like that um i did my patreon it's literally one tier um and it's three dollars a month because i told you guys i'm not here trying to finesse anyone to make any money so literally it's just one membership here so you can like have access to all of my content and on there you can have like chat rooms and i can talk with you guys and i can put like exclusive content so those things are going to be there and then also all of my future giveaways will be on patreon um just because it's obviously going to be the people that go hard for me that's where i want to do all my giveaways from now on all right so we're turned on and we're gonna i'm just gonna do very very little of this like three seconds y'all wait so the first time i did the georgia hemp delta 8. it was so harsh and hard on me like my throat's tickling a little bit right now but it's not that bad this is super super smooth and this pen is like hella janky i need to buy a new one if you can see it's like literally tilted right here but this pen is janky so that might have something to do with that as well but this is super smooth and it doesn't taste bad this literally tastes lemony and i love lemon flavored stuff like i love lemon tea lemon cake all that stuff so this tastes really good i'm just going to do a little bit more for the sake of the video and we're going to put her away so a little bit about the cartridge itself i'm going to read off the website so you guys don't have to go look for this information everything is plant derived and the flavor is natural flavor it's not cut with any cut or diluted with any extra oils vg pg pe g vitamin e mct or any other cutting agent and then um the cart itself is made of quality grade stainless steel and such things like that so you don't have to worry about any crazy toxic metals but let's do one more that was very little i'm honestly very surprised because i'm a big baby okay that one was better i'm a big baby when it comes to thc it's not my favorite thing to do so um i'm just not a big fan of being high but also see there we go also the tip of the cart is like so my hands are so dry also this part of the car is so cool it's not like a typical how it usually looks when you draw it and also the oil is very very clear what you like to see with delta eight and honestly i'm gonna do this video like the rest of it vlog style just because i'm obviously not gonna be able to sit down and talk to you guys for much longer i'm a light weight when it comes to thc so i'm trying to get through this part as quick as possible and as you can see i'm just in my comfy clothes i got this huge hoodie from marshalls we love her i've been wearing it for like three days i've already washed it once and then i'm gonna try this i need my trusty tweezers again so this is also the flavors are plant derived and everything and looking at all the ingredients it's like stuff that would just be in regular candy plus the thc um hopefully they stay good and i am looking at it and it says we recommend starting with one gummy and waiting 45 minutes before taking more i was gonna do two but since i did the cart already i'm going to just take one start with one and then i'll come back in a little while and update you guys like i usually do because we love vlog style videos um and then it also says they recommend refrigerating your gummies after opening and not storing them in a human environment as they may mesh together it's pretty cold in my apartment so it should be okay um so i showed you the box but this is what the bottle looks like it literally it literally just looks like a gummy vitamin bottle it has the information on there and then it also has it also has nutrition facts on the back so it has all that information for you and this is what one gummy looks like it's just a beautiful cube covered in sugar i'm low-key high key nervous so it doesn't smell like anything it literally just smells like those um airhead straws that's what it smells like hopefully it doesn't taste bad it tastes like a gummy vitamin you cannot taste any like weed flavor at all or thc flavor at all this could be dangerous because it just tastes like candy okay we did a little bit of the cart i ate one gummy i will most likely come back and eat two or eat another one i'm sorry i'm talking like this my mouth is salivating so yeah i did all my chores this morning i did my work on the computer this morning i don't have like work work today so we're gucci it's friday i'm probably gonna order some food later when i get the munchies and let me show you guys the time because this is an all day video it's it's kind of bright but it's one all right to turn the brightness down but it's 135 right now yeah it's 1 35 right now i'm watching some youtube you know getting all my vlogmas out the way um i'm going to turn you guys off we're going to come back around 2 30. i'm gonna make my room super cozy probably close the window a little bit and just hang out be on my phone watch youtube and we'll come back we'll see if we need another gummy and let's see hi mckenzie once again but yes i will be back to see if this kicks in okay guys as you can see my room is a little darker a little more vibey now it is it is 2 19. it's a little blurry so it's been about an hour and let me tell you guys i'm gone um i don't think i'm gonna have to take the second gummy i am glued to my bed right now i feel like i'm laying on a i feel like i'm on a boat in the middle of the sea and i'm just melted to the bed i'm extremely hungry and i keep scrolling on ubereats like it's social media and i'm just okay yeah and i'm just i'm so hungry but i want to wait a little later to order food and i'm currently eating these multigrain i'm eating these multigrain crackers from trader joe's and i'm starving i want to bake some cookies but i don't want to get up so maybe that'll be later but i'm just checking in it's hour one we'll see how i see we'll see how i feel in the next hour to see if we need to take another gummy knot but for now i look bald but for now we're chilling watching vlogmases and i'll catch up in one more hour okay my dudes it's even okay my dudes it's even more later i have sunk in more into my bed and yeah so if you guys can see it's 3 24 you could see it for like a second and i spent another hour finally got hungry enough i ordered brisket off of ubereats from some restaurant around here i'll put it up on the screen if i remember and i'm just going to keep hanging out i'm not going to take another gummy um i have stuff to do tomorrow so i don't want to be gone for the rest of the night even though it's the middle of the day but i'm just like i can't speak that's me i i literally don't know what i'm talking about so i'll see you guys either in the outro or another update when i get my food so i can't wait i'm so angry okay my dude so this is what i got it's just fries brisket piece of bread and corn back there along with some banana pudding so yeah i'm gonna go eat and i'll come back and i'll throw you guys out [Music]", "z_Kugrnbiao": "hello everyone and welcome to week's the review show where we review marijuana edibles and help you make sense of your dispensary you guys might be wondering why I've got this Nutella in front of me and that is not because I've switched over to reviewing non marijuana edibles that's just because I'm taking this as a vessel for fat because I'm looking at another gummy today I'm looking at the cushy punch TKO 200 milligram lime flavored gummy edible I don't know if you can see it that package is a little shiny so it might not show up on the camera there on the back we've got some nutrition information oh and guys real quick as well this is one of our week's minis where instead of our customary 30 60 and 120 minutes I just come out to you the initial time and after 2 hours to let you know how we're feeling so first things first when it comes to gummies I always like to have a little fat first and I like to have a little fat I like to have a little Intelli so I'm just gonna take a nice little lick I wish delicious Nutella yum yum and now that I've got some fats in my body I feel more comfortable with taking this and this is a surprisingly potent edible this is so small and they proclaim it's 200 milligrams I've never been a fan of gummy edibles I don't think they've ever been as effective oops but I do think they are more effective when you are when they are consumed with us so here we go here is what the edible the looks like right there we'll try to open this up oh wow it is very plain-looking it is just like a green shot of jello smells a lot like marijuana smells a hell of a lot like weed probably even opening this up you'd get caught because it smells so much like weed a little difficult to get out and there we have it for tiny little squares and apparently this is 200 milligrams THC I say we shall see here we go down the hatch all at once oh oh that is bad oh it tastes they say lime it tastes just like marijuana except in a gummy version and that flavor is sticking around oh that is vile yeah let me do a little bit more fats Thank You mysterious camera person mm okay that's better you get that nasty taste in my mouth I hope it's going to be worth the anguish because this is a 200 milligram edible they say it's won some kind of award and the bud tender recommended it very highly and for something so small it was quite expensive at ten dollars so I mean I've got high hopes even though it isn't gumming I will check back with you guys in two hours to let you know if those high hopes are validated or not thank you so much for watching we'll see you soon it's been a bit of 90 minutes welcome back to wheats I know I said I'd check back in about two hours but it's only been about 90 minutes and the reason I'm here early is because the experience sort of already peaked and is fading I'm actually kind of already pretty much done sober which is unfortunate men what a colossal disappointment the cushy punch TKO is it's expensive it tastes like [ __ ] and it doesn't get you high at all that is three strikes and you are out uh cushy punch TK arrow more like a big cushy punch TK no thank you hard pass woof-woof-woof if you see the sound of dispensary near you just a boy and I'll cost grab anything else this is gonna do nothing for you except thin your wallet well that's thank you so much for watching wheats sorry that we had a disappointment on this review but hopefully we've got better product around the corner thank you so much for watching okay catch you guys next time", "hOfaW5pjKaw": "Guess what we're doing today! Today we are going to make...\nSome super easy gummy Strawberry Valentine Dog Treats! Look at all the dogs in here. We're ready to make some treats. This is actually a really simple easy recipe. There's like three (3) ingredients and that's it . We're gonna show you guys\nhow to make these real quick. if you want to see some more\nValentine's treat videos, there will be a link up in the cards\nand down in the video description below. If you are new, don't forget to hit that 'Subscribe' button.\nClick that Bell to turn on notifications, so that you can be notified whenever\nwe put up amazing new videos. Let's make some treats! You're waiting patiently aren't you? Shelby's like, \"I'm being very patient!\"\n\"Can we just get on with it?\" So the first thing we're gonna want to do is\ntake about a cup, of chopped up strawberries. But first, we'll see if everybody will eat one. How about strawberry, no dip?  Oh, man! Oh!  She ate it! She actually ate it!\nShe didn't spit it out! Strawberry, no dip?\nI know you'll eat it with no dip. How about you?\nStrawberry, no dip? What was that? Oh!  You just wanna lick It?\nWait a minute... We've been here before, haven't we?\nYou liked strawberries! You... Weren't sure about strawberry. You can eat it. You really...\nNo!  This is for Oakley! You can eat it, here!\nHere, try it!  There you go! Or take it in the other room.\nThat's fine too, as long as you eat it! Anyway, we are gonna take one (1) cup of strawberries\nchopped up, and I know this seems silly. We're gonna take it, pour it into this\none (1) measuring cup and then, we are going to fill this measuring cup,\nup with water. We're gonna do that real quick. Now we have our strawberries, in our water. We filled it to the one (1) cup line. Basically what we're doing right now is,\nwe are going to make strawberry juice. It's pretty much what we're doing. We're gonna take the strawberries,\nwith the water in this one (1) cup. We're gonna pour them into this\n'Nutri-Bullet' and turn it into... Like I said, pretty much strawberry juice. (blender sounds) So now we pretty much have...\nStrawberry juice. The dogs are like, \"Wait!  What is this?\"\n\"Can we drink it?\" Kind of, you're kind of gonna drink it.\nKind of! The next thing we were going to do is,\nwe are going to take half (1/2) a cup of water. We are going to heat it on the stove\nand we are going to pour in, all four (4) of these packets\nof plain unflavored gelatin. We're going to whisk it together\nuntil this is all dissolved. That's what we're gonna do now! Alright!  The gelatin is in the water now. We are just going to continuously whisk this... Until it is all dissolved! Now once, it's all nice and dissolved.\nIt's kind of gonna look like this. We're gonna take that strawberry juice we made,\nwe're gonna pour this in, whisk it together and\nremove it from the heat. Now to make it a little easier to pour,\nwe have poured it back into our one cup mixture and now we are going to pour this,\ninto our silicone heart tray. We're gonna fill each\nof these, about halfway. What do you think?\nThings can turn out amazing? They're like, \"We're all really patient!\"\n\"We want to know what this is gonna do? So, we're gonna go ahead and take this and try not to make a giant mess. Oh!  I already made a giant mess! I should probably set\nthe camera down while I do this... And now our silicone tray is full. We are going to take this and we are going\nto put it in the refrigerator for... I would say at least three (3) hours.\nEasiest if you just do it overnight. I'm actually doing it overnight.\nBut I would say three (3) to four (4) hours, before they will actually be firm enough\nthat you can remove them, from the silicone mold. Which means you gotta\nhave some patience, honey! You and the rest of the girls\ngot to have some patience! While we're waiting for those...\nLet us know down in the comments below, what do you guys want to see us, make next? Suggest some treat videos for us to make,\ndown in the comments below. You'll never know, but we just might make\none of your suggestions next! Alright!  So we left them in,\novernight and they are done! They're pretty cool.\nSo these are the strawberry ones, but as you guys saw the video last night,\nI was reminded that we have a few dogs that don't necessarily like strawberry\nwithout something else in it, so I also made some plain ones with\njust a little bit of chicken broth in them. I'm going to show you guys more recipes\non different types of gummies you can do as well. I figured, I better have these (plain) just in case,\nthey really don't want to eat these (strawberry). But, they turned out nice and jiggly. Jiggly! I know you want to try it so bad.\nThey're nice, jiggly and very firm. They smell good! For those of you that are gonna ask,\nif you can eat these as well? Yeah!  If you want to eat them, you can eat them.\nThey're basically 'Jell-o Jigglers'. They don't have any real sugar in them.\nThey just have the natural sugar from the fruit in them. The girls are gonna go ahead and\ngive them a try and see, what they think. Are you girls ready?\nEverybody's ready to see what they think? Alright, let's do it! Sit! So first, we are going\nto give Memphis one of the... Ah!  Wait!\nOne of the strawberry ones. I think she's just gonna...\nThat's exactly what I thought, you were gonna do! Sit! She's like, \"These are great!\"\n\"I will eat them all!\" Can you speak?  Speak! That's a stomp!  Speak!\n(growls) That was really close!  Speak!\n(barks) Yeah!  Good girl! Okay, now you get one of the chicken broth ones.\nCould you eat it a little slower? Yeah, like that.\nNibble, nibble, nibble... Yeah!  Little nibbles. Good stuff!  Was it good?\nWas it good stuff? Alright!  I think Memphis says,\n\"They're a win!\" Alright! Will she eat the strawberry one? You don't want it?\nWant the strawberry one? Maybe? Okay, I'm gonna let it go.\nYou're not gonna spit it out this time. You're gonna eat it?

I want that one instead!\" (laughter) Yeah, how do they know?\nThat one was better, wasn't it? Hi!  Say hi to the camera!\nThat one was way better, wasn't it? She's like, \"That one was way better.\"\n\"This one...  I'm not so sure!\" You can eat it. It's really edible.\nIt's just strawberry. No?  You don't want that one? She's like, \"I want it, but...\" \"I don't really like strawberries without dip!\" Look at her attempt like,\n\"I could eat this...\" \"But how about, no?\" Alright, let's see if Oakley\nwill eat the strawberry one. Alright, It's Miss Oakley's turn.\nThat's a strawberry one. You're gonna eat that one? Even though it's strawberry? Maybe...  Nah! She's like, \"I don't know...\"\n(chuckles) \"I really want to eat it because,\"\n\"everybody else ate it!\" \"But, I'm not really sure if I should eat it\"\n\"because it's kind of a weird tasting!\" Here, let me get you the other one.\nWanna try the other one? Try this one... She's like, \"Oh!  That's better!\"\n\"That's more like chicken.\" Oh yeah! \nShe's like, \"I can eat this one!\" \"I'll eat this gummy right up!\" \"Maybe I'll try this one again... Nope!\" Yeah!  You're like \"The other one's better, too!\"\nHuh?  Yeah! I should remember, that you guys aren't\na huge fan of strawberry.

So big thanks to Simple Health\nfor their continued support and for sponsoring this video. Now, today, I'm gonna be making a recipe from The Vulgar Chef and it is for ranch-flavored gummy bears. Ranch-flavored gummy bears. Let that sink in for a minute. Ranch, you know, that white saucy stuff that everyone loves to dip their crudites or\ntheir carrot sticks in. That stuff. I'm talking about that stuff. And I'm talking about gummy bears and making a savory\nversion of gummy bears. Sounds interesting, right? Because I've never had a savory version of a gummy bear ever, and I've always wanted to make gummy bears way, way, way, way, way back, back when homemade\ngummy bears was a thing, I think that's probably about\nsix or seven years ago, now. I remember when the King\nof Random made gummy Legos. And I said, yes. Step back a little bit. Actually, a few years ago, I did make homemade Sour Patch Kids, which is kind of like a gummy, but I've never used a gummy\nbear mold or anything. So, of course I had to get\nmy mitts on a gummy mold and I picked up this one right here. So I was thinking, I might need a little bit of insurance for this particular recipe. 'Cause what if these gummy\nsnacks don't taste good? I mean, I've made plenty of\nthings that don't taste good, but here's another ranch-themed snack that I've always wanted\nto make, but never did. So, we'll just put it all together. We'll make it a two-for-one video today. So, let me..... The rest -- other.... (tape rewinding) The other recipe I wanna\nmake comes out of this book. It's from the Backs.... \"Back of the Box Gourmet\". I've made other recipes from this, but these are all recipes\nthat are on the back of boxes of famous things, like mock apple pie, which I've made by the way, I will put the link down below. What other things? No-bake chocolate cheesecake, which was on the back of the Hershey semi-sweet chocolate chips. Lipton onion burger sandwich on the back of the Lipton soup thingies. This is the Hidden Valley\nRanch oyster crackers. So while my gummy bears are setting up, I'm gonna make a batch of crackers too, because I think those are\ngonna be stinking delicious. So if these don't turn out,\nat least I'll have crackers. Okay, let's make the gummy snacks first. So the first thing we need\nto do is bloom our gelatin. Basically blooming means\nto rehydrate the gelatin. I'm using two packets of Knox\nunflavored plain gelatin. So we're just gonna take one\nthird of a cup of milk -- the Vulgar Chef uses a dry measuring cup, so that's what I'm gonna use -- two packets of gelatin; and sprinkle that right over the top. One, two. Kind of a cool thing happens\nwhen we have gelatin blooming. It kind of gets all\nwrinkly and shriveled up and it looks kind of, brain-like. Kind of like the surface of\nlike brain coral or something. It's kind of great. So this is gonna take about five minutes. So I'm gonna let it to do its thing and I'll be right back. So out of convenience, I'm using my little\nItaki Shabuki pot here. You could definitely use a sauce pan and do this right over\nthe stove, easy peasy. Or even in a microwave safe\ndish and just nuke this. Alrighty. So while we're waiting for the\ngelatin to bloom in the milk, why don't we prep our crackers? You're going to need\na bag oyster crackers. Now these are just like\nsaltines or a plain cracker seasoned with a bit of\nsalt and they're delicious. And, actually, I think, pretty\nessential to clam chowder. So you can find them\neverywhere here in New England, not surprisingly. So we're gonna need one\nbag of oyster crackers. The recipe calls for a 12 or 16 ounce bag. I have a nine ounce bag. So I'm gonna scale back the\nrecipe just a little bit. I have noticed just the other\nday we bought graham crackers for S'mores and my crackers\nwere significantly smaller. Have you noticed this? I'm not a huge graham cracker eater, but I noticed that when I\nsnapped the crackers in half, they didn't make squares,\nthey were rectangles. I remember taking graham crackers -- if you follow me on Instagram, you know I already talked about this in my story. I apologize for being redundant, but I really feel like\nthis needs to be shared. So the box looks the same\nin terms of packaging size, but when you open it, there is a gap between\nthe stack of crackers and the side walls of the box. So the crackers are significantly smaller. And my theory is that they\nkeep the prices the same, but you're getting fewer,\nless amount of cracker. I don't know. I've also noticed this on\nAnimal Crackers as well. They're smaller. I know that I've grown since I was, you know, five, when I was\neating animal crackers, but they're definitely\nsmaller than they used to be. Okay. So I think that's what's happening here with the oyster crackers. This book was written several years ago, back when oyster crackers\nwere in 12 or 16 ounce bags rather than nine ounce. Okay, enough of that. Dump 'em in. Two thirds of a cup of oil. Okay. Oil. We're gonna add one package of Hidden Valley Ranch\nseasoning, dump that in. Did you know the third\ningredient listed on Hidden Valley Ranch is monosodium\nglutamate known as MSG, which makes everything\ntaste more delicious? The more, you know. Deliciousness. That's why it's so\ndelicious, I'm telling you. MSG. I am not a huge consumer\nof ranch dressing, but when it's around, I like it. Quarter teaspoon, lemon pepper. Dill. Always reminds me of pickles. Dill. Half teaspoon of dill weed. I like how they call it dill weed. Boomp. Garlic powder. Boom, boom. Gonna mix-y mix-y that all up. Now, we're gonna pour\nall this deliciousness right on top of these. Oh boy. Get all of that in there. Now we're gonna toss to coat. This is like a bath. It's actually kind of\npooling at the bottom here. Okay, I'm going to have one straight up 'cause I can't handle this. Oh yeah. They're gonna be good. Yum yum, yeah. Hey, come back here. Okay. Get all of that in there. You will not escape. Now it says to bake these in a warm oven. Which I guess it's probably\nless than 200 degrees? 200 degrees? Guess whatever is the lowest\ntemperature on your oven. I'm gonna be using my\nhandy dandy toaster oven. Put them in a single layer. (crackers tapping) Spread that around. Now, place these in a warm\noven for 15 to 20 minutes. \u266a Do do, do do \u266a Our gelatin is pretty much all firmed up. There's still some dry gelatin on top. I'm gonna use this and\nkind of stir this up to get all that gelatin\nin contact with the water. I'm gonna close my window now because there's a neighbor vacuuming and it's kind of annoying. Can't go that way. Oh, I'm smellin' crackers. (whistles) Check on your crackers\n'cause they're gonna toast like lickety-splitness. Whenever you smell anything\ntoastin' it's probably toastin'. So, those look amazing. So I went ahead and\nturned off my toaster oven because it was getting\na little bit too frisky. Now we're going to make the gummy bears. Heat this up. Oop, see, it's already beginning to melt. And we want to heat this fully, so that all the gelatin melts entirely. It's happening quickly. Nice. Let me go in with my silicone scraper. Try to work out any lumpage here. Technical term, lumpage. Now we're going to add one\npacket of ranch dressing. Okay. That's looking a lot like ranch. Use some vegetable oil\nand give it a little bit of oil in here. My little gummy maker\ncame with this eyedropper. I'm gonna use that to\nsuck some of this up. Nice. Eyedropper of ranch gelatin. So we get some bears in there. Don't forget the lions. Let's get some monkeys too. Let's make some penguins too. Boo boo, boo boo boop. And let us not forget the gummy worm. So one batch of that\nmixture is enough to make one tray of gummies. I'm going to place this\nin the refrigerator. So let's snack on our\nwarm crackers, shall we? Look, those look beautiful. Hidden Valley Ranch oyster crackers. Itadakimasu! Pretty tasty. Mhmm. They could be a ranchy-er though. Honestly. The addition of the oil\nmakes them extra crispy. They're kind of light and airy and fluffy without tasting greasy or feeling greasy. So the recipe measurements include kind of a range of measurements. So I erred on the side\nof the lesser amounts because my bag of crackers was smaller. I would say if you make this, go full on and do the large amounts, even for the nine ounce bag of crackers. 'Cause I think these could\nuse even more seasoning. They're pretty good. In fact, I'm going to add some\nleftover ranchy powder and put that right on top. Now we have a more intense\nbuttermilk ranch flavor to them. (cracker crunching) Mm-hm. And it kind of coats your fingers, so you get that kind of\nCheeto, Dorito, experience 'cause you know, you\nget the powdery stuff. Yeah. That's what you do, people. Okay, delicious. How many have I eaten now? Like 20? Okay, girl needs to stop. It has been over an hour now since I put the gummies\nin the refrigerator and they should now be set. Let's go grab 'em. (Emmy vocalizes) Oh yes. Oh yes. Look at this. Silicone molds, man. I'm just gonna push them out. Boom. So easy and so satisfying\nand look at the detail. Oh, you gotta see this. Boom. Boom. Boom. And look how detailed. Oh my gosh. The monkeys are so cute. Boop. Yep, penguin's cute. Oh yeah, look at the gummy worm. (Emmy imitates spring boinging) Ranch-flavored homemade gummies. Itadakimasu! Mm. Wow. Those are strong. They have kind of a different\ntexture than gummies, though. They're bouncy. And I don't taste any\nof the gelatin, though. That's a bit of an aside, but, they are full of ranch flavor. They're actually very intensely\nflavored, pretty salty. Nice kind of buttermilk tang to them. The texture is a little bit different than a regular gummy bear too. They're not quite as soft. They're bouncy and chewy, but they don't have that\nkind of slightly tenderness and like, elasticity. I think that's what's really missing. There's not kind of a stretch. There's a bounce like\na rubber band bounce, but there's not this kind of nice little bouncy stretch to them. It's more just like ning, ning, ning, ning rather than that, heh. I've read in another recipe that sorbitol is what they put in regular\ngummy bears to give them that chewy softness. I think that's probably what these need. So final thoughts, are these good? They're fine. If you are a total ranch\nnut, you will love these, because they just taste\nlike ranch dressing. But they're in the shape\nof, of gummy animals. I think it's something\nabout that combination of gummy texture and that\nchallenge to your expectations of what gummies should be that makes this kind of\nan unpleasant experience. It's not disgusting. It's just terribly unexpected. Alrighty. So they have it. Ranch-flavored gummies and\nranch-flavored oyster crackers. Thanks so much for joining me.

(light bouncy music) Superhero power!", "Nz3FOoMJAYw": "hey there today i am bringing you a product review and ketone test which has been highly requested but i just haven't been in ketosis to be able to test it so i am going to go ahead and test my ketones now and see where i'm currently at fingers crossed finally it has been so long since i've been in ketosis so the product that i'm going to test and review is project seven so um these are the sour ones i'm also going to try the regular ones let me go over the nutrition of the [Music] the sour ones for one container it's a hundred calories zero grams of fat 39 total carbs 19 dietary fiber zero grams of protein so it does have allulose as the second ingredient so it calculates the net carbs here it says eight net carbs for the bag which is high so the ingredients are soluble corn fiber allulose cane sugar citric acid pectin lactic acid natural flavors rice flour fumeric acid sodium citrate vegetable and fruit juice for color turmeric for color and stevia let me get the other bag okay so this one is actually six net carbs these are just the plain gummy bears no sourness to it uh one bag is a hundred calories one gram of fat 36 total carbs 18 dietary fiber three grams of sugar and three grams of protein that's weird the ingredients are soluble corn fiber allulose gelatin oh it has gelatin in it gelatin pectin cane sugar citric acid malic acid natural flavors vegetable and fruit juice for color sunflower oil carnauba wax turmeric for color stevia and spirulina for color so i'll try this one first just because the sour's probably going to be more prominent so this is the yellow one hmm i don't know if that was a pineapple or something but it does have a nice flavor to it the texture is a little bit different than um regular gummy bears it's a little bit harder it's still chewy don't get me wrong but it's not like that gummy you know it's not like you really have to chew into it your teeth do kind of sink into it slowly so the texture is a little bit different than regular gummies like you can't you can't pull it you know oh that's orange that's a nice flavor i think that's because of the pectin i think that's because of the pectin um your teeth kind of sink into it they're nice though they do have a nice gummy texture to it just not quite the same texture as a regular gummy bear it's a red one the flavor is really nice it's not overpowering but it's definitely a nice little flavor it's not overly sweet too i was kind of thinking because of the um cane sugar that's in it it would be like kind of hit you in the face kind of like regular candy but it's not overly sweet it's almost like a light fruity light sweetness let me try the sour now so it's kind of lightly brushed with citric acid yeah so it's not overly sour [Applause] that's definitely sour it's not too much though sometimes when things are too sour like hurts my gland back here it's not just a little sour i would say that the sourness kind of covers up the fruity flavor though so you can't taste the fruitiness it's still there but since it was so light in the first place it's um not as prominent because the sour is more prominent the texture is exactly the same as the regular gummy bears but um it has just like that little grit to it from the citric acid from the citric acid on the outside um i like it though but i like sour so if you like sour you might or if you don't like sour you might not like this i think i'm going to finish the bag for the regular gummies because this one we might have a better chance of it not lowering my ketones so because this one um cane sugar is a little bit lower down and it's lower in carbs so i'm going to finish having this bag of the regular gummies and i'll test my ketones in an hour okay so it's been an hour since i last or so it's been an hour since i had those gummy bears so i'm gonna test my ketones now i've changed i've been uh sanding the uh cabinets outside okay so that's a bummer i was hopeful i was kind of feeling it i was feeling lethargic so i can't say i'm too surprised i'm just disappointed if you know of a good uh keto gummy let me know and i will test it in an upcoming video but that's all for this one i'll see in the next one guys [Music] you", "K3jYmHtFVoQ": "today we read it we got a weird article yeah contacted me running with

back to this episode of snack razors today is a very sour day we are going to be tasting several different sour flavored gummies that's a tongue twister yup several different sour flavored gummies and they're all easter themed too so yeah we have warheads chewy bunnies which i'm not excited about there are three flavors of that we'll go over the flavors later yep then we have a sour than sweet sour patch kids bunnies and there are several different flavors of that we have trolleys sour bright gummy bunnies which there's several different flavors of that too yep and then we have green i can't do that why are you knocking i'm sorry i broke it so we got scooby-doo sour straws so and there's several different flavors in here too so yep assorted fruit flavors it's all says so the name the names of the flavors are on the little because they come individually wrapped so that each one has a flavor name on there yep so i kind of want to save these for laughs like scooby-doo okay so like whatever you say man [Laughter] so you want to do trolleys first uh yeah we're always disappointed by them because they don't have all the flavors yeah no so let's let's see what flavors they actually have in this one package yep and then if they don't have some of the flavors well then we're crap out of luck and so are you guys because all the easter stuff at our dollar store now is pretty much gone so we would have to order these on amazon to be able to test out the rest and even then it's still a guess on whether or not we're actually going to get the flavors because you know they don't count how many they actually put in so the flavors we have for the trolley sour bite gummy bunnies is we have lemon strawberry cherry lime orange and for some reason the blue is grape doesn't make any sense they could have still made it purple but i guess they're trying to get bright colors and the calories for these uh nine the serving size is nine pieces and it's 100 calories per serving it's 270 per container yes so no was this little is this an activity says color in the bunny's ears and glasses coloring in i guess rainbow i guess oh yeah yeah did you see that it's a blank rabbit there and i guess they want you to color it in rainbow like that that's that's weird i've never seen that before so i'm gonna see what flavors they have in here real quick see they have lemon i believe they have strawberry because the strawberry and cherry kind of look the same but one slightly lighter than the other yeah yeah they have lime they have two orange so that's good and they have grapes which could have just been blue raspberry sour raspberry so they have all the flavors at least yes at least they have all the flavors so the first ones that we're going to try is the lemon ones because i'm pretty sure the lemon the cherry and the lime are going to be the most sour ones yep so uh i really got a paper cut just now on that cardboard cute yeah let me just open this real quick yep i'm good oh wow the fruity aroma is crazy with that yeah it definitely smells like processed sugar and fruit that's for sure so when i say lemon so we're going to order the flavors that is listed so the first one is lemon so we're going to try that real quick and they're cute this one looks like it had his face punched in like someone ripped out the nose and took the bone with it like all right so we'll try that in three two one not too sour no that's actually enjoyable you you have a slight little pucker but it's not you know anything like it's not crazy yeah so let me see if i could differentiate the strawberry from the cherry here it looks like i'm able to yeah okay all right so now we have two strawberry these ones have the nose fully there for some reason i'm getting random sour yeah random about the sour on like random parts of my tongue and it's making me twitch every single time i have one in the back like towards the back of my throat i have one up on the top of my jaw i have one on the left back side of my tongue and on the right front side of my tongue wow everywhere all right anyway so we got strawberry here yep i like strawberry all right there's a good flavor uh profile yeah it's not sour no that one wasn't sour at all now this is cherry which i assume is gonna be sour just because it's cherry cherries bitter so bitter and sour or pretty similar in terms of reaction so for some reason yeah yeah it's actually really light well has a bit of a sour cake afterwards but all right so now we got lime i didn't think that one was too bad no none of them are really sour no no these i actually don't mind so we got lime which could have just been green apple come on now yep that kind of tastes like the way incense smells that was weird yeah and it does pack a little bit of a sour punch a little bit now i didn't get much on mine but i tasted more out of that one than the others oh okay this one we have exactly two orange so that's good yup so we'll try that and see how this one actually has a face on it the face isn't punched in or or randomly rounded i can see the eyes and the nose and the little cheek things anyway oh that one's a little sour mm-hmm orange gummies are always going to be my favorite no matter what i say that so much but yep it's a fact my guy my grape yeah and now this this this is grape everybody grape hmm you know it's kind of kind of messes with your head a little bit it's a nice flavored grape it is a nice flavor grape but it messes with your head because normally you would see grape as purple and you know from eating a purple item that is grape no matter what like it is always grape unless you have like some exotic thing like like eggplant or something like that it's always great but then you make look at that blue yeah it's like you look at it and you're thinking it's gonna be raspberry yeah but you get grape it kind of messes with your brain a little bit yeah it did mess with mine too yeah yeah all right so the next one we're gonna try is sour patch the sour patch kids and we're gonna see how they'll see if there's a few flavors in this one too i don't think they yeah they don't list all this one well let's go by what the colors are supposedly and we'll try to figure out the flavors and the serving size is 12 pieces and it's 110 calories for 12 pieces yup or if you eat the whole box it's 320. yep so here we go and guys if i seem a little bit off from tasting these candies because i ate crabs on the m ms before doing any of these and i shouldn't add that with chocolate before doing this because it's kind of messing with me a little bit this is the red ones yeah they're little bunnies well see here's the thing if you remember what actual sour patch kids look like this is the bunny setting straight up but if you remember what a sour patch kit actually looks like it looks like that did you turn it upside down yes that's what i'm saying it looks like an actual sour patch kid that kind of messed with me a little bit i was like wait i thought they were supposed to be bunnies when i was handed it i was like but literally like from quick view it just looks like a regular sour patch kid but it's literally a rabbit upside down that's crazy because you see the guys yeah yeah exactly yeah that's more all right so this one i'm going to assume is strawberry or something like that strawberry or a cherry it's pink it's reddish pink yeah reddish pink let's do that again all right so these ones i know are going to be sour because these are always really potent i was just about all right let's go and now it's gone i'm not sure doesn't make me salivate like crazy i think that was strawberry orange orange once again my mind was messed up from the positioning oh that one was really sour oh i don't have more showed up neither do i well by the way if if you realize that we're wearing the same alphas we're trying to pile a bunch of videos into one day so we can get more done and have time to actually upload them instead of doing a video a day like we were right and then rushing to do it not making good content yeah i'm assuming green apple yeah i'm going to some green apple too i'm you ready to die mhm nice lime i don't like that flavor ah i think last one yellow which is lemon yeah i can't wait to get this over now we got warheads next i think it's gonna be even worse yeah yellow all right yellow bunny kid thing that one was horrible i need some water you want some water all right we'll be back in a sec guys okay we're back this is like this this the like one of the second times we've gone and gotten a drink in the middle of a video so i got my water so we can cleanse our pallets in between each sour candy i'm not even going to put a lid on that because i'm gonna be constantly picking it up so so this next one is the warheads chewy bunnies i'm not sure how many flavors they have for this one either it's basically like the sour patch so oh yeah good news guys too um we recently bought uh two plug-in chargers and two extra batteries so if it dies we don't have to wait about an hour to upload the video still oh only three flavors oh my god those things are huge they are what oh it felt like something was in there there's no yeah there is yeah it's green apple watermelon and blue raspberry so i already know the green apple and the blue raspberry are going to be really sour this watermelon might be sour too because it's a subtle flavor so they gotta enhance it smell smells nice sorry it does smell nice it smells it smells i smell the watermelon one above all of it so that means that one's going to be the strongest green yeah i guess green blue or pink green look at these these guys are real these things are really sticky too they're cute i like them these bunnies are really detailed i don't know if you guys can tell or not but there we go get a little bit of shadow on there so you guys can see it all right oh that was nothing warheads why you disappoint me i was expecting a big oh you know oh my gosh but they were so thick these are so thick that this you don't even taste the sourness these are some thick boys oh you you're just hit by a car all right all right now we're doing the blue raspberry i think that's what the next one was right yeah green apple blue raspberry yeah i don't know i'm looking at this for it but ready if you sit there and like suck on the outside you get i guess but i'm just getting some i'm used to that instant punch in the face yeah damn my mind mine was a test tube baby jesus look at it it got all kinds of messed up and then this one is what watermelon watermelon watermelon watermelon that one's got a really nice flavor that's a good watermelon well warheads the flavors are impressive but the sourness is disappointing for you to be known for shower candies i mean that's pretty that's that's kind of sad when sour patch kids out did you in sourness like you were the leading war you were like the leading sour candy and now sour patches got you by like a whole entire milestone this is only one thing though maybe they didn't want to like maybe crazy it you know i guess they should have though because it kind of ruins the brand a little bit well i don't know i like them though like i mean yeah they were good but if i'm not making that face then you shouldn't call yourself warheads you should be called soft heads or something anyway water yeah i mean i thought they were pretty good taste wise they had really nice like different you know different flavors yeah yeah it wasn't the same old same old no the flavor the flavors were pretty strong i'm just disappointed on how not sour they were and that's coming from a guy who hates sour did i read the i didn't read the calories i don't know so there are five pieces per serving three servings per per container and 110 calories per serving yes so and now before we forget it on these these are the scooby-doo ones that we're gonna be doing next and there are 30 calories per one pouch and i think there's only one gummy in each one i know oh it's a bunch of little gummies that's weird they're sour strawberries oh sour straws oh okay they're little sour bites yeah if you look if you look at the packaging you can see the little bites in there okay oh okay yeah so we'll try the blue raspberry they got blue raspberry i know they got where the flavors at where the flavors at i just seen them did you rip it off what did we just say earlier it's written on the package this is sour blue raspberry all right i like scooby-doo yeah i hope this doesn't destroy scooby-doo for me oh freaking the plastic was really staticky the smell is strong that's all that smells like bad raspberry though that's like kind of rancid smelling all right i'm only going to eat like two of these just because i don't i don't trust that they're really small they are they look like little ha ha fingers is easter right and they got the little rabbit pellets oh that's that's good oh they're hard and they're not even shower they're good they're like twizzlers a little bit like the texture twizzlers except a little bit harder than twizzlers they're not even sour they actually just taste sugar coated it tastes really good it's a light sugar it is i really like these yeah those aren't bad i have a weird boardwalk aftertaste but why are you dropping stuff [Music] okay so the next ones that we're going to try out are the sour strawberry so you guys let me show you these guys once again little tiny rabbit pellets so it looks like there's those looks like there's four flavors because i'm seeing we got oh watermelon i thought it was cherry so strawberry watermelon blue raspberry and green apple typical salad flavor just any sour candy really yeah scooby dooby doo these are the sour they're just strong and it takes a lot of power to eat them here we go good strawberry flavor at first still only slightly sweet huh i like these yeah they're not bad they're just like oops they're just like little bites like they're not even they're not sour whatsoever this is the kind of candy that you give the kids that you don't want to destroy with sourness i'm not saying they're gonna like it because a lot of kids like that really intense flavor but if i was skin i would love this yeah all right so now we got sour watermelon oh and we have a new sd card too so this one runs out of memory for us recording so much we could just plug in a new one yep ah come on these bags are really difficult they are i use my teeth man you want mine yeah i'll just take out of yours because it's being a pain i should have done that to begin with i mean honestly so sour watermelon yep not sour not sour fake watermelon taste very fake watermelon taste it's not bad but it's not good at the same time hot taste that one's perfumey after a little yeah that one's not my favorite yeah no all right um no on to the last one oh god that tastes like tastes like an avon product yeah yeah so now we got sour apple yeah sour green apple so let's try and open this ah i'm throwing it hey that one actually opened get off me how many do you normally eat you just get two okay yeah that's fine though all right so now we're trying the sour green apple oh that's an instant green apple taste right as soon as i put in my mouth i tasted it now is it going to stay that's the question no bad aftertaste no it's got a weird taste i don't really taste apple i mean i taste apple but after a while it kind of kind of turned into grape like a green grape after a little bit it tastes big it kind of tastes bad yeah it doesn't taste that great all right water stay hydrated folks yes all right so that wasn't too bad yeah yeah that wasn't too bad for the sour patch kids really knocked me out on my feet man yup and i was surprised with the warheads actually yeah so i love the flavor of those though yeah those were pretty good yeah i like how thick they were because i like thick gummies i like to be able to chew it instead of it being really tough like the ones we just tried were i don't like that i like gummies that are chewy something that you can actually sink your teeth into like a nice rare steak so all right so uh yeah if you guys uh like this video make sure you hit the like button so we know you liked it uh share this video out there share it to other channels that test food or whatever get our names out there and uh comment down below if you have tried any of these or if there's any other sour gummies that we didn't try that is at your local dollar tree that we didn't happen to get a hold of and uh once again um we'll see you in the next video and just be ready for one every day that's all i can really say have a good [Music] one", "Aa2NwPvyInc": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan HOF key operating officer of honey stick as well as Gold Line CBD and in today's tutorial episode we are gonna be calling it CBD gummies for dummies why not because we're insulting anybody's intelligence but because we are gonna break down in a very simple fashion of exactly what the differences are between the different types of gummies available in the market one of the most common questions that we get to our Gold Line customer support is what I hear things like full-spectrum isolate coated infused gummies what's the difference what effect does that have on me and our CBD there's all these gummies out there and no real explanation on what the difference is they cost different they have milligrams so this episode is gonna break down the main categories and differences for gummies what does that mean for your CBD in a very simple to understand fashion and how does that affect your buying of your CBD your supplements whatever so basically we have a few major categories for CBD now a lot of the products you'll see out here if you're familiar Gold Line you will see from our website some of them are not offered on the website but they are prevalent in the market so I think it's important to have them out here so we can have a full discussion even outside of the things that our company is currently offering so you're properly educated on CBD so let's jump into it right away what are the major differences between gummies were the most common questions that I get is what is the difference between isolate gummies and full-spectrum gummies and it's really simple it's what type of CBD DEET is being used isolate gummies are generally made from biomass and it is synthesized off of different hemp products and the CBD is processed and extrapolated until it becomes basically a hundred percent pure a beedi and it's in almost a crystallized form and it's really easy to calculate it's very easy to make different solutions for your gummies it's a very good effective way to know how many milligrams you're gonna get and to make sure that there is absolutely zero THC within your gummies so for people who might necessarily get drug tested or not want to roll the dice on having even any traces of THC within their gummies or their CBD products that they're taking I select gummies are gonna be the way to go so when you're buying CBDs and you're asking your manufacturer like us questions then you would ask whether they have isolates or their full spectrum now what is full spectrum full spectrum is basically gonna have traces of THC however it's still gonna be below the legal limit which is 0.3% for hemp according to the US farm bill now that 0.3% is even below 1% so it is extremely small portion of THC however some people don't want any instead of being processed over the the full spectrum is actually taken from you know basically the live plants so generally when I select gummies are very high in CBD full spectrum and broad spectrum you know made based gummies that use that type of CBD they will have other things like CBN CBG CBC and different spectrums within the CBD category to give you a very complete form of all the different type of CBDs so let's say that you know full spectrum is more like a multivitamin if we're comparing the two different types of CBDs so our CBD is just specific you are getting your CBD and that's that so some people prefer the full and the broad spectrum for that reason and other people prefer the isolates because they don't want to roll the dice they just want to know exactly what they're getting and you are still getting the good effects the supplemental effects of CBD we won't go into what the different effects are people using gummies for different conditions or whatnot or CBD that's on you guys to research I'm not dr. Gupta I can give you medical advice or supplemental health advice but the differences are is full spectrum and isolate based the next large difference is is where the gummies are infused or whether they are coated some people use these terms not properly because they think that if it's infused with CBD that it is just CBD is on there so there's two ways of getting CBD within the gummies you can either coat them or you can actually infuse them to where it's like I like to compare to donut so I mean who doesn't love donuts coated gummy is like a glazed doughnut sort of flavoring and stuff it's put on the top and that's how those gummies are made is that they're made and they are basically sprayed or soaked with the CBD solutions and they get absorbed into the gummy and they're on the outside to infuse gummies they're more like a jelly doughnut to where the solution is on the inside the oil is on the inside and they've been either injected or it's been formulated into the actual compound of manufacturing the gelatin or the building block of the gummies so that is another key difference and between that people say were some of pluses and minuses pluses and minuses are as generally the ones that are coded on the outside those are generally less expensive so they're more budget-friendly however the ones are injected are usually a little bit more consistent so if you're buying a jar of 1500 milligram coated gummies some gummies might be a little bit stronger than the other depending on how they record or if they're touching the edges of the jar and some of the CBD mighta came off and beyond the jar so you might have to take one two more of the coded gummies - whereas some of them might be a little bit stronger so they kind of average out but if you're looking for super consistency then you want the infused got me the jelly donut because that is basically an exact amount that they put into the gummy so now with these examples let's go into you know what different types of gummies there are so outside of the full spectrum and isolate gummies and the coated and infused gummies now you have gummies in the categories of even flavoring so here we have our CBD Gold Line let's take a look at this half of the product line right here so here is basically our offering of CBD Gold Line now these are actually all isolate based gummies so these will have absolutely no traces of THC they have they have basically a total amount of milligrams that you will get per jar and we recommend that you take two to three gummies per serving so we have different textures for gummies our first one here is going to be our sour gummy which is going to be like I said these ones are an isolate based so they're gonna be the zero TAC you're gonna go ahead and open it here so these are gonna be like sour flavored gummies and they are coated with our Goldline CBD solution very clean job of openness let's get close-ups here you get several different colors and these are gonna be more sour and taste you're also gonna have a little outside sugar coating for a little bit of a little bit of extra flavor let's go ahead and take one out and get a real nice close-up if you're into the sour taste not just kind of a plain fruity taste this will definitely be up your Avenue and also sometimes the sour taste can offset any taste within to come with the CBD oils so even when you're dealing with full spectrum gummies and things like that if you have a sour bass gummy it can offset any type of you say I don't like the taste of natural CBD oil there's CBD solutions then a sour gummy might be or a sugar-coated gummy might be a good alternative for you to offset some of that taste so you get a more pleasant experience of Wired having your CBD then you have your natural gummy which is basically plain fruity flavor a lot of companies just in making gummies that aren't CBD infused make very similar gummies that your the taste will be familiar from any of the Albanese gummies and things that you can get from the supermarket except they have the added CBD and these have been coated not infused and they use isolates they have zero THC every once a while different isolate gummies have different solutions every once in a while you might get some type of you might think it's sugar it's crystal but actually the CBD isolates come in the form of CBD crystals so every once awhile it might not be uncommon to see crystals on the gummies it might not have gotten fully absorbed into the gummy or that might be on the outside when the CBDs are a hundred percent pure that they're like isolates it's not uncommon to see some crystals I don't see any on this gummy so everything was good but these are generally big fruity flavored gummies so they're there Jim a little bit more fluffy they have the fruity taste these aren't gonna be the sour gummies so let's go ahead and put this back and move along so on Goldline CBD we generally sell the gummies in two sizes we have a 12 ounce and an 8 ounce and also some smaller assortments generally it's you know more value driven to buy more but we have all the way down to I think 10 or 20 pack that you can buy or even a 5 pack that you can purchase on the website just a sample the gummy to see if you like it and then once you're a go we do all kinds of bundles and you can go up to 12 ounce which contains I think about a hundred and twenty gummies so here we did a limited run for the holiday season these are of our holiday gummies on top of being the large fluffier gummies and being you know of holiday colors which is a red white and green over here these are actually uh flavored also so they're gonna have the different a little bit more added fruity flavor into them so it is a little bit more of a premium gummy than your standard base gummy bears that uh that are used so it's gonna be a little bit of an upgrade but you're not gonna get any of the sour taste so you know what a lot of people and a lot of companies even outside of ours will do is they'll use different types of flavored gummies as their base so you can kind of know what gummy bears from going to the supermarket that you like or what type of tools you like when you're selecting your ideal CBD gummy and I hope it's a gold line but in the event that it's not look for that too when you're on the hunt for buying your gummies let's go a little close-up of these guys so you can see we have the red green and white give me a thumbs up that you got a good focus and other gummies so there you see we have the nicest Ortman they're a little bit fluffier in texture and they also have the added flavor infusion so you're gonna have a very flavorful experience with these holiday gummies and they're still available on our website I think for the whole month of January we continued producing them and once that goes away we'll probably still offer these gummies but they're not going to be holiday oriented maybe some Valentine's Day gummies so now moving right along to our full spectrum gummies these use a high quality of full spectrum oil and on top of that they are actually infused so they are injected into the gummy so each time you get a gummy these that we have here available in four flavors you're gonna get a very consistent 10 milligrams of CBD in each gummy now we used to offer a 25 milligram full spectrum going but a lot of people especially when it comes to full spectrum you can actually taste the CBD oil so taste a little bit more like a medical gummy so there's different things that you have to do to the gummy to offset the taste some people are really into it like the Colorado and California style gummies and that's kind of what it tastes like and some people would rather just have you know a flavorful experience as well so what we did was we realized is that instead of offering a 25 milligram gummy let's kick it down to a 10 so some of the oil taste is not as prevalent and we also have poor flavor so we flavor and fuse the gummies on top of it so let's go ahead and get a close-up of what's available here so we have cherry flavor fruit punch and also strawberry and an orange citrus I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to lay each one of these out here on the table so you can see they're actually fruit shaped and the different flavor is actually indicated by the different color these are really nice gummy very high qualities of very high quality full spectrum oil and they are also quality infused so you have very consistent flavoring taste and CBD oil quantity in between each one of these gummies and again like I said you can get them available in the four different flavors yeah so like we said these will actually be below the point three legal limit for according to the the hemp farm bill passed in 2018 so these are in accordance with that however they might have little traces of THC within the legal hemp limits but they're there is that there is that so people who don't want to roll the dice to get you know drug tested and things like that then generally you want to stick with the isolate based product because there is zero THC in there whatsoever those could be within the legal limits see would be fine and it's still very very small almost non-traceable but we do have to put that out there for you guys then there's also gummies that we're developing that are almost like gushers to where there are very soft and heavily infused with flavor so it's kind of like they melt in your mouth and then they have the the the flavor follows up afterwards and rolls them so it's different from kind of a chewable gummy this is this is an extremely soft chew if we could even classify that but I would say it to a gusher and we have them infused I just want to go ahead and show these because some companies I've seen are doing it we're gonna start offering it but we have not yet so these are in the shape of bear but they're extremely soft very fluffy and almost melts I even feel bad putting them putting them out here but they are and they are actually they're full-spectrum and they're infused we have some of these samples are 25 milligrams all the way down to 10 but you can see that these are more than fusion style soft to customized gummies tour these these gummy bases are actually custom made to really melt so these ones are gonna be more like a gusher and generally you can tell from how fluffy and how soft they look and if you get a real good close-up there you can you can see the difference between that and even a fluffy standard gummy you know so again those would be full-spectrum and infused and then for those people who are looking for positive hemp benefits possibly a multivitamin I've also seen we don't currently offer them but hemp will extract gummy chews that you can see here these actually have hemp oil they're CBD content isn't really confirmed but it does have 20 milligrams of a hemp extract and it's also infused with like a multivitamin tour it has like your vaults a mitten or a vitamin b-complex and also your vitamin C's and different vitamin E so if you're just looking for like a nutritional supplement and don't necessarily want CBD we don't offer it but these are starting to get really popular within the hemp community and something you probably will come across most of these because they also have the multivitamin they're not going to be coated they're gonna be infused so they are gonna be very consistent to take on a daily basis you won't each one is gonna be very consistent to the other and again sometimes with the coated stuff some of them might be a little bit strong and others but generally averaged out pretty good so in summary I hope that today's

Gonna pop this over here. - Oh, gotta sneeze. - And then a finishing touch. (Devan sneezes) - Bless you. - Oh, thanks. - Now, it's time to roast it! Wow, so cool. - It sounds like you're\nmaking a fool of yourself. Just sounds like it. - What? Stick out your tongue. - Okay. - Guess it. What do you think it is? - Like a graham cracker or something. - So we're gonna feed this to you the way it's intended\nto be eated, you ready? - Eated? - All right, Devan, open up your mouth. Three, two, one, bite down. One more thing, open up your mouth. What is the original item that this is? - Goldfish? - How did you guess that? - Cause of the shape. - Yes, you got it. It's Goldfish S'mores. Ah, man, I can't believe you guessed it. Oh, yeah, these are... - These are not good. - These are rough. Three, two, one. - I remember these. I think I tried these. We're grabbing the bucket, bro. Are you good, no? (Collins mumbles) All right, onto the next one. What? All right, cool. I hope you feel better. All right, Collins, your eyes are closed. - My eyes are closed. - As they can see. This is the next item. All I can say is good luck, Collins. I'm very glad I'm not doing this one. I'm just gonna toss them in there. All right, here we go, Collins. Three, two, one. - Wait, wait, wait! First, let's do a 3 Second Like Challenge! I want to see if you can like\nthis video in three seconds. Ready, here we go. - [Both] Three, two, one, done. - All right. - Three, two, one. I missed some. - It's a little bit spiky, a little bit. - Any guesses so far? Dude, you dropped one. - Chocolate covered, I don't\nknow, scorpions or something? - What? Chocolate covered insects, bro. - No, god. - We've got crickets. We've got worms, bro. - It stuck to my tongue at one point. I was trying to get it off my tongue. - You sound like a goose. - That was horrible. I can't believe I have to\nhave another disgusting thing after I just ate bugs. These actually, if they weren't sour, I'd probably really enjoy them cause they're like Life Savers all much. - All much? - But I. Let's see how these taste. - All right, there we go. - One, two. - Oh, yeah, has it hit yet? Oh, there it is! - Number three is the charm. - Bro, are you good? Wait, did they get better? - Yep. - Nice. - So, this is definitely the weirdest one we've had so far. I am so happy I don't have to eat this. I'm serious. - Weirder than insects? - Oh my gosh. - Three, two, one. - He counts himself down. - It just tastes really\nfizzy and very sweet. - Well, take a bite of this\nand try to mix some flavors together to give you hint of what this is. What is it? - Well, they taste exactly the same, so I'm going to guess that\nit's either bread soda or toast soda. - No, you didn't get it. - What? - It's butter soda. - Butter soda? - With some bread. Instead of butter, I was gonna\nput a little bit of the soda on top of the bread and\nthen try the bread now. - I don't think so. - Dude, try it. - You try it. - It's part of the rules. I can't eat the item that's not my round. - Oh, so good. - Unfortunately, Devan, you\ngotta get another sour one. - I know. I choose you! - Let's see what we got. - Oh, no. Oh, these don't look good. I'm gonna pour a little bit back in. All, right, here we go. Three, two, one. - You went fish lips, bro. Do not spit on me. - Oh, man. - I need to grab the bowl. - Okay. - Don't spit on me. - I won't. I won't. - Oh, gosh, it got on me. Yo, all I gotta say is this\nsour gummy bear is going to be crazy and we'll be making\nit coming up here shortly, but right now, we are onto the next round. - It tastes really good now. And here is the next item. - Yay! - Wow, it actually smells\nexactly like what it is. I'm gonna do it, so you can't smell it. Three, two, one. Just bite, just bite, you can't smell it. - I think I know it! - What? Yes? We're all waiting. - It tastes like ketchup. - Yes, dude, you got it! - Dude, right, you know\nwhat would be even better? - What? - Oh, yeah. - What? Oh, dude, what? Where did that come from? Oh, man. - Too much mustard. - All right, I'm going for this bag here. I think you clawed this one. Oh! Oh, snap. - Like sour rope. - And you know, since\nyou lost the challenge, I think you're gonna have to be the one who eats the giant sour gummy bear, bro. - What? No! Three, two, one. - Oh, yo, it's like a guitar. It's like the sourest spaghetti you've ever had in your life. We'll put these in here\nand now the moment you've all been waiting for. Time to mix all of the sourest\ncandies in the world together and make a crazy giant gummy bear, so right now, let's head to the kitchen. Welcome to our kitchen! So guys, we're gonna be\nshowing you how to combine all of these sour candies\ninto that gummy bear mold to make a giant gummy bear. You guys have seen us make\nJell-O a whole bunch of times, so we're gonna do this\nreally quickly this time. Super fast, check it out. (bouncy music) - Devan! Now is the moment you've\nall been waiting for. It's time to take all\nthat candy and pop it into the sour Jell-O. Let's get the candy and I think we're gonna go with some vines first. Just kind of sprinkle them. - Just a whole chunk of worms, bro. - I was going for a handful like this. Dude, watch out, are you ready? Hold on, I gotta start\nmixing it in though. Dude, you're missing like a ton of them. - I forgot, bro, the clump! There we go. That's the\namount that we want! Oh, I'm stepping on it! - All right, Devan, get\nthe gummy bear mold. It's time to dump it in. This is the moment of truth. Can we get it in without messing this up? Okay. - You got this, bro. - Oops, a bit of overflow. We're good, we're good, we're good. One noodle left. Let's go, we gotta go to the fridge. Teamwork makes the dream work, bro. Let's go, let's go.\n- All right, all right. - He's got foot power. All right, great. - What? What? What? - Foot action! It's the sourest gummy bear in the world. [Collins] Here it is, the\nbig reveal, you ready? - [Both] Three, two, one! Dude, it's like they\nexpanded on the inside. - What happened? - I don't know! - And they juiced. - Don't do that! Don't do that! - Devan, you lost the challenge, so you get to eat it. - I get to? What a privilege! - I feel bad though, so how bout this? I'll take a bite of it as well. And comment down below, what\nare some other giant gummies you want us to make the\nmost sour version of? So, Devan, I guess you should go for it. - Here we go. Three, two, one. - I'm gonna try, I'm gonna\ntake a bite of it now. Here we go. Three, two, one. (both screaming) Oh my god, he's gonna read\nus another video right now. You have five seconds. - [Both] Five, four, three, two, one. - Bye!", "jZYpZTfWLmA": "today's video is sponsored by raid Shadow legends in today's video we're going to see what happens if we try to freeze-dry a one pound gummy bear [Music] [Applause] since you guys are aware a 1 pound gummy bear is 11 servings I say it's like maybe 2 for me but according to this the back of our 1 pound gummy bear it should only be 11 servings but a 319 carbs 1,300 calories this is fantastic it also says it's equal to 280 standard sized gummy bears so we've got two of these 1 pound gummy bears you may have seen that these are not the biggest gummy bears in the world but we figured that this was a pretty good step up from our standard size they don't stand up real great by themselves but we want to see what happens when we freeze-dried should be kind of interesting now we don't actually know if it's gonna get all the way through a gummy bear in the past we have freeze-dried dubbing bears when we have freeze-dried gummy worms got some really cool results they puff up they turn into kind of like a crunchy cheeto that goes gelatinous it's very different but because of what Callie was just saying that we don't know if it'll make it all the way through we've got two gummy bears and we tried two different ways one of them will just be on the tray and we're gonna see what happens - I need your other one few times the other one we're going to slice up into smaller pieces so that poor gummy bear will not be all in one piece we just want to see if that's necessary to get the whole thing to freeze-dry and it might be freeze drivers aren't really designed to get through like this is almost 2 inches thick in some places so we can set our freeze dryer on a little bit higher heat and I think we can set it to go for extra time and we may just have to run it through a second time even after the first time through but we're gonna see what we can do to have the best chance of getting this gummy bear to freeze dry entirely because if it does that'd be cool and we've had like the little gummy bears have like we pulled inside so not these particular governors we did have some trouble in the past with Albanese gummy candies I believe I tried gummy worms from them and while the trolly gummy worms they puff up beautifully the albanese ones for some reason didn't I don't know if it's just because it's a different recipe exactly but I do love these they are the best I got this bag for my birthday and I'm halfway through it so I do want to throw some of these on the tray as a control as well right here we have that just like that and then this one you're just gonna slice up maybe not quite a quarter-inch but not much more than that I want to try a couple like paper-thin slices okay so see what happens of course that requires being able to slice through gummy bear before we load the freeze dryer with these colorful gummy bears though we want to tell you about something real raw dark epic and awesome oh are you referring to rage shadow legends of the massive multiplayer online realtime strategy game that will take you to a world of dark fantasy and realism

that will just burn the dummy instantly see how that does haha you didn't want the joint you always want the torch Nate you always want the torch I am corrected so now if I put this back it's just gonna burn instantly so this is not a perfect solution you could have just burned it until it was char and let it come off that way and now if I try and cut it's just gonna back that burning there that's as thin as you're gonna get I think I'm so impressed almost wow that's gonna stay right there and this is now going to go this direction okay so we've got our gummy bear sliced up we've got our mini controls and we have our giant gummy bear we're gonna run this up to the freeze dryer it may take more than one day I'm betting it will but let's see what happens all right fingers crossed hopefully in a day and a half that we'll have done something if not we'll probably just set it for another cycle and run it again may go and it's possible that like the stuff on the bottom will freeze dry and the stuff on top won't we may flip it over if we have to do another cycle to get from the other side they'd see how that works we've also had it before where they have melted in the drying process if it's a soft enough material I don't think these are because we've never had that problem with the gummy worms in the past it's some of our chocolates good so we'll see what happens fingers crossed well these are things we freeze-dried them we did I did come in and set it for a new cycle at that point I flipped over the giant gummy bear it hasn't really changed much since then this is basically what it looked like except now it has fly spots on all the protrusions yeah yeah and you know I bet it the middle of this is still not completely freeze-dried but we got much better results than I thought we would especially on the blue one that we cut into pieces these look very puffed up yep well okay and we've mentioned this in the past even this is a denser material than you get out of like patrol Ebro gummy worms so this is Albanese and Albanese are sort of a thicker recipe we think we're not sure why but they don't puff up the same but even these have puffed up the decent about now I want a cone open okay start from these small and so this is just a normal sized red gummy bear what what exactly remember how hard it was to cut through yeah full sized I'm gonna try the spine of the knife and see if it's any harder no pretty much exactly the same okay so we've made cheeto dust with gummy bears again yep that's bizarre I just revived the process let's check out the inside of the biggest rat you pick it up fate has decided for us that it's time to see the inside of the big one and look at that that looks changed all the way through sounds pretty cheeto ewwww no no I was right oh yeah this does have more chew to it so what Albanese always does there's a little really chewy gummy in the middle yeah that red one was crazy [Music] and this pink one I was pretty crunchy we didn't actually weigh it beforehand to see if it was accurately 1 pound we were just going and supposedly about what the box said what case we've lost point 1 yeah 6 maybe pounds off and it is still like there is absolutely still a weight to it it absolutely doesn't feel as fluffy as they normally are this is still a dense I am going to measure all of the blue parts together to see if more weight has been lost from the one that we cut up it feels like it that's if we can get everything to stack and balance nicely on our scale new strategy okay new strategy a bowl uh-huh we're professionals 13 points that's actually more what and we ate ears off of it dude I bet the ear off of it so all right all right okay our blue one that seems to have puffed up more to me actually has more weight to it still it's crunchy like it's not soft and cheeto we like these ones normally are where they break in little pieces it's just sort of snapping like if your finger nope I couldn't I tried to get a slice that didn't quite work broke or too much for that but we might have invented the loudest food in the universe you know how people are like movie theaters are a place where people want silence let's make the loudest treat possible popcorn and give it to them and put the ball in a dark room together we've made something louder [Music] it's pretty crunchy I'm gonna cut open this one living is our biggest piece what the inside is like and pretty grungy all the way through I'll give it this so the flavor is so much stronger we find that a lot can we do this even though it has expanded I feel like the flavor condenses without the liquid in it like before you eat it and you're like like the first thing that hits you is this is a gummy texture next it's okay sweet and then you can kind of get the aftertaste of bluegrass right first thing that hits you here is I have blue raspberry in my nose that's interesting [Music] [Music] I'm now going to be tasting artificial cherry in my mouth until I die I do regret that blue raspberry that concentrated is good cherry that concentrated is cough syrup okay so I put this gummy bear in the water to see if it would do anything and it's just kind of slowly dissolving while it floats to the top now I've got water in the microwave to get really hot I don't see what happens to it in hot water instead of cold water oh wow I'm so angry about that I think it just air is escaping fast enough that it's like bubbling and I can smell it smell the lemon so warm water way faster I'm just gonna take a piece of our giant bear and throw that in there too I'll the steam the lemon ones and then I just took a big chunk of blue and drop it in and it was all the way gummy bear teeth [Music] what did you have today alright gummybear team now the deal [Music] how cool is anyone not as flavorful as kool-aid here's the weird part guys this is super bizarre that is delicious and I'm really upset about it all right guys we have freeze-dried yet another very odd thing what else do you want to see because you know that freeze dryer is gonna be around for a while let's go in the comments below thanks again to our sponsor rage shadow legends click the link in the description to get playing today guys that's not all you know we've always got more for you see hit that box up the top to check out the most recent video and we will see you in the next one talk to you then [Music]", "TLJAD3uMWTA": "what's up guys welcome to Austin blood is asking drugs ASMR edition alright what's up guys welcome to hospital bugs and dad today we got something new that I've never really tried I've only tried a little bit but never really got the full length experience but anyway what we're trying today some are [ __ ] edibles but bowel cancer so what we got today I never tried this before I'm using uh-oh so the reason one is so [ __ ] bright right here is because I have a little lamp and that has a connect to it that's why I clamped it onto my tripod and so I'm just using the edge of my camera right here I mean on my desk I'm using the edge of my desk to hold the tripod and I'm just blocking in my room cuz right now it's like 1:30 in the morning I'll get back to y'all in an hour [Music] [Applause] let me do some research on this [ __ ] before I get [ __ ] [ __ ] hey Manny Pacquiao all right guys so now it's 4:00 in the morning and I still don't feel nothing so I'm gonna take a half of another we'll keep y'all updated [ __ ] if anything I still got this bad boy right here but yeah I'm gonna kick back watch moo tang and I'll keep you posted okay guys so this is an update of Houston's tank he's still asleep right here so he babe he buried uh what he buried himself actually I'm just gonna give him 48 to 72 hours to get acclimated to his tank because it does it is stressful getting put in a new environment which is totally understandable for reptiles such as him so yeah hopefully later on today it'll be out walking around in [ __ ] and so tomorrow we're gonna go get them a new UVB light although they don't need a UVB light they do seem to like it and so if you get too hot in this little rock right here he can always walk to this hide right here which is a little half tree we're still waiting for these edibles to hit and I'll be back all right guys so they have a serious talk real quick right now it's 6:00 a.m. been awake all day this is why I never really wanted to try edibles cuz I wouldn't I didn't want to spend money on something that I didn't know was gonna work on me or not because I have read some people there's some weird reason don't don't feel anything so they get no side effects or anything and I'm guessing what I'm one of those people cuz I didn't get any side effects I've I mean I've eat brownies before I know that I do get high off right homey brownies again I ate up around 2:30 it's now 6 a.m. and only how I feel it's from the last joint I just had the high I'm feeling now is from the previous joint I wrote and it's not secret there's another joint that I just wrote this was a review on the edibles I'm gonna read it as 0 today whoa it's rated at 303 just because it did taste pretty good I guess nice pretty big chunky piece of candy it was pretty good has its highs like I could rate it because I thought about getting another pen but I literally saw that said they I got it yeah it's gonna be it for long 20 I'm sure we also watched for my day one stop [ __ ] which are heavy a.m. and if you're new to the channel make sure to hit the bell button so you can see

it's all of about", "zMrRqkL89sw": "what's up guys look at the blog I got the world's biggest company hotdog this thing is huge I also have a lift behind me so world's biggest gummy hotdog versus that lift oh this thing is so big yes how heavy this thing is when I first saw this thing I figured it was probably like 10 15 pounds I wish you guys do guessed right now how heavy it is comment it down below if you want this thing is 33 pounds of gummy hotdog it's kind of hard to hold it's so heavy and we're gonna take it up that huge lift behind me and we are gonna drop it down and see what happens down over this we're gonna see if we can drop it right on 3x like this whoo the only difference is we're gonna be way up there this is probably like 15 feet it goes 60 feet in the air so let's see what happened if we go all the way up it drop the whole thing is coming hotdog this machine goes so high that it you have to wear safety equipment to operate it so that's why I got this super heavy-duty harness I got to stick this thing on just to make sure I gotta be safe and I'm going that high okay there we go I got my safety harness on now let's get up there 60 feet in the air and let's bring the gummy hotdogs with us oh this is so big okay let's let's take this thing up in the air I got a strap on so I do not fall off because I don't want to end up like the watermelon that we dropped off of this thing go and let's start this thing up it's been a little while since I've driven one of these so I'm really excited you think there's so much Bob because he goes so high these are some of my favorite videos to do is to hop out hop on this limp drive it all the way up and just drop things off it's so simple but it's so interesting to see what happens when things hit the ground at such high heights sometimes it goes just the way you think and it explodes like the watermelon or cracks like the hoverboard where sometimes like when we dropped it say for example whew okay we're up at the top of this boom sometimes did you drop something in hit the ground it does something completely unexpected and since it's gonna be hot dog it's just so big that might be exactly what happens today it might be completely unexpected what happens I don't know if it's gonna explode into pieces maybe it'll flatten out like a pancake well maybe it'll just bounce like I seriously have no idea what do you think I don't know I can't wait to see it yeah I can't wait to see either but all I know is we are going way up there oh yeah this is gonna be really cool well okay so we're about maybe halfway up but it looks like the X is there up and I want the X over this way so I can drop off this side so we got to drive the Machine one of the scariest things to do when you're up we're probably thirty feet maybe maybe about half way one of the scariest things to do is drive and that's what we're about to do here we go we're ready watch this thing one of the really cool things about these machines is even when you're full height you can still drive across the ground and to me that's so scary because it's so wobbly up here a video game okay I think that's about right because now we have the x over this way I think we should be good I think we're I think we're good to go let's keep going up this is when things start to get really wobbly it's when you start going really high on this machine yeah we're getting high three-two-one whoa guys this is how high we were when we did the watermelon drop you can see how Liz is like she's pretty big the X isn't that high now if you look over you get to go small people are I think we're probably about twice as high as the watermelon and the watermelon exploded so now let's try to do the world's biggest gummy hot dog which is this oh it's been sit-down the Sun so it's extra gummy now so this is a brand new 33 pound gummy hotdog let's open it up oh my goodness is so squishy yeah okay I don't know if I get out of the bag here we go there we go okay this is a hot dog a gummy hot dog three pounds it smells really good wow it smells really good so this is what we're gonna throw off I want to make sure we can hit the X so I have a can of soda I got some Coca Cola we're going to drop this off and see if we hit the X if we're lined up we're gonna drop the gummy hotdog off let's do this thing just like we do when we drop anything on this channel we like to make sure we were lined up so we have all the cameras down below that can catch the shot so you guys can see it action so I'm gonna pretend like this is a 33 pound gummy hotdog so I can't reach it out so far it's pretty heavy so here we go it three two one okay corner drop the soda floated and this is the other side of it that is so crazy okay so just looking at it first glance well it totally exploded we could probably move the Machine up three feet so let's move the Machine three feet and then let's drop the gummy hotdog I think that's it maybe that was too far I don't know okay just to make sure I'm dropping a can of coca-cola so I think I'll probably go to hold the gummy hotdogs out just about this far here we go for a can of coke I'm gonna drop this one vertical shake it up a little bit here we go three two one go break and huh like the other one did but it totally exploded that looked like it landed in the same spot so do we move the machine up a little bit one more time let's do it okay I don't have anything else to drop well I can stop my water bottle let's go water bottle let's drop this off the hotdog is pretty heavy I don't think I'll be able to hold it out about this far here we go drop it one more hopefully this lands in the middle the X and same with the gummy hotdog here we go in three two one go right in the middle that was right in the middle of the X oh yeah okay I think we're ready to go let's get the hotdogs but should I take a bite of this thing first I if we drop it it might explode so this might be my last my one and only chance to take a bite oh it's so gummy you know oh my gosh guys oh you can like fold it in half I think it might actually be three different flavors I think the bun the hotdog and the mustard on top are all different flavors I'm gonna try the mustard that's pretty good Wow that's actually really good we'll try a bite of the bun - hmm definitely could not eat this whole thing comment down below if you think you'd eat this whole thing whoa the buns he's so good that's one of the best gummies I've ever had okay uh I guess who's nothing left to do we're perfectly lined up let's drop the gummy hotdogs and if you guys are doing here on Carter share welcome to the most epic channel on youtube so smash the subscribe button if you haven't already and join me on my adventure of making the best YouTube videos ever I'm gonna try to drop it flat so it lands perfectly flat just like that but maybe it'll land like this kind of like a pencil dive what if it like breaks to drive I just thought I would if it like cracks to drive it could so heavy but let's do this thing Liz are you ready down there okay they're ready hunt you ready we're ready here we go I'm kind of nervous I'd like don't want to drop it it's like a baby it's kind of scary but I know you guys want to see it I want to see everything about this all day but I guess here we go I kind of hold it out a little bit oh okay there's thumb no right there here we go oh I'm actually kind of nervous for some reason well let's drop this thing you ready Liz okay here we go in three two one go right on the act Carter you got it right on the egg did you see that it like shot out like but it looks like it's like these we hit that we hit the X it looks like it's in one piece I thought it would like explode or flatten out to a pancake it looks fine okay let's go down let's ride the machine down let's go check it out it looks like there's no damage nothing it's still in one piece the only thing is this little chip except I know it actually looks like a bite mark so I don't think that's even from the drop hey guys that's why I do a couple test drops just to make sure it's lined up cuz that was a bull's-eye a 60-foot drop of gummy hotdogs right to the center let's go check out the damage whoo okay I'm actually curious to know what happened to the hotdog did it crack did it explode or just like perfectly in one piece so it looks like it might be okay wait it looks fine no looks like brand-new like there's the bite I took out of it I thought it chip one two three is it in one piece oh the bottom look like wait it's totally fine nothing happened you're heavy okay guys what we're gonna do in the next video is we're gonna freeze this in liquid nitrogen and do the same exact drop and see if that'll make it shatter oh that is so gross okay guys I'll see you on the next blog where we freeze this thing and then drop it whoo", "cqOSNzxo7Mo": "-Vat19 presents:\nBurning Questions, featuring real\ncustomer

just because it's new but I just think it's a different way to do it different and possibly more dangerous syrup has a thousand milligrams of THC the active principle of marijuana per bottle and if taken all at once 10 to 20 times what you're typically going against smoking a joy the side effects would be palpable a lot of times very erratic hallucinations and you can also get psychosis on a temporary basis so the the judgment and your behaviors are definitely impacted grown-ups don't know Lesley Robinson is founder of Street chicks and recovery which runs a marijuana adolescent prevention program in Lee County middle schools she also produces videos helping educate kids about some of the side effects of marijuana in products like Co syrup and it's so potent you're gonna be

smell the Collier County Sheriff's Office told us they don't recall ever making any arrests where this kind of syrup was down before but many of these drugs come and wave so the best advice for

moonwalker watermelon skittles vegan gummy we've already honestly eaten a couple of these we couldn't wait we met the guys they gave us some we had to try them right away they're good so we knew that we had to share here in the taste test series we're gonna let jazzy kind of dive right into the what's on the box and the information and kind of share some of that good stuff and then we'll dive right in we ate a bunch we ate a lot of them we know that they're good but we had to share so they're called atlas watermelon skittles 25 milligram gummies and i'm going to read what it has inside it's 15 calories 2 grams of sugar and everything else is zero hemp extract 25 milligrams sugar corn syrup pectin sunflower oil water flavoring sodium citrate sodium acid sulfate citric acid natural and artificial food coloring 25 milligrams delta eight thc and plant derived terpenes take one gummy every six hours or as desired they had the test results on the bottle you can scan which is super cool it does say one gummy packed in right uh 15 calories nothing too crazy i mean i personally think you're freaking delicious it tastes like a slightly less sweet less sour watermelon gummy like the watermelon candies from sour patch cakes it's not sour it's just delicious it's so good and it it would really be hard for me to just eat one yeah there's three left in this whole thing 25 pieces started in the bottle uh we gave out probably two to each of our friends over the last you know seven to ten days and you know we've eaten a couple effect wise have you noticed any effect for that you've experienced in this i do feel like at night i'm much more chill i'm sleeping better i'm going into a deeper sleep my mood is better um just more relaxed yeah i would say just a little bit more calm less anxious overall for me personally this sounds like something similar for you so that's dope and the flavor wise this is a taste test review what is your score for the flavor of this gummy i don't taste chemicals or anything i don't like fake yeah it doesn't taste like i mean i know it's watermelon flavor but i enjoy it it's really good yeah they went with some solid flavoring mm-hmm for what for uh for like the creation and crafting of this product i'm coming in at a nine uh 9.25 on the flavor uh and the overall score on this product for me is going to be a 93 out of 100. so for me it's um nine out of ten nine out of ten for both overall in flavor yeah um i was trying to think of why but no i like the packaging i do enjoy like this this is like a medical you know it's like a gummy vibe you know like the the uh your vitamin vibe right but the packaging makes it seem cooler than a the information how it's presented i think is super dope so mad respect to moonwalker great

so if you can't talk about the title i am doing another hair gummy review but i was requested by somebody to do a part two of girl girl let it grow but i couldn't find the gummies anywhere like i went to my local walmart two times nothing i couldn't find them so i didn't buy them because i don't really trust it anywhere else than walmart because that's where i got it i don't know where else to get i'm not gonna be searching everywhere for it because i am busy and i'm always doing something and i never have time for literally nothing like i'm barely recruiting this video and i already have two weeks of doing this that's how busy i am because i literally forget or i'm just busy but the gummies that i'm gonna try are called vita fusion beautiful hair with biotin so far from taking it for two weeks i really like it because i feel like okay when i was taking the girl girl letter girl i think that's how you pronounce it but i think that's how you pronounce it but when i was taking those like not a lot of hair was coming out of my hair and like for me since i have a lot of hair and curly hair i literally lose hair like every single time like every time i shower it's like a lot of hair coming down a lot and i was thinking the girls will let it grow that means like i felt my hair was healthy and not a lot of hair was coming out but with these like i don't know i feel like more hair comes out than usual i don't know if that's normal i don't know or maybe it's because i'm stressing right now it could literally be anything the vitamins that it has is c and e only two which i don't like because i like having a lot of vitamins when i think vitamins what does it even make sense but so far the length of it being two weeks um didn't really grow that much i don't know it really didn't grow that much in my opinion i'm gonna put the picture up right now to see if the good girl or not i don't know the girl or not but i believing that it didn't grow because i don't see something different but see i think that's it about the vitamins i mean i'm gonna be taking pictures every week even though i haven't took a picture this week i'll be taking pictures every saturday to see how much my hair oh yeah my hair is curly naturally this is my real hair my real hair i personally don't like my hair because it when i say that a lot of people are like oh my god i wish i had your hair girl you know the struggles of my hair you don't know the struggles like to get like this that's all i have for right now so i see you if there's another video series so this is part two of the first video this is part two this is my little update or whatever this is the update about beautiful beautiful hair gummies let me rate it first because let me tell y'all we know let me tell you guys everything and then i'm gonna rate it okay so in my opinion for one month because tomorrow's a month because i started taking on february 14 and tomorrow's march 14th but today i'm taking the video because tomorrow's monday i'm not gonna have time at all to do the video so i'm doing it today um for me in my opinion as it had been a month and i understand that it's a 50 days assignment and i'm doing 30 which yeah but um in my opinion it did not go that much as much as i wanted it to be as if being a month even though i know you're just like but it's just a 5 minute of 50 days well you guys probably won't say that better i know other people or like maybe i just need that but i don't know it being 30 days i feel like it didn't grow i mean it did grow i mean it did work like the gummies of course but it didn't grow as much as i wanted it to be for it being a month i don't know if you understand that or not and my hair is um not brushed right now because if you guys understand curly hair if you guys know curly hair is that when you brush it out or you straighten it or anything it's longer than when it is curled um i know my hair looks short right now it's not really that short but i wanted to not brush my hair because when i had took the picture i barely realized that my hair was not brushed and when my hair is brushed and when my hair is not brushed there's a different length so i wanted to compare the length of it being not brushed and when because when i took the picture it was not brushed and i didn't realize until yeah but i'll put the picture again like right now so you guys let me know if it did grow or not i haven't seen the picture but i feel like it didn't grow in my opinion well it did grow but not that much as i wanted it to grow i don't know if you know what i mean but yeah as my hair falling out in the shower i mean i would say it was normal like i wouldn't get that much and i wouldn't get that little it was completely normal like if i was not on anything it was normal and my rating for it's gonna be i would say a seven out of ten seven out of ten because it did make my hair grow but then as much as i wanted it to grow in a month i know this video is so lame and everything because it's mostly based on my hair and it's not the thing that i can like say or entertain but if there's any recommendations for any other gummies or anything you want me to try let me know in the comments so if you leave a comment down below i'll most likely get to it because obviously i see all my comments pop up if you guys want me to try sugar bear i'm so down and try sugar bear i heard like reviews about them and i want to see so that is it for the video let me give you guys a 360 of my hair so you guys can see the length and everything is my hair in the front and

rolls and I got 82 starbursts well I had 82 starbursts now I have a sugar rush and a pile of trash but this first hack turns this trash in into fashion my favorite candy bar belt for this hack you'll need a tape measure scissors clear packaging tape to keyrings and starburst wrappers trim your candy wrappers so they are all 1 inch wide you'll need about 15 wrappers depending on the size of your waist now measure your waist and add 6 inches 26 so I'll meet about 32 inches measure a piece of packing tape that length and lay it sticky side up on the table now tape down each end [Music] now starting at one end place a wrapper in the middle of the tape now place a second wrapper overlapping the first one just slightly continue till you only have room for two more wrappers now place the last two wrappers colorful side down you do this because when you fold the end of the belt over you want the colorful side to shell now cover the whole belt with another piece of tape sticky side down take the piece of tape that was holding it down off the table and trim along the sides [Music] now add another piece of tape around the whole belt [Music] and wrap the edges around the back [Music] now cut off the extra tape on both ends wrap the end you started with through both killings [Music] and secure with tape [Music] now round the other end of your belt to wear the belt put the end through both rings then fold over and go back through only one ring and then pull to tighten [Music] the great thing is the belt is fully adjustable which will come in handy after I eat all this candy or drink it that's right in this next tap you can enjoy your delicious candy haul without even chewing my milky way to go cocoa for this you'll need a spoon a mug of milk for small milky way's and a microwave unwrap your milky way's and put them into the mug of milk now microwave for 30 seconds at a time [Music] strain each time until the milk is hot and the milky way's are melted still needs more there it's all melted and it smells really good this Milky Way cocoa is out of this world check out the best part of my home a full sized bag of gummy bears and since I have so many gummy bears I'll use some to make my yummy gummy slice for this you'll need a wooden spoon cooking oil cornstarch powdered sugar gummy bears a bowl measuring cup and spoons and a microwave first pick out the color of gummy bears you want I'm choosing red you'll need about a cup of one color now microwave this for 15 seconds and then stir until it's smooth [Music] now add two tablespoons of cornstarch and 1 tablespoon of powdered sugar and stir it into the mixture [Music] now put some cornstarch and sugar on your surface so that your slime doesn't stick to it once it's not too sticky to handle you can

today's episode we're doing another edible review since you guys like the sour patch one i went out and tried to find myself other edibles i think would be interesting for you guys and for today's episode we got we got the little trillium edibles edibles i don't know if you guys have seen these before if it'll focus yeah so they make all different types of making of the sour patch to make the little watermelon ones all kind of different ones but since my personal favorite candy is trolleys i went out the way and found these and yeah so from what i can tell these are 300 milligrams in each packaging thc obviously and from what i've heard this brand is really good it's really high quality hopefully it's better than the sour patch ones which i hope it is so yeah before we get into it guys please like subscribe comment all that wonderful magical good stuff and without further ado let's get into this [ __ ] so real quick just in case you guys are out here trying to get your own and all that stuff please be aware when it comes to edibles cards all sorts of [ __ ] packaging like this can easily be bought off ebay amazon off the internet and people can be you know [ __ ] with your [ __ ] but just as a little reference in order to know that these are real each little metal packaging will have like the certain color coordination on the dip part so if this trolley is going to have the blue and red if it's sour patch it's going to have the green and so and so and also where it says the thc part right there if you you guys probably see it'll focus for you there should be like a little very gray doctor symbol on the back so there's that too so yeah so let's open this [ __ ] and let's get it so it smells like you know what you would expect gummy worms to smell like but it has more of that gourmet kind of snow and you can still smell a little bit of the weed is not too crazy so you know you can have these out and it wouldn't be noticeable get these [ __ ] out this is pretty much what they look for they're nice big worms they're not like i thought they're going to be more like trolleys like the actual smaller ones but not either pretty solid big so because of that there's only there's six in each bag which isn't bad so normally for someone who has a lower tolerance i would say go for three but if you're like me someone who has a higher tolerance or just naturally prefers to be higher and likes being high i would say knock all sticks down the 300 milligrams it's a nice steady high well we'll find out soon so we like to send [ __ ] in this channel i'm gonna go ahead and eat all six we're gonna eat a little part just to do a little taste review see how it [Music] this is hit say and they do taste like what i would say gourmet gummy warmers would taste like like if you go to a dollar store or any grocery store and they normally got like you know they got the trolley brands and then they got like the market brands it tastes kind of like the market brands but of course it also has that hint of wheat on it and what i do like about these compared to the ones um compared to the sour patches i did earlier the weed taste on this is a lot more subtle than it was on the sour patch one yeah it doesn't hit you in the face like you're eating it you merely taste gummy worm not you know wait so that's a good part on edibles so does it take longer to eat or are you just going slow this is a big gummy worm the regular gummy worm colors the blue and orange green yellow and the [ __ ] red another one sorry they are solid if you do start throwing more in your mouth you are going to get a little bit more of the wee taste but of course that's because you put a lot but yeah tastes good packaging is good six in each thing it's not bad it's a nice solid high i would assume and i would hope it would take you know just an average 30 to an hour to hit and hopefully since these look good they taste good hopefully it'll be a nice long lasting high oh again guys please like subscribe all that good stuff and you guys have you know any specific edibles you guys would like to do review on any glass any cards anything specific and he's trying to weed please let me know down below and i'll try my best to get my hands on it [Applause] but yeah just finished eating this and i would assume it'll take 30 minutes to an hour so i'll check in with you guys in about an hour or so to see how these are pretty much hit me so i hope you guys enjoy eating edibles too or just smoking along i'll be back with you guys hello everybody welcome back and we are about what i would say two to four hours deep on these edibles so it took about an hour to hit you know normally able to take and they are doing their magic they're great it's a nice body and head high and you know yeah it's what i would say if you've experienced edibles before you know saying your first edible you know what a good edible high is this is a very good one i would highly recommend yourself to get a metals if you can but yeah aside from that it's a great thing if you can try to get your hands on them you can try them out i don't know if they're all the same i'm gonna try to get my hands on some sour patch ones or some different ones but until then we'll see so yeah i would rate it you know 10 out of 10. if you guys get your hands on it you should try it so yeah that'll be if you guys have any other edibles again please put it down below i'll try to get my best i'll try my best to get my hands on it and yeah like always guys please like subscribe all that wonderful [ __ ]",

to do is use your syringe needle to get some tincture and put it into each of your gushers now if you measure out your tincture in advance you can know approximately how much is in each so if you do a tablespoon of tincture you can divide it by however many gushers you end up filling and that's how you can figure out how many milligrams is in each gusher i have not yet tried this with coconut oil but i believe it would work as long as you melted enough so the syringe would be able to pull it up thank you guys so much for watching if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a

These delicious,\nbite-sized treats came in a medley\nof fruit flavors and soon had every man, woman,\nand child hopelessly addicted. In the early 1980s, experiments\ninvolving gene splicing and cross breeding led to\nthe birth of the gummy worm. But the masses were\nstill unsatisfied. Since then, scientists\nand engineers have been working around the\nclock to devise a solution. Something, anything to quench\nthe global gummy craving. That solution has arrived. Introducing the giant\ngummy bear on a stick. It's enough gummy bear\nto feed a family of six. Research shows this prodigious\npiece of candy tastes just like an\nordinary gummy bear. A regular sized\ngummy bear weighs about a tenth of an ounce. The giant gummy bear on the\nstick weighs over half a pound. That's about 88\ngummy bears in one. Beta testing revealed that\nthe prototype giant gummy bear was too unwieldy to\noperate with bare hands. Thus, engineers designed\nthe portability beam, known as the stick,\nto assist consumption. It aids in preservation,\nallowing the bear to be easily wrapped\nup and saved for later. With the implementation\nof the stick, the giant gummy bear has become\na mobile, mess-free delicacy. And the rest is history. Feed your massive\ngummy addiction with a giant gummy\nbear on a stick. Made in the USA and\navailable now at vat19.com.

the same as the original you're gonna want two packages of the um jello this is the three ounce the small box or 85 grams whatever flavor you'd like two tablespoons or two packages of unflavored gelatin so two packages of those nox unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water room temperature and a half a cup of water ice cold you have to have ice cold water to bloom gelatin we're going to want a quarter cup of light corn syrup for those of you who don't like like do not like corn syrup you can use invert sugar glucose honey or a gob you just need a syrup in there and what it does is it creates a barrier between your sugar crystals so that they don't come back together that's why it's needed some type of syrup we are going to need a quarter cup of can of butter a quarter teaspoon of citric acid a half a teaspoon of gour gum and gorgum is an emulsifier which allows us to bring oil and water together because as everybody knows they are mortal enemies so in order for them to be able to become friends you use an emulsifier and what an emulsifier will do is it takes each molecule a water molecule and an oil they go in together in a bubble and it creates a bubble around uh those two molecules so it creates its own um kind of uh it creates an emulsion that's what it does and that's what emulsion is bringing oil and water together to be a uniform liquid you cannot use xanthan gum it is not an emulsifier it is a thickener and it is a stabilizer it is not an emulsifier gum is an emulsifier a stabilizer and a thickener as well as it has a natural gummy uh texture to it which helps with your gummies and for those of you who don't use it or can't get it uh you can use soy it would be one teaspoon of soy or sunflower lecithin the other reason why i like the gourd gum is it has no flavor whereas lecithin does and i don't like the flavor less of them in substitute of water if you want to add a little bit more flavor boost you can use these kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters or basically any juice that doesn't contain real fruit if you do use a juice that has real fruit you have to use a mold inhibitor like this little the lorraine's mold inhibitor and that is a must otherwise they will go moldy in a couple of weeks then this is optional this and alcohol or um everclear the 94 alcohol or grain alcohol a really cool trick alert with this uh which you'll have to wait till the end to see it um but yeah this is an option um or if you make tincture you can use your tincture provided it is made with the high percentage alcohol it has to be the 94 ish around there for flavorings you can use the lorraine flavor oils i'm today i'm going to be making uh lemon raspberry so i'm going to start with a lemon base split it up split out half raspberry and make the other half of them and make them look all pretty gel food coloring now if you want to create a solid background white food coloring a thing with this you can only use one or two drops if you use too much your gummies will not set no matter what you can freeze them you doesn't matter what you do they will not set if you use too much very important one or two drops only and i think i've got all the ingredients here covered let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made all right so the equipment that we are going to need is basically the same as the old recipe there is one major difference we are going to throw away the immersion stick or the hand blender that apparently is a very bad thing for our gelatin so on top of creating a mountain of air bubbles so that your gummies don't turn out nice and clear it also breaks the gelatin so for any of you have this white goopy stuff on the top of your candies the silicone spatula or silicone whisk is going to resolve that issue so we're not going to use the hand blender silicone only metal will damage uh the gelatin who knew it was such a delicate little flower so silicone spatula very important silicone or a wooden spoon a little strainer or a bigger one if you've got one doesn't have a small one a small um saucepan heavy bottom is preferable and on heat transfer which means when you look at the bottom of your pot there is no discoloring um it's always one even if it is discolored in spots it means that your pot gets hotter in those particular areas and it can damage your uh your product so heavy bottom not heat transfer is the best thing to go for you of course your gummy molds these bottles are one of the best for dispersing your um dispensing your syrup into the into the molds they're by a sweet sugar bell and two reasons i like is because it uses the decorating tips which makes it nice as well as they have a very deep um lip to them whatever you call this a lip screw thing if you use the dollar store ones or ones that um have the really short short neck on them and then uh you're more likely it's the lids gonna pop off because the syrup is warm there's not a lot well the pressure on it it just pops them off so fair warning either that or um one of these candy funnels uh works great as well or the little odd dropper things that those some of those molds come with you're going to need some parchment paper and a drying rack i think i have most of the equipment covered you know me i always forget something um so let's jump right into those ingredients and let's get this made so on to making our candies so the very first thing we want to do is to bloom our gelatin so i've got my two tablespoons of gelatin here and you want to um sprinkle it onto your ice cold water and as i said for gelatin to bloom correctly water has to be i size very very very cold so we just want to sprinkle it across the top so this way it doesn't clump and then you're going to stir it into the water make sure it's well mixed in and that there's no lumps now one tip for you when you're doing this with your unflavored gelatin while you're mixing it it should start to um form into the texture of um of applesauce if it doesn't then you need to add a little bit more gelatin either your gelatin is not as strong or used a little too much water over whatever it is it's probably not going to be um quite enough so like this is just a little too soupy so i'm going to add in just a sprinkle there we go so that's more the texture that you want see like applesauce and then i usually toss mine into the fridge until i need it so i've added my um two boxes of jello to my pot already and then in goes our light corn syrup or whatever syrup you choose to use and yes you can use can of syrup and our other half a cup of water now this is one thing i learned the citric acid does not go in until the end so you never had your citric acid while you're preparing once everything's done and heated that's when you add in your citric acid the acid works like acid it melts things so it interferes with the cooking or the setting process if you add it in too early same thing if you use the cooked version make sure to only add it once you're done so once you've got your water and your corn syrup and your jello in the pot you just want to get her mixed and turn your heat onto low so we don't need to use a double board a double boiler as long as you keep it on lower minimum you're good if you start to see any white streaking take it off the heat immediately so you're just going to continue to stir this until the sugar and everything is dissolved okay so i've been stirring on low heat here for about 10 minutes we're pretty much done so you look at the bottom there and you can see it's it's nice and clear and when you stream it it looks clear so now that portion is done we are going to get our unflavored gelatin now that our jello and our corn syrup and that is done we are now turned off our heat this is when we're going to add in our citric acid uh so a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and again citric acid is what prevents your sugar from crystallizing right essentially it's an acid and it continues to melt things there is such a science and chemistry with sugar and water and acids and stuff it's like wow mind blowing so quarter teaspoon of citric acid in there give her a little gentle stir so next goes in our unflavored gelatin what i like to do is to cut it up into little squares makes it easier to melt and so we're just going to let them sit there for just a minute or so and then you just want to gently stir until your until the unflavored gelatin is all completely melted then once your gelatin is all melted and everything is a uniform color and texture that's how you know everything is melted and night skins come together everybody's being friends in the pot now we're going to add our can of butter and our gourgum so in goes our butter half a teaspoon of our gum and i use the strainer um so that it'll evenly distribute it over the uh butter um otherwise it can clump up and as well you want to make sure to sprinkle it onto the butter part and not the candy syrup because again if it hits the syrup part it'll clump the oil or the butter will make it melt it's a pretty wild uh ingredient i have to admit we're just gonna get that evenly sprinkled over our butter and we're gonna let that sit for one minute all right after it's been sitting there for about a minute we're going to start to whisk this now you don't want to go crazy whisking because as i said too hard breaks our gelatin it is going to break it a little bit but we don't want to go too gentle because we actually have to create be able to break that oil down small enough so that it can create an emulsion so it's finding that happy medium so i just kind of get it started here so we're trying to whisk with minimal air bubbles and then we have a look and take a look at the top and see if you see any kind of oil slick if you do continue to whisk it a little bit longer and then check it again if you still see some oil um coming up to the top you see some oil slicks happening we can add in a little bit more gour gum but this time you're not going to add it directly into the pot just get your bowl that your butter was in there's enough oil in there to deal with it and we're just gonna take a little bit like about an eighth of a teaspoon and you stir it into the oil into the butter it dissolves the gore gum as otherwise as i said if you just dump that in now it'll just lump up once it's dissolved into there just add it in like soup and whisk it again again have a look so here i've got some air bubbles we have a little bit of other gelatin broken a little bit but nowhere near like when we use the um the uh pan blender much nicer so now that we have this as our base here now is when we can add our flavors and our color so this said i wanted to do lemon raspberry so i'm going to split this off to half about right so for this side i'm going to add just a little bit more lemon and to this side i'm going to add in our raspberry it's probably a little too much raspberry and we're going to add in our colors so i'm going to keep the yellow which one do i want to keep clear i think i'll keep the yellow clear and i'm going to make the red solid so as i said if you've got the white um food coloring you have to shake it up really really well if it sits on the sits in your cover it has a tendency to separate so you really want to mix it well otherwise it leaves little white dots so that might be a little too much it's always let's do a couple drops a little heavy handed and i'm going to whisk this one together oh these red food coloring that's a pretty color now because i'm pretty sure i've added too much white like i said i only got to add in one or two drops because i kind of went a little heavy-handed likely this red isn't going to set but what i'm going to do is i'm going to quick test it i'm going to put a little bit into a i'm just going to put a little bit into a into a dish i'm going to throw this into the fridge for a couple of minutes to see if it sets up if it doesn't i'm going to add some additional gelatin to that side all right so my little test here it it's setting up that was just a couple minutes in the fridge we're setting no problem now if you'd done that and it was still sticky sticking to your finger then you would want to add about a half a tablespoon of additional unflavored bloom gelatin so you would bloom a half a tablespoon to three tablespoons of cold cold water and add it to that to the solid side but we're good and i went ahead and i added my yellow to my yellow side here and now what i'm going to just do is i'm going to let them sit for just a couple of minutes and allow the air bubbles to come up to the top and that white icky stiff stuff to come and we can pull that out before we pour it into our bottles so our syrup now has been sit and set for a little bit and it's cooled off and you can see kind of that layer on top here take your strainer and just very gently scoop that out so this is the kind of the air bubble a little bit of the broken gelatin but we can get a lot of that out before we put it in the bottle and then with your strainer and you just want to hold it over the bottle and pour your syrup into the bottle dead on on that one not bad and now we're ready to cast our candies so a tip for you put your molds into your freezer before you start that way they're nice and cold and your gelatin your syrup will start to solidify right away especially if you're doing two colors that way they won't all bleed together another tip for you before you pour turn your bottles upside down put your fingers over the tips and just tap them what this will do is bring all the air bubbles to the top or to the bottom of the bottles so again helps make it much nicer candy okay then and then just fill up your molds now one thing important with your molds is don't fill them all the way to the top you want to go just just below it go all the way to the top it creates a ridge that gets icky it gets hard these are guys you're gonna look so cool yellow on yellow is tough it's hard to see it especially when it's clear so this recipe will make about um about a hundred or so of this size mold that i'm using probably about 300 of the teeny tiny and probably about 60 50 60 of the larger size all right so my gummies have set get your cooling rack your drying wrap parchment paper design your rock [Applause] and just pop out your gummies now if you can stand them up if they'll stand up better but if not just lay them down and then after about 12 hours flip them and let them fully dry out i usually flip them a couple times a day i walk by and do my flip and these guys will take about 24 to 48 hours to fully dry out and you want to make sure that you have a dry place humidity will not help your candies dry out at all drying and humid do not work together so if you do have a human place um if you can get a dehumidifier that will greatly help you out so i'm just going to finish uncasting these little guys and i'm going to go into the next step and show you the little trick with the alcohol and what that does and then how to successfully uh sugar sour coats your candies so be sure to stay tuned so this is the size of the candies when you take them out of the mold and that's the size of the candies once they dry so they shrink there a little bit there all right so here's a trick that i learned a tip that i learned and um it's gonna make your lives a whole lot easier especially for those of you guys who ship and we're having troubles with your candy sticking together what you're going to do is you're going to take your everclear or your um everclear or alcohol depending on where you're from anywhere you're 94 or up percentage alcohol put it into a small spray bottle remember the equipment that i always forget to tell you small spray bottle was one of them so put your alcohol into a small spray bottle so we want to give our candies a bit of a generous spray here and then just mix them up let the alcohol get into all candy all over and again if you can do this with tincture if you've got your tincture provided you did it with the uh the high grade alcohol and once you do that just put them out rip them up and let the alcohol evaporate it takes about 20 minutes or so and that's it it creates um kind of creates a bit of a barrier it keeps your candies um chewier for a longer period of time so i've had these guys out for about four days and see they're still perfectly squishy and gummy and not dried out looking or anything and that's what the alcohol helps to do and it also prevents them from sticking together all right so the next part is how to successfully sugar coat your gummies all right so this is the really other cool thing that i learned how to successfully coat our candies so for the most part you take them out you coated them they melt it it gets ugly we're not happy because that's because we're doing it wrong well the reason is and citric acid as i said is an acid if there is any moisture it is going to cause it to uh to melt so that's what's happening is you take your candies out of the fridge it's warmer outside of your fridge you know room temperature it automatically creates moisture from cold to warm or if you just automatically put your candies in or there's any moisture it the strict acid will melt so in order to successfully coat them so they don't what you want to do is once your candies have fully dried after a couple of days and if you do the step with the alcohol coating and they're done take your candies take a drying rack and just spread them out onto the drying rack then you're going to get your pot of boiling water here and we're going to just hold the rack over the steam just move it around so our candy's getting cut getting steamed up here and we don't burn our hands so what we're doing here is we're creating them we're giving them a little bit of a heat steam melt to create a bit of tackiness and then our candies stick and they don't melt so once they feel kind of gooey a little bit gooey there it doesn't take very long just dump them into your sugar your sugar mix now for the most part you do about a cup of sugar to a quarter teaspoon or so of the citric acid and then taste that these guys didn't get steamed and give that a taste and see how you like it then just add a little bit at a time until you get the desired sourness that you would like or you can just sugar coat them you don't have to do the sour so once they're done you put them in the bowl mix them all up get your wrap parchment paper i don't have enough room ah i so need a bigger table then just shake off your excess and if there's any ones that didn't get coated just hold them over the steam and that's it onto the rack they're pretty much ready to go they take about 20 minutes to dry fully dry out and that's it you will have your sugar coating that will not melt and there you have them nicely coated sugar sour coated uh gummies that aren't going to melt on you all right guys so that's everything i have for you today i hope you enjoyed that video even though it was a do-over but good so is you did get to learn a couple of new things and that should greatly improve your candies all right so and once again thank you so much for joining me today and i hope you have an awesome rest of your day bye", "ifjcIiolSS8": "[Music] what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to be making cannabis gummy bears so let's get into it [Music] so the first thing you want to do is measure out your cannabis i'm going to be using seven grams of cannabis to make my gummy bears [Music] all right guys i got my seven grams of cannabis so now i'm going to put this in a mason jar and the carpet all right guys so now i'm going to decarb our cannabis for about 40 minutes and the oven temperature that i'm going to be using is 240. [Music] so all right guys so while your cannabis is the carving measure out your coconut oil so for this recipe we're going to be using a quarter cup of coconut oil i'm going to be using coconut mct oil to make my gummy bears so even though we're going to be using a quarter cup of coconut oil i'm going to measure out a half a cup of coconut oil because we're going to lose some of that coconut oil during the infusing process so just keep that in mind all right guys my cannabis is now the carb so now i'm going to add our coconut oil to the mason jar now i'm going to add a teaspoon of lecithin to my mason jar all right guys so now we're going to do is put this in a pot and let it simmer for about two hours add your pot to the stove [Music] add your mason jar now let it simmer for about two hours all right guys so i've been over two hours so now we're going to filter out our cannabis [Music] all right guys my cannabis coconut oil is now done so now let's start working on the cannabis gummies so before we start working on our gummies i'm going to spray my gummy molds with this non-stick cookie spray all right guys so now what i'm going to do is put my pipe on the stove and now we're going to turn the temperature on low [Music] so now i'm going to add in my water i'm going to be using 2 3 cups of water [Music] guys what i actually recommend you to do is turn your stove on like medium heat just so it can speed up the heating process and then once my water get kind of hot i'm going to reduce the temperature back down to two and then add in my cannabis oil and then all of the other ingredients so um so that's what i'm gonna do all right guys so i let my temperature stay on medium heat for about two minutes and now i can see the water is starting to boil a little bit so now what i'm gonna do is reduce the temperature back down to low [Music] all right so now we're going to do is add the candle oil [Music] now i'm just going to mix it together now another thing too guys usually water and oil wouldn't mix but that's why i added the lecithin to my can of oil so if you already have kind of oil made and it's not made with lecithin at this point i would add a teaspoon of lecithin so just keep that about all right guys so we're going to keep the temperature on low and i'm just going to let the water and the wall incorporate together all right guys my mist is fully incorporated so now we're going to add the unflavored [Music] gelatin [Music] and just mix it together so i'm just going to mix for about 2-3 minutes i want to make sure everything is incorporated all right guys so now we're going to do is add in our pack of [Music] jello [Music] all right guys so now we're going to do is add our mix to the mold all right guys so once you finish filling your modes put your bows in the freezer for a few hours [Music] all right guys so been about four hours so now we're going to remove the gummy bears from the mood so now what i'm trying to do is just remove some of the extra gummies from the gummy bears if that make any sense so so this right here i'm going to strip that from the gummy bears just to make it look a little bit better [Music] there we go [Music] all right guys my cannabis gummy bears is now done to my left is the medium-sized gummy bears and to my right is the small size gummy bears i personally like the medium size better but what i'm going to do is leave the link for both sides in the description below but um thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace [Music] you",

delicious all easy but they're not exactly keto so we can still have our gummy and eater too if you're on a keto diet so join me today as make my version of keto gummies now these keto gummies are ridiculously simple you just need two ingredients or three if you cut the water so the first one bean and this is the most important one for that gummy consistency is gelatine powder now this is what turns normal jello into a gummy consistency so i've got two cups of warm water so i'm going to add about two tablespoons of our gelatine mixture and we're just going to let that gelatin soak up all that water so just now that's all dissolved i'm just gonna give it a quick stir just to combine and now for the flavor i'm going to use some sugar-free jello now this just makes it far easier but if you don't have sugar-free jello just add some flavoring and say a little bit of stevia for sweetness so into our warm water i'm just going to pour in our sugar-free jello and just give it a good stir until it's completely dissolved okay so lastly i've just got a gummy mould now you can find these in most shops so it obviously makes no difference which one to use and just simply going to pour our mixture into each gummy mold [Music] okay so once you've filled up all your gummy moulds simply place it in the fridge for a good one or two hours to completely set now gummies have been in the fridge for a couple of hours so it's just a simple matter of removing them from our molds and look at that one delicious keto friendly gummy bear and there we have some delicious keto gummy bears now i've also made gummy worms gummy bottles gummy rings so this is certainly a very versatile recipe you can use any mold that you like any flavor that you like and it's completely healthy no sugar no carbs so whether you're making gummy bears or some delicious gummy worms either way they're going to taste simply [Music] delish [Music] you", "hOnV1X7ulRQ": "you're going on a bear hunt goodbye Haribo we

peach ring gummies I am including a recipe in this video but you can use any recipe you like you could even buy orange and yellow pre-made store-bought gummies and just melt those down and that will work just as well and this video is going to include some troubleshooting because I had quite a bit of issues making these I had to remould them multiple times I'm gonna show you guys how they started which was like this but eventually I got to them to come out like this here's what you're going to need 1/3 of a cup of water three and a half tablespoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below 1 teaspoon citric acid 1/2 teaspoons of peach flavoring oil 1 tablespoon of Tincher 1/4 cup of sugar 1/4 cup corn syrup 1/2 a tablespoon lecithin white food coloring and yellow and orange food coloring the first step is to bloom your gelatin so just pour your gelatin over your dish of water as well as your citric acid your potassium sorbate mixture your flavoring oil and the lecithin no need to stir this just leave it to bloom for about 5 minutes now pour your sugar and your quan syrup into a saucepan and heat that up once that begin to melt you can add in half of your gelatin mixture and then stir that in you're going to add in a candy thermometer and you want to keep stirring and heating up this mixture until it reaches between 200 to 210 degrees once it's heated up to that temperature you can add in your remaining gelatin mixture and stir that in then turn off the heat now I'm just going to pour in my tincture and stir that in and then because I'm going to be doing three different colors I'm going to separate this into different dishes I'm going to be coloring one yellow one orange and this one here is white and yellow I filled up a pyrex dish with very hot water to keep my mixtures warm while I'm not using them and then I'm going to pour my first one into a plastic bag that I have sprayed with cooking spray so it doesn't stick and then I'm going to fill up the first half of my molds alright so you can clearly see I'm having a lot of issues pouring the mixture into the molds it's too sticky it's making a mess and not coming out smoothly so I try to warm it up again and that is not working so I am just going to have to figure out how to fix these and what I decided to do was to take them all out and remelt them with some more water and a little bit of gelatin so I added a couple tablespoons of water a few for the microwave for about 30 seconds and then now I'm going to add in half a teaspoon of gelatin and just mix that in I decided instead of a plastic bag I'm going to put it into a squeeze bottle so I'll have better control of how much is coming out and you can see how amazingly it's coming out it's absolutely perfect I was very happy I also added a little bit of water to each of my yellow and orange but not extra gelatin as there wasn't a large enough amount for it to matter I wanted to try and see if I could put the yellow and orange directly on top obviously I couldn't so that means I needed to leave it in a freezer to cool down for a bit and then after all of that work I realized something very unfortunate and that is that I did everything in the wrong order so the curved part of this mold is on the bottom meaning that I needed to have the orange and the yellow on the bottom and the yellowy white color so once again I am pulling them out and going to warm them up and remould them and then I just threw it in the microwave and poured it back into my little squeeze bottle and everything looks like it's gonna be perfect third time's the charm right let's hope so well after this was done I put them in the freezer for about half an hour and they were good to come oh they look beautiful well after all this hard work I am happy to say they came out very nice they have a beautiful texture they look wonderful hopefully if any of you guys try this out some of my mistakes will help you guys not make them and then I want something to have sugar on them so I'm just gonna throw the ones that have a little bit of imperfections into a container of sugar shake them up and then lay them out to dry and just a reminder that before you cover your gummies in sugar you need to make sure you have let them sit out for at least 24 hours so any excess moisture evaporates otherwise they will become watery thank you guys very much for watching this video if you enjoyed it please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe also let me know do you guys prefer shorter videos that I don't include any troubleshooting or errors or you prefer videos like this where I kind of talk about things that can go wrong and how you can fix them let me know in the

again just in case give it a taste that's pretty good there is a strong marijuana taste to it however Dusty's like lemonade but the after room the more I sit here the more it tastes like marijuana there's a strong there I want to have to taste but the initial flavor is quite good but it does linger still lingering but it's not gonna unless you test the taste of weed edibles now this is gonna be just fine but yeah so the dozers gee strawberry lemon-aid cannabis infused tastes a little bit like weed tastes okay but the most important thing as we all know is how it makes you feel and so I'm going to jail this bad boy drink the rest of this off and come back to you guys in two hours and let you know thanks so much for watching we'll see you soon hi guys we are back here on weeks it's been two hours since I have consumed this drink down this bottle of dozers strawberry lemonade I'm not sure why there's a G on it it says dozers on the back but yet there's a drink the G and a strawberry and eliminate I don't know dozer I I'm not a hundred percent sure it's actually even called juicers to be honest but I would not recommend it so don't concern yourself with what the name is the more I drink of it the worse it started it tastes it started it tastes less like strawberry lemonade weed and urine mixed together and two hours later I don't really feel very high at all which is especially disappointing because my tolerance has been a little bit lower recently because I'm just getting back from vacation so I just wanted to let you know if you see dozers or this random G and a dispensary near you hard pass no thang I'm looking forward to reviewing some more drinks in the future to see if my mind changes but right now wheats would not recommend you spend your money on drinks thank you

"hi well welcome to Diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much your support has been truly awesome so I had a couple requests there for vegan gummy bears and as I said it previously in the past I tried it with epic fail and so but I am never one to give up so I kept thinking about the method I knew would have just something to do with the method so I I thought I figured it out and the fact that you're seeing this video actually means that I did figure it out so I've created a vegan gummy candy for you so it's not gonna be exactly like a gummy bear but it's gonna be about as close and probably with you being vegan this is probably something that you're far more used to anyway and and with that yeah so I'm really excited to be able to bring that for it to you and the one thing I decided is if I'm ever gonna want to pick up somebody rich I'm gonna pick up a vegan because seriously man if they can afford the Google's groceries or that kind of food holy mountain they must have money because that stuff is expensive so anyway I'm gonna get into the ingredients here and the steps on how to do it and stay tuned alrighty so for our vegan can of oil gummies you're going to need well now I'm just making a small batch because I'm testing it so I'm not a hundred percent sure if this is gonna turn out and I really don't feel like wasting a whole bunch however if it does turn out you're if you're seeing the video then you know it's turned out so I'm going to be using 1 cup of juice I'm just using a peach cocktail you can use whatever juice that you'd like just not pineapple juice because it has an enzyme in it and that will that I know causes gelatin not to set I'm going to think it probably has the same effect on agar you're going to use one and a half tablespoons to one cup of the liquid if you want to make it more so if you're going to go 2 cups of liquid then you would do two and a half tablespoons of agar 3 cups of liquid three and a half a garb so on we're going to use one tablespoon of blue a gob syrup a quarter cup of our can of oil now I've just used regular coconut oil I haven't infused it because again I'm not going to eat this so I didn't really want to waste it and there's really no difference whether I've got THC in it or not and we're going to use Gore gum as our emulsifier so we're no further ado and we're gonna need our handy little blender and a saucepan and a spatula obviously your molds and that should be about it so I'm just gonna get this stuff cleared up and we'll get going alright so we're going to turn our heat on - so we're going to add our liquid to our saucepan and we're going to add in one tablespoon of the aghasura that's a coconut it was a lot different than butter so what we're gonna do is we're going to emulsify our our oil and our liquid first when I've tried it the other way adding everything into the agha R it just didn't work so I'm hoping that emulsifying our liquid and our oil together first is gonna solve that problem so I'm going to use 1/2 a teaspoon of our agar our sorry of our Gore gum Gorgo Mogar it's very tongue-twisting if you have a strainer like a little small strainer strainer works great for doing the gums so because you can evenly distribute it all over the top otherwise if you have to do it with your hands just try and do it as evenly as possible just kind of take little pinches and sprinkle it around like so and we're going to get our handy little hand wonder and start blending this up [Music] all right so that looks all thoroughly mixed so that looks good all our oil is nicely blended in so once you're that it's all nicely blended and it is all one uniform nice uniform homogeneous texture you're gonna add in one and a half tablespoons a Gaur now you can get Oh Garf lakes or agar powder the flakes are less expensive the powder I'm pretty sure you would use at the same but you'd have to look at the instructions for it I just don't have a hue a lot of experience with us with it and a half a tablespoon is one and a half teaspoons three teaspoons is one tablespoon and you're going to turn your heat up to medium-high we're going to bring this to a boil and once it's boiling we're going to turn it down and let it simmer for five minutes so now that my mixture is coming to a boil I'm going to turn it down to medium medium-low and just let that simmer for five minutes or until it is completely dissolved and you just want to keep make sure to keep stirring that alright so I'm kind of seeing some oil the oil sitting on the top here so I'm going to use the blender here to see if we can get that mixed in there because that's not looking quite right [Music] so I'm still seeing it set up at the top here the oil on the top so I'm gonna add in some more I'm gonna add a little more girl gum so I'm going to add in just a quarter of a teaspoon this time [Music] well that looks a lot better all right so what we're going to do now is distribute this in to our moles so whether you're using your squirt bottles this might be a little bit thick for the for an eyedropper but you can give it a try all right so once your your syrup looks like this it's nice and smooth no lumps you can put it into your squirt bottle oops oh [ __ ] all right don't do that on the mold learn from my mistakes all right so I'm just gonna clean up that bottle we'll get this into molds all righty so now that I've cleaned up my mess now the bottle is going to be very hot so you want to wrap it either in a some doubled up paper towel or use an oven mitt or something and you're just going to distribute it into your molds now don't fill your molds all the way up to the top like I just did there that's an oops you want to keep them just below and that's so it doesn't create an edge a sharp edge on your candies now with agar you're just gonna leave these sit on the counter for a few hours for them to set they do not go in the refrigerator whatever you do a guard is not set in the fridge it is completely different than gelatin also has a very different texture well if you're vegan and you you use agar you know what the texture is like but for those of you too new to it are trying it something different it is a different completely different texture than gelatin I can't really describe it it is a gelatin but it's not jello it's filling these up and I'll come back in a couple of hours we'll take them out and see what happens right so let's see how these little puppies came out well they come out of the mold really holy mackerel they actually worked this time I can't believe it last time they were partially set and partially mushy and they were really disgusting but this this method actually worked so I did some reading on how you actually store these because you can't do them like a regular gummy bear or a regular gummy candy and with four agar actually it says but it's served best cold so actually once they're all set you know just put them on a plate put them in the fridge for a couple of for about an hour George's for them to cool down get cold and then give them a try so I'm gonna do that and we'll see how they are now these puppies just pop right out of the mold look at that lot easier than the jello look bear overboard alrighty so I put these guys into the fridge for an hour and so they're nice and cold and you can see how much they lighten up and as well they're not as greasy so when you first take these guys out they are gonna feel a little bit greasy once you put them in the fridge that tends that goes away but as I said you can probably see you store them in the fridge I'll just wrap them up in wrap it up with saran wrap and they'll probably be good for about two weeks I'm gonna guess if you find that different please let me know in the comments that would be great alright so that is the little tutorial there on a vegan can of oil gummy bears and I'll just be back to say goodbye so that was my little demonstration there on vegan and can of oil gummy candies I hope you enjoyed the demonstration if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I will get back to you as soon as I can and I'd love to hear from you and let me know how yours turned out alright well thank you so much for watching I really appreciate it and if you enjoyed this video I do hope you subscribe thanks again have an awesome day [Music]", "EHBqjp1NS7o": "what's up guys Sara here and today I want to show you guys how you can easily calculate dosage when making your own edibles so the first thing to understand is that the average dose is considered to be ten milligrams if you're new to using cannabis or you have a really low tolerance level you might need like half of that maybe even less if you have chronic pain or your chronic user you might need considerably more so it's just good to maybe aim for the 10 milligram mark and when you eat your edible eat like half of it wait the 60 to 90 minutes and see how you feel and then you know for next time maybe you need the whole thing maybe you need to maybe you need even less okay but when we're calculating the dosage when you're making your edibles at home it's kind of nice because you can gate you can make them basically cater to exactly what you need based on your personal requirements so what you want to start off with is some cannabis obviously and this is more than a gram but like just for simplicity sake let's say this as a gram of cannabis now when we're talking about dosage we deal in milligrams like I said the average dose is 10 milligrams so I'm gonna take this one gram and convert it to milligrams one gram of cannabis is a thousand milligrams okay and then if you know the strain then you will know what the dosage is of THC in that cannabis so some strains have 22% some have only 12% the average is 10% so if you don't know what it is go with the 10% mark but obviously it can vary quite a bit it's best if you know what the strain is that's that you're using so we've got a thousand milligrams in our one gram and for simplicity sake again we're gonna state we're gonna go with the average teach the content which is 10% so 10% of a thousand milligrams we go 10% times a thousand I got 100 milligrams so in that one gram of cannabis there's a hundred milligrams of THC now let's say I'm gonna make a batch of cannabis infused coconut oil so I'm gonna take a cup of coconut oil I'm going to infuse it with cannabis and then I'm gonna use it to make something gummies or cookies or whatever okay so I have my one cup of coconut oil I add my 1 gram of cannabis which is a thousand milligrams which contains a hundred milligrams of THC so I know now that in this one cup of coconut oil there's a hundred milligrams of THC now when I go to bake with this let's say again for simplicity reasons or sake I am going to use that whole cup of coconut oil and in a bake a batch of cookies and I got 25 cookies out of that batch so I've used the whole cup I've used the hundred milligrams of THC and I got 25 cookies so I go 100 milligrams you know that was in that recipe divided by the 25 cookies so I know that each one of those cookies has 4 milligrams of THC in it and like we said the average dose is 10 milligrams so this would be a really good like starter amount for somebody you can have one cookie which only has 4 milligrams of THC see how you feel next time maybe you need two cookies or next time you make a batch of cannabis infused coconut oil maybe you use two brands or three brands or whatever depending on what you need personally so that's a really easy way to we calculate dosage when making your own edibles so that you can better control your own medicine and how it best works for you thanks so much for joining me guys if you're new to the

"XwDbtYweiVk": "you're watching B TV welcome back to B TV a year ago this next company was number 12 in its category today they're number one by a wide margin in the cannabis edibles market in California the largest legal cannabis market in the world plus products makes gummies so how do you create such a successful brand and become a revenue generating company so quickly to find out we spoke with the company's two co-founders Justin crunchy Quinn and Jake hi mark we started in edibles because we thought that was the place where there's a lot of things that can go wrong and if you get them right what you've done is actually create a great brand however on the way to making gummies jaqen crunchy made cannabis gum with a little help from Jake's parents the only space that we could afford was his parents free garage so who we've moved there and we built a makeshift cleanroom for the first six months of the company it was basically R&D facility office manufacturing facility packaging facility it was everything gum eventually led to gummies with his knowledge of cooking from his career as a chef and his experience in the cannabis industry Crunchie was well aware of what it would take to make a great gummy these look really good cooking especially at a high level is the blend of art and science it's the ability to give people the experience that they want the experience that they didn't even know they wanted a lot of the infusion process is extremely scientific and the flavors and how we do special additions and how people feel about the products that's the artistry what we've done is taken gummies which can be a category where it's tossed into different bags or boxes that can sort of not be an attractive format and we've made them really small which was hard to do to make them precisely dosed and then put them in a really convenient when you turn the top off of the tin what you have is all of the gummies right there and their beauty and their deliciousness it's a really important part of the customer experience that has made us products so successful in California looking good and tasting great our only part of the equation one of the hardest things to do really well in a manufactured cannabis product is to get the dosing exactly right every time if a product is too strong people wind up in the couch and you never want to try the product again if the products too weak you don't move it on and so getting that balance really between the two is the most essential thing to the customer and having the right selection of flavors has definitely helped win over customers we look at what people are enjoying in other parts of the market not just gummies just you know flavor trends things that people are really into now with the special editions we look at the short term trends and also things that we've never seen before that we know that we can actually execute so we do both seasonal and we do things based around holidays because you're selling an experience it's tapping into the desires of people around specific times and what about tapping into markets beyond California as more and more states legalize it's really important to think through what's going to make a successful national brand a plus we do one thing to make manufactured cannabis products and it puts us in a unique position to actually do that same thing in every state and in other countries in a way that is simple for customers it's simple for partners our ingredient suppliers understand it and the focus of the company is all line on one goal which is making really great products but with mainstream success comes responsibility I think there's an opportunity for the entire cannabis industry to actually bring us from where we are today to be a more mature responsible and adult this tree if you look at the alcohol industry they put a lot of time and effort to make sure that drunk driving wasn't something that people wanted to do at plus we hope to be a leader in those companies who are helping others to understand the benefits but also some of the potential downsides of cannabis we think all cannabis companies should do the same we work every day to make products that we like to say would make our grandmothers proud there's a lot of heart and soul that goes into every single product that comes about out of our factory and that's why in every package it says made with love in California plus products has recently launched mints and with the acquisition of good co-op will be selling baked goods also made with love [Music]", "aeAwCMHrxP8": "[Music] what is up guys welcome to another video hey man for today's video man i have a bunch of gummies in here as you can see so we're gonna go ahead and try this thing out these gummies are special there are what you call edibles so basically this thing has a 50 milligrams of thc as you can see right there 50 milligrams of thc and uh so if you guys don't know what thc is so let me see thc or tetra hydrocannabinol is the chemical responsible for most of marijuana's psychological effects it acts much like the cannabinoid chemicals made naturally by the body according to the national institute on drug abuse so this gummies right here contains some kind of thc um so basically thc you will find out in a marijuana flower or a marijuana product so technically i live here in washington marijuana pot mary jane dahon whatever you call it it's legal out here as long as you have your state id and your uh as long as you have your state id actually and if you're 21 and up you can actually go to the store and get some marijuana but on this case i have this this is different kind of taking marijuana i'm not saying that i'm taking marijuana you know like i do this i do marijuana i do hardcore drugs no okay no this is a gummies so [Music] marijuana marijuana is so broad guys marijuana is so broad uh some people believe that it can cure cancer can cure illness it can cure epilepsies and stuff like that so they made a different bunch of products that have thc on it because they knew they thought that marijuana can help alleviate you know pain stress anxiety and some illness and you know some people can just smoke that [ __ ] you know some people cannot just smoke and feel the effect some people needs to drink it some people needs to have gummies like this to feel the full effect of the thc so in this case i have these gummies right so man i'll make another video on this marijuana thing okay so for today's video i just want to go ahead and test this out and uh see what will be the effects on me after an hour so basically this is just a gummy it's like you know it's like gummy worms but it doesn't shake like worms and it says here at the back activation time is 45 minutes cannabinoid edibles can take after two hours or more to take effect so that's just another warning but yeah man enough of the talk i'm gonna go ahead and try this thing out so i'm gonna go ahead and try whoops oh crap i'm gonna go ahead and try this mango flavor okay and then we'll see what will be the effects are right now i'm clear i just i'm good i just had water so i didn't i didn't have no alcohol i didn't no nothing you know and i've tried an edible before i would probably recommend edible than smoking on marijuana but enough of the talk let's go ahead and try this edible let's go ahead and try this up let's open this thing up come on it doesn't taste any let me get one of these shout out again to jj man thank you for this um thank you for the edible let's go ahead and try this thing out so i think 50 milligrams each for one of these um gummies so this the gummy right there that's the gummy that's it you know it's a regular gummy [Music] hmm [Music] hmm [Music] hmm it's sticking in my my teeth alright so right now it's [Music] um right now it's 3 44. i know if you guys can see that it's just too bright but it's 3 44. man come on bro it's 3 45 right now probably don't see that but it's 3 45 so in about an hour so i would say about 4 45 i might feel the effect i don't know but we'll see and uh yeah man let's see what's going on let's see what's gonna happen [Applause] it tastes like mango tastes like gummies it actually tastes good but yeah let's see what's gonna happen and i'll see you guys in an hour [Music] peace [Music] what

but i didn't feel any effect i mean i don't know i don't know i just didn't feel the effect um i'm not sure if it's 50 milligrams per one gummies so i didn't really feel the effect on this one so yeah i'm a little bit disappointed because you know i thought there was something on it i thought i was gonna feel it immediately but it's been almost an hour now nothing really happens nothing really changed i still feel normal i still feel the same so yeah i mean i mean it's worth a try and uh shout out again to jj for giving me those um gummies thank you so much brother i appreciate it uh yeah

"RIMPb0wXPfM": "this is one gonna be there this is ten coming back and this is 1000 gummy bear oh no we loved one ooh 1000 mm mmm they smell good I feel like there are a lot more lollipops then gummy bears I think it looks a bit bigger now this looks like a thousand gummy and just kidding it's a camera trick and today we're gonna be mixing 10,000 gummy bears into one giant gummy bear [Music] oh my gosh guys I can't believe we did it we melted 10,000 gummy bears into one giant gummy bear hey guys it's wengie and gummy bear hugs today is another epic DIY day we are mixing 10,000 gummy bear and instead of making a giant gummy bear I'm gonna make a giant wee bit it's not really like a bear bear he's a panda bear that you know looks quite delicious because the Q's I'm also gonna show you a bunch of experiments hacks and DIY so you can do with gummy bear let's get started and go shopping safely we have social distancing let's get [Music] [Applause] like 19 of these we cleared out the store he need a hundred so we're gonna go to the next door there's two kinds of bags in this pie of 160 grams and holds approximately 70 gummies accounted this multi bag holds 90 gummies and it's 200 grams we have sixty five bags of dish with brings up a total of ten thousand four hundred gummies are you gonna do that no I already ate it you ain't 400 oh no no no maybe like 200 300 small packs are pretty easy to open I could just open them up and tip out the gummy bears these multi-path have to open the big path and each of the individual packs so here is our Neutral 1000 gummies now it's time to unwrap these Oh easy than I thought alright guys I think we're 1/3 of the way through I'm trying not to eat these gummy bears you just ate - I wonder if cats like gummy bears really you don't like them it is not to my liking I prefer lasers yuck where is my fisherman never tried a gummy bear below you have your own YouTube channel yes I do subscribe or I will do few lucky cooker you wanna try coming there anything is this friend no it's weird uh-huh you prefer the camera Oh No okay I'm out ah he's out too Haley's cats don't let go me oh you know what I need coffee okay finally [Applause] I just realized I have a gummy bear planned decoration because I just green light give me a thumbs up guys thank me for my efforts [Music] alright guys we did it a mountain of 10,000 gummi bears if I lean back it looks huge [Music] now we're gonna figure out how to melt all of these so first up we're gonna try microwaving your pup a few yellow gummies into the dog whoa the bubbly it dried up and solidified straightaway anything this is liquid enough for me to do anything with microwave didn't work out so well you know what there's like a super cool live hack that you can do in the oven let's test it out [Music] I'm gonna show you guys how to make some gummy bear lollipops all you need for this hack is gummy bears lollipop sticks and baking paper let's make some lollipops I'm going to be using the four gummy bears per lollipop then I'm just gonna pop them in the oven and wait for them to know when they're melted just please see a lollipop sticks onto the gummies we have the lollipops what I actually did was put them in the fridge make them solid and they look really good now you have a gummy lollipop it's shochu mmm it's tough this next half is so cool you can make super cute gummy bear charms using hot glue if you can't find a gummy bear mold you can make your own using some liquid silicon I just got these glitter hot glue sticks I can't wait to test them out the glue stick please your hot glue into the mold are set I put them in the fridge to speed up the process so let's pop them out to the cutest can decorate you can make jewelry out of it you can decorate your books with it you can stick them anywhere so adorable so you don't have to mix 10,000 bits to see a giant gummy bear i'm gonna show you what hack we can take this little bit right here and make him grow up fast you need a cut and then you want to fill it let's take a gummy and drop it after about 24 hours of the gummy grows in size as it takes in the water pretty cool trick right it is time to make my Ellie bear mole imagine eating a gummy bear as videos of this we there there and there that making a mold out of a soft toy is a little bit awkward but I'm gonna make it work so usually I'd use a two-pot silicon mixture but we would need so much of that mixture because he is so big kind of expensive so instead I bought a whole bunch of liquid silicon sealant from the hardware store [Music] oh that actually work be there there we're gonna make a replica of you oh why you so heavy panda bear it's my hormones can you believe that I hold you of this was only two dollars a tea technically I've tested this before are now mini-mall did earlier with the hot glue but I haven't done it on something so big so I'm hoping at home so my panda bear is ready he is definitely not happy we're gonna prepare a bowl of warm water and turn it can actually dip our hands in it and mold the silicon as soon as it hits the bear you smooth it on and make sure it takes its shape we don't have the detergent on our hands is gonna stick to our hand depending on the brand you buy this stop can smell really bad prepared myself a face mask oh it's like a snake oh that's Christ out of fungi [Music] oh it feels like clay this action is pretty good it feels very satisfying I'm just molding the silicon around mr. panda bear it's actually quite easy to be honest and you're starting to feel like it's a bit more tacky onto your hand you've run out of detergent so you should read it [Music] and a bear is fully encased in silicon it was actually easier than I thought now we wait for you to say Amy I stuck the gummy bear 100 go looks like the gummy bear two three four five seven eight oh boo my side becomes yeah oh no no - - all right guys it's been 24 hours panda has been chilling in his silicon mold ooh it feels dry it's so fancy he see that I'm really impressive this silicon hat doesn't smell too bad like from here but if you really get close he smells like your vinegar on my nose oh you see that he's coming right off that is so cool I mean and it hasn't really damaged his fur at all like peeling Elmer's glue off your hand oh yeah actually much easier that he's actually a soft boy cuz like what I'm doing is I'm pushing down and he's peeling off the silicon I finally got the mold up oh my gosh that is kind of really satisfying use unharmed I can see the face on the other side that's crazy all right let's put him down ooh that's not good we have a problem panda let himself go in a 10,000 coming bear panda bear is not holding himself up and we're gonna have to pour the gummy in while he's facing down what we need is like a little bit of support to hold his arms up let me go right and then back in the mold so that you can keep its shape while we fill Oh guys we are rescuing Panda oh all that with vinegar was so struck the mold looks really good I was time to melt outcomes alright guys so this is my yummy rainbow Roy CG this rainbow is getting worse every we are so many different shades of orange and yellow oh there's some Reds making its way in there my bad [Music] time phalanges random facts they didn't need to know but I'm gonna tell you anyways because I wanna tell me best were invented in 1922 by German candy maker Hans Reigle I hope I pronounced that correctly Oh sadly the green gummy bears are actually strawberry flavors and sir confused I guess I got a taste at home apparently the clear ones a pineapple flavor II oh okay the flavor is so subtle and speaking of giant gummy bears that we're gonna make today the biggest one money can buy is actually 36 pounds the one we're gonna make today is actually going to be 44 pounds looking at random facts and weird things if you guys want to see more of this don't forget to subscribe to react accordance with me and max actually look at a lot of these things it's time to get melting alright let's go [Music] this is the last year's save his ears so now it's time to wait for mr. yummy panda bear to set so it's been a full day halfway through I was checking up on the gummy and seeing if it was setting or some reason it wasn't sitting properly it was still really gooey put it in the fridge buzz off fridge isn't that big to kind of take him out of the ride and a squash him up it should be set by now oh no you know what he is perfectly solid but he is very out of shape oh you they're heavy oh my god oh I mean he was so cute before the guy was still really sticky I don't think Ari melted gummy sets really well now we know it's better to meet gummy from scratch his ear came out so well this is so heavy you left out for the week got on a diet and flat on his stomach bit me he ain't good abs it's kind of a bear shape let's peel him oh my god he's still kind of have a face [Music] he's actually very yes [Music] oh my gosh guys I can't believe we did it we melted 10,000 gummy bears into one giant gummy bear we made out of mold we melted it all he came through I actually didn't know if this was possible when I started the video he is adorable slightly deformed but that's okay we love a unique bear and I wanted to make like a nice different rainbow color thing but it just kinda looks Brown this is a normal gummy bear and this is my giant 10,000 gummy bear bear how's it look guys it is time to eat my goat hey Matt yeah how long do you think he'll take you to eat is gummy bear I think you and making a bed for what oh if you can eat it in two hours I'll wash your dishes for a whole week but if you can you have two editions I'm Prince okay that's good I'm sure it's

another offsides with series next week let me know what you want me to do and I'll see you in my next bye guys love you MA", "YmpPGpPUw0Q": "[Music] hi guys welcome to Diamond delight edibles if this is the first time you're joining my name is Liz and all-you-can regular guys welcome back thank you so much for your support I just popped that 10,000 market oh my god think you could not have done any of that without your support guys I really really appreciate it it just means the world to me you like me you really really like me sorry just being an ass having some fun alright so today what I'm gonna do now that I showed you how to do canna candy sugar & Canas syrup we can now make our gummies without using butter and the Gerber is an emulsifier however if you want to make them super super strong absolutely go ahead and stuff the butter back in there but this gives you far more control over how strong or weak that you would like to make them now you guys are always asking me how much milligrams etc something is and I don't generally tend to answer that very often because it is all dependent upon what you make how you make it once you're starting THC is etc so what I've done is in the description there I've included a link for the calculator that I use it's a free signup it's a little course you're more than welcome to have a look take a look at it listen to her she's really interesting and lots of information but the calculator you can use for free and that's what I use so then you can go ahead and you can make your calculations and figure out how strong etc that you want to make your candies and with this it gives you a lots of versatility so you can go all can of sugar and syrup or half-and-half which is what I'm gonna do in the recipe so I will stop babbling on now and I'm gonna get into the ingredients of course and of course what we need and then we'll put all that stuff together and make some awesome gummies there we go alright guys all right so for our new gelatin for our new gummy version here you're gonna use one box of your paper flavored jello I three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water for blooming your gelatin or what I use are these kool-aid waters so they're just flavored water so I now use these in place of water they're great because they add more flavour to it or you can kind of combine some flavors which is really cool to do so I use those things are nice they're lighter and sugar and said just adding more flavor now another thing you can do for adding flavor is juice crystals now I get these at the bulk bar and you can only get them during the summer time but I get these in all different flavors and I've got two tablespoons of those again enhancing the flavor that way if you don't want to use or have these flavors artificial flavors you can go use those which work great the other thing you're going to need is a quarter cup of your can of syrup and a quarter cup of water for our jello and then for our candy side our candy version so it's going to be like the other one where we do the cook you're going to need a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar or again you can use a full can of sorry a full cup of your can of sugar same thing with your syrup I'm using a quarter cup of canned syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup again you can go and use as much or as little of either of those as you like I like to do the half-and-half mainly for taste and not to kill people so that's my kind of my you I don't want anybody rendered completely useless and then we are going to need 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and then as well if you want to add additional colors or flavors you can add those optionally as well and as I said if you want to add your butter as well it really makes them super duper you can do that you're just going to follow exactly the same thing except the previous steps from the previous version with regards to adding the butter and the Goregaon to emulsify it now something else I wanted to say and the same thing now in this version I'm not using the clear gel however you can use the clear gel exactly the same way as you do in the previous recipe of the regular and sour gummy recipe that's a good one to follow it's the most up-to-date and gives you both those versions that you can use and that's all we need for our ingredients and now we'll get into our equipment and then we will get the best part go and we'll get all this stuff put together alright so the equipment that you're going to need just like the other recipes a double boiler I just do a makeshift I get a bowl that will make sure that your water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you will need a smaller saucepan for our candy syrup two spatulas you will need your candy thermometer and you will need a larger pot that your bought is that your saucepan small saucepan will fit into ice water water with ice in it but a little tongue-tied today and obviously your candy molds now a lot of you ask me how many candy is gum you will get out of a batch now it's all depending obviously on the size molds that you use if you use about this large size I got these from Michaels you will get about sixty if you use of this size gummy which is kind of a little bit larger than those big ones you're going to get it probably about 75 to 100 and if you use the little teeny tiny ones then you're going to get about 150 to 200 of them so that's approximately what that recipe will break down to you for you and now d'leh before we get started there is something very important that I found out from my other recipe when I started this is and I don't do this in the other recipes but when we're working with the can of sugar and the can of syrups it is a must that we oil down the sides and the insides of our pot for the candy syrup reason being when it heats up and starts boiling the oil THC oil starts to separate and it sticks to the smiths of the metal of the pot you might have noticed that if you did that with a can of syrup which is why I redid the video for that specific reason so we're going to do things a little bit differently than we do for the regular candy recipe but I'll show you all those details once we get into it but the very first thing and don't really don't want to forget is we're going to lightly grease our saucepan and hold on just couldn't dribble a little bit of oil into it and then make sure to work it all the way around make sure to get it right into the corners because anywhere that this oil is not where there's no oil your THC will sit the only thing that dissolves THC oil is oil because it is oil soluble by doing this we're going to be able to scrape anything that sticks to the sides off much much easier then seeing all your products that they're going oh what happened so you said you want to lightly grease that you don't want to have any excess oil so make sure to do that up as well as your spatulas you want to lightly oil your spatulas for the same reason when we scrape it off the sides if these are not oiled it sticks to it and it doesn't come off so you want to make sure anything that is going to be touching the THC the syrup you want to make sure that you all and that's it I'm gonna get into putting our ingredients together and get this started oh one other thing I wanted to cover is with your moles I don't spray my moles beforehand but I have found sometimes that they do stick but so what I do is I care them so I will spray them or oil them down lightly let it sit for 20 minutes in the mold and then wash them out so it still leaves that oily feel but it's not gonna leave your Piquet knees all greasy and makes it far easier for them to come as well as you only have to cure them once every few once every five or six batches or so so it lasts a long time by doing it that way all right so now I promise we'll get into the ingredients in our candy all righty so the very first thing that we are going to do is we are going to microwave our quarter cup of liquid for about 50 seconds till it's boiling and we're going to bloom our unflavored gelatin all right so you're going to evenly sprinkle your gelatin over the top of your liquid whether you use water or the kool-aid water and then you are going to stir it in now a lot of punches I explained in about whether that your gummies did not are not that they're too sticky but they're not gelatin enough that can depend a lot of power on your gelatin I just bought a batch of gelatin because I buy a bulb that didn't it wasn't blooming at the strength of it or something was not working well I did two batches and I had almost double the gelatin so a lot of it is dependent upon your gelatin now one test that I do is when I put in the three tablespoons and mix it in it should start very quickly to get the texture of apple sausage and clicking up pretty quickly now this is not so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add in another half a tablespoon of gelatin yes I've just sprinkled on another half a tablespoon and I'm gonna stir that in and now I'm getting that texture of applesauce can you kind of see what I mean that's how you know you're probably are at the great strength for your gelatin starting off if your gelatin is not right from the beginning if it's mushy I'll show you when we go to put this in but that's the texture it should be once you once we've got it mixed in now we're gonna set that aside for five minutes or so to let that bloom now meanwhile we will add our box of jell-o I'm giving the blueberries well berry blue and we are going to add in our boiling water and stir that around and get it dissolving see was it and then just keep scraping because the jello will cause the sides of the bowl are cool it's good to just kind of stick to it so just keep scraping the sides down as you go and turn your heat on to low so again we only want to melt our gelatin over a hot water bath we don't want it hot at boiling at all that's what breaks our gelatin a lot of the time is you don't even think that you've got it too hot but really past hot water probably by 150 degrees it is that's about all you need so that's that's a big mistake that a lot of people make myself included so I'm just going to continue to stir that gently until the gelatin is dissolved and then we will add in our corn syrup and our other stuff and once your gelatin and that has started to melt the sugar takes longer because the sugar melts at a higher at a bit of a higher heat so it just takes a little bit longer but once your gelatin and that is melted you can add in your corn syrup and your flavor crystals if you're wanting to add so you saw your canister your quarter cup of Kanna syrup and then your flavored juice crystals if you want to add those in as additional flavoring and again just stir that until it all starts gets incorporated and now for you guys asking for those clear gummies how do I get my gummies clear this well you can now you could have perfectly clear gummies so I'm gonna kick it continue to stir this and just gently mix it together until everything is melted and combined I'd you notice I got my nails done so for all of you those wishing that I get them done they're done and to those of you commented there you go I know I looked at the videos and thought make and those are ratty looking hands so I do apologize hopefully it'll be better from now on in the future I hope you like these a little bit better do you got a look at them for quite a long time so why not make them a little bit more attractive and also just remember to continually scrape down the sides of your bowl so that the gelatin is not sticking to the sides and just to show you this is just how hot your water should be there shouldn't be any boiling just a little bit of steam coming off of that that's as how that's as hard as you want to get it otherwise any hotter than that it's gonna break your gelatin alright so now that everything's pretty much dissolved I'm going to add in our gelatin now here's another thing if your gelatin is after 5 minutes or so blooming is mushy when you touch it then your gelatin is not strong enough so whether it's old and it's weakened or there are different gelatin with different strengths if it is nice and firm to the touch and no mushy you're good to go so I just split this up into pieces slap her in and you're just gonna let that you're just gonna gently again stir that until it completely melts and again if you start to see any kind of foaming may take it off your heat immediately it's getting too hot so I'm just gonna let them set them going to continue to stir that until my gelatin is fully melted well once your gelatin is melted and everything looks good and it is nice and translucent just set it off to the side and now we're going to start our candy syrup alright for our candy syrup in goes our half a cup of white sugar our half a cup of Candace Canon sugar our Candace syrup quarter cup a can of syrup like I said before you're more than welcome to play around with your different measurements on that as long as it equals 1/2 a cup either way it doesn't matter and our quarter cup of light corn syrup our half a cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to gently stir that till ever - your syrup till your sugar and water and everything's just combined and then once you're combined here turn your heat on to medium Cline to start and then we're going to drop it down to medium once it begins to boil and you're just going to continue stirring this make sure to get all around the edges because the sugar likes to sit there and so we're going to continue to stir this until it starts to boil now all of my and all the other candy recipes I say as soon as we start boiling we're gonna stop stirring and use our brush not in this recipe and I'll show you once it starts boiling as I said the oils yeah I got a little syrup on the burner there so the oils start to separate out with the heat and until it gets all to the same kind of temperature it will they will stick to the side so we're going to have to continually work the sides of the pot but you're going to want to be very very gentle because we don't want to spit dirt into the syrup so as I said I'll show that all to you once it gets there now you'll start to notice as as it's starting to heat up if you scrape the sides of your pot see all that that's your oil and that's what we want to make sure it gets back into our syrup so I usually have to use the two you want as I said you have to grease both spatulas here and work it off get it back into the syrup and we're gonna have to do this continuously through the whole cooking process so at anytime that you see any darkness starting to form on the side make sure to scrape it down and as your syrup gets hotter you can just put your spatula in it'll just melt it off and also make sure when you are scraping the sides of your pot hold on to the handle firmly I've done it before I wasn't paying attention and whoops and the last thing you want is molten lava being poured anywhere other keeping it in the pot so when your syrup begins to bubble starts boiling you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and remember this is normally where I say we stop stirring not this time so we're not actually going to stir it what we're gonna do is just to continually scrape around the sides of the pot but don't go deep into the syrup we just want to stay around the bubble area and you just want to keep pulling this in so this is the alcohol of the excess alcohol and stuff burning off and any impurities that are in it so see how it's gathering up on the sides that's what we want to make sure get them back into our syrup whatever is supposed to cook off will cook off whatever is good will stay in so again just gently don't go into the stirs syrup just gently keep going around the sides and you'll do behind the candy thermometer towards the end and we are going to cook our syrup - if you want a soft candy you're gonna cook it to 260 if you want a firm candy you can go as high as 280 280 is soft crack I'm gonna go to just before that I'm going to take this to 275 but you see what I mean about the oils how they just continue they'll keep going to the sides of the pot as it heats up and gets up to temperature it will it will the oils will get incorporated and once your syrup is boiling in that you want to just turn your heat down to medium just medium a little above medium I said then don't forget to get behind in behind the thermometer because it will hide in behind there I love the smell of this syrup cooking it's oh it smells so awesome oh and just as a tip for safety always have a fan either an overhead fan I've got one going or the if you've got an overhead on your stove regardless when you're ever working with tinctures even though you've working them in a dehydrated yeah most of it's cooked off some of them may not be and you just want on the safety side always have a fan going and leave don't be sparking anything up in the in the general area so you've had your gelatin sitting over on the side and you have a look and you've noticed that there's all this white inky foam stuff and you're sure positive that you didn't do it high on high heat the heat didn't get too hot that'll happen so nice if the gelatin is old and it's starting to break down so if you do see that in order to compensate for that bloom another tablespoon of unflavored gelatin and we're going to add it into the candy mixture at the end that's gonna help us compensate for the gelatin that's broken in our mixture here so that will help it so anytime that your candies come out super sticky and you can't get them out of the mold the reason is is because the gelatin is not gelling properly so there's a really handy tip there for you guys now in order to get that out because I don't want that in to go my syrup I'm gonna run this through a strainer before we put it into our syrup so now I might actually my syrup while I was babbling away there is getting close to temperature I've got my ice water ready to go and as soon as it hits temperature I'm gonna drop the bottom into the pot and once the temperature starts coming down and the cooking process is stopped I'm gonna set it to the side until the temperature comes down to 240 before we add our gelatin in just watch your thermometer till until the temperature starts coming down and your bubbles start stop bubbling and then just set it to the side and said until your temperature comes down to 240 all right so now my syrup is cooled and then it's say because I don't want that white foamy stuff into my syrup I'm going to use a strainer to pour it through that way it'll catch all the chunks of jell-o gelatin and being bad and I'm going to mix that in now I also what I did was I bloomed another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid and we're going to add that in a little bit in a little bit so right now you're going to stir your jello and your candy syrup until it is all combined and if you find that your syrup is a little too sticky and it's solidified you can put your heat on to minimum you just want to heat the bottom to get the syrup off the bottom now you can make sure that you do so that you scrape the sides and if you said if you find that it's too hard coming off turn your heat on and it'll eventually start to melt so you just want to want to keep doing that until everything is completely melted in all the same temperature all right so now that everything is all melted together and nicely mixed now this is a test that I do to determine whether my syrup is did a job correctly if I pull it up and you see how it just goes in a nice smooth syrup it doesn't really seem to start gelling or anything it stays in a fine line so that's kind of telling me that this is gonna turn out way too sticky it's gonna come out what's it like you can't get it out of the mold it's more candy than the gelatin that's what I said about my gelatin breaking there that I knew that was gonna happen so I've added it I'm gonna add in the additional gelatin that I bloomed and I'm just gonna stir that until it's completely dissolved so now if you want your syrup just translucent that nice clear there you go you've got it you can go ahead and put it into your bottles your squirt bottles or use the little eye droppers for dispensing into your molds but however I never like to keep things plain so I'm gonna do half-and-half or I've got translucent and solid and also just to give you a look to see how to go about doing that all right so now when after adding the additional gelatin in now when I do my test you'll see it's thicker and it'll start to split up and almost solidify in midair so that's how you know it's likely going to set correctly I still had to not do things correctly that's occasionally but that is a very good indication that you're safe and good to go so if you wanted translucent go ahead and put it into your bottles at this point or use your eye dropper dispensers or whatever it is that you get it into your moles however I of course need to always get fancy so I'm gonna split this into two colors so I've got half of it translucent and half of it of the solid blue whoops all right so I'm just gonna eyeball this here if you want to be exact you can pour it into a measuring cup and split it exactly however I've been doing this from this pot for quite a while so I'm pretty good at it sometimes so because I mix the blue with the green because obviously the green from our can of syrup and our sugar so it's turned out a little bit greenish and I actually want this to be blue so I'm going to add in a little bit of blue color and then on 1/2 I'm going to add in white so this one I'm mixing in a few drops of blue you can use any kind of food coloring the gel base oil-based water base for this for this particular candy recipe does not matter so we're just gonna get that stirred in oh that's a pretty color you see it on the white that's nice that's a nice kind of teal color then in my other half I'm gonna pour in some of the blue the same kind of teal but this is gonna give me the solid background as the white now if you guys have white on hand make sure that you shake it really really well if it's hot it sitting for a while it does separate and you will find that if you pour it in you're gonna get a little tiny white it doesn't go well you get little white lumps or something like that it just doesn't blend really nicely so make sure to shake it really really well you can almost hear it come back together it's like you can almost hear the water at the top and then all kind of comes together and sounds a little bit thicker so I'm gonna pour a little bit of that in isn't that pretty so again you're just gonna thoroughly mix that in until it is one complete uniform color and once I've got that i'll get it into my bottles and we'll get this into the mold there's a little trick i learned the other day find it by Occident that's on most things happen so I'm if you want to have a half and half candy where you've got the clear on the bottom and the solid on the top what you can do to easily make that happen is use your hand blender on this we whip a bunch of air into it and once you put them together the air is all I'm automatically gonna bring the solid color up to the top or if you want to do that with the if you want it the other way around then air Rach you're clear but you're gonna have to wait a while for the bubbles to come out because that's gonna make it not so clear so I recommend just putting the solid on the back you can do that it's just a quick way of doing it otherwise you have to pour one layer let it set a little bit and then pour your second layer well aren't I just a cesspool of useless information today I'm just gonna pour this into my squirt bottle this should make a full almost a full bottle or a little bit more see bang almost right on now if you guys have to haven't seen these before these are the best squirt bottles ever they just make putting it into the mould so much easier especially if you want to blend colors absolutely highly recommend these I've got there's a link for them in the description there for you to make it easy if you'd like to order them and I'm just gonna do my clear and we'll get this going all right so I said I always do two colors I always like doing that so I did combination I'll either just whoosh or if you want to happen half you can do it that way you can go this way freestyle whatever you like and that's it get them all into your mold and you're gonna put them in the fridge for a minimum of two to four hours sometimes they've got to go overnight now if you let them go overnight and they're still sticking you can't get them out of the mold put them into the freezer for a few hours let them freeze up take one mold out of it I'd add out at a time and pop them out as quickly as possible if they still if there's still stop the first you'll come out if it starts to stick throw it back in the freezer work on another mold put them into a double boiler melt them down on low heat and add another tablespoon of gelatin melt it and recast them and that will fix that problem for you and that's it enough I'll come back low will pop these out so you can have a look at them and I'll show you how to sugarcoat them not that sugarcoating is that difficult but you can coat them with the can of sugar and just show you an easy way of doing it and that'll be it will say goodbye candies upset and you can do this in a bowl or I found that doing them in a large plastic bag worked a lot easier so in this I put a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar and I put a quarter part about a quarter cup of the flavored drink crystals that I used in my recipe again the drink crystals are totally optional for you just adds that little bit extra flavor and then I added about a half a teaspoon of citric acid because I wanted these to be a little bit more on this our side if you just want to have just a little bit of a tick bite but not really sour at all I add a quarter teaspoon so I'll do those two my sweet ones and then to the sour I use a 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid I don't recommend using much more than that one it's not going to the sour flavor isn't that great and it can also melt your candies because citric acid acid is water soluble so simple enough you can actually see it oh and I also have sorry a wire a wire rack with parts line o parchment paper line line on top of it for them to dry so I just pop them out these guys are popping out nicely and I get and what I do is I do one mold at a time so I leave the rest of them in the fridge because otherwise they start to warm up and they can makes it difficult sometimes for them to come out of the mall so I just think about one at a time and once I get them on the bag I go a little bit there and I just fish them out and shake off the excess sugar and we just lay them out to dry here just like all our other candies this is just a slightly smaller mold that I use same thing now see sometimes you'll do that and you'll see you think oh no they're not gonna come out they're stuck just pull the edges away and then they just they'll just come right out now if you do that and it doesn't come out that's when you would put them into the freezer so again you see that just around the edges to pull it away and they're good to go and that's about it I'm just gonna go through and sugarcoat the rest of these guys and then I'll be back to say goodbye well guys that's my little demo there on your cannon Candace Eric and sugar gummy bears I hope you enjoyed the demo as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to ask and thank you guys so much again for your support and let's get to the 50,000 whoo all right so you have an awesome rest of your day and

pretty hard [Music] [Applause] that's how much we can have left to go we're slowly finishing the packets look how much powder we use it almost fill up and I guess we have to use all of this because we wanted super hard gummies right now we're going to add in some warm hot water [Music] now we have to stir it together [Music] Wow so this is super hot so only an adult can do it [Music] and so you got all these residue left over here that we have to just throw away because it will not dissolve it just looks like it's still watering let's see if we can take it out on you joining us is mr any case number last time I ate that gel here I think so huh let's see it's gonna work that means it like yeah [Music] [Music] we can take it out and put it on oh these are hard like nothing but sugar probably

I enjoy it in more fun [Music] you", "hsEAWR1_W7s": "hey Kelly and today we're in the sports research kitchen and we're going to be making homemade watermelon gummy using our beet gelatin collagen protein here's what you'll need fourth research beef gelatin a whole mini watermelon lemon and honey the first thing you're going to do is liquefy the fresh watermelon [Music] after you have it done pour it through a mesh strainer to discard the pole [Music] next we're going to skim off the white foam now you should have about two cups of watermelon juice and we're going to separate it by putting one cup into the saucepan now it's time for the beef gelatin you're going to sprinkle five tablespoons for the remaining order melon juice now you will let it rest and it will start to solidify okay let's go take care of the other half now that I've heated up we're going to add the other half of the gelatin mixture now you can whisk it until it's smooth next we're going to add a half a cup of lemon juice and we're using honey but you can use any sweetener that you [Music] okay we're almost finished all we have to do is pour the gelatin into the mold and place them in the freezer for 39 [Music] alright guys they're all finished and they're delicious they're filled with protein amino acids and collagen I hope you guys enjoyed this recipe and I'll see you guys next time [Music]", "HEMxJl7_cEA": "[Music] welcome back to unwrapped i'm mark summers sorting through lots of halloween treats how about gummies they're a standby on the trick-or-treat streets they come in many shapes and sizes including these creepy crawlers so right now we're gonna go behind the scenes to see how they're made [Music] gummy glow worms are one of ferreira pan candy's top selling treats they make the gummies with lots of gelatin blended in this machine with corn syrup sugar and water surprisingly every step is mechanized the machine does all the measuring the program will run and it will say how many pounds of each ingredient when you hit that amount in the tank then the valve will close and the next ingredient will come in fully automated here they heat the mixture to 240 degrees fahrenheit then it's put into a vacuum that cools it and removes much of the moisture the next step would be to add any of the color the flavor the juice before we deposit it and that's done in this huge machine they call a cfa or color flavor additive deck now this is a very critical piece of equipment because it's measuring out precisely how much color how much flavor and is doing it match after batch after batch so that every time you buy a gummy worm you're getting the same flavor and the same color in that gummy worm now the colored flavored mixture is ready to turn into gummy worms but most people are shocked to find out how gummies take their shape the gummy mixture never touches a mold instead it goes into this white stuff which has been pressed with a mold into a gummy shake it's a corn starch with a small percent of mineral oil and if i wanted to make a gummy hand i'd flatten it out press in and then just fill that up with slurry cool the cornstarch is actually a better mold than a metal pan plus it's easier to get the gummies out once they're dry and we use a piston pump and a nozzle that lines up directly with the mold and injects the liquid candy into the starch they can fill 28 of these boards a minute which is a total of six thousand seven hundred twenty worms every sixty seconds or four hundred three thousand an hour and over nine and a half million a day just in case you're counting these boards are taken to a drying room for 18 hours then put back on the machine to be processed after the product shakes out of the mold it goes through a steamer gets it all sticky and then it will roll in the sugar acid blend the sugar acid gives these black forest gummies their famous sweet and sour taste especially popular with the under 12 set after the product goes through the steamer it's going to roll in this drum where it's going to get covered with the sugar acid blend that gives us the glowworm and sourness from here we'll convey it up we'll catch it in boards and send it off to the packaging room and then all that's left to do is to put them in a package and let kids do the rest you", "eauPO7r9ATw": "i just crashed i mean it's a lot it's a lot oh

"J5Nu589uIAw": "what's up everybody my name is Sarah feet and welcome to the channel the haze we're gonna be reviewing the very famous very well-known and very beloved got me edible cushy punch now this is a California brand this is the sativa formula and it is absolutely fantastic so there's a few different types of products such as you punch makes the gummies I believe are their main and their original I know now they have like vaporizers they have CTD products things like that but the cushy punch are very well known for their gummies now these guys come in a hundred milligrams they also have a 200 milligram call to TKO and these guys come in these awesome little packet they're easy to break apart and each of these little squares is ten milligrams so you can dose however much that you would need personally now they are pretty strong I don't know exactly how they're made so they are made with organic sugar and feature no artificial coloring is all made with natural coloring so if that's something that concerns you if you have allergy problems and you can do artificial coloring these guys are a great option so let's talk about flavor these guys are really nice they're sweet but you do get a strong kind of cannabis oil to smell to them so if you pull them out in public if someone partakes or it is kind of in the know-how of how cannabis smells a little recognize this then they will smell it now if you're trying to see what kind of high this is this is the sativa one and for me these guys will keep me well they don't make me drowsy you can be very creative on them yeah I built this Depot these guys are good I could go together in a pinch because you will find out my most places now if you're talking prices they kind of range up and down I've seen these guys as low as $10 and S&M as high as $20 I don't really know if there's just a lot of places that are able to up the prices because it is wanted so bad if you can find a good deal on them they're very much worth it if it's the people are signing for 20 bucks and if you have to get it but it's a bit bit overpriced for these guys all in all if you are someone who travels a lot these guys aren't perfect companions they're small to fit in your pocket if you go to the movies a lot these are great as well so that is my little small review for the fam the cushy punch well there you go guys thank you so much for taking the time and watching this review again my name is Sarah B welcome to the haze and I will see you next time oh also please follow us on Instagram the haze anyway guys thank you so much

here we go here we go oh yep it has the flavors oh it's not grape it's black cherry interesting okay so the flavors black cherry orange green apple strawberry watermelon and blue raspberry cool now that i know that just ate the black cherry that was pretty good it's a sour black cherry against your sour so it was slightly sour all right that makes sense way more sense second color blind taste test don't tell me don't tell me what i get all right now you guys see here we go what'd i get chris i can't tell you oh all right so i have no clue what [Music] strawberry okay hmm all right so very chewy it's stuck in my tooth it makes me think of the consistency between like the dots times starbursts and chewiness and like stickiness and like how you have to get it off your teeth it takes like some effort but also there is a very much like a uh uh what is it the uh sour patch kids yes there's a very much a sour patch kid aspect to this it's not quite sweet enough i can't give them that these are slight these are definitely tart i wouldn't say they're sour though at least for the black cherry and the strawberry uh those two again let me see do these they don't really have individual smells let me see what we got here presentation beautiful front label sticker there that was in the top of the lid i love it they've got the warning labels on it all appeal you know i gotta say the steezy does a great job of presentation i'm going to give these a solid 10 out of 10 appeal um sour gummy cubes i'll give it a 9.5 there's nothing that makes me feel like this is healthy whatsoever um color super wonderful branding the colors of the gummies are all super on point like i feel like that's all good 10 out of 10 smell definitely don't get me if these gummies had individual smells with each of the gummies i'd give it a perfect score but they don't and because of that that's ah man to me that's like a 7.5 on the score because there's just no smell to this jar whatsoever so it's just smells like sweet candy although that's what candy should smell like that's why they get a the 75 because it's like okay cool they get the candy smell right like that's it but like i really needed like five different flavors of stuff uh potency let's see uh total of 100 milligrams thc but this pack specifically only had 95.54 a little disappointing right but to be expected right it's hard to get this 100 dialed in if that's not your model so it's tough um potency i gotta give you guys you know it's not a hundred milligrams it's five milligrams less i'm going to give you guys an eight out of ten that's kind of hurting there taste i did like the black cherry i thought the strawberry made sense afterwards it was nice and light and kind of tart uh taste uh uh you know to read the full to get the full taste score i'll have to eat a few more of these and then make sure you guys check back into the written review or in the description that'll kind of help that but for now i'll give it a give it a i'll give it a 7.5 out of 10. um not not that sour and not a very strong flavor that made me know exactly what it was if that was grape would have been hyped but it wasn't um purple usually goes with a grape flavor let's see let's see let's see experience experience so far is around a 7.5 to an eight out of ten again i wish there would have been a smell i wish there would have been greater flavors kind of hard to identify what all the flavors are unless you peel the sticker off i was always bad at reading directions i assume lots of other people are makes it going to be tough for them to figure out what these flavors actually are so in my experience i'll give it a i'll give it an 8 out of 10. more information there is a lot of information on there i notice again steezy does a great job of uh you know educating and teaching and they're good with pads and vendor days that they stop all out of their stores so i give it to them for that it's tough i'll give them i give them the information was there it was peelable i'll give them a nine i'll give them a nine out of ten what i recommend i would recommend probably some other different versions of these gummies i've had better ones than these from them but i definitely would recommend this 8 out of 10 solid recommendation the only time i would recommend switching away from this is if there's a specific flavor you want or if you feel like price point it's kind of that kind of choice for you or you know maybe get a better deal so that uh overall i'm going to give them an 8.5 out of 10 but we'll cut we'll also see what our slider method kind of aggregates it to once we enter in all the exact scores so stay tuned i appreciate you guys for all the love we've got the steezy bits here 20 assorted flavors a lot of good ones a nice sour candy look at all these cool colors that we've got here um i love the experience man stevie you guys do a great job i look forward to doing some more work with you all please

attention to the video how many gummy bears were made in this yummy blueberry flavor do you remember put your answer below in the comments bye cookies woo", "1Y7hrWj9sY0": "hey everyone its James from fun foods and today I'm just going to make these Mountain Dew gummy bears now this was a request video and they turned out amazing so keep watching I'll show you step by step how to make these now the first thing we need to do in a medium pot we need to add two cups of Mountain Dew soda to it then just bring this over to the stove until it starts to boil while we're waiting for our mountain dew to start boiling get out a large pot and to that we want to add one more cup of Mountain Dew soda and then I have three of these packets of unflavored gelatin just take it out and sprinkle it on top of your Mountain Dew you don't have to mix it just sprinkle it all in there now just let that do its magic while we're waiting on our other mountain Dew to boil alright so when your Mountain Dew starts to boil we'll just turn off the heat and take it over to our work station now just pour your boiling Mountain Dew into your Mountain Dew that we poured the unflavored gelatin on and mix it in you want to mix it for about five minutes until all that unflavored gelatin has dissolved and at this stage now that all our gelatin has dissolved what I'm going to do is divide this I'm going to keep some of them this color this regular Mountain Dew yellow color and some of them I'm gonna turn green so I just want to pour some in another bowl not a lot and add a little green food coloring to it mix that up now just let these sit out for a little bit before we put them in our molds because I'm using plastic molds I don't want the heat the hot liquid to melt my plastic molds so you have to be really careful if you're using silicone molds you can put them in there right away that's fine but plastic molds be careful don't let them be too hot or they'll melt your molds now I'm going to transfer my liquid into something with a pour spout just to make it easier for me to pour them into our molds so they don't go all over the place so the little one here I'm going for the green in big one I'll pour the yellow all right so now I have my mold here and I just have this one template of little bears it's only six of them so I have this little silicone silicone mold it looks like bananas or something just use up the stuff the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna fill about half these bears with the green and then half with the yellow now hopefully I'll have just a steady hand when I'm doing the yellow we'll see and then just fill your other molds up whichever way you'd like now just take these put these in a refrigerator for a couple hours just until they set well my Mountain Dew gummy bears have been in the refrigerator setting up for about three hours I'm a bit nervous and I don't know if I used enough gelatin they are firm but not as firm as I want them to be so we're gonna try to get them out of here see if we get them out intact and that's always a challenge especially when you don't have a silicone mold so let's try this I'm gonna try with a knife gently to remove this and decapitate it the first one that's not good poor bear taste food anyway don't think it's gonna work out my friends we got to do Plan B we got to make them with more gelatin so since it didn't work out on our last attempt we're gonna try things a little different this time we're still going to start out with the saucepan and we're gonna add 2 cups of Mountain Dew soda to that bring this over to the stove and bring it to a boil while that's over on the stove boiling we have one cup of Mountain Dew in a large bowl this time I'm gonna use five of these packets of this Knox unflavored gelatin and I think that was part of the problem not all the problem but part of it I want to make it a little firmer than it was it was almost just like a jello and not like a gummy so we're gonna add five packets of this and you just sprinkle this in on top of your Mountain Dew [Music] and this time what I'm doing differently is preparing our molds a little bit different last time they didn't come out too well and of course if you have silicone molds use that because there's a lot easier but what I'm gonna do this time is I'm gonna spray this with some cooking spray gently just a little bit and then because I'm extra nervous about this is I'm going to let's wipe a little bit of the excess off it so it's a bit much not dry but just no puddles of spray now we want to take some powdered sugar or icing sugar and we just want to lightly coat this I'm just really going the extra step to make sure it doesn't stick in there now we can just fill our molds I'm gonna do three of them green three um yellow and hopefully they work out this time all right so I have pulled my gummy bears out of the refrigerator they've been in there about three and a half hours and now it's show time to see if they come out of this mold all intact I got my fingers crossed I hope it happens if not we'll have to redo this with some silicone molds so let's see how we did I'll start with the yellow one I'm just gonna kind of pull it away from the sides a little bit of my fingers before I try to pull it out hopefully that will work and see if I can kind of like push it and peel it out looks like it might work oh yes I did it so one of the other ones have come out nicely perfect well now something to taste us I'm gonna try one of the yellow gummy bears the yellow Mountain Dew gummy bears and see how taste tastes like Mountain Dew now I'm do gummy bear it's pretty good and this is the one I didn't put any food coloring in it it was just straight and Mountain Dew so really good well thanks everyone for watching I hope you enjoyed watching me make these Mountain Dew gummy bears is a lot of fun making these and thanks again for the person who suggested I make them if you have a suggestion yet you

back today i'll be showing you how to infuse starbursts so delicious and surprisingly was one of the easiest edibles i've ever made and i feel like i'm going to make these many times in the future they turned out so well [Music] to make these starbursts here's what you're going to need some starburst candy i wish i could have had the all pink kind but we don't sell them in canada so i just got the original infuse coconut oil and optionally you can also use a concentrate or extract to make them extra strong and some lecithin to help with absorption first i have the top part of my double boiler and then i'm going to peel the wrapper off of some starbursts and place them in the bowl i use 30 pieces here but the amount you use doesn't matter too much the recipe is very forgiving then you're gonna heat up a pot to a light boil and place your double boiler container thing on top and then using the spatula you're going to use to mix everything together add a scoop of some lecithin and then mix that in they do take quite a while to melt so just keep an eye on them and for the first five minutes or so they probably won't melt that much so you can pretty much just leave them be but then after five minutes when they start to melt like this um just keep stirring them and watching them until they melt all the way down then once everything is pretty much melted like this we can add our coconut oil so i'm going to be adding one tablespoon of coconut oil but you can add for this amount of starburst up to three tablespoons of coconut oil and to make it stronger i'm also going to be adding some concentrate now we just have to mix everything together so i'm having some trouble getting the starburst and the oil to emulsify together you can see um the oil kind of just doesn't really blend into it at all so i'm going to grab a whisk and see if that'll help us emulsify a little bit better so using the whisk aggressively actually turned out very well everything mixed together and it worked better than i expected honestly now i'm just going to put my starburst mixture onto a baking pan that is covered in waxed paper and then i'm just going to place another sheet of wax paper on top and kind of roll it and shape it out to the thickness i want in the end i feel like i wish i would have made it a little bit thicker so it would have been the exact same thickness of actual starburst but next time i'll do that i guess and then i just use this sharp utensil to kind of just shape it so i could have nice corner edges and then i placed it in the fridge now while i'm waiting for it to cool in the fridge i'm going to heat up my double boiler again because um i don't want to waste any of the starburst and the coconut oil mixture that's left in the pot so i'm going to make a little drink out of it so i have a whole video on how to do this and to be honest that video is going to give you a much tastier result than this one because this is just like a little makeshift one i did and i'll post the link of how to make that drink below pretty much you're just going to add some water and heat it up so you can get all the mixture combined and then you're going to add a drink mix to it and then cool it and serve it over ice but check out the video i have on how to make an infused starburst drink because it's like literally one of the most delicious drinks i've ever had and you can put quite a bit of coconut oil in there and you can't taste it which is very surprising considering how much i put in it okay so now that our drink is made and our starburst has cooled down a bit i actually left mine in the fridge a little bit too long it was about a half an hour and i felt like it was a little bit too hard for me to cut easily so i just took it out of the fridge for five ten minutes until it was ready to be cut so i'm just going to start by cutting these little edges on the side which i'll probably just snap on while i'm cutting and then i'm going to cut all of these into squares after i cut them i realized that i feel like the size was not accurate to the size of a starburst so when i make these next time i'm going to actually place a starburst on there and measure it out now they're all done so i'm just going to throw them into their little container and that's it they are ready to eat [Music] these turned out so well i'm so so happy with them this is probably going to be my go-to instead of gummies now they just just everything is amazing thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thanks so much guys have a wonderful day [Music] you", "p6oKnG_sEwc": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please don't hesitate to put them you know where and thank you so much for joining me today you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "pgPdJJwt9SA": "ladies and gentlemen let me introduce you to tequila gummy bears that's what I'm talking about look at the color on these bad boys those are gorgeous so we start off with some tequila okay little bit of sugar stir stir stir over low heat okay wait a minute you're burning off the alcohol that's why we keep the heat low in one or two hot okay we want this alcohol to stay alcoholic stir stir stir a little gelatin okay beautiful we got a little mix now we come around with a bit of food coloring to get off but look at the desired color look at that maybe a little bit more because we want a nice neon green and then we just squirt it you could pour it in but it'll spill everywhere so it's good if you could use one of these don't stop a thing is just squeeze it in and it's beautiful so this is a gummi bear mold okay and now we put it in the freezer and fridge sorry break it up and look what we have we have little tequila gummy bears Oh gorgeous I love these okay", "1wSCMic5Epo": "[Music] hello and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are looking at a trusty lovable brand one that we reviewed a couple of times in the past and like them every time we're gonna take another look at them in this post and apocalypse world and that is the fine folks at cannabis syrup well mostly for buying folks I think they do some review inflating on weed maps that has me a little peeved but for the most part I do like cannabis quite a bit this is the hundred milligram variety cherry flavored I think we've done grape and chocolate didn't change arena in the best so now we're doing cherry again this is 100 milligrams 10 servings of 10 milligrams each of course we're just going to do it in one I've like canvas syrup every time I reviewed them I find them to be quite potent I think that they are reviewed by s or excuse me they are they used to at least be reviewed by SC labs but I don't see it on here right now but I'll double-check that but independently verified doesn't taste terrible I therefore being unfortunately has a bad texture it it's gonna or thickness it's got like a cough syrup like thickness or at least it used to well let's just go ahead and shut up and open this up and and give it the old-fashioned review here alright almost done with the protective loo balloon okay here we go here is our cherry liquid maybe we could just do it in one gulp that's fine now I do have a chaser here in case things go badly but let's not let's hope that doesn't happen down the hatch did I get it no oh it's like robitussin well it's no good it's not terrible it tastes like cherry cough syrup um but it won't get you uh what's the word for when you do sizzurp I can't remember whatever that kind of crunk is or drunk or [ __ ] up this won't get you that it'll get you high but it won't get you whatever it is like doing coding also don't do coding and I'm done oh well glad to be done with it and guys if you've never tuned in two weeks before you're gonna have to wait a couple more seconds to find out how it's actually going to affect me cuz that's the most important part of the edible review how it makes you feel not how it tastes so I'm gonna sit here stew for the next two hours see how I'm feeling and I'll come back to you guys to let you know thanks for watching wait so I'll see you in just a second this cherry is a real peach that was terrible but this is really good another kind of a syrup another winner ten bucks for this I had a discount to think it got up like seven bucks did it taste terrible it has a cough syrup it kind of flavor as I went over ad nauseam but I'm high I'm still high right out of the sort of six ish kind of range five six someone there feeling good like the format like the syrups it's an easy quick discreet way of doing it this might be the last cannabis we review or review for sometime maybe we'll try some of the higher dose ones because I think they do actually have some like two under or not I've tried that 200 milligrams I think they might have 500 milligrams I'm not sure but maybe we'll do some of those but for the lower doses the 100's the 200s that is going to do it for our cannabis reviews we know they're good now we can concretely say that you can pick up cannabis and feel like you're gonna get your money's worth happy to tell them are happy to give them a good review so again this was the cannabis cherry 100 milligrams from cannabis give it a shot if you haven't already I think you'll be quite happy with cannabis when you do that's going to do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a future review peace", "kFmO_2CBpC4": "[Music] [Music] funnel cakes we're here Seana sleeping glasses at school now let's get straight into it cuz I'm sure y'all was going to ask we are going to make what that's what happens when you don't practice we're gonna practice videos ready now let's pretend to practice ready you guys on the count of three we're gonna say edible gummy slime one two three that's you should probably youtubers do so what we have here is the leftovers of our chases corner gummy vs. real video part three if you haven't watched that one go watch it first so we you don't spoil the gummies and fun that we had on that channel go watch the first thing come back hey we'll see you later and you probably watched it by now so what we're gonna do is do it a little bit interesting this time frame here we've got this shark bite game there's some fish and lobster right here we're going to pick one out and whichever one that we pick out that causes this shark to that's the color of the gummy we will make our first batch with sound gun now might sell it oh well that's kind of cool but really here's why it's nasty because if we get green this is pickle and the green pickle tastes like pickle yes the green pickle tastes like pickle and this red bacon tastes like thank you Cherry's bacon chili bacon we're missing one of these guys there but that's alright and since we don't have blue we put blue tape on two of the green ones you go first chase you ready you go fishing I'm going now doesn't matter which one you choose well you got two it matters which one bites at you mommy do you want to take a turn okay the thing is is we don't know which color is gonna trigger it bad boy all right so I got a yellow fish that means I chase got it so you can pick I think I would go with melania for this first batch we're just using one cup of gummies all right we got all the black let's reset this shark by Chase is going first safe

means you can choose watermelon bacon or we've got our first batch working out cuz we're about to get snacks it's got that Mike merch that murse is actually not for sale on our store but he also designed your but no we're not gonna show me your but those right there is the word left and I ke and it's foot backwards and there's also a little Mike right there and once again I'm Andrew this but we're not selling this much but we do have other merch for sale like Clarence website but let's go ahead pop disruption pop this bad boy into the look in the description I'm not sure how many seconds let's try like 30 seconds we need to melt it a little more but that is looking kind of good I think one minute we're using one minute it will all depend on the strength of your microwave just how buff is your microwave is it this book or is it this buff I think we're done ant ooh oh my goodness you don't want to watch out because this stuff is going to be your room catch up in mustard and man in panic now no that's not what I was gonna say look at that guy's that is pure gummy Comenius powdered sugar which is also known as sugar icing and cornstarch two tablespoons of cornstarch two tablespoons of powdered sugar but slowly we have to mix this in so who wants to be the mixer okay slowly start to mix in both go ahead or fastly yeah let's do it fast Li and now mix mix it mix it mix it the more the powder sugar and cornstarch you used the less sticky it'll be but it'll be more stretchy if it is really sticky you just add more cornstarch and more powdered sugar but then that means it'll be less stretchy to make it more stretchier you add one teaspoon of coconut oil this has had a little more powdered sugar and a little moko stop now we're going to add in Foca nut oil with the alignment yes it's obvious that you need stickiness test mmm that looks really sticky chase you try yeah oh no that's too sticky does it taste good like a melted pink starburst oh yeah we're gonna keep adding more powdered sugar I guess this recipe we read is wrong I had a whole bunch go sing a mixing song and mix the chocolate it's doughy I got a cousin named Oh week oh that's Joey Joey bag of doughnuts this is like really hard tonight it looks like it's not getting any less stickier oh gosh oh sorry back oh whoa since we added a lot more powdered sugar I'm gonna add a little bit more coconut oil is it good let's see Oh guys look look it's not getting stuck early let's do that thing that people always do it's lime okay more cornstarch [Music] [Applause] lunch I bite a bubblegum hi my back and actually tastes like a big pink sorry yeah oh my god that is really good this is so weird but it feels like there's actual slime you know I'm feeling a Laffy Taffy but it's like a melting laughing it's really yummy it's sticky like bubblegum I don't know how we can make it completely not sticky maybe there's more and more cornstarch this is still pretty stretchy though look at that so I'm sure we get add more cornstarch let's do round two yeah that's gummies oh do you want gummy hey Sean is it okay if I prank you with pickle gummy try to cool the gummy Monica means you pickle out you got yellow Lexie's home from school and she's going to pick a color whatever color you pick that's the color gummy we're going to make edible slime with this place you wait you're supposed to goes on Lexi's turn she's going for the blue oh she's safe chase your turn oh you want to do a turn okay just wait so after chase all right I give him the pickle gummy I thought it would prank him but he

cool dirty nasty gummies in that one no it's yep oh no it's not does it hurt powdered sugar oh you undo what helped Oh God we're using a lot of cornstarch whoa whoa look [Music] let me except it I think I put too much cornstarch it's not getting sticky at all [Applause] [Music] [Applause] yes go ahead face guns what it takes to - you look at it it's light again study that stick you this time look good okay showing up cornstarch on your butt all right look at this this one is not getting stuck oh wait spoke too soon it's back to sticking to our fingers again Shawn what did you do no I

I love you I love you gummy bears I love you I love you gummy bears", "ZOEwJRlZG7s": "g'day welcome to the simple cooking Channel today I'm going to show you how to make homemade gummy bears before we get started you're gonna need some sort of mold like see what I've got now you can get this from an arts and crafts store basically this has got a little little bears in it now they're not easy to find so I will put a link to the place that I bought this from and and this cost me I think it was two dollars for one sheet now with a small saucepan just have it on the bench or somewhere put in 1/3 of a cup of water then add one satchel and these satchels vary the satchel I use has about 10 grams which i think is probably just a bit under a quarter of an ounce just slowly sprinkling there now this needs to be unflavored gelatin then you get your flavored gelatin and you want to use roughly 85 grams which is around 3 ounces now for this particular one I've chosen a strawberries and cream gelatin just pour it in slowly now once you've done this just leave this on the counter for roughly 10 minutes and it's about ready to put on the stove now put this on the stove we turn on to medium heat now we'll have this on here for roughly somewhere between 3 and 5 minutes and what we're gonna do is just give it a stir every now and then the idea is once this is dissolved it's ready okay that's ready to go let's do the next stage now just pour it into something that you can pour it out if it's got a little spent and just pull it into each mold leave that on the counter for I don't know five minutes a and then once it's just cooled a little bit and not for us to be able to transport it without it spilling anyway put the end of the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes well they're ready to go now what I like to do is I like to get a teaspoon of plain flour and teaspoon of castor sugar and just mix it together in a little shot glass like this once this has come out of the fridge just sprinkle it sort of over it this will just help the the gummies not to stick together so just do that again spread across it like that so make sure that you do wipe the excess off this because you know what spilling all over the place um well I hope you like my homemade gummy bears got so many yeah let's give them a go oh oh come come Frogger TV hmm I'll see you next time for my next meal

another episode of couch lock news i'm emma and i'm super excited to be talking to you guys today about the wanna gummies that just launched at move dispensaries here in florida i've tried wanna gummies before in the past when i've gone out to colorado and out of every edible that i tried out there that were gummies they were hands down my favorite so i was really excited that move announced that they were bringing wanna to florida so i could finally get my hands on some tasty edibles so a little bit about wanna brands they were one of the first edible companies to launch in colorado back in 2010 and the thing that makes them so unique is they're made with all natural ingredients they're vegan gluten free and they're pectin based gummies now pectin is a fruit derived alternative to gelatin and it's really great because it also helps the gummy maintain its consistency so you know if you leave your gummies in your car in the hot floor in the sun they're not going to melt they're going to maintain that shape and consistency so it's a really great alternative in my opinion another thing about these gummies is they are distillate infused and they contain terpenes to help determine whether the gummies are going to give you indica effects or sativa effects or hybrid effects or whatever you're looking for one thing that i find curious about that is i am pretty sure that the way terpenes digest through your body they don't pass through the liver and everything so you really don't get that terpene effect off of edibles especially because the thc gets converted into something else which gives you that more like relaxed body high so i'd like to know what you think if terpenes make a difference for you and edibles or not because personally i don't think so but they're advertised as having strange specific effects so i guess we're gonna find out so this is what the wanna package is going to look like you can tell that i have not opened these yet i picked up the blueberry indica ones because i've tried all of the flavors in the past and the blueberries are hands down my favorite that and the mango ones of course we're filming so these child resistant containers are able to open by pinching them on the sides and you kind of like have to pinch it really hard and you just pull off the top the gummies per florida state guidelines are wrapped up in this little baggie with a thc symbol so you know that these are thc gummies i kind of always have a i don't have a hard time opening these bags because i got it like before i could even finish my sentence now one thing that's different about these gummies in comparison to the ones that they produce in other states is florida does not allow artificial coloring in their edibles so these are basically like a light yellow or clear color and they have the thc symbol on those as well these are like kind of coated and like it's not sugar i don't really know what it would be because they're sugar free um but it's coated in like this like powder this crystal thing which helps it from sticking together and getting all nasty in the car or in the heat or whatever but these gummies are 10 milligrams each and you get 100 milligrams per bottle and that's only for 25 dollars which isn't really that bad especially if you get them with a discount or they're running a promotion you can really get a good deal and stock up on some edibles now for my first taste these taste like wanna gummies thankfully personally 10 milligrams isn't enough for me to get any kind of effect off an edible so in order to give you a true review i'm going to eat 30 milligrams because that's kind of like my sweet dose without getting too medicated but i'll definitely get like the effects and be calmed down hopefully so two more um i'm gonna get back to you guys in about an hour an hour and a half and let you know how i'm feeling two hours later it has been probably about two hours or a half two hours an hour and a half two hours um since i ate the 30 milligrams of the wanagamines and i'm gonna be honest like i was pretty high for a moment kind of like almost not uncomfortably but i was definitely feeling good i was relaxed i was kind of like in my mind a little bit i was like laughing at stuff but yeah they were nice they were really effective personally i think these are probably like the most effective gummies that i've had so far from a florida dispensary so i'm going to recommend that you check them out because i'm feeling really good right now and i don't have a lot of anxiety and you know they're just 10 milligrams each so if you're a beginner you can easily cut them in half and get five or just try a 10 but yeah i'm a big fan of the wanna gummies and y'all should check them out thank you guys so much for tuning in to this review of the wanna gummies remove if you like this video give it a thumbs up let me know in the comments below if you've tried the wanna gummies before yet what you think of terpenes being put into edibles and subscribe to couchlocknews if you're excited to see some more videos more importantly you guys stay conscious", "Iy2bgBVFf4Q":

"BpKYde5BXHI": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you how to turn regular Cola bottle gummies into you guessed it infused Cola bottle bellies here's what you're going to need two tablespoons of warm water four ounces of Cola flavored gummies one-and-a-half teaspoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon of potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below one to two teaspoons of a herbal tincture if desired and a soda bottle mold the first step is to sprinkling a gelatin over the warm water there's no need to stir it just leave it to sit for about five minutes so it can bloom now you can take your Cola gummies and cut them so the lighter color is separated from the darker color place the lighter colored gummies into a dish and add about a quarter of your gelatin mixture then place it in the microwave for about 30 to 40 seconds until it melts once it's melted pour in some your tincture and then stir it in I'm going to be placing my mixture into a squeeze bottle and then putting it into a cup filled with warm water to keep it warm and liquid until I have everything ready to go now repeat this process with the other half of the gummies you'll be using your remaining amount of tincture and all of your gelatin my tincture is having some difficulties binding to the gummy mixture so I'm adding in about a teaspoon of lecithin to help it emulsify now I'm going to pour in both mixture at the same time putting the light color on the top and the dark color on the bottom once that's done I'll place them in the fridge or the freezer for about in half an hour so I can take them out of their mold [Music] I want some of them to be coated in sugar so I just filled a little bag with some sugar and shook them around and then I will leave these to sit out for about 24 hours so any excess moisture can evaporate that's it now your gummies are ready to be enjoyed [Music] thank you guys so much for watching if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe [Music]", "gQYc6uzjt9E": "I love ICS it's like on a hot summer day when it's just like it's hot to eat but you want something you have like a refreshing cold pop smoke back baby but this time we got a summer this I'm gonna show you a really easy way to make watermelon lemon juice pops all right you need some watermelon slices I cut down the time you should already know how to cut a watermelon you're in the top three cups of milk one and a half cups of cream two bowls just because you need to go ahead and sort things out a frying pan and a couple strainers as well your molds for your eye sees and Bram you need like an eighth of weed depending on how strong you want it I think a eighth is good for this amount my man the blender right here and just a positive attitude we're gonna start over our cannon milk I'm gonna go ahead and put the water medal to the side right now three cups of whole milk I got about one and a half cups of cream right here as well it'll fit in this cotton at an eighth of the weed here just some water my mouth is mad dry right now you're gonna go ahead and put a couple of inches of water into your pen and you want to make sure that you keep that and make sure that that's always simmering and it doesn't need that plate we need water into that pan you know I'm saying so this is a slow process we're gonna have this on a simmer for about two to three hours to not go past three hours because then that's it you waste some weed isn't even working in the next step we're gonna go ahead and place our watermelon trunks into the blender this is crazy this isn't a baby boys and baby girls it's time to grind this what is my favorite color but is my favorite flavor maybe one day I can make a business out of this got the dog spoken in the back beat I think the sound of a dog is a very summertime now we have our watermelon chunks they grind it up we got a strain it and we got to get a lot of this juice out of here right so we're just pouring that in there for now I've been smoking way too much weed all right and the good thing about this is the fact the lake you could save this juice for later you have like fresh mixer for your vodka when you want to go ahead and have some drinks always have paper towels on exact this is the essence of life things get messy sometime you know I'm saying and next up we're gonna go ahead and cut up a lemon I'm only gonna use half of it because the strange that we're using is lemon curd and also I just don't like to add too much citrus to milk it's good to have cattle milk already made and thankfully already have some like that's in the fridge ready so that we can use for our process now always use very cold milk when you're gonna go ahead and combine it with fruits can you pass me the can of milk thank you so much so we just need 1 cup of canned milk and then I'm gonna go ahead and put my watermelon pulp in the bowl this is has a couple seeds unfortunately for this fine you split them up add a little tiny bit of honey for flavor as well I'm gonna shake it up so you're gonna pour it into the mold we got some chunks in there it's gonna be a textured treat all right so the go ahead and cover up your popsicles and then the next step is obviously to go ahead and put them in a freezer and let them freeze for as long as ICS and tentacles freeze right I already had a couple of them in the freezer so let me present to you my little pop baby look at this water bellicose pop I know I got married in here so I know this is gonna be potent it's gonna be potent baby unless it tastes good Wow this was awesome hey baby can we say ding ding ding ding", "dsxcqshvH34": "hey guys welcome back for another video so if you saw my video from last week we learned how to make elderberry syrup which is high in antioxidants great immune boosting properties and just overall really great health benefits so this week we're going to be doing a recipe using that elderberry syrup and we're going to be making some immune boosting elderberry gummy bears for the kids take your one cup of elderberry syrup put it in your pot and turn it on medium heat once that starts to warm and you can feel the temperature change in the liquid you can go ahead and actually turn this off you don't want it to come to a rolling boil it's going to take that much longer for them to set up [Music] because it's only one cup of liquid it usually heats up pretty quickly so there's a couple variations that you can do for this recipe so you can just use your elderberry syrup that you made last week and add your gelatin in and put it in your mold and that's totally fine for me personally i like to add the gelatin a few drops of my young living thieves because this really has a lot of health benefits to it as well and an eighth of a cup of honey just to make them a little extra sweet so again i'll have both variations written over on the blog so you can decide which ones you want to make so now that your elderberry syrup is simmering you can either add your essential oils if you're going to use some if not that's fine too then you're going to take a quarter cup of beef gelatin now this is grass-fed organic unflavored beef gelatin if you're vegan you can also use a vegan gelatin and that will work just as well so you're going to slowly add that to your pan and just continue to stir so after your mixture started to thicken up a little bit at this point you could add your eighth of a cup of raw honey you'll want to stir that up until your honey is completely dissolved if you're adding honey so now that all the liquid is blended together it's time to add the liquid into our gummy bear molds so these particular molds i purchased on amazon they came in a set of two and they also came with this dropper now you don't need a dropper to fill your gummy bear molds but i did find that it made the process a lot faster a lot cleaner and a lot easier if you don't have one of these you can use an old like medicine dropper from a kid's prescription or a kids medication that you purchased over the counter droppers are just really handy to get these molds filled so if the molds you have at home you find you're having issues getting your gummy bears out of you can take a ghee cooking spray or a coconut spray and you can spray in the molds and that should make it a lot easier to pop them out these particular ones i've never had issues getting them out they always come out really clean so now you're just gonna take your liquid and you're gonna start filling up your mold so another good thing to do if you're intending on putting these directly into the refrigerator is to do this on top of a cookie sheet you don't want to have this really warm liquid in your gummy bear mold and trying to pick this up to put it in your fridge that could also get really messy so putting it on a cookie sheet will help luckily these set up really quickly so just having them out on your counter for about five to ten minutes after you put all the liquid in your mold will help set it up before you put it in your fridge so once you remove your mold from the refrigerator this one has been sitting for about 30 minutes it's time to pop out the gummy bears i like to store mine in mason jars with lids and just keep them in the refrigerator and then in the mornings my kids usually remind me to get out their elderberry gummies so i have elderberry gummies here and then i've also made a batch of ningxia gummy bears and my kids love them both so these pop out super easy do so again check the description box down below i will have a list of all the things that i used here today and where you can find them as well as substitutions for the beef gelatin if you want a recipe card you can head over to the blog and print that out i will also have a couple different variations for this recipe over there that you can have as well i hope you guys have a wonderful weekend and i'll see you next time", "Ur6nBVrs800": "they look so cute don't they so good hi guys welcome back today i'm going to show you how to make sugar-free gummy bears with coconut oil for these sugar-free gummy bears the ingredients you're going to need is your coconut oil the gelatin something to flavor your gummies so these are just those sugar-free flavoring packets that you put into your water these ones i have are kool-aid sour green apple and i'm also going to make some of them with some sugar-free crystal white lemonade so you can use these flavor packets of any kind that you like or you can also use these type of sugar-free water enhancers whatever you'd like to flavor it will work i have some citric acid because i want mine to be sour again you don't really need citric acid but if you do want to be sour this is how you'll do it if you don't have citric acid and you still want them to be sour you can crush up vitamin c tablets um which will really give the same effect i have some spray which i'm going to use for my molds and soy lechen which i have in capsules like this but you can use the liquid version that would be better so you can do soy election or you can do sunflower election um ideally you want to do the liquid one not the pills because i'm going to have to break these open to put them in um the liquid one on amazon was just like kind of expensive to deliver to canada so i just went with these so you need these to keep the coconut oil from separating um from the gelatin and water mixture and then if you don't want to store them in the fridge and you want to be shelf stable so you can just keep them in your drawer in your pocket or wherever and they can last for months you're going to need a preservative this is a potassium sorbate mixture it's very very simple to make i will post a link below on how to make this all right our first step is to bloom the gelatin so this is very important to make sure that your gummies have a proper texture um so we're going to do this first before we do anything else because we have to let the gelatin sit so we need half a cup of water so you're going to want a larger dish for this if you have it in a smaller dish the surface area of the water will be a lot smaller so it won't be as effective so you could use a pyrex dish or anything that's like a little bit bigger than the average bowl so we're going to put our half cup of water in here and then i'm going to sprinkle three packages of gelatin or if you're not using the packages you could use like two and a half tablespoons of gelatin so i'm trying them now after they've sat for a bit and i feel like because it's hot in here and it's summer and the last time i made these it was winter so it's a lot colder i think i would use a little bit more gelatin so maybe like add an extra package or um another tablespoon just in case it's hot where you live um so that it doesn't so that it stays like fully hard enough it still does look fine like this though but if it's really hot in here it might melt a bit so good so you just want to sprinkle these over the water so you're getting as much surface area as you can some of it will overlap and that's okay and we're just going to leave this to sit for about five minutes no stirring just leave it as is so while this is sitting and blooming we're going to add a couple more ingredients to it um we're just going to put them directly on top they don't need to be stirred in just yet we'll just get it prepared for when we're ready so the first thing is our potassium sorbate mixture we're going to do 1 8 of a teaspoon of this we're going to add some citric acid again this isn't necessary but if you want them sour this is what you'll use for your vitamin c tablets and i'm going to do about half a teaspoon because the mixture the flavor packets that i'm using these kool-aid ones and crystal light already have a lot of citric acid in it and i don't want to have too much or it will break the gummies down so we're just going to do half a teaspoon and then we're going to add in our legend if you have the liquid kind you can add in about half a teaspoon to a teaspoon in my coconut oil i already have legend mixed in so if you don't already have that in your coconut oil you're going to want to make sure you have it in here i am going to still add some tear just for safe measure as i don't have that much in my coconut oil oops so i'm going to do two um little capsules i'm just going to cut them open obviously i'm making a lot of a mess and not even really much of that got in there okay let's just do another one here and we can just leave this for now um there's no reason to stir it in we will stir it in when the gelatin has bloomed i do want to mention that these gummies because they're sugar-free and aren't using um sugar or corn syrup they're going to have a little bit of a different texture than a regular gummy bear so they're going to be a little bit more jello like but i mean to sacrifice it's a sacrifice i'm going to take for less calories if you are looking for a gummy that is more um like an actual gummy i have a video on that and i'll post in a link below now let's measure out our coconut oil we're going to use a quarter cup you can use a little bit more a little bit less depending on how strong you want them to be just don't go over half a cup i think that you would need quite a bit more gelatin if you're going to do that so i'm going to spray my measuring cup just so the coconut oil doesn't stick to here and we don't waste any of it now i'm just going to pour in a quarter cup and i did take this out of the fridge a while ago so that it would liquify that way it'd be easy to pour now that we have this measured out we can warm up our gelatin mixture so we'll just take this and kind of um solidify it into this little i don't know mushy thing so we can just take that whole thing and add it into our little saucepan and we can bring this to the stove okay now we can turn the stove on to medium heat and we will just let this melt while i'm waiting for this to melt i'm just going to spray my silicone mold so they're ready once everything is done okay it looks like this is melting a bit more now just wait till that's fully melted now we can add in the coconut oil so i'm just going to pour in my coconut oil and just i should have been whisking that at the same time actually so pour it in slowly and whisk while you're pouring it in that'll help emulsify it and make sure that the oil isn't separating from the gelatin mixture so let's make sure we scrape this all out so i'm just checking to make sure that the um oil and the gelatin has binded together and it looks like it did and i believe that's because of the soy legend if you don't use soy election it probably will not bind properly and you'll find that it will separate so the legend is an essential okay now i'll just wait this um for this to start bubbling a little bit we don't want it to boil but we do want a couple bubbles to form um and then it should be good to pour into our molds so while it did emulsify together i feel like it could be better so i'm going to use my immersion blender now i know not everybody has an immersion blender which is why i was going to try and avoid using it um so while this did separate a little tiny bit the gummies would still turn out fine um i mean it looks pretty good but because i have an immersion blender i am going to use that to combine it all a little bit better but that isn't necessary if you don't have one [Applause] so i can tell it's starting to heat up quite a bit um i can see the steam coming out so i'm just gonna lower the heat a little bit so i'm like medium low now all right so again the emulsifier is not required but if you have it it's a nice touch to just ensure that everything is evenly distributed that way for your dosing you can really tell how much coconut oil is in each gummy whereas if you don't have the immersion blender and you're just hand whisking it there might be a little bit more coconut oil and one gummy over another so i want this to heat up a bit more and get a little bit thicker so i'm going to turn the heat back up to medium and just a few more minutes until this thickens up a little bit more all right we can finally see those little bubbles starting to form i think that means that it's about ready so let's just stir that a couple times and then we're gonna turn off the heat so i just turned off the heat this should be good to go now i want my gummies to be two different flavors like i said i'm gonna do the sour cream apple and the lemonade but you don't have to do two flavors you can just do one so now that our mixture is done on the stove we can add the flavoring but because i'm doing two flavors i'm going to put it into two separate bowls if you were just doing one flavor you could mix it directly into the pot okay so i'm going to add my flavor in and you can add as much as or as little as you like you could also use like i said those little liquid water enhancers so in this one i'm going to do the kool-aid sour green apple oh my gosh it smells so good that color is so pretty just make sure we don't really have any chunks left in there we'll just kind of squish them up with our spoon you want to make sure you're doing this while it's still warm you kind of have to act fast because it does kind of like form a layer on the top so we have to act fast to avoid that if not we could just throw it in the microwave for like 20 seconds so i don't know i think one packet is enough but it's hard to tell i'm just gonna taste this and see okay so it tastes good with just one package but i think i want a little bit more you can kind of taste the coconut oil a little bit too much alright that color is even better it's so green now i'm going to flavor the other one with some lemonade no okay well i'll taste that that needs more lemonade i'm really glad i added that citric acid in there too because that sour taste is so nice i almost could have had more but i mean it's risky because you don't want to break down especially because lemonade is pretty much already all citric acid and of course if you want you can double this recipe it won't have any um effect negatively you can do it double tripled whatever works for you oh yeah that tastes so good now that we've got our flavors mixed in they're ready to put into the molds so i put my molds um on a tray so that it's easy once they're filled to pick it up and put it into the fridge um i've just learned that after a few times of having to try and pick these up when they have gelatin in them so i'm going to do swirls with my two colors um not necessary but just how i want to do it now that i filled them all up we're just going to put them in the fridge and we'll wait until they have solidified i think that's going to take about like 10-20 minutes my video just cut off but they are done so i'm just popping them out of their molds and then i'm going to put them up to dry so i'm just going gonna leave them under the hood fan and my microwave um for about 24-ish hours i just want them to kind of dry out and that way um all the extra excess moisture is gone and then i'll just put them into a little baggie and keep them in my drawer they look so cute don't they anyways i hope you guys enjoyed my video i hope you guys enjoyed my video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe i love hearing from you guys hope you have a wonderful day bye", "RcVOWaIsDes": "today I'm gonna be doing something really fun for children and this is my version of jell-o gummy bears so let me set up with all the ingredients that we need and I'll be back in a second so now that I've set up I'm gonna show you exactly what we need I have a silicon gummy bear mold a measuring cup for our water we're gonna be starting off with cold water but I'm gonna get to that step in just a second you're gonna need one tablespoon of gelatin that is equal to 15 milliliters and if you buy your gelatin in little pockets this is what it looks like it's a standard package and this holds one tablespoon or 15 milliliters and also a regular sized box of jell-o and this here is 85 grams so for our first step I'm gonna get my water ready and I'm gonna come back in one second for my first step I have added 1/2 a cup of cold water from my kitchen sink that is very important you need the water to be cold I am now gonna take that 1 tablespoon of gelatin and I'm just gonna sprinkle it over the top of the cold water and I'm gonna let this sit here for about 5 minutes because I want this to completely dissolve in that cold water you can already see that it's dissolving quite quickly so I'm just gonna let that go for a few more minutes and then I'll come back so this is 5 minutes later and I've just taken a fork and just stir this around everything is nicely dissolved and now I'm gonna take my last little bit of water 1/4 cup and dump that right in so in here we have a total of 3 quarters of a cup of water I am now gonna take this put this into the microwave and just microwave it for about a minute until it's hot so that was 1 minute on high and you can see now that it's much clearer that's because heat has been introduced into the gelatin and water and now we are ready to add in our actual jello mixture so I've opened up our little box of jell-o and now I'm gonna get that right in there and because the liquid is hot all of the jello mixture is gonna really just dissolve that much easier in there well I smells good too and I am using a cherry today I'm just gonna mix this around so you don't have to worry about the exact temperature that you heat this to in your microwave just make sure that it's hot does not have to be boiling just hot and that will help all the you know the actual package contents mix up in there really well and that's good and now we are ready to fill our mold so I've just put my mold on a little cutting board because this is very very flexible and if it's very hard to lift up when it's full so we're ready to pour it just give that a little bit of a stir just to make sure that all the contents are completely mixed but nothing has settled to the bottom and then I'm gonna start filling our little mold and that looks good just like that okay I'm just cleaning this up and now we are ready to pop this into the fridge so you want to put this in the fridge not the freezer just into your fridge and just let this chill down for about four hours and you're gonna have a really really nice gummy bears so I'm gonna pop this into my fridge and I'll come back much later on and I'm gonna show you the final product and they are really fun and they are full of flavor a few hours later once your jello has completely set you can just peel out your little gummy bears that's what's so nice about the silicone is that you can get right in there and just peel them right out so I'll continue doing this so I'll be back in a second and our last one and there we have them let's get them around the right way look at that really nice let me zoom in so I've zoomed in just a little bit to show you how nice these are and there we have it our jello gummy bears and look at how really gummy these are really really nice you can see that extra gelatin will really set these up really well and these here are super super fresh hmm a burst of flavor right in your mouth super super fresh hmm YUM I just zoomed in a little bit more because I think I heard some of you say zoom in a little bit more I want to see a little bit more detail in those gummy bears and here we have them aren't those cute made with jell-o and gelatin a little bit of water there we have them really fun really really delicious that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed it if you did please give me a thumbs up subscribe if you wish I really do appreciate that and that's it for today I'll see you next time you", "U3FvHNl2k58": "hey everyone i'm Shereen from mypaynecenter.com\u00a0\nthe cbd headquarters hey today i want to try our\u00a0\u00a0 new delta 8 gummies with you guys i want to tell\u00a0\nyou how i feel when i eat them what they taste\u00a0\u00a0 like and all that good stuff i'll even walk\u00a0\nthrough what is delta 8. i do have a prior\u00a0\u00a0 video that i made that goes through what is delta\u00a0\neight so you can watch that if you don't wanna\u00a0\u00a0 hear about what the gummy bears are like but you\u00a0\nwanna go straight into the what is delta eight so\u00a0\u00a0 right now on our site we carry delta eight in two\u00a0\ndifferent flavors we've got a few other flavors on\u00a0\u00a0 the way but for right now we've got two flavors\u00a0\non the site we've got a berry white which is an\u00a0\u00a0 indica indica is really good at night for sleep\u00a0\nbut it's got all the same benefits as the sativa\u00a0\u00a0 which is really good in the daytime because it\u00a0\ndoesn't make you as drowsy the sativa comes in\u00a0\u00a0 an orange crush flavor and the indica comes\u00a0\nin a very white flavor they're both delicious\u00a0\u00a0 the whole container has 30 gummy bears in it\u00a0\nthere's 750 milligrams in each container so each\u00a0\u00a0 gummy has about 25 milligrams of delta eight\u00a0\nin it so these are the two we carry right now\u00a0\u00a0 we also have these little sample packs so if you\u00a0\ndo order anything from mypaynecenter.com and you\u00a0\u00a0 want to try delta8 but maybe you're not willing to\u00a0\nmake the commitment right now to a whole bottle of\u00a0\u00a0 delta 8 just let us know in the notes section\u00a0\nhey i want to try a delta eight sample can i\u00a0\u00a0 get a sample and we will send you a sample so\u00a0\ntoday i'm going to take a sample of the indica\u00a0\u00a0 the barry white um because about 9 30 almost 9 45\u00a0\nhere at night and i'm probably gonna try to go to\u00a0\u00a0 bed by eleven eleven thirty so this should kick\u00a0\nin way before then and we're gonna have a great\u00a0\u00a0 night's sleep so i'm gonna take this now and\u00a0\nthen i'll walk you through what is delta eight\u00a0\u00a0 okay so here we go so it's just like\u00a0\nthis okay so i'm gonna eat it it's chewy it's pretty sweet too a little sour but\u00a0\nit's like a mixture it's like a sour bear i should also note the delta eight can\u00a0\nshow up on a drug test because there is\u00a0\u00a0 thc in it not the thc that's in the\u00a0\ndelta eight like there's delta a\u00a0\u00a0 thc and then there's delta nine thc and\u00a0\ni'm going to tell you the difference so i will say the gummy bear was sweet and sour it\u00a0\nwas a good taste you could taste the berry in it\u00a0\u00a0 there is like a slight aftertaste to it like a\u00a0\num like a bitter aftertaste to it so it's not\u00a0\u00a0 as smooth as a cbd gummy where you can't taste\u00a0\nany cbd in it you definitely can taste in the\u00a0\u00a0 aftertaste that there is something in this but\u00a0\nit's not gross or overpowering or overwhelming\u00a0\u00a0 but just be aware that there is an aftertaste\u00a0\nokay so we're gonna let that seep through my body\u00a0\u00a0 it is actually 9 54 right now so we can keep\u00a0\ntime on how long it takes for this gummy bear\u00a0\u00a0 to really take impact on me so what is delta eight\u00a0\nokay so i'm gonna i'm gonna make it really simple\u00a0\u00a0 there's delta eight which is\u00a0\nwhat we're talking about today\u00a0\u00a0 and then there's weed and in weed there's thc\u00a0\nand that thc makes you high paranoid stone\u00a0\u00a0 increases your anxiety whatever it does to you\u00a0\nmay make your mouth dry it may make you hungry all\u00a0\u00a0 that stuff that that's weed thc also called delta\u00a0\n9 thc okay this is delta 8 thc the difference\u00a0\u00a0 is a carbon bond and that's what makes the what\u00a0\nmakes them different now they both have the same\u00a0\u00a0 properties to them in the sense of what they can\u00a0\ndo for you they have the same benefits per se\u00a0\u00a0 so just like when you smoke weed to relax to lower\u00a0\nyour anxiety lower your stress chill out calm down\u00a0\u00a0 maybe use it for pain relief anxiety relief\u00a0\nsleep maybe usually for nausea maybe use it\u00a0\u00a0 as an appetite stimulant delta eight will do all\u00a0\nof that for you as well but delta eight will not\u00a0\u00a0 make you high stoned increase your anxiety make\u00a0\nyou paranoid make your mouth dry but this is\u00a0\u00a0 legal and you can buy it without either a medical\u00a0\nmarijuana id or for buying it from a dealer behind\u00a0\u00a0 the garbage can or i don't know i don't know how\u00a0\npeople buy drugs these days i'm really not sure\u00a0\u00a0 um but this is legal because it comes from a hemp\u00a0\nplant so it is legal under the farm bill of 2018.\u00a0\u00a0 i should also note though that this does have\u00a0\ndelta 9 or weed thc in it less than 0.3 percent\u00a0\u00a0 because if it's more than 0.3 it's not legal\u00a0\nanymore in the united states but if it's less\u00a0\u00a0 than point three percent it is legal however\u00a0\nthat means it will show up on your drug test\u00a0\u00a0 so be careful if you are going to have these\u00a0\nokay so i'm just gonna let it sink in um and\u00a0\u00a0 i'll just keep reporting out to you guys as i go\u00a0\nthrough my process here okay y'all i had to go\u00a0\u00a0 lay down because then it started to hit me and\u00a0\ni was like oh my god so how do i feel it is now 10 36 so it's been what is that 40 minutes yeah\u00a0\nit's been 40 minutes since i took the gummy\u00a0\u00a0 um i've been watching tik tok videos\u00a0\nso probably not the best thing to do\u00a0\u00a0 if you're trying to go to sleep but uh\u00a0\ni feel relaxed i feel calm i am feeling\u00a0\u00a0 drowsy like i can feel my eyelids getting heavy\u00a0\num they started watering for a hot minute too i feel kind of like heavy if that makes\u00a0\nsense like i'm lying down and i just feel\u00a0\u00a0 heavy not fat heavy though i don't\u00a0\nknow what's going on over here but like\u00a0\u00a0 just you know like when you're sleeping and\u00a0\nyou're just dead weight yeah i feel like i'm\u00a0\u00a0 already like a dead weight like i think my body\u00a0\nis already sleeping and it's like shut up now\u00a0\u00a0 and turn this off and go to bed so i'm gonna do\u00a0\nthat i'm gonna go to sleep and then i'll report\u00a0\u00a0 back to you guys tomorrow morning how i slept and\u00a0\nhow i feel until then good night good morning so\u00a0\u00a0 i slept great uh i went to bed around i think it\u00a0\nwas like 10 30 when i stopped talking to you guys\u00a0\u00a0 i was feeling sleepy at that point i wouldn't\u00a0\nsay i felt high or stoned or euphoric but i\u00a0\u00a0 definitely felt something and i've been trying to\u00a0\nthink of the word to use to explain it but like\u00a0\u00a0 nothing was spinning nothing was dizzy but i\u00a0\ncould feel a shift in my body but it wasn't like\u00a0\u00a0 a bad shift but i knew something was happening\u00a0\nbut it wasn't like concerning or anything but\u00a0\u00a0 i just want to let you guys know that so that\u00a0\nyou don't feel that i didn't tell you that if\u00a0\u00a0 you do start to feel that it was totally normal\u00a0\num fell into a really deep sleep like i could\u00a0\u00a0 tell i was in a deep sleep according to this my\u00a0\nscore was a 95 out of 100 which was great sleep\u00a0\u00a0 um i i did i did notice that i was in such a deep\u00a0\nsleep that i usually have to wake up in the middle\u00a0\u00a0 of the night to pee um for those of you under\u00a0\n30 and don't know what that feels like enjoy it\u00a0\u00a0 because the minute you turn 30 um like at least\u00a0\nfor me when i turn 30 and now i wake up to pee\u00a0\u00a0 in the middle of the night and i had i struggled\u00a0\na little bit trying to get up because i was in\u00a0\u00a0 such a deep sleep i couldn't wake myself up to\u00a0\ngo and do that like it was like it was a fight\u00a0\u00a0 you know what i mean like my bladder was like let\u00a0\nme out and my resume my body was like no we're\u00a0\u00a0 not going anywhere so there was that and then in\u00a0\nthe morning um even at 8 am i probably could have\u00a0\u00a0 slept more um that would have given me nine hours\u00a0\nof sleep and i could have slept more but the other\u00a0\u00a0 good thing about this is like when i woke up and i\u00a0\ngot myself to wake up because of my alarm clock i\u00a0\u00a0 didn't feel groggy so like i used to take advil pm\u00a0\nand if i woke up before it was time to wake up i\u00a0\u00a0 would feel groggy i just shook this off like so i\u00a0\nam uh excited about these i think these are great\u00a0\u00a0 i'm gonna definitely use them on the weekends um\u00a0\ndefinitely do not use these before you're driving\u00a0\u00a0 a vehicle or if you have to wake up early like say\u00a0\nyou only get five six seven hours of sleep stay\u00a0\u00a0 away from these but these are like my new favorite\u00a0\nthing i cannot wait for the weekend to try one\u00a0\u00a0 of these i will be back with a daytime video on\u00a0\nthe orange crush since it's a sativa it's really\u00a0\u00a0 good for the daytime so i will be back with this\u00a0\nreview but for then i will

[MUSIC PLAYING]", "uIPRrcxet6g": "g'day guys and welcome today I'm going to show you how to make gummy bears at home this is a great fun recipe for the whole family and it's very easy so for starters into a cold saucepan add half a cup of cold water 2 tablespoons or 20 grams of plain unflavored gelatin and 185 gram packet of flavored gelatin or jelly mix use whatever flavor you want and this will determine the color and the flavor of your gummy bears now give this a quick mix together and then turn the stove on to a low to medium heat and just allow this mixture to warm slowly for 5 to 10 minutes and just give it a stir every now and then once the gelatin is fully dissolved just pour it into a jar that's suitable for pouring and allow it to cool for a couple of minutes while this is happening you can skim off some of the foam on the top if you like this is purely cosmetic and now I've got my bear mold here you can use whatever shaped mold you want to make whatever fruit animal or shape you'd like so simply pour the mixture into the mould and then into the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes until it sets repeat this process for any other flavors and colors you'd like then just carefully remove them from the mold and you're done guys you have got a gummy bear a great variation of this is to make sour gummy bears so to do this just sprinkle over a little bit of citric acid and will make them nice and sour don't go overboard as it is a preservative and enjoy these are a great idea if you're looking to have a bit of fun in the kitchen and of course they taste great too be sure to subscribe to my channel for more great recipes thanks for watching and I will catch you all on Thursday you", "0gsvUuwBZVo": "hey everybody welcome back it's Master\nBlaster we're back at Johnny's green extractions and today we're in the\nkitchen we're gonna make gummy bears today and we're gonna infuse them with\nshatter we're gonna make 100 gummy bears here we're gonna use half a box of\njell-o two packs of gelatin maybe a tablespoon or two of our vegetable\nglycerin and we're gonna use our shatter here there's seven grams in here this\nshatter has to be decarboxylated which means it has to be heated to change the\nform of it from a THC a to THC so that you can get a medical effect from it and\nwith that being seven grams that will break down into point forty five\nmilligrams of shatter in each one of these gummy bears so they're going to be\nquite strong because they are for our own personal use and basically a medical\nused to help you sleep etc I just want to stress the point here that these are\ngummy bears and if you do happen to make something like this it is so important\nthat if there are children around whether it's grandkids your kids nieces\nnephews friends that have kids any kids that come over you can't just hide this\nstuff you actually have to lock this away because if a kid did get into it\nand they do seem to find things they will be hospitalized so everybody keep\nthat in mind and that's with all all edibles that you make that are THC\ninfused okay so our first step here is we're gonna decarboxylate this shatter\nwe're gonna put it in the oven at 200 and\n50 Fahrenheit for half an hour all right that's our first step here all right everybody we decarboxylated\nour shatter we melted our jell-o mixture it's warm remember everything's in low\nheat now we're just going to melt our shatter right into our liquid here slide\nit over to the heat pretty sticky   okay go we're gonna mix that in here now ok we got our hot liquid here we\nadded a teaspoon and a quarter of food glycerin just to disperse the shatter\nin here now this is a little tricky to do so we've got to move quick here here\nwe go and basically that is it okay everybody this is master-blaster\nsaying thanks for watching give us a thumbs up subscribe peace and we'll see\nin the next video bye guys", "0kRtpX4Yk2k": "i'm a gummy bear yes i'm a gummy bear i'm a

the first time you're joining and if you're a regular welcome back so today I am going to show you how to make these awesome Jolly Rancher gummies from actual Jolly Ranchers that's right so I make these with canister up you can also do them with the can of sugar if you want to know how to make those I do have videos they're made from textures there is a specific one can of sugar and then the other one for the can of syrup is can of flour powdered sugar and syrup not well show you how to make the syrup if you'd like so from the actual gummy art from Jolly Ranchers I've made these gummies and I'm going to show you just how to do that so it's usually I'm going to jump right into those ingredients and what we need to put that together and get it all put together for you so you can make these awesome candies well one thing I did I want to tell you so in the recipe I used three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I would recommend using four tablespoons of unflavored gelatin to the same three quarter cups of liquid so I I will put the correction in the ingredients in the comments I do sorry I'm they turned it a little bit softer than probably what I like so I would go with four tablespoons of the unflavored gelatin all right so now we'll jump into those ingredients and get right to her alrighty so for our Jolly Rancher gummies what we're going to need is about twenty of your preferred flavour of Jolly Ranchers so I'm going to use the blue raspberry and peeled of course take off graphics you're going to need a quarter cup of can of syrup that we're going to mix with this then for our candy syrup we are going to need one cup of white sugar regular sugar and 1/4 cup of can of syrup and a quarter cup of regular light corn syrup 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and a quarter cup of water for syrup then we're going to need three and sorry three and a half tablespoons to four so if you've got the packages of the gelatin you can just use the four packets they got a little bit off one you'll be good and 3/4 of a cup of water for your gelatin cold it needs to be very cold and then for our equipment we are going to need a candy thermometer a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler just use a pot where another heat safe Bowl will fit on top and that will suffice another pot for your candy syrup a couple of spatulas and then your bottles if you've got the bottles for dispensing your syrup if you don't have these guys these are great things if not you just use your eye droppers you've got those and of course your molds and that's everything we need to get started so let's jump right in and get it going alright so our very first step we want to do is bloom our gelatin so you are going to take your three and a half tablespoons and you're going to sprinkle it over your liquid you want to kind of get it all mixed around and then you're gonna get that you're gonna mix this in your gelatin into your liquid so you don't have any lumps and while you're mixing this this is a good yet to know whether your gelatin is a good strength or that it's not too old while you're mixing this it should already start to gel and while you're mixing it it should how to get turns to about the consistency of applesauce and that's how you know your gelatin is good and then we're going to just put that aside to bloom or total ready to loot till we need it now we are going to melt our our Jolly Ranchers and our corn syrup so we are going to melt our Jolly Ranchers and a quarter cup of our corn syrup all on our double boil just don't forget to put water in your bottom of your double boiler I've done it how come I plug it in hold on alright so we're gonna turn our heat on to medium medium or medium-high and we're gonna get our candy put your Jolly Ranchers into the pot mine got a little stuck in the bowl here got a lot of humidity too don't want to give it up gotcha and we're gonna put in our quarter cup of corn syrup our can of corn syrup and that eats up everything will begin to melt the Jolly Ranchers will start to melt you just want to try and get the candies covered and covered in the syrup just start getting things moving around but just going to continue to stir and this until the until your candies though the Jolly Ranchers are completely melted so it does take a while for the candies for the Jolly Ranchers to melt just be patient it does get kind of goofy and glumpy don't you can see that but just be patient it will all nose what I do is I let it sit for about a minute or so let it get heated up and then I stir it around breaking trying to break it up mush it down you just don't want to really overwork it does that just continue to do that your lumpy mess will turn into a nice syrup will see very shortly all right so now my candy start my Jolly Ranchers are all melted so you can see that a little better so we're just gonna set this off to the side for about five minutes to let that cool down before we add in our gelatin because if we add in our gelatin now it'll be too hot and it can break through gelatin that's a lot of problems that happens with with it so the next stage I'm just gonna let that cool down and we'll add in our gelatin and get that melted in and then we'll make that by the candy syrup and get it all put together so now that my syrup is cooled down it's time to add in the gelatin and I like to just do this and cut it up into smaller pieces and then we'll just plop we're all in and get that melting now you'll find if it's not melting you can turn your heat on to low put it back on the double boiler auctioneers probably enough heat from the water still from the double boiler to to melt the gelatin if it's not hot enough right still Cece was started melting because we have the cold temperature and the warm you can kind of have a separation here but once everything comes to the same temperatures and everything will mix together so you may find that your candy is kind of is starting to solidify getting a little clumpy well the gelatin is not really is not fully melting if that's the case then turn your heat on to low or just want to gently heat the reheat that up you just have to be patient with this because it is gonna take a few about five or five minutes or so for everything to come together properly you might think oh no it's not working but don't worry be patient so you're going to continue to gently stir this over the low heat until everything your Jolly Ranchers and your gelatin of all melts together in one even uniform syrup and there's nothing sticking to the bottom of the pot yeah once everything is melted together and everything's one uniform texture and color and there's nothing sticking to the bottom and now if you find here you may want to add a little bit of additional food coloring because the blue with the green it's gonna muddle that blue a little bit so if you do want that with more intense blue like your Jolly Rancher go ahead and add a little bit more blue food coloring it's just exactly what I'm gonna do here so you took the one out of much just one drop will make one to two drops at the mouth you can see the difference there with one drop me get that mixed in so that's a much nicer blue how well you can see that so I skip it too much then it's gonna I'm gonna spill it and not like we haven't seen me see me do that before so we want to see what the color is gonna look like you just drop it onto something white there and I'll just see what it looks like so I'm happy with that color goody-goody I'm just gonna set this off to the side and we'll get our candy syrup started alright so for our candy syrup part portion we're gonna pour in our 1 cup of sugar our quarter cup of cannister up our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our quarter cup of our sorry our half a teaspoon of citric acid and our quarter cup of water and we're gonna get stirred together so you just want to get it mixed together so the water and Evert the sugar in the syrups are all incorporated and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high forever this pillar so we're going to continue to stir this until until it begins to boil then if you have any duty sugar sugar sugar sugar crystals are so acceptance I just want to scrape that off or get a pastry brush and hot water and just wash down the stop then as soon as your syrup begins to boil you're going to stop stirring and we're going to watch your candy thermometer and we're going to cook the syrup to 260 degrees Fahrenheit and that's it just the letter go now periodically don't forget about your jelly the gelatin and your candy syrup you want to go around and stir that because it we can do start to solidify around the edges if it's like to pull off too much solid once once go around and just make sure that it's all still doing good but don't worry it'll get remelted once it gets out we added into the hot candy syrup whose life my candy almost up to temperature once you hit 260 you want to remove it from your meat immediately keep the candy thermometer attached because you want to wait until the syrup comes down to about 240 before we add in our other mixture the best is that you have a stone or marble surface to put it on is the best thing it draws the heat out quickly and and it doesn't get the surface doesn't get hot at all if not just put it off to the side burner and wait until your heat comes down to 240 all right so now my temperatures come down remove your candy thermometer grab your can you stir up your gelatin and your Jolly Rancher syrup and now we're going to gently pour it into our candy pot candy syrup here it'll probably bubble up a little bit and then you want to gently mix this and and continue stirring until it's all combined and you want to try to stir it gently to incorporate as little air MIDI as little air bubbles as you can but we need to make sure everything gets stirred there we go and once you're all good with air we're gonna get this poured into our bottles or you're just gonna use your dispensers your little eye droppers so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pour it through a little strainer this isn't necessary if you've got one great if not don't worry about it so because it gets so hot these gelatin may break a little bit you get that little bit of whiteness I can't really turn the pot that way for you but if you do you can run it through a strainer just so that doesn't get in and if not no worries it'll all kind of go up to the top I'm just gonna pour this in I don't want any left in here now one thing you can do is you can fill up if you want to know if your gelatin it's gonna set correctly is you can just set up one or two cavities in your in your candy mold put it in the fridge and it should start to solidify very fairly quickly within about five minutes or so it should start to set so you'll know if it's still really gooey and tacky then you may have difficult study let it leave it for twenty if after twenty minutes it's still not setting then the gelatin has gotten too hot or it is not it's not some notch Ellington's are all the same strength so it may not be strong enough you can remelt you can add that back into the pot and add in about another half a tablespoon more of gelatin so this way it saves you a lot of time and this has got to cool down anyway because it the bottles are too hot to handle even if I use the oven mitt you don't want to do it when it's super hot because what will happen is it'll warp your bottle and it'll screw them up so one of those will end up leaking on you so you don't want to do that so while my bottles are all that while I'm waiting for my syrup to call I threw a couple into the fridge so I'm gonna see how they're gonna set up now I wasn't setting you may find your bottles because the bubbles will start to come to the top and instead if any gelatinous broke them out White's gonna come to the top as well so what you can just do is get a little spoon and just scrape that tops kind of skin right off of there oh yeah that way it's not gonna end up into your candy and make it muddled want to have a nice clearer looking syrup all right so I did check my candies they are starting to set up nicely because the syrup is hotter it's taking them longer and I don't want to leave this get too cold so yeah so the velocity is really you just distribute it into the molds if it's still a little hot for your hands full you can use paper towels on it which is exactly what I'm gonna do cuz that's too small just hold up some paper towel to put around it I thought I don't go with the oven mitts because I find that they're heavy and clunky and that's it just disperse it into your molds and put them in the fridge for about two hours for them to fully set and I'll come back we'll pop these out to see what these bad boys looked and chase like I tasted the syrup and oh my god it's so good it tastes just like a jolly rancher now if you find that your candies don't set you put them in the fridge for two hours they come out and they're still sticky you can't get them out of the mold don't panic put them into the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours let me get good and frozen and then pop them out so I don't you have to do one mold at a time take them out one at a time pop them into a double boiler remelt it add another half a tablespoon to a tablespoon will be good enough bloom gelatin and that will fix that problem and the same thing if you you've gone you've made them set them up and they're just way too jelly they're very very jelly to sick you can still you remem and add in a little bit about a quarter of a cup of liquid and that should take care of that all right so I will be back when these are set and we'll pop them out and see how pretty they look all right so welcome back here so my gummies I have them sitting in the fridge just over two hours and now we're gonna take them out so as you see first it looks like they're gonna be sticky but you just got to pull around the sides and we'll start to pull away as long as they're doing that and you can pull them out you're good you're gonna slay them on your parchment paper or stand them up if you can some of your candies molds are able to stand up others won't so I bought these guys on their sides and then also when it's warm especially it's warm I only take out one or two molds at a time to take them out and leave the rest of the fridge so that they don't warm up too much if I don't have a hard time getting them out of the molds and then I'm just gonna let these little guys dry for 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go yeah if there is still a little bit sticky once you've dried them you can toss them in a little bit of cornstarch so you don't want to do too much usually what I'll do just coat my hands in them and then run my coat my hands and cornstarch and then just run my hands through the candy and just kind of get a very light coating on them the other thing is you could do the same thing with oil so if you want to just take some cooking water olive oil coat your hands to them rub it in and then just gently go over your candies look at a little bit of an oil that will help them to stop from sticking as well and there you've got it Jolly Rancher canna gummies look at that baby and these guys taste so good oh I tried one earlier I don't know if I'm gonna get these to drying time get them fully dried they're so good but anyway guys that's it for that tutorial I'll be back to say goodbye and yeah that's about it oh one thing is gonna tell you so if you tried taking them out of the molds and they weren't coming out they're too sticky as I said don't panic put them in the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours pop them out put them into a double boiler let them melt down again and then bloom a quarter or sorry a half a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of liquid blue matte add that in and that will take care of that problem recast them and you should be good that's awesome thing we working with gelatin and the either if there is a mistake you can usually fix it as long as you haven't burnt it oh and remember that this version of the recipe is just for playing gummies we are not going to sugar or citric acid these if you do they're going to melt I will do another version of the Jolly Ranchers of the sour version for you okay so don't add your sugar and citric acid to this they will melt so that is my tutorial on a can of Jolly Rancher gummies I hope you enjoyed that and if you have any questions as always please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and as I said in the beginning of the video in case you just skipped right over it use four tablespoons of gelatin versus three and a half it'll make that little bit of difference or a little bit softer than I probably would have liked but if you like a softer gummy go the screen 1/2 but if you want that more firm gummy go with the four and you'll be good to go check out that baby's its see-through ish it's got that clear candy looking it tastes just like a jolly rancher it's so good so please let me know if you give this a try I'd love to hear from you on which flavor you prefer and once again thanks so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "_XVNvnQLo44": "hey thanks for joining me today I want to show you how to make gummies a lot of people ask about hey do you have a gummy bear mold well essentially all of our chocolate molds are gummy bear mold so you can really make any shape that you want to so what I want to show you today is you're doing this from scratch we're not using a box mix of any sort so the powder gelatin that we have here at sweet wise is a really great deal because you can get a whole pound and then we're going to be using some of the sweet wise flavorings those are all natural and then the citric acid that we have here as well so the recipe is pretty basic I'm just going to use a cup of water and two-thirds of a cup of sugar and then I'm going to use four tablespoons of gelatin but before I get the rip to the rest of it like with the flavor and color and everything I want to give you a few tips on mixing this what I did I went ahead and did a cup of hot water with my sugar because when you pour the sugar into the cold water then it takes a little bit more time to dissolve that granulated sugar and you really you know want to dissolve that before you get to the gelatin it just makes it a little bit better so I went ahead and this hot water that I mixed with the sugar and I also went ahead and mix my color because let me show you this if you add the color I'm going to do red in this one just to show you the difference if you do the color in here then it can be kind of gloppy and it's a little bit hard to mix into cold water as well you have these little spots that don't mix as well so when I mix it with the hot water this is essentially the same thing with a different color okay so you can see how much clearer it is when I use hot water mix the color in and the sugar that's all I am right here 1 cup of water 2/3 cup of sugar and the coloring and then it's cooled back down to room temperature now we can add the gelatin and I've got 4 tablespoons of the sweet wise gelatin and I'm just going to go ahead and sprinkle this slowly on top and I'm not going to stir it quite yet I wanted to start absorbing all of that liquid and you'll notice that it starts to bloom is what it's called it starts to absorb that liquid over time and once that's all absorbed then we can melt it so that'll probably take a minute or two so we'll just leave that alone and come back to it okay so my gelatin is all dissolved so now I'm just going to add a teaspoon of the lemon flavoring now this is an actual lemon oil so if I was going to use like this cherry flavoring over here in the red I would probably want to do two teaspoons in that but the lemon is so much stronger I'm just going to do one teaspoon in that give it a little stir and then I'm going to take it over to the microwave should take about 20 seconds and then it will probably be ready all right so I'm going to check it give it a stir I think this needs a little bit more time I'm going to give it about another 15 seconds you want to make sure that you don't overdo it on the first round because you you can scorch some spots you don't want to do that so this is ready usually I have a lot more foam on the top and this this batch turned out really nice but what you want to do before you start using this is just kind of skim this off just kind of gather it off to the side and take a spoon then just kind of discard it off to the side that way you can have a nice clear gummy okay you don't have to have every single particle out of there but just having the bulk of it out really helps now you can pour it right out of here it has a nice funnel but that really only works well if you have a bigger cavity like this if you're doing something more finely detailed like these teddy bears or these little gems I really like to put it in a squeeze bottle so let me just go ahead and pour that in here and since it's nice and warm that'll go quickly if this does cool off you can pop it back in the microwave for 10 or 15 seconds and it'll be a lot more fluid again you may have a few little leaks in this but I wouldn't worry about that too much okay so let me show you about preparing these you really don't need to oil these or anything but it does help but come out a little bit more easily I'll show you an example these have not been oiled they sat at room temperature about 20 minutes this one was oiled and this one was not so you'll see I'm just gonna take a toothpick and I'm going to kind of start the edge and then get my finger under there and pull it out that one pops out really easily this one will come out easily but not as easily as the oiled one this one does have a little bit more shine to it if you'll notice but what I want to warn you about is if you do add like a spray in here and we just do one of these down here like a quick spray like this all these bubbles that are here we'll come out in the surface of the jello so you want to avoid that by just kind of brushing it around or maybe taking paper towel and get that excess out of there so just to show you how to fill these I want to fill this one just to the edge these bigger ones I pop in the fridge for like 20 minutes and they're fully set if you left it at room temperature I'm guessing this would be at least an hour these take about 20 minutes these little bitty cavities they take about 20 minutes at room temperature and then they pop right out and I'll show you one of these as well you see how easy that comes right out and then of course the rubber Ducky's it which is why I did the yellow with the lemon if you want to do that for a baby shower again this is a little bit bigger cavity so if you want to pop that in the fridge for about 20 minutes that would come out as well but you want to avoid like over filling these you can take like a bench scraper or something to clean that up but if it forms on there then it's just a little bit ugly and then you can always go back and trim it up with scissors but that's just more work so I just say use the squeeze bottle and make it a little bit easier on yourself one more tip if you want to make the sour is to use citric acid now this is very very strong so don't use it straight you're going to just really give somebody a heart attack I do like 5 or 6 parts of sugar just granulated sugar to one part of citric acid so if you're using a teaspoon measure I have two teaspoon measure whatever that's fine too but what I like to do so like these already done you can put this like in a little salt shaker if you want to but I don't like to sprinkle it right out of the container because it'll just be too heavy so just put a little bit in my hand and then I also don't sprinkle down close to the piece I'm doing it just kind of it sticks too much in little globules if you'll raise your hand a little bit higher and just kind of sprinkle from up high then it gives you a little bit more even coating and it's also not quite as strong as if you did it really really close so there's a really great easy way to make gummies you can make them the regular way or the sour way I really like that you can kind of customize your color if you do want to like for a baby shower for a wedding or for a birthday you can kind of make the colors and flavors work to your advantage rather than just buying something that's pre-made plus just having the custom shapes and different sizes people are really going to be impressed that you made these so give it a try thanks for watching have fun with it you", "WPakqUMCCIA": "So today I'm making gummy candy. I'm starting with a half cup of cold water,\nand to that I'm going to add three packets of plain gelatin. I'm just going to open these up, you can find\nthese in the store, they're available in the little box. I'm using Knocks but any kind will do, and\nI just want to add this gradually so it won't clump up. So just with a nice spatula or spoon make\nsure that your constantly stirring. Stir, stir, stir. You can see it's turning into a gelatin kind\nof a mess here. Which is perfect, just what we're looking\nfor. So I'm just going to stir that around and\nlast but not least I'm going to add one whole packet of Jello, because I'm really just going\nfor it. And I'm using the blue one, but any flavor\nyou like will do. Just pour it in there and again stir it around\nso nothing will clump up. So that is it, I'm going to take my candy\nand I'm going to move it to I have a pot of water simmering on this stove. And then I'm just going to heat it up inside\nthis pot of water. So I'm using a glass measurement cup and I'm\njust letting the heat from the water, kind of heat up my mixture. So this way none of my gelatin is going to\nend up burning, it's all very safe, very kind of a gentle process. You could also just pop it right into the\nmicrowave if you prefer and that's fine too. I'm just going to let that kind of simmer,\nand get nice and thick. So my mixture has melted so I'm ready to go,\nand here I have a nice cute little I have like a jewel mold. You can get any kind of plastic mold that\nyou like or any other kind of candy mold that. The little bears are really fun and adorable. But just while my gelatin is still nice and\nsmooth and liquid, I'm just going to go ahead and pour it right into my mold. You can even go ahead and fill it the way\nup to the top or as big as you like them. That is it. I'm going to let those sit up on the counter\nfor about 10 to 15 minutes or until they're nice and firm to the touch, to keeping them\nto the heat of your house you might need a little longer or a little less. But as soon as they're firm I'm going to take\nthem out of the mold and we're ready to go. So my blue gummy candy are still setting up\nbut I have some that are already done, so these are just the same just with a lemon\nflavor and a cherry flavor. The same recipe and you could see them getting\nnice and firm and chewy. Now if you want to get that kind of classic\nsour candy coating, you take a little bit of sugar mixed with a touch of citric acid. And what that's going to do is give our candies\na nice sour coating. And that's it or you can leave them plain\nor you can just drench them in sugar. Anything that you like, but anyway, enjoy. That's how you make gummy candies at home.", "WMwvIJ4BUgI": "hi guys welcome back to my channel for those of you who are new welcome my name is Amanda and today I am reviewing the Jessie PD gummies this is my first time reviewing a CBD product and this is actually the first time that I've tried to CBD product so let's go ahead and get into it this video I wanted to cover why I was interested in testing on a CBD product and it's because I've experienced a lot of anxiety stress and I have a hard time sleeping sometimes sometimes it'll be hard for me to fall asleep and sometimes it'll just be hard for me to stay asleep I'll wake up multiple times throughout the night and so I just won't get that great of a sleep so I wanted to find a product that relaxed me so I turned to CBD just to try it out I basically just wanted to try to find a product that would help me relax and help me sleep better or feel less stressed a little bit about the just CBD product and brand I saw it on Instagram and so I decided to give it a try if you're interested in trying out just EVD I will leave my referral code or link down in the description box below the product that I got is the just CBD gummies and I got it in the rainbow ribbons they're basically like rainbow ribbon candy gummies with CBD in it I started out with the 250 milligrams size I believe this is a small size they offer but basically it contains about 20 pieces in here each piece is about 12.5 milligrams of CBD and you can tell that I just finished my container and that is why I wanted to do a review about it based on their website it's as adults typically take about 20 to 30 milligrams of CBD and you can up or lower the dosage as necessary so that would be about two pieces of this gummy ribbon but I think the suggested dosage or a recommendation maximum is about four pieces I honestly don't know too much about CBD but I know it does not get you high so you won't feel those types of side effects with this product it does say on the website that it'll take about 30 to 45 minutes to take effect so it just takes at a time once you take the gummy if you are interested in purchasing from the just CBD store or the brand I do want to note here about they do charge a foreign transaction fees so if you can try to use a credit card that with no foreign transaction fees just to avoid that moving on to my experience and my review this again was my first product that had CBD in it that I was testing out and so I didn't quite know what to expect and I started out very slow I started out with a dosage of just one gummy and then I moved on up to four gummies starting off with a taste I think it was pretty decent I love gummies so I was excited to try a gummy product with sweidy in it and it did taste kind of like gummy rainbow ribbons but I feel like sometimes I'm a little bit sensitive to taste so certain pieces I could taste more CBD taste than others if that makes sense it just tasted like something else other than a gummy candy as far as taste goes I feel like I would purchase this again based on the taste it tasted pretty good I could continue eating product like this in terms of how well the product worked however I think that's a little bit of a different story I did start out with one piece and then I gradually made my way up to four pieces as a single dosage I moved up in dosage because I didn't really notice I was getting any results from one piece or two pieces or three pieces so gradually I made my way up to four pieces and unfortunately at four pieces I wasn't sleeping any better it was still hard for me to sleep I still felt stressed I think sometimes when I would take the CBD gummies I would feel slightly more relaxed but I don't know if that was just with SIBO fact or if it was really helping me but overall it didn't really change or improve the quality of my sleep I was still very anxious and stressed out when I slept and didn't sleep any better that I noticed so based on the results that I got from the product I probably wouldn't purchase this again I might try a different product affairs or just taking CBD in a different form but I just want to share my experience with you just to let you know how well it worked for me or didn't work I'm excited to try different types in the future if you are interested in purchasing or trying this out again I will leave my referral and the description box below but I can't personally say that I would purchase this product again if this video helped you please give it a like and don't forget to subscribe for more videos like this I hope to see you in the next one thank you so much for watching bye", "hurGRpDwYeM": "Please subscribe, like, and comment Watermelon soda It smells like watermelon!

We\u2019re going to start out by preparing our\nfruit for our homemade gummies. So I have some strawberries that have been\ndefrosted. Feel free to use fresh, but when berries are\nout of season, I like to use frozen. Now what we\u2019re going to do with these is\nput them into a food processor and make a puree. We\u2019re just going to puree them until they\u2019re\nnice and fine and there\u2019s no lumps. Next, we\u2019re going to take our puree and\npass it through a sieve. Now we do this step because we want to remove\nseeds and we also want to end up with a nice, smooth strawberry puree at the end. So we have our lovely fruit puree, we\u2019re\ngoing to head over to the stove and combine it with the rest of our ingredients. In a heavy-bottom saucepan, add in your strawberry\npuree, water, lemon juice, and honey. And then heat all of these ingredients together\nuntil they just come to a simmer. Now that our mix is simmering, it\u2019s time\nto add in our gelatin. Now if you are vegan or don\u2019t eat gelatin,\nyou can always replace this with agar powder, which you can buy online or at a health food\nshop. Sprinkle your gelatin over the mix and then\nwhisk it in until there\u2019s no more lumps and your mix comes back up to a simmer. Ok perfect. So I\u2019m going to take this off the heat. I can see that there\u2019s no lumps of gelatin. It\u2019s nice and smooth. If you do find lumps of gelatin in yours,\nyou can feel free to pass it through a sieve again to remove those. To make these real, authentic gummy bears,\nI\u2019m going to set mine in this mold I got online. It\u2019s really inexpensive. However, if you don\u2019t have one of these\nmolds, you can always line a tray with cling wrap and this\u2019ll work just as well. You\u2019ll just have to cut our your gummies. I\u2019m going to put a link for this mold along\nwith the recipe for my gummy bears on biggerbolderbaking.com. If you\u2019re using a mold, lay it into a tray\nbefore you start filling it up. Pour your mix into a jug with a small spout\nso it\u2019s easy to pour into the molds. And also, if you see any bubbles floating\non top, just scoop that away with a spoon. Now just very slowly, fill up all of your\nmolds with your gummy mix. If you see any air bubbles, just pop them\nwith your finger. So when I worked as a pastry chef, one of\nmy jobs was to make the sweets for after dinner. And every night, we made pate de fruits, which\nis exactly what this is. It\u2019s kind of like a fruit paste. Ok and that\u2019s them done. So now remember, you don\u2019t just have to\nmake strawberry. You can make any flavor you like. I also made blueberry homemade gummies and\norange flavored homemade gummies. The orange flavor is particularly easy because\nyou just use orange juice instead of a puree. Once you\u2019ve filled your mold, we\u2019re going\nto put our gummy bears in the fridge overnight so they can set. If you like this video, don\u2019t forget to\nsubscribe to my channel so you don\u2019t miss out when I upload a new one. So I made these gummy bears yesterday because\nI wanted them to be nice and set so I could show you. If you\u2019re using a mold, just go very gently\nto ease out your gummy bear. You don\u2019t want to damage him. Just look at this little gummy. He is adorable. And the best thing about it is you made him\nand you know exactly what went into him. It\u2019s all good ingredients. You can create any fruit flavors you like\nso the possibilities are endless. Don\u2019t forget to head over to my website,\nbiggerbolderbaking.com where there is a recipe on how you can make your own sour gummies. Thank you so much for watching and I\u2019ll\nsee you back here next Thursday for more Bigger Bolder Baking.", "uBlyb3dh02U": "good afternoon we're going to make some THC infused gummies first step is to make sure you have everything that you need out so our items are a three ounce package of unflavored jello or flavored gelatin not sugar-free I'm using two packets of unflavored as per the recipe that I posted and 2/3 cup cold water I've also got my lecithin to the side to put a little bit in because that is a nice fat protein that the THC bonds to there's a little machine that keeps it to a perfect time without having to go back and forth to the stove also has a link posted since we're doing super Lemon Haze on blue so let's again box tile I like to make sure it's very loosely powdery because it'll stick together I said it is a plant fat protein mini whisk mix all of these powders together enter water so we want to make sure that all of the gelatin is wet and separated and there are no clumps of gelatin that are still powdered the gelatin is mixed and 15 minutes has elapsed the gelatin has soaked up the water so enter the trusty little heater you turn that on I'm going to go ahead and break up the gelatin a little bit here and I'm going to wait probably about 10 minutes to come back and stir it again back quick search it's starting to look clearer for the record I'm doing blue for super-lon haze because true clear has a blue label just like I did read for indica and I did yellow for hybrid alright we're gonna let it sit another five minutes so it's been a little bit I'm gonna go with that is as clear as it needs to work because there's lecithin and it doesn't get that crystal clear like if you're doing candy but it is quite smooth quite runny I'm going to inject the super Lemon Haze truth here into it that has been so deep and warming in a cup of warm worth yeah it's tough [Music] and what i'm doing here is optional ma'am I usually pull that off but I'm going to pull some of the jello up in give it a shake and squirt that back in we all want to make the most of all of our product so I'm going to stir that in and once again I'm going to let it sit for five minutes to infuse before we put it into the molds all right we're gonna give it one more stir then because this is gelatin and not egg I'm not gonna whisk it super fast assuming it's going to stay in there [Music] smells like THC so the gummy bear molds that I put the link to hold about a milliliter you don't need to measure but they came with little droppers I'm going to hand this off to my partner because he has a much better non-payment you if you drip anything cuz it's silicone it's gonna that's basically gonna be one dose all of the little dots that end up on top of the silicone yeah kind of scrap all those at the end put them together it's almost like having an extra Bayer we use the opposite color or a different color than the jello you he's gonna go ahead and fill the rest of those up and we'll be back in a moment on to another bold [Music] we're gonna go ahead and stipple some cornstarch onto the back I put these in the freezer they've set and I've let them come back to temperature to make sure there's not a lot of moisture so this is my makeup brush there's a link to this this is the stipple the flat top that's what we're gonna stipple with so I've got cornstarch I just used the cornstarch lid they've got a little folded up foil and a paper towel in case I feel like it's getting too thick so I just went to stipple along the back of these and if you feel there's a bit much you can always go back and kind of wipe something away the nice thing about the brushes you can twist it and if you feel there's too much corn starch somewhere then you can use the edges of it so I like to know that my backs are good prior to pop them out I'm gonna pop this one out like so now gonna turn it over and show you the quick way I just stick my nail into it and pop them out and then lay them out afterwards welcome back to the final step we're going to say it's been 24 hours these will stay out overnight these have been out for 24 hours they're slightly smaller because they've now reduced down a little bit in size once they have dehydrated a bit as such I stipple them on the top with the cornstarch and I'm able to have them not to be sticky any further questions please feel free to send me a private message or post on the video however you'd like thanks", "tJquc9UyobU": "- ( Collins Key ) This is the largest melted gummy snake turned into sour slime. Three, two, one. You challenge me to melt giant gummy food into edible DIY candy slime\nthat you can actually eat. And so to do this, I got my friend Natalie from Natlie's Outlet over here. She is the queen when it comes to pranks, when it comes to DIY, so\nshe's gonna be helping me out. Today we are making three\ntypes of edible candy slime. The first one is out\nof a giant gummy worm. - The second one is\nwatermelon flavored slime. - And the last one... - Oh. - And for the last one, we are melting this eight foot long giant gummy snake into the sourest candy slime in the world. And then we're gonna eat it. So right now, let's get started. - How to does this work? - Make this super rare slime. First we need to melt\nthe giant gummy worm. So let's do this. - Ready? - Yep. Okay, go towards the bottom. Oh, that looks so cool. We're like burning it. Try to keep it like-- uh-oh. It smells really good though. Alright, it's kinda... - It's catching fire. - Oh yeah, it is on fire. It's starting to drip though. It's starting to drip. Come on, I believe in you. Oh my gosh, there we go. That's a lot of it dripping out. Oh, that's a lot of smoke. Oh, we don't have time for fire alarms. Okay, inside is getting kinda\nburned and kinda charred. If you do this at home be very careful. Make you sure you have\nparental supervision. But it's kinda working a little bit. We are melting the gummy. I'm gonna try this really quick. Just kind of see how it's tasting so far. It taste delicious. - Hmm. - But this is not quite working how I thought it would, because look at this. It's like a crusty mound right... Ow, that's hot. It's working, it's working! Yes, woohoo! - Woohoo! - This is so cool. This literally reminds\nme of when we were doing that liquid metal fidget spinner. The way this thing is melting is crazy. - It's bubbling. So now that we've melted\nit, we're gonna add some cornstarch. Kind of eyeball it and then\nwe're gonna make some slime. - Yeah! I done this before one time\nwhere I accidentally used my hands prematurely. Bad idea. Ah, it's on the back of my hand. No, no, no, no, no. So we're gonna use a spoon for as long as we possibly can to make it. Oh my gosh. It's starting to get\nstringy, so I think we need a little bit more cornstarch. And then we're also gonna\nwant to add a little bit of powdered sugar in. This is how we'll make it taste good. Now we're gonna switch of stirring duties. Not 'cause my arm got tired at all, just because I think it\nwould be great to share. Everyone gets to have a little bit of the experience. These videos are never clean. Ever. So ladies first. I'll let you... Let you do your thing. I'm a gentlemen when it\ncomes to candy slime. I've learned that to have\ngood slime it shouldn't stick to your hands, but\nlike it's stuck to my hands. It's like my hand is sneezing. Oh, there's still more\nslime left in the bowl that has not been mixed yet. Whoa, this spoon is covered. Yo, I've got a new idea for a candy. It's called the sugar spoon. Stick it into powdered sugar... Like the cinnamon challenge. Quick, high five. Oh!\n- Oh! - We're like stuck together now. You know what's missing right now? - What? - Some nerds. Alright, so we're gonna add some nerds in what's going on. - Woo, party. - Yo this is so... (Collin sneezes) - Ew. - This looks so, so cool. 'Cause now it's not only candy slime, but now there's like\nthis little bumps here where you can see the nerds. - So you wanna taste it? - I think yeah, it's time to taste it. But first, I have a challenge. I want to see can you\nsubscribe to this channel, turn on the channel post notificatoins, and give this video a thumbs up. Seven seconds, here we go. Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Done. If you can do that, comment down below. Keyper Squad right now. So now for the taste test, you ready? I'm gonna go for a giant chomp. Here we go. Three, two, one. - Crunchy, slimy. Every kid's dream. - It taste delicious. - Kinda tastes like gum. Wow, Collin. - Let's melt this watermelon. - Woo!\n- Woo! That was very unsafe. - Yeah, it was. It was a little too close to my face. We're gonna be doing the hot knife versus the gummy to melt it. We're gonna give this a shot right now. So first. Let's heat it up. It's glowing. There we go. Three, two, one. Let's see if this works. - There goes. - Yo, it's working! Oh no! No, no, it's so smokey! Oh gosh no, what've we done? It smells delicious, yet very toxic. It's working, there we go. It's almost like slicing off the gummy. Yes! Yes! Yes! I've got a new start\nthis time guys, though. Watch out. Gonna slice it off. - [Natalie] You should\nslowly slice it off. - Yo, I wonder if you can\nslice right through it? Get so smokey so quick. Yo, but it's actually melting it, guys. The way I'm holding\nthis, this flamethrower in my face is not a good idea. I'm just like... Well without smoking up the entire house, I think we're gonna pop this one again in the microwave, but this actually works. Like this actually melted. The hot knife was\ndefinitely a better strat than just the blowtorch. So right now, pop it in\nthe microwave and let's go. What started off looking nice and pretty, and now it's just kinda... It looks like grease or like an oil. - Pour some in. - Let's do it. - Slime. - Slime! Whip it, flip it, sauce boy! YO, this looks so nasty, fam. - Ew, it looks like hairball. - I was going somewhere else with it. I'm like this doesn't\nlook like a watermelon. It looks like peanut butter. Go away. Alright, so now we're gonna pick it up with our hands and go... Oh my gosh! I got it on my shirt. Aw well, that's part of it. But now I have an edible candy shirt. - You've got skills. - Yo, this looks like a\nmakeup that you would put on. Like it looks like a foundation. - Wanna pour some on? - I'm good. One more step to make sure it's the ultimate watermelon gummy. - What about me? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Collin share. - I think mine are just\nkinda disengrating. Hers look really pretty, and then look what happened to mine. Mine just kinda splattered everywhere. It's definitely turning red now. So we didn't have the color before, we definitely have the color now. Oh man. So let's see if this actually tastes like a real watermelon gummy. And if you wanna see me do a whole bunch of crazy DIY's and experiments live every single Saturday, 1\nPM Pacific Standard Time, I'm partnering with\nLive Me as summer long. So yeah, the download link is\ndown in the description below. Come join, it's free, it's superfun. Tell your friends and also\ncomment what should we do on our livestreams, 'cause\nwe're gonna be doing literally whatever you want. So right now, you ready to try this? Here we go guys. Three, two, one. Ho, ho, it's stuck to my teeth. Alright, so final verdict on this. What are your thoughts? - I don't like it. - Yeah, I thought it was good at first, and then I started tasting\nall of the corn starch, and that really is terrible. So right now, we've been\nmelting the eight foot gummy snake into the sour\ngummy slime in the world. Let's go. This is literally an eight foot gummy. Oh my gosh. It's so heavy. It's like 20 something pounds. It's almost like it weighs 30 pounds. We're gonna make it sour. We also need the bucket. Alright, so I think I\nhad it for like a second. Can we get the bucket? You're gonna take the snake... Ow. It smacked me in the face. Where'd the eyeball go? Ah. I want the other eyeball though. I want to try this. - Good? It's so heavy. - Use your muscles. (Collin and Natalie cheer) - This is so cool. Fashion is my passion, but I'm gonna release my scarf now. Almost fell over. I wonder what it's gonna taste like. - It's lipstick. - What? You wanna try to hold this thing? - Yeah. Oh. - That was like choking me. Because this is eight\nfeet long, we can't pop it in the microwave. So now, we're making our own microwave. You know what, what I think we're gonna do is let's just chop it up,\npop it in the microwave, and then put it back in here. Because there's no way\nwe can melt this down. - Cheers!\n- Cheers! Oh my gosh. There we go. Oh jeez, oh. Alright here we go. Time to make some... Yo, that was a powerful mix. - Stir, stir, stir, stir, stir. - This one is going to need\na lot more corn starch, because right now you can\ntell it's super, super gummy. Oh my gosh, she got it all over me. It looks like a bizarre\nalien substance for real. - Yay! Now we can do this. Now the corn starch won't get in my nose. - Yo, this stuff looks crazy. You good? - Yeah. No, I really can't breathe. I can't see. - I think this slime\nis getting pretty good. And now we're gonna\nadd the sour candy into what's going on. So right now... What kind of a sound was that? We're doing a lightning\nround with the sour candy, and to kick it off, this is Cry Baby Soda. - I never had that. - I've never had it either. So you have to bite off\nthe top of it, apparently. It's like wax. Cheers.\n- Cheers. Oops. I missed my mouth. Eww! That's sour. - Next up, toxic waste. Cheers! I've got some Warhead Chewie Cubes. We got like two left. - [Natalie] I never had these. - They're sour, but not too bad. - Yummy. - Got this, I don't know what this is. Oh, it's like a roll? Three, two, one. Oh no. - Are these like Pop Rocks? Yeah, sour power. Alright, here we go. Sprinkle a little bit of\n'em in here, and then... Holy cow! Alright, I think we got\nsome of this stuff here. I don't know what this is. Looks like some spray stuff. You like that? (Natalie screams) - It's in my nose. It burns. - Yo guys, so we're adding some malic acid and she wants to try this stuff. - I'll do it for the Keyper Squad. - You got it. Before you try it, guys\nwe also filmed a video on her channel where we made slime. It's as crazy as it sounds. The link is down in the description below. So go check it out, go\nsubscribe to her channel. Give her video a thumbs up\nand comment Keyper Squad. Oh! Yo, I told you this stuff is crazy! - My tongue, my tongue, my tongue. It's still going! - It's still going? Alright, we're gonna do this. We're gonna do this quick. We'll sprinkle the malic acid. That's so much! That sour stuff is so intense. It's so intense. There's so much malic acid everywhere. This is the largest melted gummy snake turned into sour slime. We're about to eat it right now. But comment down below\nwhat's another giant gummy something that I\nshould melt into candy slime. But right now, you ready for this? - Yep. - Here we go. Three, oh-no, two, one. (Collin and Natalie yell) (Collin mumbles) Okay, bye! It's not a joke. It's not a... It's not a joke. You're like, \"Yeah I'll give this a shot.\" I'm like, \"Fam!\"", "XK1PuIkrEk8": "[Music] d [Music] d hey girl hey what is up you guys it has been a minute since i've done a slime video with me not uploading much in december in general i didn't upload any slime videos in december i don't even know if i uploaded a slime video in november i probably uploaded one in october last time today i decided to come back with a fun slime video not just any slime video an edible slime video i did one of these also months ago so basically turn this candy into slime challenge last time we did three to four candies and today we're doing three more this is a fun little series part two today the candy that we're gonna be turning into slime is skittles tootsie rolls and gummy bears so let's get to it let's see how these turn out i get a little bit nervous about these just because edible slime is so so much more complicated than not edible slime also you guys i just want to mention i am very aware that my fire alarm battery needs to be changed i think it just went off yes it's annoying i'm so sorry you guys i get it girl i think it's annoying too okay so first slime we're gonna attempt to make is a skittles slime we have a skittles right here let me tell you we had to do some research for some of these because not always will candy turn into slime it's not always slimeable so alex behind the camera she actually separated all these by color i can't believe you separated all the skittles literally all of them it's an even amount it's an even amount for all the colors that is incredible that's a point for skittles because we've separated colors before in the past with different candy and a lot of times for some reason like the best ones like they have the least red or you know things like that which is kind of crazy but that's the tea guys so what you're gonna need to make these is sour skittles we're gonna need some cornstarch we're going to need a coffee grinder yes we're gonna need coconut oil and we're gonna need some marshmallows okay so we have our coffee grinder this is uh the mr coffee one and i believe we had gotten this for another video and video and we even bought the skittles and everything and then we didn't end up we got and then we ate all the skittles but uh we're gonna use it today so we got a coffee grinder okay so we're just gonna put our skittles in here one color at a time it's going with purple and then we're just gonna pop her in and then you just press down it's dust like in seconds we could use this to crush up hot cheetos too and stuff whoa oh my gosh this is a lot do not ever stick your fingers in this guys or anything electrical like this at all the fact that this turned it into straight up dust a skittle you guys i feel like skittles are you know that first crunch it's literally kinetic sand do you see that it literally looks like sand like kinetic sand crazy okay so now that our skittles are dust it's time to go on with some marshmallows okay in order to make our skittle slime i actually tested this a few times to get the perfect measurements because there was not really any measurements for this and also it really just depends on how much you're making so what ended up working for me was one coating the bowl with coconut oil and then i added marshmallows and to calculate the measurements for that the bowl is a medium size and i filled up about a fourth of that cut those in the microwave for 10-15 second intervals until it melted completely so once the marshmallows were done and melted i also went ahead and each time i went in with a different color i pulverized them again since it's sugar it starts to solidify and kind of like bind together so i pulverized it again and then mixed it into my marshmallow mix got in there with a fork a spatula very sticky situation with any type of slime making whether it's edible or not you're gonna get your hands dirty and then you go in with some of that cornstarch and then it starts to come together like a slime so i started adding in cornstarch a little bit at a time and started to come together also adding cornstarch to your hands to the countertop to the parchment paper whatever surface you're working on is great and then adding a little bit of coconut oil to your hands helps it to not stick so much knead it up and you're good to go say if you want to put it in the fridge for another day you can actually store it into a deli container or anything airtight is good then you can go ahead and just take that out put it in the microwave for five seconds at a time until you get that soft smooth slimy texture it's also a very thick consistency so this would definitely i can't see this sticking to kids as long as you put some cornstarch on their hands and some coconut oil i feel like this definitely is very very manageable [Music] they actually still feel warm which is great they still feel very puddy like even in the containers these look so good if i was just looking at this i would straight up think that their butter slime i just want to show you when i poke into it so pretty i also think this is my favorite one because it smells like lemon heads you guys you guys oh you guys look how cute oh my gosh well since i made this with my hands i think it's safe to eat so let's try this out wow you actually cannot taste the marshmallow straight up skittles and they're sour too next up we're gonna be making tootsie roll slime and i'm really excited about this one one because we could just throw the whole thing where i gotta go you know we're not making five different colors i feel like that's what took so long with that one so this is actually a very very simple method and if you watched my last video of turning candy into slime this is a similar method to the bubble gum tootsie rolls are so underrated i feel like they're so underrated and i only see them during halloween we love her we're popping this bowl in the microwave this is probably the easiest one here that's all you do guys anything taffy i feel like usually is very very very stretchy so this should be a good one let's pop this in the microwave for about 10 to 15 second intervals until we have it nice and dough-like okay so after about 45 seconds you can see that it's very dough like oh it smells this smells so good you guys i'm sure my entire house right now smells like candy so soft this literally feels like brownie batter in slime form also the gloss the gloss so an option for sticking is some cornstarch or coconut oil also if you don't have cornstarch you can use powdered sugar but it's really it's the same thing oh my gosh that looks perfect it literally looks like brownie butter slime like slime are you kidding that is the easiest candy slime i've ever made 45 seconds and it smells incredible okay this stretch unbeatable okay skittles really could never i mean i love you skittles but tootsie roll like are you kidding okay this is crazy soft i don't really even need the cornstarch anything it smells so good it just melts so easily but it stays warm it's like you could play with this endlessly this is like the perfect taffy consistency for an edible slime this is probably the one i would recommend out of all of these if you want to just make one that's like really easy and you want to impress your kid and just be like look at this we're turning this into slime like nothing so effortless literally the only way i could describe this is if you magically turn brownie batter into slime that's exactly what it feels like so stretchy for quite a bit it looks like it's gonna take a while to cool down also if you're making these of course you know like you're making them so that you eat them so you might not need batches like this you might need smaller batches if you're just making them to eat them with your kids or you know something fun this is really cool guys tootsie rolls really recommend these last but not least we're making gummy bear slime i'm really surprised that i've never made gummy bear slime before because i feel like gummy bears and content is like a thing in my last video i was able to make clear edible slime with sour patch kids so i'm assuming that this should also be able to make clear slime there is some gummy bear slime recipes where you make them with powdered sugar but the only thing about that is i feel like gummy bear slime should be clear so we're gonna pop these in the microwave for 10 to 15 second intervals just as we have been doing mix them in between until we have a nice melted slime and then we'll go from there parchment paper down coconut oil this helps it from not sticking to the surface and also it'll help with being able to actually control it in your hands okay 45 seconds in they're starting to melt oh wow this looks really good oh wow okay melted melted melted it is definitely a little hot right now to manage but i could tell that it's gonna be a good one i'm gonna let it cool down first though because you don't want to burn ourselves i'm gonna let it cool down a little bit it is it honestly doesn't really even feel that hot it actually goes like a massage it feels so good it's kind of giving me lava vibes almost this is definitely slime i don't know if i put too much oil but it's not like binding as much but look how crazy this is i mean the stretch is endless okay this is crazy stretching right here that's a lot of stretch all right guys that's it for this uh candy slime challenge you know what my favorite one hands down was a tootsie roll it took 45 seconds to make literally and also it was the stretchiest one it smelled like freaking brownie batter i know it's tootsie roll smells like chocolate but it just felt like what literal brownie batter would feel like slime form the tootsie roll was also the cleanest it wasn't messy at all i needed barely any cornstarch i learned that the clear gummy bear one was really easy as well but you still gotta sacrifice the stick a little bit it is gonna be a little bit sticky because it's clear but it was also pretty fast i feel like that's more like a gooey experiment the skittles was really cool i loved all the colors i loved how it looked and felt like a butter slime but dang that one literally took a couple hours i like how all these kind of had like their own texture we got like a butter we got a brownie looking one and we got a clear all in all it was a success i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did make sure to click that like button comment down below if you were to want me to make more candy into slime girl then comment down below what candy you would turn into slime thank you guys so much for watching i love you guys and i'll see you guys in the next one bye", "gwyTK2hK9pc": "hello everyone and welcome to making gummies 101 today I'm going to explain an easy and simple way of making homemade gummies if you dig this video please punch that like button and don't forget to subscribe for future and easy 101 cannabis videos today i'm gonna be using cannabis infused vegetable glycerin and we'll be doing this without using additional sugar however I will be using jello and that's basically pure sugar I do use my own homegrown and I will be making a separate video on how to make the glycerin so materials I'm gonna be using today are gonna be a pan a whisk a spatula some gummy molds and a syringe the ingredients I'm gonna be using is one cup of cannabis infused vegetable glycerin 12 ounces of flavored gelatin of your choice so I'm using the cause of the blue raspberry jello yeah the blue raspberry jello one cup of fruit juice of your choice I use real apple juice I really like the taste of it and it makes it can really bring out the other flavors easy it's kind of a neutral flavor I don't recommend using citrus juices pineapple juice or orange juice nope two and a half ounces of unflavored gelatin I recommend knocks it's very sturdy keeps everything together it's it's pretty hardcore as far as gelatin scum a quarter cup of honey or agave syrup I use agave I recommend natural honey it can be a little difficult to mix but you know it's a lot healthier so either way is good and one tablespoon of tart and sour or citric acid powder in this case I use citric acid powder so I've started off by separating all my ingredients by my citric acid powder my Knox and my jello I'm gonna start by combining all of my gelatin together once they're in the same bowl I can give them a proper stirring okay that's looking good next we're going to be moving on to the agave syrup and the apple juice I've already added the agave syrup to the apple juice I'm just mixing them together now once they are mixed I'm going to add them to the bowl of gelatin powder now I want to whisk this gently I have to make sure it's mixed properly so I don't have clumps of sugar stuck together and you know in the end ruining some of my gummies once it's finished put it to one side and let it bloom while this is happening I'm gonna heat up my vegetable glycerin it'll take about an hour and a half and in that time the gel will starting to thicken so right here I have one cup of cannabis infused vegetable glycerin it's been on low for about an hour and a half it does take some time to heat up and start to smoke so just be patient don't let it smoke too much though or it will burn keep it low keep an eye on it and keep stirring it circularly every now and again with my molds lined up I'm ready to pour my jello into my vegetable glycerin since my jello has been sitting there for an hour and a half it's giving it time to solidify a little bit from here I can scrape it out of the bowl directly into the pan it's good to use a spatula for this part just to ensure you're not wasting anything and you get it all over the bowl at this point I'm going to use my whisk just to give it a nice gentle stirring it's okay if you want to turn the heat up a little bit at this point just to help melt the jello as long as you keep stirring it and afterwards you turn it back down again it's too high for too long you will burn you're just doing this to melt the jello once it looks thoroughly mixed in it's a good color and consistency to you grab your syringe as you can see I have assistance but it's okay if you're by yourself and you have to stop stirring to fill up your molds as long as in between filling your syringe you just give it a little stir give it a little stir so right here I'm basically just showing how I fill them up I'll edit this speed up the process but I try not to keep the syringe too high above because then it can create bubbles and your gummies and just visually it's not very pleasing that's all [Music] my personal favorites are the snowmen the very big you know I can use one syringe or I can use four syringes for me it's nice because it's a great way to control the dosage so I'm just gonna finish up these last little few right here make sure I finished with everything in the pan and then I'm just gonna pop them in the fridge give them a chance to cool down and get them all ready now for the final process I'm gonna keep them in the fridge for 8 to 16 hours usually the longer the better so they stay solid now that a few hours begun by I'm ready to take them out these those are my bears thanks to the Knox gelatin this should pop out righties look at that hey mister bear you look pretty solid I can actually identify what you are cool beans once that's done we can bag them and tag them so here's all my gummies in total not you shabby we got our festive snowflakes good our presence went mine done ripen one of those Halloween on Christmas we got our spiders we got our bats oh yeah and up here we have our snowmen well actually two sets of snowmen the badness to Frosty's you can see how thick those are my personal favorite and then there are smaller counterparts right there alright everyone so that's it thank you very much for coming by and checking out this video I hope you liked making gummies 101 don't forget to Like and subscribe for future videos and any comments or anything as well

love squishy chewy delicious these are the Haribo called gold gummy bears I'll put a link to in the description if you want to pick these up but one thing that I'm distressed about in the gummy bear world are the albanese candy sugar-free is sorted through gummy bears particularly the 5 pound bag available on amazon.com check it out I'll put a link to in the description but obviously some of you probably know that many of the reviews have been very critical of the Albanese gummy bears and I would just stop you know I'm deeply pained by it deeply pained and I want to read to you some of these descriptions in all seriousness and we're going to treat it with the reverence that it deserves because they can be disturbing and I'm going to get through it and we're going to we're going to be serious throughout the whole thing because obviously this is a heavy heavy subject so let me just start by reading you you know 390 reviews on these gummy bears and I think though the reviews speak for themselves oh man words cannot express what happened to me doctor genius the gummy bear cleanse you are someone that can tolerate the sugar substitute enjoy if you are like the dozens of people that tried my order run first of all for the taste I would read these a five so good soft true to taste fruit flavors like the sugar variety I was a happy camper but or should I say bought dutt not long after eating about 20 of these all hell broke loose i gastrointestinal experienced oops like nothing I've ever imagined cramps sweating bloating yawn my worst nightmare I've had food poisoning from some bad shellfish and that was all like Schiphol apart compared to what's going on inside then game odd the flatulence heavens to Murgatroid the sounds like trumpets calling the demons back to

want old Niagara Falls through a coffee straw I swear my fingers were screaming it felt like delicate starfish was a gaping maw projectile vomiting a torrential flood of toxic waste 100% was aquitted flammable liquid napalm it was actually a bit humorous for a nanosecond as it was just beyond anything I could imagine possible and it went on for hours I felt violated what it was over which I think might have been sometime in the early morning of the next day there was still Tommy out of me that I ate a my wedding in 2005 high five pounds of these innocent-looking delicious tasty Albers so I told her friends about what definitely enema dig it had to be some type of sensitivity I had to the sugar substitute and in spite of my warnings and graphic descriptions she decided to take her chances and take them off my hands silly woman the horrendous sounds a demon screaming your gut is like an alarm clock without the snooze button do not lollygag when you hear them chant you just run

out", "mAZXWAuWp6E": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make nerd ropes here's what you're going to need two boxes of nerds one cup of gummy bears and some tincture the first step is to fold some foil in an accordion shape and spread it along a baking sheet then you can pour your Nerds into each fold of the tin foil make sure you have enough because if you don't the gummy make sure we'll stick to the tin foil and it'll be harder to take them out after then you'll melt you're going bears in the microwave for about 40 seconds and if you like add 1 tablespoon of ginger and stir it in I'm gonna be pouring my gummy mixture into a squeeze bottle so it'll be easier to dispense be careful not to pour too much just like I did on that first one take it slow and just do a thin line now you can top the ropes with some more nerds once they've all been filled squish the tinfoil together to make them into a tighter more compact shape then put them into the fridge or freezer I still had some remaining mixture left and instead of making more ropes I'm just gonna make some little nerd bytes by using a mold that I had on hand I also added some more nerds on top before I put them into the fridge once they've solidified in the fridge or freezer shake off the excess nerds into a bowl and then peel them off the tinfoil now some of mine came off okay but some of them I had a little more difficulty with so I decided to leave them out for about 24 hours outside of the fridge or the freezer so that they could dry out a little bit more which made them a lot easier to peel off the nerd bites in the silicone mold came out really easily after letting them sit in the freezer for about an hour [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you guys they turned out so beautifully it did take an extra day for them to drive because they were sticking to the tinfoil but after I let them dry they turned out absolutely wonderful just make sure you put enough nerds on the bottom part of the tinfoil so that you're not having issues with the going mixture sticking I can't believe how fantastic they all came out I'm so excited and they're so delicious because I have already tried some and the little bites are so few I love them so much I could have made more ropes but I kind of liked having these little ones if you just grab I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you to the person who requested me to make this video because I'm absolutely in love with these and I'll be definitely making them again thank you guys so much for watching I hope you try these out have a wonderful day", "zYgVCXcyrcI": "hi welcome to dive into light edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and to the regular subscribers thank you so much and welcome back new subscribers thank you again for joining I'm so excited this channel is kind of weirdly taking on a life of its own it's it's really really exciting but a little overwhelming I'm not gonna lie it's kind of cool when there's like you know a couple thousand people seen it but now we're getting into some not large numbers for me um that I never expected and it's like what oh but it's super cool and thank you guys so much I couldn't do this obviously without you so today I know I've got another company recipes up there and I'm always working to refine and make things better so in this recipe this is good for regular gummy bears or regular gummy candies or the sweet and sour there's really only one difference in the change for that recipe whether you want to make regular or the sugar sugar-coated and so I wanted to go for that as well as a little bit a little bit of change in the method but any one of those recipes will work so kind of how I'm gonna how I would list it is the regular gummy bears that I put is more like a condensed jello realistically it's jell-o and gelatin and you harden it up that's condensed jello and then the other candy this the sour one with the the sugar-coated sour ones they're more like a real candy so I know also how the gummy that's more like a real candy versus just condensed gelatin and I will stop babbling on now and also I've got a recipe at the end there if you want to stay tuned on how to make inverted sugar which is a replacement for corn syrup so if Kourt lake corn syrup is difficult for you to get expensive just not available in your local grocery stores you can actually make your own at a fraction of the price and it's super easy to make however it is very very finicky but I go over all of that at the end there about the inverted sugar so I hope you stay tuned for that and and check that out and I think that's all I've got for us right now I'm gonna get in as I usually do get into my ingredients the utensils you're gonna need we'll put everything together and we'll get some candies made we're getting started what you want to do is to get a pot of either ice water or set up a pot of cold water and put it in your fridge or freezer about an hour before you want to start this very important you need the really cold water to start to stop the cooking process for the syrup so just get that set up ahead of time and now we'll get into your ingredients and the tools that you're going to need all right so I'm just gonna go over the ingredients now the ingredients for the gelatin side are exactly the same whether you want to do be regular or whether you want to do the sugar coated it's exactly the same the only difference is whether you're doing the sugar coated or the regular is in the candy syrup and the difference there is if you're doing sugar coated you're gonna use one cup of sugar actually I'll go over that when I get into the sugar part you never mind about that right now we'll start with the gelatin side so you're going to need a one box of jell-o three envelopes of gelatin or three tablespoons you are going to need a quarter cup of corn syrup or you can use what's called inverted syrup which is a substitution for corn syrup I have a video at the end of this to show you how to make your own inverted sugar which I use quite often which I'm actually using today I'm just showing you the bottle for what you've got what you need in the light corn syrup you will need a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/2 teaspoon of gore gum a quarter cup of liquid now I tend to use the kool-aid jammers or the or the kool-aid waters they're great or the Hawaiian punches are great to use as well or you can just use water you're gonna want a half a cup of liquid again you can use your juice or your gelatin I'm sorry your juice or your water for the gelatin and for this you need it needs to be cold so for your gelatin it has to be very cold and for our jello portion we're actually going to boil that and the only other thing is if you want to add some additional color and additional flavor we can do that as well and I think Oh sorry and we also need a quarter tea store sorry a half a teaspoon of citric acid I apologize almost missed that our half teaspoon of citric acid that's everything that we're going to need for our gelatin side and now I'm just gonna when we start the syrup I'm going to go into the ingredients in that for the syrup side and then if previously I talked a little bit about clear gel for the regular gelatin gummies you can actually use this now for either one and again we're gonna do all the work on our gelatin side and add this in so with regards to the clear gel if you want to use it what you need to do beforehand is you take a cup of the clear gel and you mix it with a quarter cup of sugar and you keep that to a side mix it thoroughly so that the sugar and the starch are thoroughly mixed the reason for that the starch will clump if you do it on its own or doesn't have the sugar properly mixed these starts will clump up in your mixture so that is why we add the sugar then you are going to use two tablespoons for your gelatin for your gelatin mix now this is an option now what this does is it takes your candy to that next level that more professional candy like you get in the candy store so it's not as gelatin like it's more it's a little bit softer it's more of that gummy candy versus just like concentrated gelatin and I've been using this ever since I first since I tried it I used it in all my candy now it's I love it it's not that expensive you get a large container of it and it lasts quite a long time so if you do make candies more on a larger scale or on a professional level you might want to give that a try it's excellent it's a little pretty pain to work with but I'll go over all that adding that in so for the candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar okay laureate let me back up here if you are making the sugar-coated gummies you are gonna use one cup of sugar and a half a cup of corn syrup if you want to make regular gummies that are not sugar-coated you're going to switch that you're going to use one cup of corn syrup to a half a cup of sugar but it's to a half a cup of sugar so the recipe is exactly the same this is the only part that'll change regular gummies one cup of syrup to half a cup of sugar sugar-coated gummies one cup of sugar to half a cup of corn sort syrup and the water remains the same half a cup either way you go that's all you need for the candy syrup side temperature cooks to the exact same we're gonna cook it to 260 all right so the equipment that we are going to need is a double boiler you don't have one no problem just what I do use a metal bowl that fits into a pot you want to add water into the bottom to the pot you just don't want it to touch the bottom of the bowl you're gonna need a second pot for your syrup you would let you want to use a heavy bottom pot it works it's better for even the heat distribution for your syrup that way your syrup cooks evenly you don't have any hotter spots you're going to need a candy thermometer a hand blender a whisk a couple of spatulas and a strainer if you've got one handy and I think that's everything that we need for our equipment I usually end up finding something that Wow's that we need but this is generally the majority of the equipment that you're gonna need so next I'll get into the ingredients for putting our gelatin portion together and then we'll then we do the candy syrup and then we combine both of them alright so give me a moment to get everything together here and we'll get started all right so let's get started with our recipe so our very first step what we're gonna do is our quarter cup of liquid we're gonna heat up in the microwave for one minute we want that boiling then with our half a cup of cold liquid we're gonna bloom our gelatin so add that to a bowl and your gelatin you want to evenly spread it over your liquid and again water or the juice I'm actually using kool-aid jam or yes or sorry I'm using the kool-aid waters you know if you do use real juice with real fruit all you need to do is to add a mold inhibitor laureen's makes a makes one and that's what you need to use if you if you use anything with real fruit in it otherwise they will mold very quickly but if you use fruit jammers Hawaiian Punch they don't have anything real in the sugar content they don't go mouldy I literally have gummies that last for months I've never seen mold on them so with regards to your gelatin you want to sprinkle it evenly and then mix it up to make sure that there are no lumps and then you're gonna set it aside for five minutes to allow it to bloom and meanwhile I'm going to microwave this for one minute so you're gonna add your box of jell-o to the double boiler you're gonna set your temperature to low and we're just gonna wait for I'm just waiting for my liquid to boil all right so we're going to add our boiled liquid yeah it got very hot I'm gonna add that in and we're gonna stir that around let our gelatin let our jello get dissolved you might need to add a little bit more liquid to it if you find that it's not fully dissolving but it takes a few minutes anyway and you want to continue to scrape all the gelatin off the sides otherwise it will harden up and we're just gonna stir that and let our water get warm now it's really important with jell-o and gelatin is the heat jello and more gelatin sorry I apologize the our unflavored gelatin melts at just hot a hot water bath if it is too hot it breaks the gelatin and what will happen is your you'll notice it'll start to get very foamy if it starts foaming immediately remove your bowl from the heat and let it cool down you also may need to add about 1/2 a tbsp more of unflavored gelatin because you've kind of broken the the you broken the gelatin a bit so it may not be as sticky or it may not be sorry gel as well so you may I need to add in an additional half a tablespoon to compensate for that so I'm just gonna continue to stir this on the low heat until it is till it's pretty much fully melted until the sugars all fully melted so now that my gelatin is pretty much melted we're gonna add in our quarter cup of corn syrup and get that thoroughly stirred in and we're also gonna add in our half a teaspoon of citric acid we're gonna let that all mix in and melt together again try and keep the sides of your bowl as clean as possible so now that our jello is all melted we're going to add in our gelatin and your gelatin is bloomed when it is nice and spongy if it is squishy at all then either your gelatin is it's not strong enough because gelatinous do have different strengths or it's old and the gelatin is just broken so you want it to be nice and firm and just break it up into pieces and scoop it in and then we're just gonna stir that until that's melted and again remember you just want to warm hot water by at this point you don't want the water underneath boiling at all otherwise your jello your gelatin will break and again if you see it starting to foam up at all take it off immediately now once your gelatin is all melted and everything looks nice like so we're gonna add in our can of butter so you know it in a quarter to a third of a cup of can of butter I'm doing a quarter cup they have dogs and cats behind me [Music] cats trying to trip me up here and then I'd in the Gerber gun this is when you want to use the strainer throw it on there and you want to evenly sprinkle it all over the top and now we're going to get our handy dandy hand blender and so you're going to blend this until it is completely all one color one unit alt one texture and that you're not seeing any kind of oil separation [Music] all right so we've got that all what we called emulsifies so what Gord got gorg um is an emulsifier what an emulsifier does is it allows oil and water to come together essentially it creates a little bubble so when we use the blender it breaks the oil particles up into tiny little part into little pieces and the emulsifier acts as a bubble and holds the water and the oil together in little bubbles that's how it all comes together and your water and oil live happily together otherwise your butter is going to separate and come to the top if you don't use that now a lot of people have asked me if you can use zanza zantac xanthan gum no you cannot it is not an emulsifier it is only a thickening agent so geurim is an emulsifier it is also a thickening agent and a stabilizer that is the other you can use lecithin I prefer Gore gum because lecithin gives it a flavor that I really don't like and I find that the Gore gum works awesome with you don't need the lesser than now at this point if you want you can add in your some additional flavoring I add in about a cup and a half full and if you want to add in some additional color I do it on this side as well I use the no taste red if I'm doing red color so I'm doing raspberries so I use the no taste red reason for that a red die has red food coloring I mean has a tends to have a bitter flavor to it so I like the no taste rent the only downfall about it is you don't get quite as an intense red as the regular ones but I would for rather give up a little bit of the color for than the flavor so I'm gonna mix that in and I'm gonna use the hand blender again just to get it full all mixed together the color comes out much nicer when you use the hand blender [Music] and when you're riding a clear gel you're gonna want to have your whisk ready and coupes and we're going to add in a tablespoon at a time and you want to evenly spread it over the top like so and then use this too and then you're gonna have to whisk it for about a minute or minute or two you're gonna notice it start to thicken up it's just kinda like cornstarch you know when you're making gravy you have to keep mixing it a little while for it to up for it to thicken up and do its thing we're gonna do and you can see how it's starting to thicken up and now we're gonna add in the second tablespoon same thing evenly over the top whisk and you're gonna repeat the same thing we're going to whisk it for about a minute or two until it's all to look pick it up so you can see how it's thickening up here I said you want to continue whisking for about two minutes and it should look nice and smooth and again all one uniform texture and color alright that side is ready is finished now we're gonna do the candy syrup side alright so for our candy syrup side because I am doing sugar or sour coated ones I am going to be using one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and a cup of water now remember if you want to make regular gummies our only difference is you're gonna use a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of regular sugar that is the only difference there you're gonna mix that together until it's up until it comes up together and your sugar begins to dissolve make sure to go all around the edges because the sugar likes to hide on the edges all right so and once your gonna have that all mixed up you're gonna turn your heat on to medium medium-high and you're going to continue to stir this until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you're not going to stir it all right the other one of the things I forgot is you want a pastry brush or a paintbrush clean paint brush so that you can clean off the sides of the pot to use a cup of hot hot water and that'll melt any sugar crystals that you've got and you want to get those off the side because any sugar crystals can cause your syrup to crystallize later on and just continue to stir it until it begins to boil Oh once your syrup begins to boil stop stirring and you're going to add in your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook this until 260 now if you want a firmer candy you can cook it to about 280 so anywhere between 260 280 you can experiment on your firmness if you want a softer candy cook it to 250 but I found 260 seemed to be a really good temperature for it and we're just gonna let that go until we hit the proper temperature now you also want to get your pot of cold water handy and the only thing that you'll do drink the cooking process is if you do see any sugar crystals form just wash them down and now while your candy while the candy syrup is cooking you just want to consider this because stir your jello side because the top part of its gonna start to solidify and the bottom is gonna be liquid because it's closer to the heat so you want to continue sure to mix that up and it all stays nice and smooth and keep it on keep it on low temperature so you have the low hot water bath keeping it melted all right so I've hit 260 take your pot and submerse it in cold ice water turn off your heat and you want to wait until the temperature begins to come down on your thermometer then you're going to place it on the counter until the temperature hits 240 well once your temperature reaches 240 you can remove your candy thermometer and we are now going to add in our gelatin or our jello and our gelatin mixture right so now we're gonna get our jello we're going to get that added in and then you're gonna very carefully stir this until it is fully mixed together your sugar the sugar syrup and the gelatin come together but be very careful because this is very hot you're going to pull it from the bottom and again make sure to get the edges and then it's this is up to you it's an optional step I do I like to use the hand blender on it and the reason I like to use the hand blender is just to make sure that everything is all mixed and blended thoroughly together [Music] [Applause] well see you like that be careful I'm gonna clean up my little mess here and then we're gonna get lit gonna let this sit let some of the air bubbles come out of it we you can work them out by just gently stirring it let it sit and then just look gently stir it again we need this to cool down a bit so you can do that and I'm just gonna clean up a little all right so my mixture is cooled down a bit and I'm going to pour it into my to my bottles my squeeze bottles that was one of the things I forgot in the utensils or tools you need is your squeeze bottles or eyedroppers and I use these squeeze bottles they're by sugar sweet sugar bowel and they've got their nice because they've got the piping tips for them which makes it really nice and easy as well as they have a wide bottle and a wider thread if you use bottles that have too thin of a thread if your syrup is hot or really thick it'll pop the top right off if after you filled your bottles if you still have syrup left just keep it on the lowest temperature just so that we can that you it'll stay so melted there otherwise it will solidify all right so now we're gonna get ready to put this into our moulds all right and then when you're filling up your mold you just want to fill them up just a little over halfway you don't want to go all the way to the top because that way it makes a rough edge on them and it makes your candies not very nice so you just want to try to make them as clean it's also you want to try not to get any jello on the edges there and you're just gonna fill up all of your molds and then once you've got them all filled you're gonna put them into the refrigerator for a minimum of four to six hours I found its best overnight so if after four hours or so II go to try to take about there knock coming out just leave them for overnight usually that usually works if they're still not going to come out of the mold you can put them in the freezer it means that you've got too much syrup the gelatin isn't working too well what you can do is put them into the freezer get them out of the molds remount them at about a tablespoon of gelatin and recast them and then if you find that you take out your candies and they're far too gummy too sticky you can remount them and add a little bit of liquid to it means that it has more too much gelatin you can add up I probably say about two or three tablespoons of liquid to it remelt it and just recast them and this recipe makes about sixty candies if you use smaller molds and if you use those little tiny bear molds you're gonna get about at least a hundred to 150 all right so these candies I had in the fridge overnight and I made lemon yesterday so you can see now I did I have found that they do stay there are better if you leave them overnight then just leaving them for a few hours and they'll come out and you pop them right into your sugar sour mix now your sugar sour mix should be one cup of sugar to a half a teaspoon of citric acid don't use any more make sure to thoroughly mix it in and that'll make a nice sugar sour mix if you just want sugar just use sugar what I usually do is for the sweet ones I will use a cup of sugar to about a quarter teaspoon of citric acid just a little bit because it brings out the fruit flavors so you just mix them into your sugar shake off the excess and lay them on a a rack with parchment paper to dry overnight now these guys also dry a lot quicker and then the other recipe and just pop them out now if you find that they're getting too sticky like this you can put them back into the fridge sometimes they do the when you leave them out they get too warm so as they get a little bit too sticky so what I usually do is take out one mold at a time and do them and that's it you'll continue doing that until they're all are all coated and just lay them out on the rack to dry overnight and those are your sugar or your sugar sour coated candies your sugar soda yeah cannabutter gummy and I just want to go for also a couple of things with regards to molds when you get brand news if you get brand-new silicone molds what I recommend to do is to cut to season them so I use a spray the spray cooking spray I spray it on let them sit for 20 minutes and then rinse them in hot water I don't use soap on them again but I want to rinse off all the excess cooking spray and then that kick that that cures them which is nice I found that red silicone mold do not work well for some reason they're thicker and I can never get anything out of them so I tend to stay away from red silicone molds I found the blues Browns and that work great but red mm-hmm does not work Oh to make inverted sugar replacement for corn syrup you need two cups of white sugar one cup of water and a quarter cup or sorry a quarter teaspoon of citric acid you're gonna need a pastry brush or a clean paintbrush brand new one will be better in a glass of hot hot water we're going to need a pot you want your pot to be super clean there cannot be even a speck of dust or dirt in your pot because it will cause your syrup to crystallize now you want a spatula and your candy thermometer that's pretty much all you need so to get started we're gonna get started in just one moment all right so we are gonna combine we're gonna put in our sugar or 1 cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're gonna stir that till the biggest sugar begins to dissolve and any sugar crystals that are on the side you want to make sure to wash down we'll do that in a minute and if I change you see anything in your sugar at all any dust or any little particles whatsoever make sure that they come out because I said anything at all in your sugar will cause it to crystallize and sometimes things happen you get little little dust or little pieces of stuff I said then wash down any sugar crystals off of the side and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high you want to make sure that your pot is always in the center of the burner so that you're getting proper even heat distribution not where your sugar is cooks prop evenly and so we're gonna continue to stir this until our syrup starts to boil the moment it begins to boil you're gonna stop stirring it stirring once it starts boiling will actually cause your syrup to crystallize and we need to avoid that at all costs so just continue stirring until it begins to boil and wash down and in between keep the washing down the sides of your pot for any sugar crystals whatsoever like literally one crystal will cause your your syrup to crystallize so although it's really easy to make it is very finicky when you're stirring it's also very important to take your spatula and go right around the edge of the pot the sugar likes to settle in on the edges so you want to make sure that nothing's sitting because otherwise if it sits to the bottom it will will stick and cause you problems so the reason why inverted sugar is so finicky and while any crib one single crystal or dust will cause it to crystallize because what we're making is a what's called a supersaturated solution so I don't know if you remember science class see that science stuff does come back to you if you you made saturated solutions and supersaturated solutions where you add a saturated solution is where you have water in salt you have us salt to its maximum saturation point in its water once you go one crystal beyond that it becomes what's called a supersaturated solution and that is what we're making here because we start out first of all with a saturated solution the two cups - 1 cup of water tea cups of sugar - 1 cup of water creates a super create a saturated solution by cooking off the water we are now gonna have more sugar content than your water which then creates your supersaturated solution there you go science for the day you've learned your something new you're done oh sorry one thing I did forget is you're going to need the lid for your pot mine as you can see this one is too big for it if you don't have the right lid no big deal just use them flipped over they work just as good so you definitely need the lid to your pot because once we stop cooking this we're gonna put the lid on it immediately now as soon as it starts to boiling you're gonna stop stirring it you're not going to stir it anymore from this point on you're going to add your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook the syrup to 230 for between 234 and 237 if you want a little bit of a looser syrup then 234 if you want it a little bit thicker than 237 but you're not gonna go beyond that and the only thing now that we're gonna do through the cooking process is wash down the sides of any sugar crystals form that it's the only thing you want to make sure that's equal that's it that we're going to do through the process so keep an eye on the thermometer goes fairly quickly don't walk away don't go be hitting the bong or anything silly like that and as I said as soon as it hits 234 you're gonna wash down any crystals that may be on the sides and then we remove it immediately from the heat place the lid on it and put it on your counter or a stone block and you're not going to touch it again until it's room temperature it is very important that it doesn't get agitated or moved in its cooling process because any agitation again can cause it to crystallize now if your sugar does start to crystallize at any point not a big not a huge deal put it on low heat re melted and it should be fine so as it's boiling while it's boiling into all the sugar melts the crystals can splash up onto the side so said just keep a very close eye and if you've got which imma call it screws here normally there's little bolts here on your pot where the handle make sure to clean around there because the sugar likes to hide in on those and the sugar also will gather behind the thermometer but I only tend to move that one time near the end of the cooking process because as I said you don't want to be agitating your sugar at all so when my syrup gets close to to 29 to 30 is when I will gently move the candy thermometer and wash the crystals off in and behind mat and then gently move it back all right so my temperatures now at 234 I like to actually let mine go to about 237 I like it a little bit thicker so at about 236 I'm gonna pull it because your sugar does still tend to and continue to increase once you pull it off the heat so we're at 235 236 I'm going to remove the candy thermometer turn off my burner remit place it over on my back burner here cuz it's nice and cool wash off any crystals that may be there for the last time be very careful and then you're gonna place your lid on it and you're not going to touch the syrup again until it reaches room temperature as soon as it reaches room temperature you can use it you can either store it on your counter or you can put it in the fridge for up to six months and the one thing is you can transfer it to another container however any time I've ever done that I have it ended up crystallizing I guess the agitation of moving it from one container to another so I just tend to leave it in the pot that I cook it in so I always recommend if you're gonna do that use a pot that it's not your favorite so that if your it's off to the side for a couple of months you're not gonna miss it so I basically designate one pot for my syrup so I'm not gonna miss that pot if I'm if I need it for in the next couple of months and that's it for inverted sugar making your own corn syrup so this said this is I use it quite often in place of my corn syrup it's great if you do not have access to a corn syrup easily or like places in the UK that you really don't have corn syrup you've got I think it's called a golden syrup I'm not sure but now you can easily make your own well I hope you enjoyed that little tutorial there on how to do your own inverted sugar thank you very much for watching you have a great so that's my little tutorial there on a regular gummies and sugar sour coated gummies I hope you enjoyed that as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll get back to you as soon as they can I do apologize I do sometimes have a bit of a delay there I don't mean to but some life takes over sometimes but I do try to get back to everybody as I can and then here's our little of my little lemon and I did lemonade and or sorry kind of turned out like lemonade so there lemon and raspberry and these are there were little little puppies aren't they cute well good luck with your candy making and I'd love to hear how your how yours turned out and if you have any questions about the inverted sugar let me know and I hope you have an awesome rest of your day thank you so much for watching and if you're new here and you like the video I really do hope you subscribe take care have a wonderful awesome day [Music]", "n8-VIBJAf6o": "[Music] aloha mai kakou my name is Ralph and welcome to my kitchen where I like to share on my favorite Island and Hawaiian style recipes and today I've got a treat for you we'll be making the Huy lemon peel gummy bears this has been the biggest snack craze right now in Hawaii it's nothing new but since everybody's been home and craving all their favorite foods this has come up more than ever it's a simple recipe that you can make at home it includes the Huey the Huey is a Chinese dried salted plum you can use the Huey in the seed form or in the powder form this recipe uses the powder form this also uses lemon peel which is another Chinese dried snack and gummy bears of course now you can use any gummy snacks that taste great gushers strawberry belt peach rings anything really you can use the sauce on fruits as well it's really yummy the kids love it toss it in the freezer if you'd like make it a cool treat before I get started I'd love it if you'd subscribe to my channel by hitting that red subscribe button down below and don't forget to the notification bell so you can be updated everytime I post a new video and I post new videos every week also don't forget all the recipe instructions and ingredients are always listed in the description box below so how they might come along and let's make so many lemon peel gummy babies all right first we're going to get the lemon juice I like to use fresh lemon but if you want to use the artificial ones from the store you can roll the lemon with the palm of your hand and cut in half this will help get the lemon juice out easier then you're gonna squeeze the lemon to get the juice now I have a kabillion of different kitchen gadgets but for some reason I don't have like a regular juicer I have the full-blown juicer that you throw the whole thing in but I figure I just squeeze it here because most people don't have one anyway so if you squeeze the lemon and place your hand underneath you can catch the extra seeds that fall out if some slip away from you just make sure you get them out of a bowl when you're done [Music] next you'll take your lemon pill strips and place them into a food processor if you don't have a food processor you can use a blender we'll go ahead and grind it until you get fine pieces continue to grind it down until you get the strip's down about this size next we're gonna make the sauce take a bowl and add the lemon juice that we squeezed earlier some granulated sugar and some of the human father Meehan whey powder can be found at most grocery stores in Hawaii you can buy it online on Amazon at crack seed stores around it's pretty easy to find all these go ahead and mix that up until well combined and you're gonna go ahead and add your gummy bears toss the gummy bears in the sauce until well coated [Music] then you're gonna add the ground-up lemon-peel lastly stir it up and enjoy [Music] and that's how you make lemon lemon peel gummy bears really easy right if you try this recipe or any of my other recipes please let me know leave a comment in the comment box below what's your favorite thing to put the Himalaya powder on and until next time Hui hold thank you for watching my mom's video", "WgipuEpUeXQ": "[Music] [Music] [Music] you got caught didn't you Brits you need to take Sam back to the

modernist pantry Test Kitchen I'm home cook hot mess mark Fischetti and I'm Scott Guerin the research and development chef here at modernist pantry and today we're talking about one of my favorite I'm gonna I'm not gonna lie my favorite ingredient in the in the modernist pantry catalog the druids grove vegan gelatin this is actually this was my introduction to the to the company and and to your cooking skills so this WTF is a particularly special one thank you for being here for it so here's what's really cool about this this is vegan gelatin but tell us a little bit about normal gelatin what that's used for and then where the vegan gelatin comes in so we'll kind of go over how normal gelatin is used normal gelatin would need to be bloomed in water if you're using sheet gelatin you would bring it out and then add it to something and heat it up or if it's a gelatin powder you would sprinkle it over the water bloom it again I'm sorry bloom it so that it hydrates and then add it to your that water to your mixture heat it up and then eventually after you heat it and cool it it will make a gel so that's the basis of what gelatin does now this works in a similar way as it does make it gel but you need to use it in a slightly different way you don't just you know bloom it if I were to sprinkle this over water it would start to clump up because it loves water so much so I'm actually going to do a demo right now because I need people to see just the difference between it because if it is a one-to-one replacement for regular gelatin but it's not a one-to-one replacement on the method of those recipes so if you just take a recipe that has gelatin you you wouldn't be able to use this in the exact same way you would get a very similar result but you wouldn't be able to use it in the exact same way so what I'm gonna do and the biggest thing you should do with this is if you have a lot of dry ingredients so here I have sorbitol super-tall is a sugar alcohol it's going to help sweeten our gummies without your raising the calories through the roof so oh okay so I have the vegan gelatin here I'm just gonna pour it in and then I also have right here is a citric acid so it's going to help with acidity and an in flavor I will talk about that a second about why the acidity yes and then this is sodium citrate and sodium citrate acts as a buffer because vegan gelatin it's not the biggest fan of acid and I know I added asset to this for flavor right but I need to add this to my water to help buffer that to allow the vegan gelatin to actually work so and I think it's kind of important to point out that you are dry mixing all your dry ingredients first whereas normal gelatin you might just lose so the reason why I do that is that I'm dispersing that vegan gelatin into a large amount of sugar or sorbitol or whatever you're mixing it in it can be a small amount too it just helps break it up and evenly mix it with the water now this looks like a lot but if I take this here and this is just some liquid that I have that sodium citrate in there and you'll see it just mixes in very easily and it won't clump the last thing I have to do is have a little bit of flavor we're just making vegan gum so if I were to make this and then pour it into a large mold as you can show them right there we're gonna have a giant gummy bear and you can see one that I already have made through the magic of television or internet television the magic of Internet is so so very simply and you can see it's a nice fluid here yeah and I'm just gonna pour it right into a pot and I'm gonna bring it up to a simmer the reason why we bring it up to a simmer is that it needs to activate so when I heat it up it's going to hydrate which it pretty much just means dissolve yeah it's going to dissolve all those little bits of vegan gelatin and then when I cool it it's going to turn into a gel now temperature-wise am I looking for would be looking for a different temperature than we would be looking at it's a a traditional gelatin recipe like is that a modification to watch yes oh absolutely when you're using vegan gelatin it it gels just like gelatin sure but the properties are slightly different so it's going to up here a little bit it's going to gel a lot quicker than regular gelatin if you ever made it like a gel of desert you take it you pour it into the glass molds and he put it in the refrigerator or the kids would stare at him for three to four hours before they're even ready they start to or or until the end of the episode in this yeah so you can snack all you want okay with this once it hits 140 degrees it could still be pretty warm to the touch it will still be warm to the touch but it would be gelled yeah so if this happens a lot faster so you can have dessert ready you can make this almost album new you can make it and have it ready at when it hits the table so it's pretty good as long as you're doing it in small amounts like I'm making gums or what yeah like this you know mold this big that that'd take a while but yeah not really this took what like 20 minutes in the ice bath if that yeah as long as it was set up and I could pop it out yeah see it right here I made one this morning and that's when you go with like the aggressive giant gummy bears and you're doing the little drop since we yeah that's all how long it takes that that the cold temperatures to get through to the centers that are very easy so we can just see it heating up right now no this works with a lot of different recipes it doesn't just have to be a gum or like a jello style dessert this can replace and I know you get the recipe when you actually order this product gelatin that's usually found in marshmallows yes that's how I met this product and you were like look we get marshmallows I was like wow life change they're not dense the only additive that you add is a versa whip which helps with the kind of the fluffiness of the marshmallows but you get a beautiful vegan marshmallow that tastes just like a normal marshmallow I wouldn't yeah if you have a friend like the freeze dryer like we have it was the world's largest Lucky Charms Marty absolutely about five pounds so one of the things you'll notice well that's kind of getting yeah well it's doing its thing is we've got our mold in an ice bath that's not necessarily a recipe thing that's a you know these these aren't a modernist pantry mold this was just something we picked up you know it's the plastic molds not the silicone molds that was a learning experience yeah because it's the first one we it looked like a pug yes so this does heat up quite warm and if you see it on the overhead you can see it I'm coming up to well over boiling temperature there's so much sugar alcohol in here that it's going to need to come up a little bit higher so I pour it into the mold and the first time I ended up with the almost nothing so I just put it in a little bit of ice bath and that's gonna have really helped it set almost immediately yeah now if you happen to have a silicone mold these ones do come from mana dispensaries yeah I did actually yeah I couldn't be one-to-one it's what you used for the small gummies right yes definitely want to treat yourself to the silicone mold over a cheap plastic mold you'll just have a much better time with it you won't have to worry about the mold melting on you plus super super super reusable for all of your things and one thing that's different about these is you don't have to dust with cornstarch or anything like that you can it helps get them out but I was able to just pour it right in there very easily and then pop them out within maybe 10 minutes because they set up so quickly yeah so it's good because we wanted to show people how to use this product if we had I think a few comments last week about a again do a demo and yeah we won't be able to do one every single week because some things are a lot more difficult a lot more time-consuming but this is so simple we want to show you how simple it is that you can make it gummy now it won't set up unless we want to sit here for about you know 10 20 minutes Francois yeah so but we'll show you that once I get it in there and then yeah give it about 10 20 min so you could have a giant gummy bear to show off for your friends for those of you playing at home yes this means that we will have access to two giant gummy bears so if you're in the area I don't know so if traditional gelatin is made from from animal based products this is actually made from red seaweed so it's whatever gives the seaweed its its structure you extract that and you start at phones ringing yes a little bit yeah so whatever gives the red seaweed its structure its extracted and it gives the gelatinous structure and as we can see right here I'm getting a nice boil on our vegan gelatin gums so I'm just gonna stop but I'm gonna let it cool down just a little bit before I pop it into the mold I don't want to pour it in directly because it's so hot at this point I don't want to melt any bit any bit of this mo because I do want to reuse it will have another puggy bear yes um so yeah you would say it comes from it comes from in this case it's a red seaweed if there are other seaweeds and if you just like where to Google vegan gelatin agar agar is kind of a commonly used one this one's not well one it's easier to use than they are certainly yeah it's about the same it's just all dealing with the texture yeah because we want the texture that's going to simulate traditional gelatin as closely as possible if you want to just just show them that the jello desert the wiggle of this so it's it's crystal clear yeah and it jiggles and but it has a nice creaminess that is very similar to gelatin yeah and that's one of the things I really like about this is that it's not just for items that have gelatin in them yeah I like to kind of replace a little bit of like eggs that are in custards for vegan custards and things like that because you get that texture if you mix it with it with soy milk you really get like a beautiful almost you know creme brulee kind of flan which you've had and yes like that you can make some really amazing things so it's not just a one-trick pony it doesn't just simulate joked and it simulates a lot of different things in it I think the testing will really show over time is like well how versatile this is yeah and just the big big big things to look out for is make sure you try mix it first no matter the recipe I know we're gonna keep hitting on that a lot it's because otherwise as soon as it hits water it does like clump as long as you try mix it even with the sugar that's in your recipe or whatever it'll so I just want to show everyone that it sits nice and fluid it's not clumpy if if it does clump up for some reason it may be that you did the the recipe wrong or the recipe ratio is wrong that you got we do have a few recipes that we are you know putting out there for you guys if you go to vegan gelatin if you search for vegan gelatin on modernist pantry com you see this exact recipe right below it so it has all the links to the ingredients and a very base recipe that you can make any flavor that you want yeah super simple I'm use myself as home kitchen hot mess I do mean it I even I pulled off this Gumby recipe no problem yeah so I'm just gonna actually pour it right in I'm just gonna fill the base no I made a half gummy for you to take home that's fine yes two full gummies is a finish it great I don't want to look like the vegan gelatin um all right so you know to kind of play around with it and get going with it vegan gelatin just to do the quick break it's $15.99 for this four ounce to put that in perspective for the home cook that's sixteen packets of traditional gelatin is worth so you do get quite a bit of playtime out of this whether you're going for confections it's also kind of good we were talking we were chatting about shallots and uses about including it in your stocks right this is something you do even with traditional stocks to add a little bit more of that mouthfeel yeah so so if you get like a canned veggies stocker or whatnot from the grocery store and you add a little bit of this and obviously I would dry mix it with maybe a little bit of salt or something or if you want to you could put it in a blender and then slowly sprinkle this in if you're not adding any other 3d in so that's another easy way to add it so I'm do that and then heat it up it will add a little bit of viscosity to it when it doesn't hot this is usually done in very small amounts so you don't want it to turn into a thick jello because jello no veggies dog is never gonna be thick jello it yeah it sounds awful yeah exactly but for that nice little bonus and mouthfeel that you typically lose this / - I make my own stock it's it's watery but because it's all veggie stuff it's quite it's alright so this is gonna set up before a little bit while we stare at it longing Leigh we always in these WTF stalk about not only where we transform food but what's the food we talk about what's the food babe better what's food possible you may have noticed this in our last episodes this one's probably gonna be a little bit different because with vegan gelatin it's all about what's the food made possible and in this case it's everything would traditionally rely on that gelatin that animal-based gelatin was just a reliable one just one replacement so here's a little thing is it each one of those packets from like if you bought a powdered gelatin it comes in packets now each one of those packets is seven grams so this is exactly seven grams I believe it's a teaspoon that's in one of those packets as well so if you see a recipe that says add one packet of whatever gelatin powder gelatin if you take seven grams of this or a teaspoon and you add it in and in just the way I showed you I went in bloom if the recipe says the bloom disregard because you're using something slightly different so if you add this in you're going to get the same thickness as you would in the traditional recipe because it is a one-to-one replacement yeah and now that you've kind of seen it done you'll know what to look for when you cook it but I got to tell you because I don't have the poly science wonderfulness an instant-read thermometer goes a long way especially just for your first time working with it and so you get used to the feel and how it looks when you're whisking it through the pan so an insta read thermometer the Druids grow vegan gelatin is if you can see it on this side here it is organic non-gmo gluten-free and vegan so that checks all the boxes for making amazing amazing things and this is a really really fun ingredient all right anything else we want to say all right no I to be honest I think it's one of my favorite ingredients as well just because it's so versatile and I've been able to make a lot of really great vegan alternatives to many items so awesome alright so modernist pantry com just search V ghen gelatin in the search bar at modernist

are too limited in flavor I attended a birthday party hosted by a super hands-on mom and I was amazed by the different flavors she had I asked her how she made her homemade gummies successfully because I failed mine a couple times before she was gracious and kind enough to tell me I can drop by sometime so she can show me I was so excited I was thinking of gummy bears the whole time what can go wrong with homemade gummy bears here are the things I learned I did wrong and I figured these could becoming mistakes so read on one not blooming the gelatin - mixing the bloom gelatin with hot

different video we're gonna be testing out these little gummy bear molds that I got from my sister-in-law she actually sent them over for the kids for Christmas and yeah so we're gonna try them out we did actually film this video yesterday and I filmed it with my kids but the recipe didn't come out very well I think I might have made a mistake on making it so I'm gonna add a little bit more gelatin today and we're to see how these would come out so these molds you can buy on Amazon for about $8.99 I have mine here in my dish rack just dry now cuz we did use them like I said they were just kind of like jello just a tip on these gummy bears they're not like your regular gummy bears tell you buy at the store but they are a lot healthier I'm gonna be using four ingredients you can use even less if you want to just put juice with them but and you do have to keep them in the fridge and I read that they can last up to two weeks in the fridge and a container so they're not like the gummy bears that you get in a package but if your kids like little treats like that then it's perfect so what I'm gonna be using today is just this pineapple juice I got from Walmart you're gonna want so any kind of juice that's not from concentrate and then I did go ahead and go on Amazon and bought the vital proteins beef collagen it's like grass-fed beef gelatin but this is the one that they saw at Walmart so I bought this one you need three tablespoons of gelatin a cup of your juice but I'm gonna throw in some strawberries so I'm gonna have to blend them up I'm gonna put them in there then measure up a cup with the juice here then we're gonna blend it and then we're gonna put it in the saucepan we're gonna add this gelatin let it it says that it has like bloom so you're gonna see little cracks on top and when that happens then we're gonna bring it up to a simmer you're not going to want to boil the ingredients then we're gonna add our honey after we take it off the heat because you don't want to mess up any kind of benefits from the honey so we're gonna do that and then we're gonna pour it in the molds put it in the fridge for two hours and we'll show you how they come out we'll let you

they pulled up next to me and said roll your window down roll your window down and they were having an argument and they pointed the billboard and said do you say that gyro or hero and i said i say hero and the the wife was like see i told you and then they drove off and he was probably pissed off that [ __ ] white dude he [ __ ] me over my name is brandon walker and i am the host of pick central um the gambling show every day on sirius 85 bar stools series radio station that was appointed to that position by dave portnoy who came up with the show and decided i was the one who should host the gambling show on barstool power 85 serious it was his choice could have chose anybody but he didn't chose me yes brain did you see uh a blog that just drops i think a lot of blocks are up on the site it was uh it sounded like it was kind of calling out another gambling show yeah yeah uh so apparently blackjack and laduca have launched hitting the board a gambling show congratulations to those guys so do you think with the time that they're spending on the blog they have time to be on the radio show well that's a question for them i i don't know but to be on the radio show it does require attendance in the office uh on monday hitting the board or bending the board or something like that uh there's a couple of butt hurt people that are allowed to come to the office and aren't coming to the office i can be on a certain radio show called pick central they didn't decide to come in and be on it and uh yeah i don't know what to tell you they came out with a show at 11 45 with uh real gambling stats because everyone comes to barcelo sports for the statistics and speak my point of view but it's not safe hello it is pick central brussels fake gambling show we got rico bosco we got big cat marty mush is here hi everybody how's everybody's weekend i'm bored are you yeah this show's boring yeah trying to hit the board somewhere else i i you know what i don't know if i like words to the people at home i don't know if i like being on the show with the two biggest personalities at barcelona i don't think so rico and brandon mr 90's gotta go to 100 you got to go 100 hours a week i don't know if you'll be able to do it you might die i said one time during an argument with dave that i worked 90 hours a week i didn't mean it i just sort of said you was playing defense anyone who's been around this office knows that mr mr90 likes to talk about how hard he works i'm not worthy of responding correct you were not worthy of so i worked 90 hours a week here dude every [ __ ] show i'm not worthy of a [ __ ] response eight through three eight five stool is the number two call and give us some picks anybody else out there that wants to call and get a picture will be on the show they can if they work at barstool that's fine um it's the thing that you gotta do a little petty show that's what you do when you're five years old your arm is throwing me off the stairs this morning new socks uh we responded that hey we have an entertaining show uh the office is open you're allowed to come bar still doesn't work where it's like hey i have to wait to be asked to do something and you go and do it i'm here at the office i go on the show that's how it is i mean what they did was petty paula duca keeps saying hey keep me out of it but you did a petty thing what what what are we doing we work at barcelona we talk about things but you know what it doesn't bother me i went 7-1 are they going to put it out every day right before pick central is that what the deal is they're trying to that would be hilarious i don't think they're capable of being hilarious i commend whoa i i don't that's why you don't have live shows why don't you have one of them call in let them call in maduka blackjack yeah call them talk about your show someone called don't call it oh they're like blackjack's it's interesting so blackjack called and he told us that uh had nothing to do with pick central and he wasn't mad that i chose rico to be on the show a couple of weeks ago even though this is clearly an answer to me choosing rico sorry guys i know there's beef there between blackjack leduca and rico but rico is here i've seen him and he's very entertaining steve dave asked me to do an entertaining gaming show rico bosco's entertaining love him or hate him that guy knows how to entertain so i grabbed him had nothing to do with them they start their own show whatever it's an interesting move let out the real words yeah just say it okay just [ __ ] saying these guys are these guys have got their feelings hurt because i let rico on the [ __ ] show well guess what rico's entertaining so he's here he's also willing to [ __ ] be in the building and you guys aren't so what do you want me to do you gotta start a new show rather than come in here and do your [ __ ] job you're gonna start a new show this is [ __ ] what are we doing all right welcome to the first episode of hitting the board new gambling show here at barstool sports where uh in a novel concept we are actually going to spend our time talking about gambling on a gambling show i know that may be strange to a lot of people but that's what we're going to try to do here pick central is better than uh jerking the board because it's literally no one comes to like if you really think you're they're good gamblers they're just not i mean the best part about us is we are bad gamblers but when we win it's awesome because i went 7-1 almost i was looking for mariachi band i booked them for an hour but i lost one game it's just i mean that's what we do we first out we talk about sports we have serious sports talk but then we get into some crazy topics and then we gamble i mean that's what we do do you feel a little bit more pressure me yeah no i'm the winningest gambler on the show but do you feel a little more pressured knowing i forgot about morgan do you feel a little bit pressured knowing that if riggs and leduca and blackjack have winners i'll tell you what if the 25 people that listen to their show also listen to pixel i hope those 25 people are able to see i'm not worried because i'm a shitty gambler no matter what correct that's right right we're not going to get here my reputation isn't on the line of being a good gambler but yours no it isn't there's not a person in this there's not a person in the studio who's here because of his prowess as a gambler do you think anybody in this company was hired because they're a good gambler you think i was i went over eight my first night i know i bet all of them i still think i'm a good gambler but well you shouldn't you shouldn't think that i'm shitty ass i know hold on we got to step in here i'm a piece of [ __ ] every bet i put in yeah this episode of stool scenes is brought to you by owens craft mixers i'm not a mixologist i'm not a bartender i'm not tom cruise and cocktail when i want a little craft cocktail for myself i just pick up a bottle of owens and then i mix it with a little bit of liquor and it's that simple for example this mint cucumber and lime will make you a delicious mojito a little bit of rum a little bit of owens craft mixers and there you have a night you don't need to be tom cruise and cocktail to enjoy the lifestyle of tom cruise and cocktail get some for yourself today at owensmixers.com it's fresh [Music] can you draw money well maybe i already have that off what company do we work at that doesn't work no what is this for or is this an anti-scale drawing yeah of course what are we doing just setting some things up look at this look at the attention to detail [Music] jeff have you uh drawn a line in the sand yet for what the boys jeff's a guy that's one of my guys oh full with rico yeah that's not even a question he's drawing wine right now rico you mean the guy who picked [ __ ] morocco to win the pga championship damn right i think you look slim then just do it so what are you diagramming what what are you diagramming here we're just doing a scoreboard gambling is scoreboard dana asked me to comment on some things scoreboard is what matters we'll set up a little scoreboard here so you're going to illustrate it visually yeah i got some stats without the emoji yeah we go with the emojis make it simple looks like a mushroom what about the origin of skel orange scale that's like a very much new york city thing i definitely didn't come up with it but it's like uh i mean you kind of know what it is i do but i've never heard of it before i met you yeah well i made it popular i should have trademarked the [ __ ] thing well like i don't know you're a skill like you're [ __ ] you know never the guy who has the money you don't split the cabs like just comment decency type [ __ ] and then from twitter twitter skills i have a hot clip of dave doing actually twitter skills let me see if it's a hot clip like uh it's in my favorites i put it on the like hot clips like hole [Music] that's your copyright yeah it wasn't a [ __ ] [ __ ] he didn't know who he was i don't look like a [ __ ] [ __ ] you look scary i try to first of all what do we have on the board it's going to be on squabble i'm a visual learner my friend martin mush co-host he's a visual learner so we'll just do some uh some visual learning today right now it's a nationally broadcasted show and uh kind of like an off-brand uh shoprite version some would say our show is uh plus 36.13 units bonnie for the people at home a unit is what what you bet right okay so that's a lot yeah what i'm hearing is the record is 20 25 and 1. tough edge boss goes to the different markers they're on there's no use the blue one who's the blue one walker is fresh that one's stressed hold on oh oh boy no it'll work it'll work all right we are as a team because i'm a team guy 36.13 units okay not bad now i would know but what i'm hearing is they're 20 25 and one so you do the math there let's say roughly five edge team guy edge pixel all right and what about uh overall chemistry and entertainment value let's get away from numbers for a second one for every host and actually probably two minuses so that's a big you know kind of running away with it viewers you like the numbers viewers followers i should say 48k 353 followers again page pixel combined i think we have i don't know when you get into the millions i don't understand how it works so it's like i got 190 dan's got 1 million uh rico's got about 50 and brandon's got 130. what's that 1.2 pretty good for uh you know pretty good so scratching and clone the 50. so listen like we say you just you want to evaluate us equally then it's the scoreboard settles itself so if there's any other kind of question mark i guess you could just look at oh is that the hammer set triple hand off that's a dribble he takes it here he flashes up screen here as he clears the lane this guy goes we're going to kick it out to here martin for the three that's a [ __ ] hammer set hey [Music] [Music] how do you like have designated practice time without learning the opponent yeah why don't you just go yeah why wouldn't you i'll go i don't need to practice actually i played smitty and let go somebody asked me to play warrant this when he's playing uh the first so i said okay played smooth now he's freaking out because he doesn't play anyone it's like he can't just walk in there and do it himself there's no rule against it i've played smitty for 10 minutes um we started to keep track and i was up 29-9 on him had the head but i think like every single one of those games is like right down to the wire but somehow i have the edge over him i have like mental edge um you'll see it's gonna be really close really tight i mean a lot of yelling at each other but i'm excited i think it's the best game of the day by far have you played jake yet i heard jacob i've beaten jake oh really but he i mean well he no no he's beating me way more times than i be him but i have beaten him and it was like one of my greatest accomplishments in like sports because he's ridiculous he plays like he's in tennis he's playing a tennis game but he can't play right now right there's that that's why like hank chosen the plays he wants the ew where he wants the the chance to beat beat him against he's playing against a scooter no he sprained his ankle yeah but he's been on a scooter like that's he can't walk playing cake [ __ ] marsh cakey cake uh it was lined up before he sprained his ankle uh someone was saying that it was intensive in me i was there when he spread his ankle and i was called insensitive for asking him this was like a week and a half ago he sprained his ankles on the ground rivering in pain and i was like do you think it would be good for next wednesday uh like girlfriend has to walk after i did ask him if he was okay first i was like are you okay and he was like yeah and then i was like are you gonna be good for next monday so some say that's incentive i'm just you know trying to make sure i have an edge i'm not gonna be like billy football right now but we've all had ankle injuries that's the first step yeah let's go i'm not i don't feel terrible like he'll be fine people have played through a lot worse thanks to bully we're out playing tennis my darling jake twist his ankle nearly snaps it in two hank runs over to him first thing then he says it's not jake are you okay jake can i help you up jake did you break anything first thing hank says is oh no you have to play ping-pong against me in a week and a half wow that's a real shame immediately first reaction it really depends what percent he's at i think he's at like 80 like an ankle injury is the ankle's a lot farther from the heart from the heart the ankle is a hell of a long way from the heart okay i'm excited i'm like i said if hank beats me i'm no excuses i'm ready to play ready to win i i played some scrimmages with pft yesterday it made more of an impact than i thought but i don't think it hinders me from winning i think i can still do what i do um it'll play a factor but i'm going to have a good chance to win what's your confidence level uh what's less than zero absolute zero somewhere in between that and zero look i'm an above average pink one player in the office i would say my level is above jeffy low a little bit but below the humps and i have not touched a paddle outside of today and shooting promo stuff since quarantine pft one of the best players in the office before quarantine and has played all during quarantine so hence the uh in between absolute zero and zero yeah but we'll see you'll probably get waxed you know not prepared i'm in a win-win situation here i'm not supposed to do well i'll be victorious me trying to do anything over the top will only not only hurt myself but it will be unnecessary best revenge is victory alongside jeff dilo i'm jake marsh thanks for taking some time on your monday afternoon for a new week of stool streams very hard ah [ __ ] oh on the app store oh ah all right i oh oh delicate flour back to you guys oh all right yep hey leave beforehand the old henry come on [ __ ] me henry now you stole the chance playing [Music] oh [Music] yeah i mean it [ __ ] me up like i poured milk on my face and now i have like [ __ ] milk cake and up my [ __ ] hair

back in a very long time and i don't know if people will do next week's episode like we're going to think of something very easy like i'm honestly thinking about doing a sunday bar and giving them like a stuffed animal just for a week just to make it easy on them because they won't come back to the bar if we keep doing the gummy bear that's how bad it was [ __ ] like my stomach is just in a [ __ ] knot right now so just ate that [ __ ] thing vibs after i ate it he was like just you know if you have heart problems you shouldn't have eaten that if you get heartburn you shouldn't have eaten that and also it's really gonna [ __ ] up your stomach for the rest of the day and i was like would have been good information 45 seconds ago [ __ ] off [ __ ] off it's instantly hot yeah like any

go back into vip's torture chamber it's [ __ ] crazy someone asked me if i look for like certain people like because they're going to give me a good reaction frankie is someone i always go to just because frankie wears his emotions on his sleeve and will tell you exactly how he's feeling and frankie supposed to be an italian could not handle hot it if you're italian and you're watching that

[Laughter] how many how much would you charge um i do something crazy like 753 okay that's a good number how many subscribers would he get at 7.53 per month and i'm just going to say i'm going to say ten thousand less more more or less than ten thousand yeah bro it's 60 40 under 10k but that means 40 of my followers think it would be over 10 000 subscribers at 7.53 cents we're talking about seventy five thousand three hundred dollars a month for fights to [ __ ] stuff yo i'm gonna tell you what if we got anywhere near that this podcast would be [ __ ] obese see ya i got my [ __ ] i don't

seeing as americans can't travel to most countries in the world figured i would visit our chicago office which i've never been to i think it's going to be nice to reconnect with employees that i normally don't get to see because they live in the middle of the country and hopefully i'll get some content out of it too i have no idea what to expect i've heard that the chicago office is is very humble compared to what we have in new york uh they're kind of a bare bones operation salt of the earth and i'm a salt of the earth guy so i feel like i should mesh pretty well farmer's insurance

app marvel racing you know people always talk about it they always you know tweet us like do marble racing do marble racing uh so we decided to try it obviously you just have to build it yourself so and the interns around here do nothing except for sit in the gaming cave all day and talk [ __ ] so i was like billy i i was like billy you and the interns i didn't say you're going to be in charge of the interns i was like you and the interns because billy is an intern so i thought it was going to be like a group project uh so you and the interns go in the school stream studio build the marble racing uh and like test it out make sure that it's like evenly done or whatever and then i told spider who is not an intern and is somewhat of like a you know overseer i was like just make sure you know everything's going well uh i came in to the studio and billy and spider were just screaming at the interns they they were talking in the mics like it was a live broadcast interns were like reacting like there's a live broadcast and then i don't know her name what's her name dev dev was like oh my god i'm so sorry like i i didn't mean to do i was like i don't know what you're talking

knows what's gonna happen with that kid i'm side to side i'm just terrible and this will be the start and then we'll connect two towers from here and you can incorporate and why don't we get something so it all connects back here you need to connect these to this right um this is so high let's just assemble one this is gonna take way longer let's just assemble something solid and then from there we can add clusters this is gonna like you see how it's like we're totally yeah we're chilling yeah and we heard some of the intros for uh our contestants today why don't we continue there's still two to be introduced [Applause] ready oh oh [Laughter] [Music] i mean this is a this is a obviously a trial like this probably won't be uh i mean no they're recording this but they're testing out the angles

up for me so live life loud cheers and cheeks gummies gummies will be out very shortly [Music] don't forget comment like and subscribe you", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man that's all i got to say about it this joint is pissing me off much love y'all seven likes do it do it all right go to twitch.tv link will be in the description uh go to my twitter man i'm trying to get my twitter up as well like i want y'all to be able to follow me and know what i'm doing you know know when i'm going to make a video knowing i'm going live you know i always want feedback as well you know i want to talk to you guys too that's always awesome so much love you guys let me know what you guys thought about the video i will see you in the next video be safe peace out [Music] you", "szIfo0BJMs0": "[Music] there's a color-changing pineapple behind me see know what that means it means it's time for weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's episode I'm gonna help you make sense of one thing I have never understood at any of the dispensaries I've been to because I have seen this product at practically every dispensary that I have been to and I have never ever picked it up because it always seems like such a bad deal to me and that is cheeba choose as I said I have seen these at practically every dispensary of it around but I have never actually picked them up because they just seem like a tremendously bad value so this is their extra strength hybrid and chew at a hundred milligrams of THC see if we can actually get that oriented properly for you probably not oh there it goes um so yeah you can see hundred milligrams of THC 520 milligram doses but let's look at the back and you can see that price tag they sell this for 15 bucks I got a discount for 13 to 13 dollars for this tiny tiny tiny little thing now I do like small edibles I do actually have always have an affinity for potent things in small packages that's what she said but this just does not seem like it could do the job hundred milligrams isn't that much especially for 15 bucks and it just doesn't seem like it could pack that much of a punch in something this small I mean I've had like the punch bars before which are quite small or I've had the bang the bite and each of those actually had nearly twice as much THC in them as there's this thing did and they were considerably bigger even still so I do not know what to expect I'm hoping because they are everywhere they're sort of ubiquitous that means that there's some reason they're so popular and they're as potent as they are but we're about to find out together all I know is if this ends up being a disappointment I'm gonna have some harsh words for Chiba Choo so I'm gonna shut up now open this up pop it in my mouth poll tell you how it tastes and then I will be back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling although for you it'll be just a couple of seconds okay so I'm unraveling it here comes in it is definitely a caramel I don't know how you would split this in five doses otherwise it's pretty pretty mushy it smells good it smells like a caramel I'm just gonna plunk this whole thing right my mouth I'm gonna do it in two bites just do it in one here we go well maybe actually cut some music in my new tune there we go down the hatch so it taste is good you've got to give him credit for that wow that was a really good taste in caramel perfect sort of consistency very little cannabis taste I was happy with that but what I'm unsure about is how this bad boy is actually going to hit me for that guy's you're gonna have to wait a couple seconds me on the other hand I'm have to wait a couple hours to see what its gonna do to me I will let you know I'll see you guys in just a bit peace it's been two hours guys since I had the Chiba juice and it's just as I feared Chiba I'm afraid I do not choose you it's it's about as bad as I had hoped um yeah I can't say I feel nothing I would say I'm at maybe a three two and a half somewhere in there um so you know not high at all you know I feel something maybe there's sort of the effects after you had smoked a joint an hour later or something just like the echo of a high so it's you know it tasted good I like the taste of the chima choose it's just too expensive for what it is and does not provide enough of a high I have tried other 100 milligram edibles that I've hit harder than this and that 15 bucks for this thing it's just it's it's too much I cannot recommend the Chiba choose at this point I don't think I would be reviewing any more Chiba choose just because you know one and done with this one maybe unless you guys really have some wrong feelings about other ones or if there's something you really want me to review from cheap at you let me know but otherwise this one is enough of a bummer on its own then I don't feel like I have to run down there their entire catalogue I think they have more projects than this I think anyways that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching as always and I will see you on our next review peace pretty good", "KuADqkCoK84": "me Erica again we're here gonna do a tutorial about how to make sour worms and gummy bears with Lucas into white this is how you're going to need a little bit of lemon juice you're going to need a weekly stocking or any kind of chili pepper that you want and the turmoil and a bowl and a spoon so first I usually just put in a little bit of the lemon juice when I squeeze a bunch of the Chum wing and then I put looky there then I give it a little stir but more of the chili give it a little stir do it - it gets a little a little bit not too thick because when you after you're done adding your snack st. and you put you're going to put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes and this gets hard like not super hard to get Louise that's good ye up in the feedback my mom's messing up my video very she's leaving after the gummi bears are in you mix it in again and I want some worms I already have the lemon juice I think I got this at the Family Dollar for like a dollar I am I got this at HEB I got this one at on na Michoacana and I got all the candies at Walmart as 98 cents a bag or you to go to the Family Dollar and get the candies also but third daughter I really I'd rather get the 98 cents I make myself laughs our people oh so you mix and the worms you should have a little texture like this I'm gonna put some more of the Lucas a little more chewy mix it in there I throw in another bag will do the another one we're going to get crazy I'll see these were my kids York mr. cameraman Rene I'm going to eat one myself we're days continue stirring not be my crappy in my video all right hi everybody here just saved you a warm day hi everybody hi my son ready he's cute March annoying since I added more worms I wanted to be covered more Lucas mix it in there and we're done folks put it in the fridge or freezer for about 30 minutes and I'll come back and show you the result by this is a final product this is what your gummy worms chamoy worms should look like after being refrigerated see how it's kind of thick kind of sticky and I'm going to have my kids try it and see if they like it Marko's mmm-hmm they're good Peter you

wild in general they are a portland-based edible company and they specialize in using things that remind them of the pacific northwest and what makes it special and using those ingredients and those fruits and other items found in nature to make these awesome little gummies now in this box there is a hundred milligrams and there are ten small gummies i also want to just talk about real quick how the packaging is it is so cool so you open it like this and out comes this little pocket super easy to open you just squeeze on the side like this bam pop open and you will find these small little sugar coated gummies these gummies are made all with natural flavoring i absolutely loved these edibles they are not overly sugary at all which is fantastic they taste like a natural gummy something that you will find like in a trader joe's or something like that i started out with 40 milligrams and it hit it hit good too i loved it i wasn't overly i didn't feel dumb which some edibles can make someone feel dumb i didn't feel dumb i didn't feel like falling asleep was just so awesome i've been finding too many edibles lately that make you just want to pass out and these guys kept me up kept me going and once the high kind of wear it off and the after effects kind of left i still was able to have a great functioning day which is really nice i love the artwork that will did i love these little huckleberry flowers you'll see all over it and i believe every box looks a little different it goes with whatever the flavoring is which is really awesome on the inside it gives a little message and i'll read that for you the edible contains hybrid perfect for preparing for life's adventure it's a little like the perfect balance of wearing pajamas to work i just really appreciate the the thought process that went into the packaging and making of these edibles now i believe these guys are the number one selling edible in all of oregon and it makes sense they're based in portland but i found them also all over california they are a little bit more expensive than your normal edible but they are extremely consistent some edibles are really great one bag and they can taste great they'll be just like mind-blowing you can give a bag to your friend next thing you know they say it never hits them i don't believe this will be a problem with these guys i'd say if you if you were going to be hanging out at the house like all of us are right now but you're going to be studying maybe doing something for work i'd say eat one of these little guys and you're going to be chilling you'll be chilling you'll be chilling hard yeah so if you guys see these little edibles anywhere i would say pick it up you will not be making a mistake i promise you all right guys so that will be it

anywhere take it off there you being a crazy diesel could be high for all we know they've done the drivers on the road alright what's up you guys it's kink alley here for another a new video so I got Jessica and Lizzie so if you want to are wearing the same outfits from the last video it's because I'm filming a couple of review videos in a row cuz they have you know quite a few products that I want to review some that are edibles and carts and flour and I want to go ahead and you know review as much as I can and put out as much content as we can today we're out just the three of us we're not going outside or anywhere we're just cruising around we're going through the hills and everywhere just kind of cruising we're not going into the parks or anything where anyone's hiking or anything we just wanted to pull over though and I'll insert some of where we drove through here but there's gonna be a vlog as well just kind of us talking and chillin and hanging out but I want to go ahead and get another review in so today we're actually gonna be reviewing another year another heavy hitters product but this time it's not gonna be a cartridge it's actually gonna be their edibles so we have my excuse my nails again I'm gonna get them done soon at home because I can't go anywhere what so we have their two edibles here so one is a cannabis infused gummy pineapple flavor five pieces 20 milligrams each total hundred milligrams we'll go ahead and get closer in super bright where I am I'm sorry you guys but does he just wanted to go out and be out where the Sun is and I'll do a closer up of this maybe in a second so the other one is cannabis infused got me strawberry 5 pieces 20 milligrams each total hundred milligrams here anything to kind of get the point of it perfect and then let me try to do the pineapple one more time just get a really good one of all right so we're gonna go ahead and review both of these for the flavor so let's go ahead and see so star burning fuse - 10 milligram servings per piece let's go ahead and read the back if there's anything so it says gluten-free dairy-free not free so gluten free dairy free not free super vegan I guess that's okay right it doesn't say specifically v4 like vegan or anything but it does say clean kind of is guaranteed let's see let's go ahead ten milligrams THC less than 2 milligrams CBD per piece it doesn't say specifically indica or sativa so most likely it's a hybrid that these gummies are so we're gonna go ahead and get into the strawberry ones here in this video you know go ahead and try one oh these are cute so they are rippable it um it's like a super soft like what is it called like a starburst if they put sugar around it but it's also soft like a gummy bear and it rips in half into two pieces but I'm just gonna go ahead and eat the whole piece as a 20 milligram so I'm gonna let her try it first and then I'm gonna give my thoughts on it so that way I don't say anything that like makes her change her thoughts on it so don't say anything but let me know when you once you have your thoughts in it okay so one first strawberry I think that they could have put in more like um maybe some citrus just for a little more punch and then just really a strawberry flavor there's no like to me it's like a very watered-down like gummy but it doesn't strike to me as like strawberry kind of tastes more like almost like a gummy vitamin where you know it's a berry but you don't know that specifically it tastes like strawberry what do you think it smells like fresh strawberries or when he tastes it tastes like frozen strawberry that's been in the freezer too long while you were saying about the strawberries yeah like that's pretty good very hybrid yeah and I thought got me like it definitely tastes like I've got me it's sweet um you definitely don't taste like I need super wheat or THC in it so that [ __ ] tastes more like that you did like the old-school gummies really hard like a pure weed to it and then I think a lot of people wanted to go like a lot like the skittle slavers and stuff enchilada like people really want like our candy taste and I think that's why you don't even really taste the weed in it so next one that we're gonna open is the pineapple let's go ahead and open it and see if it smells like pineapple yeah it does smell like pineapple okay I'm not really tasting a pineapple oh I do a little little bit after I chewed it for another second it does taste like pineapple yeah and for the pineapple it says ten milligrams THC but each piece has 20 milligrams in less than 2 milligrams of CBD in it pineapple 100 milligrams the same thing it's gluten free dairy free yeah not free so mmm that's the best part I think it's a both of these gummies are really good by heavy-hitters I do like heavy-hitters products am a fan especially if their cartridges her mom recently picked up a cartridge - and what did your mom say about it that's strong yeah like she took popped it once and her eyes were like red she really felt the high I think heavy hitters really brings it you know because of their brand and they're really well known and they have some really good products out there I think they're gummies are really on point um I do wish that they would have a little stronger of like a flavour - pineapple and strawberry personally but other than that they are good gummies you know they are gonna take about 90 minutes to kick in so we will give you guys a little update on the gummies later as we go but yeah so we just wanted to go ahead do another little gummy review let you guys know what we thought of them the flavoring and everything if you guys have any questions or comment or anything please go ahead and leave them in the comment section and if you want please go ahead and subscribe and hit that notification Val thanks for watching you guys bye", "fvKzpfkqD7Q": "- [Man] Gummy bear shot glasses.

Stay tipsy, my friends, stay tipsy.", "NiaPli8UDB0": "welcome to episode 4 of mmm medical edibles I'm chef Tynan Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist and today we're gonna make flavored candy also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music] I'm rolling up all your good and all your gun [Music] this is not for you no chocolate for your dog you", "GLWRBcAOmxQ": "hey you guys welcome back to my channel Bros beds for those of you don't know I'm your host Christina Marie so today's video is going to be a review on these hair gummies that I have by tastebuds I just want to start doing some shorter videos you know I'm working out my consistency staying focused and just really putting out more videos that are more educational and creating that dialogue with you guys so I have these gummies here that I just thought I'd do a short review on that I really like I mean these are not sponsored videos or anything like that these are just products that I have that I've tried and just want to share the information that I have with you guys on these edibles so these are the gummies that were going to review today hopefully that got in focus there we go they are by a brand called taste buds based here out of Colorado and that is Lizzie but taste buds I first got familiar with this brand when I was by attending at the dispensary that I was at and this was a new brand test when I was there they just came in and I wasn't sure sometimes with edible brands we can just kind of start there I'm really quick it's hard with some of these edible brands to find a brand that's going to be consistent and when I say consistent I mean through the whole package if you come by this 10 pack of gummies that usually have their package for the recreational side sometimes on the medical side you can get more and then have a higher milligrams and CBD as well per gummy and packaged but sometimes with a package of gummies let's say you buy a 10 pack on the REC side 4 of them could work and then the other 6 may be in and that just really depends sometimes on how they infuse their products if it's sprayed or if it's actually cooked with the if they're doing like a co2 oil however they extract it just really depends on that sometimes um and it's so frustrating sometimes to buy like not sometimes all the time if you buy a pack of edibles that's not consistent the taste isn't good they're weedy hashey and it just has like a really gross aftertaste and then there's just nothing your waiting there and I've been how now with these I don't know if you guys have seen that meme that says when you start talking [ __ ] about the edible and then it kicks in like yes what I thought these really do kick in and for me I have my med card here in Colorado so I usually shop and get medical edibles I have a really high tolerance so they just work better for me as well and having my med card that helps like I said you can have a higher milligram per piece when you buy edibles on the medical side but these are recreational gummies and actually got these at house of dainties here in Colorado they're one of my favorite dispensaries again I'm sponsored they just have some fire s what you didn't know like the people that worked there um so I got these at how the dankness one day I wanted an edible I was going to my cousin's birthday or something and I really like indica like but if I'm smoking that's where the stream pretty much is and then edibles sometimes I'll do a sativa the reason why I don't really smoke sativas or do sativa edibles is just because I have really bad anxiety I already have a lot of energy so sativa smoking sativas or like having a sativa edible can trigger my anxiety and make me a little bit more anxious and feel a little bit more panicky so that's why I usually try to stay away from those and there are some strains and edibles that you can find that will work with you if you're someone who's like that but I just like the end because just because I feel like they give me a perfect balance because I'm already a naturally high-energy person or just have like a lot of anxiety these just give me like a perfect balance where I'm good and I can still function and maintain now depending on like if it's the end of the night because these are indica gummies I have like a little moon there on the packaging if you see that I can have like a couple more and that will put me out definitely so you just really have to figure out your dosing as well and go ahead and add that in as well with edibles everybody's body is different and everyone's body's going to react differently to certain types of edibles drinks may work better for you there are tinctures gummies chocolates I really like doing drinks or certain brands of gummies just because I feel like they hit quicker for me drinks because it's going through the saliva will hit you a little bit quicker but the [ __ ] not last as long versus ingesting it it may take a little bit longer for it to your high to hit but it may last you a little bit longer another key tip I can add for edibles as well not just on this brand of edibles in general is that they do work better with the fact that you consume in your body so I am working on eating better and healthier but if I'm gonna have it edible I don't want to have like a little bit of fat content to activate that THC as if you're eating an edible on an empty stomach or like a super super healthy meal and there's no fat content looks like a juice or something it may not work right and that's maybe what the problem is so make sure that you're consuming a little bit of fat before you have any kind of edible not just this brand but back to taste buds one thing I like about them after doing some research is that their oil that they extract and use in their gummies has to test over 70% and then also I say that they are the first strain-specific gummy here in Colorado which is cool meaning that on their packaging right here on the side it'll tell you that this was made with Afghani so you know exactly what strain is has been um in your gummy are your edible so I think that's very cool and that they also have as standard as far as where their oil should be testing at now let me show you what the gummy looks like I do like it because there's no sugar coating on it they're fat-free and gluten-free but they do have your ingredient oak glucose I was until you guys just in case if that's an issue for you and gelatin but I like this consistency like that you know typical gummy type of consistency just because they're like they're just really chewy and juicy or not wheaty or hashey they're so good like right before you go to bed are you just trying to chill out the function popping one of these looks like a little jello shot so so but again this is not sponsored I really just like tastebuds because their products have been consistent for me and they really work and it's a recreational edible that's um really great price you just have to check your local dispensary to see what they're charging some places are different and hey and what else was I going to add on to that I'm sorry oh yeah they have two four flavors - four indica - four sativa and they also offer a CBD option as well which is really nice I think it's like a green apple flavor and then the other indica flavor is a tropical fruit or something like that and they have blueberry and kiwi strawberry for the sativa don't quote me so host but I'm pretty sure I hope I got that right but anyway I just want to do a review I do like them I do recommend them if you're someone that has again a lot of anxiety and you're looking for something to kind of give you a nice balance for the daytime you can do a half a piece of these nighttime you can do a whole I would recommend you know just be safe about it I'm not a doctor or anything like that I can just tell you from my experience of working in an industry and what I know and then from times that I've tried edibles as well you know everybody's body is different you're going to react a little bit differently than your friend she your friend might have homies who sometimes will have a half of a piece like a half like a five milligram and that's like my that's consider like micro dosing and for me I would say my max I can have at least maybe like a 800 to a thousand milligrams depends on what the product is or you know what's happening but um you know just depends on your body is different I'm out here going hard but anyway that is it that is off if you have any questions on this review tastebuds or anything like that on edibles if you have any edibles that you'd like me to try or that you'd like me to review please let me know down below also be sure to follow me on instagram at rosebuds underscore hi that's
