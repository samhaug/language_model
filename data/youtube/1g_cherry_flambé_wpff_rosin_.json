{"AORyULfIRe0": "yo yo yo what's good youtube welcome to another live stream i'm going to raise you up just a bit sweet so gopro updated and um my new wi-fi router is in we're showing signal strength here for the stream decent it didn't show that before so now that's pretty good to see anyways let me go ahead and share the link out to instagram and we're going to go ahead and get started uh all right cool well glad we got that up and running let me go ahead and uh get this stream up on my computer oh you're right let's see i'm sure you guys want to see some of this stuff that i have here before we even get started right let me show you what we got going on first of all we weighed everything out earlier we uh pulled it out of the freeze dryer fresh this morning fat fat nineteen point four percent yield killed it one thousand one hundred and thirty grams of nug went in 220 grams of full spectrum hash came out as well as 19 grams of 25 and 160 micron so this is our test press that we use for edibles and then we'll go ahead and press out the rest of these full spectrum pucks i loaded them by hand into the bags and then after putting them in the bags i pressed them down in a rosin evolution pre-press to make sure that they stayed nice and tight and they are evenly distributed went up from uh the small little four ounce jars and uh upgraded to the six ounce jars i got tired of filling those little small ones to the brim and i said it's time to upgrade baby so we got the jar all weighed out we'll be able to weigh this when we're done tonight and see what our final yield was on this run now i'm a big fan of doing my presses a little bit warmer than what most people would i'm using my stool for you guys today so i'm gonna do this but um yeah you guys that watch me often know i will press anywhere from 200 to 225 depending on the cultivar depending on the hash um not all hash comes out the same um for example we talked about trichome density before right we talked about just because it looks like a lot of hash it may not be a lot of hash because um the oil inside may not be full you know what i'm saying the trichome may just be partially full in that case it's fluffy hash where it looks like a lot but it doesn't weigh a lot that's why this 25 micron and this 160 micron it looks like a large puck but it only weighs 19 grams compared to this puck which is smaller in comparison by about a centimeter right and it's not as fat but it weighs more probably about five to six grams more and that's because this is the full spectrum 45 through the 159 which contains higher density trichomes that are full of milk oil compared to the 25 and 160. so just a little throw that in there for you interior genetics what's going on asteroid farms if you guys aren't following asteroid farms on instagram go follow so old homie of mine platinum grove colorado who used to have a really pimp-ass girl room the nasa lab right um one of the inspirations for me initially stepping up my garden well now it's his turn to come back and he just got a brand new house with a nice ass basement and guess what it's time for a brand new build out so we're gonna help each other out take some ideas off of each other and i'm basically gonna have him record the whole thing and um show you guys how he does his build out you know and he'll give you guys pointers along the way and uh you know show you how to build a grow room so by the time you know he's done with that uh build out i'll be done uploading my video on how when i built out my grow room and uh his will be pretty much part two of a series that i'm going to be doing where it's going to be either build-outs brand new or remodels or upgrades and you guys will be able to pay for each episode um individually and absorb all the information that went into that whole build or remodel so it was actually his idea and we're gonna do his build out as episode two so it's gonna be awesome it's gonna have amazing information in there and it's gonna be great for you guys because instead of just seeing my room all the time and you're like oh that's great but not everybody has your room like yours or not everybody has a layout like yours you'll get to see different layouts different places different um climates right you're gonna get to see it all and you're gonna get to see the different thought process that goes into building these so it's gonna be really cool but anyways go check out his instagram because he's already started posting updates on it and it's not often that you get to jump on board and watch it build out brand new from the start most of the time you hop in and it's like uh the person's halfway done they've already done a bunch of [ __ ] you kind of like feel like the new guy you know what i'm saying in a crowd of old guys that been around for a long time now's your chance to get in on the bottom floor be one of those old guys he's been there forever by the time he gets done finishing you could be like i was there when you were still drawing the blueprints yo whippersnapper some of this blue icy and then i'm going to glove up the press is set to 175. we're going to do a low temp press on our test bag it's not going to be a clear indication of how the full spectrum is going to respond but it's going to give me a good enough idea to know whether or not 175 is going to provide the flow i'm looking for or if i'm going to need to go up to my 204 temperature 202 maybe i will put a link up right now i'm not sure that you guys can do it that's what's up jinder mah what's up dude i haven't seen you in forever holy moly so yeah check out asteroid farms what's going on viper what's up slug upstate what's going on we're just giving everybody a minute to trickle on in taking dabs we're enjoying life i haven't even taken a dab with you guys yet have i ah let's take a dab i'm gonna go in on some of this blue icy first oh let's get in there who wants to get in those guts with me we've got 31 left on this battery oh let's get in there the gopro doesn't focus well close up so you guys are gonna take what you get and be happy all right first time catching a live stream viper you caught a very good live stream for your first live stream this whole live stream i've already prepped all my parchment i prepped all my bags normally i'm not this prepped normally i still have full parchment and [ __ ] i wiped down the plates i'm ready to go baby it's waiting on you guys i mean what do you think we're about to press a half pound of hash a half pound cheers at 413 on the email okay ah that blue icy i swear on the exhale it tastes just like a blue icy it is so crazy every time it never fails what's up easy labs green ranger nashville how you doing freshly pressed what's up annie oh gee what's up hidden creek we got the whole [ __ ] family here i think i'm gonna do a live stream prank and start a live stream pressing hash with the hair straightener so we can get a million people asking oh no what happened did the press break fantastic so huh all righty all righty all righty let's swap out the battery you already know we got it we gotta swap out the battery we don't want it to die it'll be another short live stream i had to find it i couldn't forget i couldn't remember where the [ __ ] i put it down now i can't remember which batteries are charged now let's see lucky number nothing they'd be lying sometimes you got to pull them out and pop them back in they're not lying tonight [ __ ] [ __ ] well one of you's got to be higher than 25 [ __ ] percent let's find out i i don't feel comfortable knowing i've got 25 percent left on the battery i just took a fat ass dab and i'm about to start pressing i'm gonna get excited forget and this is gonna die by the way if the stream does go down unexpectedly please stay tuned because i will bring it right back up this is a non-stop party tonight that battery was at 100 you [ __ ] lying ass charger all right all right so for those of you that are new here i do a [ __ ] ton in a very small space so this is where i'm going to be collecting at when i'm all done here okay we're gonna move some [ __ ] out of the way shout out to roz and inc i want you guys to look at something real close here custom product for who that is who has bags like that who has bags like that do you want to know why he carries these two and a half by four and a half bags hey cuz of me baby who wants some bags i know some of you press and some of you need some bags all right anyways we've got parchment laid out we've got our bags ready to go okay and here you guys are going to go you're going to go right here look at that just for you how's that view yeah you could just chill set you down now is a good time if you got to use the restroom you got to go grab a drink you know what i'm saying whatever you got to do go handle that let me figure out this lighting i don't want it to be too bright for you guys oh [ __ ] that's too bright all right i feel good about this you guys are ordering from rosin inc make sure you guys use my coupon codes they're on my site solventlessbnb.com let's get ready get up there get up there just a little love from my homie right there you know all right remember you guys we're gonna be doing the 160 micron and the 25 micron mixed together as a test press before we move on to the full spectrum presses here we have the uh [ __ ] puck come on turn on screen doesn't recognize my gloves oh well anyways i hope that you guys were able to see that now this uh this is just some uh edibles mix of some uh the last strain that i pressed out which is the grape cosby little dark but it is [ __ ] chirpy and delicious and it will do amazing for edibles because the flavor that it will add is not too over the top but it's definitely like you notice it notice it so we're going to drip this into that edibles jar this is probably not going to flow crazy this is a test press a low temp test press at 175 all right i honestly feel like i should go up a little so so so so oh that looks like it's gonna be good well i think i found the temperature i'm gonna try for the first full spectrum maybe it'll flow a little bit more i'll take it for edibles siezer um don't worry that was just a plate on top of the press jumping around my cold plate up there good extraction well the flow was okay wasn't quite what i want it's kind of a weird flow so all right well not quite what i'm looking for believe it or not 185 that's gonna give me that awkward drip i'm gonna hold pull my audience to see what you guys think the temperature is that i'm gonna go with i already know what i'm going with i'm gonna go with uh my usual all right well we're gonna go ahead and do the first full uh spec press now all the same size that one was at 175. small bag we'll do this one first oh jesus 224 no too high 202 202 202 that's that's where i'm feeling 202 today i can feel it in my huevos rancheros pressing some cool spectrum once cash baby all right the room temperature is 74 degrees i do not believe in running a cold room during the pressing stage now bear with me you guys this is going to be a tad bit awkward as i have to deal with not only the um press this new jar which is larger and doesn't sit on the edge so i have to hold it like this in fact i don't even know what your viewpoint is now does that make sense right there where it's at for you guys i mean all right here we go we're at 191.1 191.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 six that's how slow my press heats up i love it i don't care what anybody says it doesn't overshoot temperatures during pressing because it sleeps it heats up slowly it doesn't like jump up all crazy because it has some overpowered 150 to 200 watt heaters it just has two 100 watt heaters nicely spaced out let's take a dab again next time tomorrow it sounds delicious this [ __ ] is like caramel taffy uh oh uh oh ah excuse me i felt like my nose was gonna run all over camera i didn't want that oh yeah what's up mommy my [ __ ] that'll do good that'll do oh that gets the job done i'll tell you what how you guys feeling about this prize we're at 199.7 199.7.8.9 200. 201 i'm not there and dad just [ __ ] knock me on my ass about let's get ready to remove look at that still plenty of paper towel left to clean bangers with throw that away save that puffing my man it's a good night when my boy puffin comes to visit you're pressing yourself right now huh hell yeah get it dog we are warmed up to 202 degrees let's go this is gonna be a second test press slightly lower than my normal but for some reason i'm feeling this temperature why i saw gonza say 204 and i'm like yeah yeah that's my normal i feel it but then all of a sudden my balls rumbled and spoke to me from deep within and they said no 202 now they're all right [ __ ] it the balls haven't lied yet oh what would you look at that there already me gusta come here come to daddy a little [ __ ] go what i say i knew it i felt it i felt it in my huevos rancheros oh yeah let's get messy somebody's got to make a meme out of the next big bag that squirts all over this jar so i'm feeling good about that that's a fish grab that and we're gonna move this over here i'll turn you right now 202 my [ __ ] i want to know did i get it all did i oh man that was a beautiful extraction 202 good job balls sometimes it's in your brains sometimes it's in your balls tonight it was in my balls oh check your insta i just saw you let me see let's let's see what am i checking your story i don't know maybe i jumped in at the wrong part of that conversation oh elevated uh nah there wasn't a lot on the parchment there was barely anything in here really maybe like two to three grams that was a small piece of uh that was small and that was 19 grams in there and uh [ __ ] dude not a lot left in there it's all over the [ __ ] sides of this jar is where it's at you guys want to see a big squirt huh all right let's get it gotta get off this cyber dream stuff though um all right let's get it big old fatty this one feels like a 27-30-ish somewhere in there all right let's go i don't want to listen to trap sorry i gotta get i gotta get the right music on first this is bothering me put on some good old tj hotto all right let's go i'm gonna fold this one down the center i just pinch it crease it down the center diagonal the other diagonals and that gives you kind of like a good flow right there already and then you just pinch the sides together and it's like let me check my battery here 85 percent go dude i'm all smoking one squeeze okay shout out to my man mysticalgo my official artist on sbnb records back down oh yep bomb extraction on that one let's go cross mountain ranges split cells of tomorrow it flowed so well there's like not even that much on the paper let us go yes uh let's keep this party [ __ ] going good over here peace i think i put some information in the description maybe i didn't add that i guess but 25 micron double bag from rosin inc for the uh for the bags my bad y'all i tried to put some information in there and i left out that one yo if you guys can't catch the live streams sign up for my patreon i upload them there so come to daddy um is i'm the master of my own fate i determine my own yield i grew the flowers this is the source of the single i am my own god excuse you uh is that's why i keep the ends of these parchment pieces wrap them over the parchment paper i wish i could slow this down listen listen did you [ __ ] catch it though my man [ __ ] threw it in putting him on game yo understand he let y'all know i'm putting y'all on game for free i'm gonna i'm gonna take it back one time is it too loud uh um let's go ladies and gentlemen it's time to flow i'm gonna bring you guys back some i feel like i'm not bad hold on you guys don't really need that flashlight i don't think anyways let me take it off and passed wrench squad hold it down here's a pro tip on really fat pucks make sure you leave a little extra space behind the puck so that you don't get a blowout but i can mute it that's fine didn't need that light but i'm not liking how that's lining up on the [ __ ] plates i'm gonna move it over just a tad real quick like uh is i go go go go go real big extraction what is it [ __ ] this one's really done i'm calling it now it's gonna be a dumper is nobody [ __ ] with you you know what as a kid i actually did like origami and [ __ ] you know what was better than origami paper [ __ ] planes god damn it paper planes with a [ __ ] i could fold all types of paper planes you guys when i was a kid not now you know why i can't do it now because i lost the book i didn't look that [ __ ] up read that [ __ ] in the book you know what i mean books are cool as [ __ ] you can learn how to make paper airplanes and [ __ ] who would have thought mm-hmm starting to get good at this [ __ ] so um okay well brown is foreign i until you quit this next one's gonna squirt like a [ __ ] so um okay i have that camera ready i'm gonna record this one on my phone i'm not sure how i'ma do it watch me money money all the time hey money please no worries it's only 200 degrees touch it with your [ __ ] hands that sense sorry i'm trying to align this a little bit differently here safety reasons there it is my press has a ram that can adjust positions so um it's a little bit different than most the ram isn't stationary which means that it can come out of alignment sometimes if i move it or whatever but it's all we're helping to make good taking care of your summer projects is a breeze bam summer savings on all your favorite brands make things even easier so freshen up the deck and fire up the grill summer's here and it's as close as your home yard get more done let's get it i've used this prosper [ __ ] ever you're biking like five years now i just let go of the [ __ ] bar my bad you guys the camera is on a very unsteady amount kinda i don't have the tripod leg spread out very well all right is to the place whoa the puck slit in the plates when i was adjusting it apparently almost popped out of the front no blow out though but i gotta pull it out real quick and readjust it i'm so glad that didn't blow out but somehow that slipped out that's a trip i'm so happy that i didn't blow out that's crazy what the [ __ ] i've never had that happened that's a trip that's a trip son experience saved for real he wouldn't would he he [ __ ] would let's go back on the plates you go you son of a [ __ ] that was a trippy trip trippy trip trip this thing is about i was like why is it not going like it should be leaking way more and then all of a sudden the handle slipped and i was like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] what happened put that back on the plate for a second up a let that so hmm who's your daddy who's your daddy what a safe uh is before oh yeah good extraction i'll take it oh yeah let's power through it two more to go parchment gets added to the jar everything i want everything together mixed together equal even steven the stuff that sticks to the parchment might be different terpenes might be different different [ __ ] you know you don't want to leave it out shop from the comfort of your home at sprint.com that's not a lot of work bro i know i'm saying it's already time to upgrade the jar again i just got this damn jar i'm upset it's not fun i thought for sure it was going to be good enough we knew get a bigger drawer uh bertha it's time to go squirtle what the [ __ ] it did it again something's going on here is it sliding something's happening here there's no blowout but it's sliding off pressure's not being applied evenly to the plates somehow or they're too tight or i pre-packed them at an angle never had this happen okay i know what i'm about to do fix this i'm going to have to increase the pressure even slower every problem there is a solution hmm leaned on him to apply pressure for the pre-press by doing it evenly i had to have been time to upgrade and put my bigger plates on i guess for these bigger presses right inside there i hope you guys are watching this if you guys aren't [ __ ] paying attention i don't know what you're doing right now when i mess up that's when you guys need to pay attention because i don't mess up very often not to sound cocky whatsoever but i don't so if i make a mistake that's resulting in some type of mess up it would benefit everybody around me to pay attention and realize what i'm doing wrong so i got my light that's fine before i make sure i got the jar underneath there i didn't think it was going to squirt like that still this parchment is heavy from the [ __ ] first part of the press but it's still flowing good that's all that matters and no blowout fan dumb strong on the top setting don't you get a damn hum my curl is my rocker maybe i choose you and i don't even have i don't even have um i have a couple theories for what it is lots of adjusts right now it's increasing pressure too fast and also i have the press at a a pretty good angle right now leaning towards the front and i think that the hash is melting and making the puck inside uneven and then it blows out the front like that so i think i'm just going to go ahead oops just hit the table i'm going to go ahead and flatten out the press a little bit more risky with this puck anymore how would i do on the save [ __ ] crazy giving her incredible so okay my battery at 34 okay um check the alignment of the plates one more me come on gloves don't stupid i know it's not that cold in here but then mm-hmm little 74 degrees in here oh missiles contemplating life changes foreign foreign let me grab some parchment hold on i got an idea not so much as an idea that i just want to do something for this press just insurance actually all okay searching for savings on descriptions is so complex it's like getting a documentary unfortunately you just savings period not all patients eligible savings so um me yes i haven't even hit one ton of pressure you guys think i'm kidding look so just hit two and a half oh figured it out right pressure was increasing too fast and the angle probably didn't know so so well aren't you guys glad i got the internet connections really good attraction well wow please so um batteries are charged let's get a battery swap in before we do anything else we'll go from there sound good oh think so okay all right so good job bertha good job baby we're gonna take a dab and then after this dab i'm going to um go ahead and collect what's on the parchment and get it added to the jar while it's still warm man that's heavy that's heavy i mean yield wise i'm thinking it's got to be it's got to be upwards of 80 it has to be you know there's it is no [ __ ] way it's not it's a little harsh didn't it that's okay i'll turn it down i knew there was a little [ __ ] nap thingy in here a little [ __ ] flew right on me else we know there's never a good time to run out of fresh luckily our delivery and free pickup excuse me so whether it's a few extra guns from the back all right i mean you can't help it i got lights on in here when i come in through the garage little [ __ ] just came in with me i guess oh boy oh what are we taking a dab off i mean this is the 160 and 25. this [ __ ] is looking better than some people's like 90s come on man this is my throwaway edibles what's your calling air force reserve af reserve dot com all righty i got the drugs already got a little bit of runs on here i'm gonna grab some more though on the outside of one of these parchments but i smeared i know there's like a bunch on the outside i could take so i don't have to dip into the jar or anything i'm i'm weird right now you're like call that fresh press man i wish i'll give you a melt so like wood that's runs wow wow that flavor is intense now that i haven't dabbed it in a while in a while holy [ __ ] it is intense um hitter hitter hitter hitter hitter goodness q-tip foreign all right fire all right here we go we're gonna collect the rest uh i don't have a tool i can even stick that far down into the jar to reach the bottom that's being 100 you guys want to get the girls so all right all right all right all right hash dust all over there packing the bags so all right you guys i'm going to turn up the music and i'm probably going to space out a little bit i have the chat right behind the camera though so i can see what you guys are saying and i will talk to you guys so

friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis reviews today we have an awesome product category it's extracts i've only had one extract on the channel i personally love extracts it's mainly what i smoke it's what i'm used to vaporizing from the legacy market something that i hold near and dear to my heart and i'm actually going to show you my live rosin and hash rosin in a coming video from my garden you get to see some of the things that i've made and some of the cannabis i produce and kind of see how i'm holding people accountable to my standard but what do we have today a really cool product uh from an awesome company out on vancouver island from good buds we've got hash rosin and you might be asking yourself andy what's hash rosin well let's take both the words break them down hash being uh seething the glandular head off of cannabis either through a dry sieve or a wet sieve being bubble hash or dry sip i believe this one comes to us from a fresh frozen bubble hash because that's what they have on market right now and what their product card is saying now rosin if you're not familiar with the terminology rosin it's actually the way you can excrete the essential oils from the cannabis flower or hash by only using heat or pressure and then you squish out those essential oils and you leave behind any contaminant that may be there giving you a beautiful dabbable product there isn't very many uh products to dab on market right now so that's why i was excited to see the good buds hash rosin come out and at a reasonable price point this is a half gram and the half gram is 40 that's what i paid for it so not too bad now i see this it was packed on may 6 2020 uh net weight half gram and it's equivalent to two grams of dried canvas not bad at all the smoke from cannabis is harmful there are 800 milligrams of active thc in a full gram of this so 400 milligrams a lot of thc a lot of terps uh all the good things that you're looking for if you are have found that you've built a big tolerance to cannabis and you've never tried an extract before like rawson shatter live resin or even just hash i definitely would recommend uh supercharging everything up you can use these products in different ways today i'm gonna use them in a dab rig because that's the best way for me to assess the flavor but enough talking about it well i think i mentioned good buds is certified organic which is cool uh good buds this is from sun grown cannabis and the company was started out the back of a sprinter van i believe uh growing cannabis and evolved into an entire licensed producer so good for the guys out there for having the business acumen to bring something like this to market and be one of the first movers pretty cool in my opinion i don't know who processed it for them but if i was to make a bet on it i think it was whistler tech here we go let's break the seal underneath this camera and we've got this big package see our cannabis seal all of our good stuff let's get in there hope you're having a wonderful day oh can i get in with my just my thumbnail there we go and then it should be a easy peasy lemon squeezy and there is what's inside of our package which is another child proof container and there is our rosin let's inspect our container no contaminant doesn't look like there's any contaminant it's a little dark but we're not raws and racist here so we're gonna try it it definitely has that crust formed on the top it's been sitting packaged for a couple months now so that's fair um but let's dig in and then we'll start smelling it very soft you can see there buttered underneath that color goes all the way through i kind of like to break this out of here but let's smell it so this is a mixed hash they say that it's a bunch of mixed ones but i know they have lord of the apes and white glucky so i assume it's a mix of those two um on the nose there's like lemon lemon bar a little bit of lemon cream yeah definitely just those confectionary kind of cakey lemon bar aromas creamy sweet cream lemon it's quite simple that's all i'm really pulling out of it at first i had a bit of an aroma skunk but that skunkiness is gone let's see if i can pull this out of there there we go we can get it out pretty easy and uh we can get a little booty shot of our grain or our half gram here so you can see how it waxed up in there you can see the sheen on now that's been opened it's sweating a little so that's pretty cool uh oh no stuck to my finger okay so now most importantly let's taste it uh if you guys aren't used to doing dabs it's a little bit of a process there are more things you are going to need a rig now there's many different options you can use an electronic rig like the g pen rom that heats up and it's you know click of a button it all turns on i have reviews of that um or you can use the traditional rig banger and a torch with a carb cap today i think i'm going to do that since this is hash rosin i want to give it the respect i'm going to put the respect on it um so let's give that a little taste test out of my elbow dyno 2014 very cool check out elbow glass this is one of his original shapes um always wanted this piece very very cool i am using i forget what kind of banger this is and then there's a ruby insert in here we're gonna use the gordo scientific cap this is a blazer big shot torch in case all those things matter to you there's a lot of pieces to this dabbing thing but again as i mentioned vaporizing essential oils is what i uh tend to do the most it's the most time consuming but it's like smoking an entire joint in one puff and that's pretty all right if you ask me so there we go got it hot enough and now we're gonna wait a minute good thing i have a timer up here or else i would completely lose this we'll put that little guy into that bottom shot while we wait for it here well let's do it up here the dino just cooling down super cool love this piece absolutely love this piece um i was really happy actually me and my wife bought it together and we got hooked up through homeless hittings at homeless headies on instagram you should definitely check out homeless headaches if you're looking to get yourself a sick rig at a great price all right that's about our dab temperature and uh cheers okay so pretty good um things that i often look for in a hash rosin uh are that it has no plant matter taste um there wasn't any plant matter taste so that is a good sign and then the motto is there's always going to be a little bit of residual in the banger so you got to waste it to taste it but we're going to want to wipe out what's left over to keep our banger nice and clear we can really get a lot of indications off of the q-tip as well see if there's any contaminant anything like that and to me it uh it melted pretty clean actually um so pretty pretty good um what did i taste though i did try their white glooky's hash and i could taste that kind of wood chippiness come through from um that hash so maybe that's one thing i did take a decent size dab so i was really trying to taste it on the palate i got um i guess a little bit that lemon bar a little bit that sweet cream i definitely got wood chips i tasted a lot of like older hash that maybe had been quite oxidized but the finish is nice and long on my palette not bad at all i think it's a good representation of where the legal market can start and what we can evolve too i think it's probably competing with a lot of things on that legacy market right now maybe not the top top end um but it's not uh it's it's it's not too bad um okay well let's break down the good buds hash rosin from top to bottom how we liked it uh so the appearance it is hash rosin uh we're not rosin racist but i would like a much lighter creamier um more stable less sweaty as soon as i open it product there are a lot of things that uh this could go through to give it a different formulation so on the appearance i guess there's no contaminant the color's rough um we'll give it 15 points i think 15 points is fair for the appearance this is definitely maybe just a year behind where it could be um the smell wasn't too loud as i mentioned it is a simple rosin it had that sweet cream lemon bar kind of buttery lemon bar i don't know not anything insane again 30 points done the taste was good the finish is definitely the best part but when i did get that little bit of wood chippiness that didn't get me too stoked it would just kind of tasted like old hash um just being an absolute hash head i knew what i was tasting um so in that case for the taste i'd like to give it 13 points could have done better didn't taste bad had a nice finish um but the pieces of it that stood out to me i could kind of feel like it might have been i don't want to say faulted but i could i could tell that it wasn't um what it could have been uh overall experience based on my knowledge of cannabis rosin everything about this um it's like a 70 product so let's give it 14 points and that's my total i bet it's about a 70 percent uh hash rosin um ways to go good starting point not overly upset at my purchase for forty dollars and let's play with it once before we go in the camera so you guys can see the butter butter see the sweat mixing up but it is quite sticky and let's give it one last smell no nothing's changed just sweet cream and lemon awesome thanks so much for watching i hope you're gonna dab some extracts i hope you're out there i hope you're gonna move into that new world have you ever dabbed before let me know below let me know if i need to do a dab tutorial or something like that and cover it a little bit more in depth i really appreciate you watching have a great day make sure to like comment share and subscribe cheers guys what's my name what's my name the cannabis somalian", "o6UrX9n_UWo": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys it's cliff with peer pressure here thanks for tuning in to are solving this review series we've got Roz and Ryan from olio here today we're gonna be checking out his papaya punch number four let's get to it [Music] the papaya punch number four from olio is a cross between purple punch and papaya both heavily indica dominant strains the purple punch was giving me hints of grape candy and a sweet blueberry muffin fresh out of the oven while the papaya was was on the sweet candy side of things papaya candy maybe a little hint of mango in there and it's very surprising that it was an indica dominant strain because most of the effects I was getting were what you would attribute to a sativa dominant strain and I was getting a very energetic productive and uplifting high I tribute this to the high concentration of limonene found in the string and the limonene is really what was giving me that mood elevation in euphoria the second most concentrated terpene present and this strain was Lin Ahlul and I tribute that to the relaxation and stress relief that I was getting from this hey guys it's clip peer-pressure here welcome to the solvent ice review series this is episode number two we've got rosin ryan here with olio and we're gonna be reviewing the papaya punch number four this is our jam product this is been heat cured this is pretty much the most separated of all our consistencies as far as THC a and terpene content within the rosin and we believe it's probably the most shelf-stable even if you don't put it in the fridge or anything like that it keeps flavor for a long time and it's honestly my favorite consistency that I'm smoking right now so you can leave this out and it doesn't it doesn't you know decrease in terpene value it won't dry up which some people do like but this here let me show you here sure so what's this little dab tool here so every gram of ours has kind of comes with a personal dabber it's just a little extra thing we do just select emergency dabber in case of situations for sure very nice nice touch so what can you tell me about the the strain here so this is our papaya punch number four this is we have a few different fee knows we always Fino test a few different seeds that we get it's like the most exotic fruity and most punchy almost phyno it's got an exotic note it's um it's got a little bit of that artificial grape in it from the purple punch it's probably one of my favorite strains at the moment and this is from pony seeds papaya times purple punch very nice yep this is perfect for during the day I'll run some errands after dabbing some of this stuff it's very relaxing but its clear-headed yes it's a hybrid like most things are nowadays and for me personally I know it's different for everybody but I could dab some of this and still get a lot of stuff done during the day I don't feel too body locked or anything like that I still I'm ready to go you know do my stuff for the day so got that clarity stay exactly exactly and it's so flavorful that I almost don't expect to relax feeling I'm expecting some type of anxiety yes achieve a high but it's honestly perfect mellow high for the middle of the day definitely so how do you typically go about finding a good hash string it is many different steps so first of all to grow which ones grow nice we can't get any males obviously we take out the males whatever females are left it really is dependent on how well they grow their yield in the garden then once we wash them it's gonna be based on water hash yields it's gonna be the thing that plays the most role and if we keep it or not if it does yield well a nice hash and it presses well usually we'll keep it it all depends on flavors yields we all come together smoked them we all you know put in our opinions of you know which one do you think is a little bit tastier versus if the yield if it's really worth it sometimes we'll take a tastier one even if it yields a little bit lower just because it's got that little extra that we know people will will enjoy it so for sure so what do you thoughts on fresh frozen verse washing dried and cured flour so you can wash cured I've seen it done stuff 99% of our stuff is fresh frozen almost almost all we have our own in-house garden everything is harvested fresh frozen washed within usually one to two weeks so we try to wash it as quickly as possible really keeps that terpene profile just like it was when you were smelling the plant so when you're going around you got your fingers on the nose I want that to be what the rosin tastes like yeah I went down I really do think fresh frozen you know produces that a little bit better of a quality in the end for sure yeah so yeah you talked about doing BHO extraction in the past and you know when BHO first came out people were always looking for a light golden color but it seems now that things are kind of moving more towards an almost white color and I've even heard of people pulling their plants early to even get that color do you have any comment on like that is a huge trend right now in the in the grow world as people know you can pull your plants a little bit early but you're gonna sacrifice what I believe is a little bit taste and your potency the effects from you pulling early I believe are gonna be felt people really go for that visual yeah so when people see white hash they really they get excited yeah I think people really need to try the hash more side-by-sides sometimes a darker hash will blow the lighter hash out of the water with taste with potency affect how it makes you feel so I really think people should try stuff before you know everybody eats with their eyes so to speak but but uh you really gotta get smoking yeah so what can you tell us about the terpene profiles some of the flavors that you're getting up the papaya punch number four so this number four is probably our most like exotic fruity vino of this papaya punch it's mostly papaya notes it's that exotic fruit in there and it's got a little bit of artificial grape in there from that purple punch that's definitely that's it in there I think it's probably the most well balanced of our papaya punch he knows as far as flavor goes and that consistency is honestly my favorite I like when I see large chunks and they're swimming in Terps so definitely that Jam was just it's something else that is beautiful I seriously could smell it earlier just sitting back here when it was sitting over there so I liked what you did with it for sure well what about terpenes in general their medicinal benefits I mean how do you think that plays a role into the medicinal benefits the high and whether you classify it as an indica sativa I think everybody you know takes terpenes in a little bit differently obviously some of the ones like limonene stuff like that are just known to generally give people a little bit more uplifting effects like that but as far as terpenes go it's really about finding a flavor that you enjoy in an effect that doesn't hinder your day really yeah if you smoked something that you really like but it's giving you anxiety obviously that might not be the strain for you you should find something you know with similar profiles that don't actually have that same terpene you know within the plant so if you like something fruity but you're getting horrible anxiety from lemon let's maybe try like a citrus yeah or another a strawberry banana or something like that where you know hey this tastes really good but it's not gonna cause me to freak out yeah strawberry banana is one of my favorites - it's super relaxing probably the heaviest indica of the fruity stuff that I've tried so I know a lot of people that love it definitely definitely so one thing I love about following you on instagram is that you're just always dropping knowledge helping push the community further for those of you who aren't following him on Instagram he's at a troz and Ryan check him out lots of great content out there so I feel like the first time I ever heard the term rosin jam it was from following you on Instagram can you comment did did you coin that phrase is there anything there it was kind of more of the people speaking we did a little survey and stuff we just wanted a different our selves a little bit um there was a huge craze going on at the time of people putting rosin in jars and this whole new tech that's going on and I really wanted to create a name that people think Jam they think olio but honestly it's kind of taken off we've noticed other people you know using the rosin Jam name and we really don't seem to mind we've had people in Spain posting rosin jam so I think there's a really awesome to see and it's just it's just our version of rosin sauce or you know just a just a new just a new consistency we're just trying to cone so definitely yeah consistency is everything when I'm looking for a product if typically I lean more towards the jams you know if I see something that's a little more buttery that's just not usually my flavor lots of people like the butter does it is all of reference a lot of people love the butter just for ease of dabbing people like to just dig in some people grab it with their hands and just drop a bomb right in there and just its ease of dabbing it's a preference some people don't want the rosin heat it up some people want it straight off the press and put in the fridge so we like to offer a product for everybody yeah if you want your Ross and put in the fridge we have classic coins um if you want butter we have butter if you want your stuff lightly heated we have a batter and if you want a true separation and you want your rasam to look like BHO a live resin consistency and you don't want to leave it in the fridge then the jam is for you no down so I've got a bunch of homies they nerd out on temperatures as far as pressing goes dabbing goes do you have like a perfect temperature range usually fall in when it comes to pressing and dabbing yes I do if you know if something is pretty melty I use usually stick around 180 degrees that's a nice low temp of times and stuff really vary between how much you put in the bag and what you're squishing and all that but I like 180 degrees it just really is like a nice golden you know point for me for sure yeah so what about the your actual rig or the nail have you ever played around with temperatures I have and stuff it's been a while I'm usually just a time kind of guy kind of figure out what my new nail you know Davin is I'll heat it up and kind of do a test or at 45 seconds you know on minute 30 kind of see what my nails I like a low time dab it uh I'm gonna be dabbing I like a little bit extra on the bottom I'll leave a little puddle sometimes I don't mind you're sure we'll be sure to keep it on the blue setting oh yeah yeah so when you typically take a dab how long does it take for you to feel the effects usually I'm and this is just me I usually feel the effects pretty instantly honestly me too I uh I'll take a dab of this stuff and be ready to go yeah you know it's it's pretty instant behind the eyes yeah yep do you get that with other extracts or do you think rosin high gloss hooker I think rosin in general and solvent listen general I feel throughout my body a little bit more I noticed when I dabbed BHO it's it's more of a head high uhm BHO always you know it feels a little more floaty to me uh rosin solvent list is always a little bit more body I feel a little bit more relaxation from it instantly definite so tell me a little bit about the the bubble hash side of things how are you guys washing what's the trick to getting this so it all starts in the grow so most of our stuff is it's very well taken care of throughout all of its life the veg has to be very clean the early flowering stages at the environment is a huge factor so that's all before the wash is really the plant when we take when we're harvesting no no trimmers even touch the nose they're all hold it you know by the stem cut off the nose and take little golf ball sized pieces really trying to not disrupt any trike formation that we've you know work so hard to grow so washing we use our all RO water it's all hand washed pretty much as gentle as you can wash bud they do it multiple times will wash four or five times just to ensure that all the heads are taken off it's done in a cold room it's all ROI sorrow water it's as clean as can be in there so yeah that's how you make clean Rossum's clean hash and a clean girl so you mentioned washing by hand why do you prefer that over say and automate it where I can just hit the button and it's just uh really control over you know your whole process you can stir as gently as you want you can have a machine that stirs pretty gently but just having that control that hand on it and really seeing how much you're taking off each plant and stuff like that it's that extra care that really goes into it that really just makes it that much better for sure well let's let's get to it yes you want to about here guess we'll switch on over to the blue temp there it's the lowest temperature we've got I've got a little new little guide tool too they do come in handy [Music] man that's just what I was looking for you can definitely get that sweep of pile on the front and then on the backend you've got that like earthy grape soda candy like it was it's definitely what I'm looking for I'm glad you enjoyed it man yeah I always um I always enjoy papaya but that uh that little extra little grape really adds something to it it's got like a little almost a spiciness almost to it it's just really good for sure so what are you feeling like effects wise right now what do you think I I love the relaxed feeling I get from this the clear-headedness good vibe to some music right now to there so I just love the effects just great for chilling yeah you know I've got a real calm my body's real relaxed but in my brain I've got that little tingle to it but it's still real clear yep perfect biking it's quick behind the eyes and stuff quick acting I still feel like I could you know get up and go do some stuff right now so it's perfect and it is some strong stuff dum papaya punch generally tests around 80% for us so I mean that's a pretty high THC content so sure yep the rest of it's pretty much chirps we've been getting regularly 20% turps with the jam it's probably a 5 to 8 percent increase over just having it out you know just fresh press so wow it's quite a significant difference yeah so if somebody was looking to get some of this sweet papaya grape soda candy where could they find that so yeah you can find our product pretty much all over Colorado it's in recreational and medical shops dispensaries we have a flagship dispo it's higher grade they offer recreational and medical at two different locations you're probably gonna have our your best bet you know finding some jam there but we also you know post drops all over our Instagram page at dabble leo 7:10 you can give us a follow I also have my personal page at Ross and Ryan so I usually post the flavors as soon as I make them people get a little anxious and always ask me where it's at it's gonna be about a week or two before testing and all the packaging gets ready usually about a week and usually the olio page is where you can find all the information the drops what you know pretty much where everything's going that you're looking for thanks for stopping by man really enjoy the papaya punch number four it's definitely gonna be one of my goat cheese for this summer for anybody out there is not following them on Instagram be sure to check out at Roz and Ryan always dropping knowledge about solving this extraction trying to push the industry forward and dab olio 710 that's where we got the papaya punch number four from highly recommend it I really appreciate you guys having me I always love talking hash and thanks again so much come down so after sitting on the high for a while you know I really found it interesting that I was getting a lot of sativa dominant effects or what you would think would be sativa dominant effects because they're both in economists trains that we're working with here you know we've got the papaya on one side we've got the purple punch on the other like I said both indica dominant so you would expect a sedative effect but what I found was something really uplifting and that's why I think it's the perfect Brosnan for summertime vacation because it was relaxing mentally but still energetic got a little euphoria from that so an all-around great summertime high and perfect for like I said any vacation any trip to the beach or the lake definitely be my go-to and thanks for tuning in guys be sure to like and subscribe below follow us on our IG Facebook at go peer pressure thanks for tuning in [Music]", "A4liVeDhO6g":

mature audience if you're not a mature audience this video is not for you what's up everybody Cubans here and today we are going to get into some rather expensive concentrates I picked up a gram of some hash rosin today that was priced at $75 and it is one of the most expensive grams of concentrate I have ever purchased so let's take a close look at what we got I've had a gram of Summit connoisseurs genetic and concentrates Tiger's milk and this stuff looks like a nice little slab of peanut butter I'm pretty excited pretty excited abot both so you can get a look at the packaging here this is that Tiger's milk and it's testing at about seventy nine percent THC and then it does have a little bit of CBD a in there but you know what I am so excited for this let's just take it down where are my clothes at let's get a nice nice little scoop here out of the email all fresh and clean and I'm gonna see how it does does [Music] um yeah that was really good I'm gonna actually throw that on a courts now I'm gonna throw that around on a few nails and see if we like it but just to compare I picked up some cheap dabs this cost 75 a gram for some hash rasen 75 bucks for this it's pretty expensive most most of my concentrates I usually find deals and get a lot of good looking stuff like this this is some live batter I got for about 15 bucks a gram one-fifth of the price now sometimes I find live sugars live diamonds of batters around that 15 to 20 dollar price if I'm getting it on a deal it's not the everyday price so begin the deal you can get this stuff cheap so it's really interesting to pay five times as much for a single gram of concentrate I can't I can't believe I did it it's still interesting to me that this costs five times as much as this other gram of some delicious looking stuff but some hash rods and it's hard to come by especially here in Colorado Springs it's not super common to find rosin hash rosin so I guess you got to pay that top dollar because it's so rare but let's get some more dabs of this cone I'm not done with this yet let's see what I'm gonna do some cold starts when you know that this is $75 and you get in a big school but I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there okay [Music] it's throwing out a couple bucks in that [ __ ] it [ __ ] it and get a little bit more I need about three-fitty oh we got it okay okay just pricey tab right here damn it all right let's get a nice cold start here and see if it's super delicious on the court oh damn well damn okay okay that's good stuff so I just stabbed it a couple of times here and it's pretty good stuff but is it is it worth it is it worth paying five times as much as I do for some good live banner is it worth is it worth paying five times as much to get some solvent once that's basically the major difference is the fact that it's solvent list most concentrates are made with a solvent it's the easier method it's the most common method but with rosin they use heat and pressure to make it so they just basically squish the THC or they squish the extract out of the nugs or out of hash most of the time they'll make a hash and then they'll press the hash and that's what this is this is a this is hash rosin so it's a little bit more expensive and my understanding is the yield is a little bit lower it's it's a process to make the hash and then when you press the hash you wouldn't get the same type of yield as if you were doing like a butane or propane extraction so I think part of the process is it's a little bit harder to get high-quality product and you're typically going to get less with whatever amount of plant material you go into the process with so I think that affects the price it is pretty rare out here in Colorado Springs not a lot of people are pressing - I can find it in a few places some places have rosin and half chosen but it's not as common as BHO and pho and there's so many dispensaries that grow their own bud and they do their own in-house extractions so something like this I can I can pretty much get really cheap any day of the week if I'm looking around so for me to pay five times as much for this it's a little little far-fetched I honestly I'd rather have five grams of this and haven't done but yet and it's just I like volume I like to do a lot of dub so I'm gonna go back and forth on these we're gonna compare I just want to shave this I got this the same day I kick it costs literally one-fifth the price I'm just gonna see if it's if it's it if it's 20% it's good like it doesn't make oh god I just paid so much money but anyway anyway anyway yeah that's that's solid for the price that's sell it for $15 grand look um I I think it's good I think that that the rosin is good I'm gonna dab the rod let me have a bucket that was that was the I don't even know of the other strain is [Music] [Music] I mean it's definitely better [Music] the Robins better smoother and tastes a little better you can't really compare the highs because I'm better than both back for it but it's all about the taste for me and it is smoother is it pay five times the price smoother [Music] I don't think so because it's not it's not five times as good yeah I don't even know how you would get five times as give it something like this this isn't the best this isn't the best cheap batter that I've got but for something to be five times as good as this would be pretty impressive so this is not five times as good probably not worth five times the price if I see it on deals I may get it but I don't think it's worth anything that's worth three times the price two times the price even thirty forty five bucks I get why it costs so much it's a it's a little bit less common not as many people are making it and you get lower yields with it I get why it it costs more but it's not currently it's not at the price point where it's super worth it for me to only buy rosin maybe if I had a press and I could get amazing yields myself but I don't grow and I don't have any interest in growing so it's like I don't have to buy all my nugs anyway to smash it so kind of interesting I like finding deals so maybe I'll get excited about finding a deal in the future but yeah this isn't actually the most expensive gram of concentrate I've ever purchased a few years ago I remember purchasing a I purchased several grams actually a full melt bubble hash that I got remember the dispensary but I got some full melt bubble I think it was about eighty eight bucks a gram I think I remember paying just under ninety a gram it was really really good stuff it was like some of the craziest stuff I ever spent I I gotta go back and look for some pictures of it cuz it was a few years ago those full mount bubble hash grams I got were like pretty good but after I got a mouse this isn't worth eighty eight bucks a gram what the [ __ ] did I just do so I kind of feel that way here what the [ __ ] that I just do but we made a video that's what the [ __ ] we just did so let's do a few more dabs of this [ __ ] might as well I've only taken out several dollars off of it I don't see if we can take several more I'm interested in the cold start here so let's do that [Music] here's a few dollars [Music] yeah this is good stuff still I wish I could afford you dabs well this was actually pretty fun and I'm pretty blessed after all those naps and I'm glad I finally got to try this rosin up and see it in a bunch of dispensaries even if I did pay money for it but if you liked this video be sure to subscribe for more content in the future and check out my other social media I'll have links in the description below and for my live streams tune in to twitch at twitch.tv slash Cubans if you tune in at night I'm probably live right now getting high dabbing some much cheaper than than $75 a gram rosin unless you tuned in very shortly after this is made that I might have some of this left but uh come hang out and we'll see you next time [Music] I would say perfect balance but I'm going [Music] [Music] [Music]", "Kg8MX7yE_54": "easier welcome back everybody this step we're gonna be doing a little bit of a hash review I haven't done any of those and like a while so I just wanted to do a quick smoke out and talk about some of the hash that that I have seen that is not mine and you know we'll smoke it and talk about it I obviously got this stuff from bubble modes this is from a whole plant fresh frozen run I gave him this cut of the cookies and cream that I you know pop the seeds from a while back and I gave him a cut and he decided to wash it and it came out amazing I cannot talk about enough how much this stuff is fire super surprised this is a fee no I hadn't washed before so I mean I thought it was just I thought it was just a strain that would look good in the bag I didn't think it was this washable I mean I have a different fee know that I was washing and sifting I don't know which one is better I think the one I have still is better for sift but I might have to give that one another try obviously it was I mean everything whole plant fresh frozen means that it was chopped down and went straight in the freezer even the top coalos we're not just talking about trim and then larf this is like top rock-hard colas going in there too I did a similar run with the pineapple Express where I I mean I washed everything about it and it's drying right now I'll probably smoke some on the show with the later date because is like the first time that I did it and it came out absolutely phenomenal I'm gonna check it that out it's amazing or what oh my god look at that and again I mean the camera it's it looks phenomenal on camera but the camera still isn't doing it justice like it is it's like white white this this light kind of makes it look a little yellowish I mean when you pour this stuff out it is stark white super impressive pretty stable he was worried that it was still a little wet so we'll give that a shot and see if it is if it is it's not a big deal I was kind of impatient anyway I said he'd been drying it for like Oh ten days or so and he still wasn't sure if it was dry which was crazy I know his room is spot on so I mean it's in the mid 30s as far as humidity which should be drying hash out in definitely seven days but this strain just might be that greasy I have a couple of people that were asking me if it's worth it to wash whole plant I mean it's kinda not like BHO where you're gonna get a higher yield because it's Bud like it's pretty much gonna be about the same yield you would have got off a tram which is discouraging but I feel like the hash is better mean you're gonna get the same amount of total weight and resin but I think there's gonna be more heads in the bags that more heads in the bags that are good so there's gonna be more 90 more 70 less 25 yeah and even I mean my experience with whole plant I mean this isn't a hundred percent of the time but it seems like even the 190 and the 160 seem to be extremely better than then they would have been just off of trim mainly because you know the 160 and 190 bag are on and you let you guys take a peek at that I know you guys like the hash for him hmm good clear one before yeah really nice glistening juice the 160 and the 190 are like you know they're for bigger particulates realistically but when you watch whole plant it seems like there's more mature heads on there so there might be some big bulbous turkey heads that end up landing in there and I've seen some 190 melt like five six star same thing with 160 which is is rare if you're washing hash and trim I think I think whenever I do trim runs it seems like that 190 is a little green and the 160 is maybe a little bit lighter but same kind of texture when it comes to the the hash kind of gritty and you know fiber risk I mean you could already see this stuff I mean it is like see-through so yeah when people ask me hey am I gonna get a better yield with with nugs I generally just tell them no because you're not really you might get more six-star but not very much more it'll definitely beter beer and now that rosin is in the game it really is more no prevalent because if you take all that lower grade hash that you normally wouldn't smoke and you just rosin it up and it turns into six star or better I guess some people claim some people like to call it seven star or I've even heard somebody call their resin ten star which is kind of silly no again didn't really have too much terribly to talk about today I was going to put up another video instead but I hadn't done any of these cache reviews in a while and I got gifted this stuff I got some other stuff too I gotta ask him what the names are for it I he called it something but didn't write it on the thing so god the smell is just so cookies-and-cream if you guys have ever had the strain it's really like super cleaner a little bit of cookies in there but just heavy with with like a cleanness and if you've ever had any of exotic genetics crosses that Starfighter that starfighters creaminess definitely carries on you gotta go nailed it all right pack them a little bit extra on there probably would have taken this a two hits normally but I don't want to get it's the first thing in the morning I want to get a nice juicy one for yours so again thank you bubble modes really appreciate these type of gift this guy makes awesome hash I can't really say that enough one of the most humble guys I've ever met and he really started off just not knowing much at all about you know extracts and just cannabis in general and he's gone from like zero to a hundred in and just you know over a year and I'm just super super impressed with the product that he is churning out yeah look out for this guy dude this guy is killing the hash man for sure I always loved to see new products coming out of his corner they're definitely worth the time to check out the quick smoke on I think that's pretty much all I wanted to talk about if you guys have any questions or comments feel free to leave them down below I do not mind answering them I'll try to keep it positive though there's been a couple trolls hanging around you know basically just saying my hash is garbage which is kind of silly to me but everybody's entitled to their own opinion but to those people I really don't know why you stick around and watch my videos I I know I have to be long-winded and just unpleasant to watch if you're not enjoying the content so I would just maybe not watch the video if you don't like it just the suggestion though by all means come and spend 20 minutes to hate let's just take another look at this stuff I mean I wish I could shine a light through it for you guys it's super duper clear exciting alright cookies-and-cream whole plant fresh frozen Cheers oh man super Turkey Wow such a Perla just to even be sampling that but do you believe that this is the 90 you obviously the makers stash a lot of people don't get to try this bag and definitely that's where all the good stuff lives such a creamy flavor if you haven't had a chance to just try some of exotics genetics you know cookies and cream Kimbo Kush and I know he has a new dessert menu coming out for his seed line but the cookies & creme Kimbo coach are just so flavorful I know that he's been winning cups with that also look at the screen here is that not an insane melt I mean ah just straight juice but I definitely would call that six-star and I wouldn't enjoy getting more of that I would smoke that every day it's absolutely a pleasure mmm Lim cleanliness to start the morning I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll catch you next time", "9FFnQhc2sgk": "hello and welcome to today's webinar solvent list extraction explained profiting from rosin my name is Eric sandy and the digital editor of cannabis business times in this exclusive webinar pure pressures director of marketing Eric glass key will give you the tools strategies and key information on how to capitalize on the quickly growing solvent extraction segments of the cannabis market focus on actionable insights this webinar will cover solvent list concentrates across every aspect Eric will explain exactly what saltless concentrates are which eske use are the most popular how to cultivate or source material that yields well for Robins and how to attract customers to your brand just a few quick housekeeping notes before we begin you'll notice on your screening questions box please do feel free to type in your questions as the presentation is going on and I will relay them to Eric at the end and also know that if you have to leave any time we will be recording this presentation both the audio and video and emailing the full archive link to all registrants in a few days here so you will have access to to the whole presentation with that I'm very pleased to welcome today's presenter Eric Blackie thank you Eric appreciate the time in the intro and I also appreciate everyone who's tuned in right now this presentation was designed with you guys in mind and it's going to be really focused on educating everyone about what solvent list is and how you can incorporate it into your business profitably so to get started just going to do a quick intro here and go over what our agenda is so everyone gets an idea of what the cadence just like Eric just said my name also Eric I'm the director of marketing and now business development with peer pressure I joined in 2016 and I'm also the marketing and brand strategist for peer Cannell abs which is our sister consulting agency I've been working in the cannabis industry for just about there is now big passion for what's going on it's awesome to see the growth in the industry so today's agenda first I'm going to be talking about what is solvent list we're going to be going through kind of the layman's overview of solving Wisconsin traits and all concentrates just as they fit into the market in general so the point of this is we're going to be talking both to total beginners intermediate as well as people who have quite a bit of experience here so I believe that anyone who's tuning in no matter how much knowledge you have about concentrates or cannabis in general you'll be able to take some great insights away from this presentation then we're going to start talking about solvent with skews and some of the products that can be made solvent lessly as well as market data that supports where the market fit is what kinds of products these are as well as giving you guys some ideas about who are purchasing these products although some of that information is a little bit more anecdotal then we're going to be talking about material identification this is one of the biggest topics in solvent lists you know how do I get the right starting material to yield well to work well to make those super high-end concentrates then I'm going to wrap it all up with you know really the top key tips and ways to frame your thinking about how to be successful with solvent lists you know high-level points that you can take and implement immediately and then we're going to leave about 15 or 20 minutes at the end for Q&A so that I can make sure that I can get through as many of your guys questions as possible so with that being said the focus of this webinar is going to be on the THC side of cannabis in solvent lists I will be touching on CBD as well but just so everyone knows going into it CBD is going to be a little bit more of a footnote for this presentation so let's get started so what is solvent list there's a lot of terms out there but a solvent was cannabis concentrate is one that is made without any solvents so it's butane co2 or ethanol this extraction method is also known as mechanical separation now there's no governing body dictating which words people are using in the cannabis industry now it's still a bit of a Wild West situation and we're hoping that in the near future there will be a little bit more clarity around this but some people say that water for example is a solvent I would argue that it's not water in the solvent was processed for bubble hash or ice water hash which we'll get to soon you're separating the trichomes from the plant material and trying to keep them intact whereas if you're performing light hydro carbon co2 or other solvent based methods it's actually a process of dissolution so that's an important distinction here that solvent lists for the most part is getting a mechanical separation and then rosin which we're going to get into in a lot of detail here shortly is expressing and filtering those isolated trichome heads so solvent list fits in to the market as the craft beer of the concentrate world it is the high-end artisan level concentrate that the huge brand builder for any business that's processing or manufacturing cannabis products you want to think about this as the same kind of consumer that's interested in organic fruits and foods that's also going to be the type of person that's interested in solvent list because well to give it full credit with butane co2 and other methods you can purge the vast majority of those residual solvents you really can almost get to actual zero percent solvent or having a product that has never touched them in the first place the only way you can do that is with solvent list now another question that we get a lot is what does solvent 3 mean versus solvent list solvent free means that it doesn't contain any solvents when it reaches the customer but that it did contain solvents or solvents were used in the production of it so there's a whole subset of customers that will only buy solvents products and if you are not making a solvent list product of one variety whether it's a dab mobile concentrate an edible or a topical you're not even in their consideration set so that's why it's important to recognize that having us almost concentrate is an important part of any processing or manufacturing business plan so to move on to the next section some people who have been in the industry a long time are going to know all this already but for everyone who's tuning in who's a little bit new to the concentrate world or is really just getting their feet under them about what kinds of concentrates are out there I figured that it would be helpful to throw in this a fairly busy chart about where current concentrates in the cannabis industry fall so on the left side of the chart here you can see what we've got are the solvent list and of concentrates dry sift sometimes also known as Keith bubble hash also known as ice water hash and Robin and those three products of course are going to be what the vast majority of our focus is spent on today but it's also important to know what the solvent based concentrates are and to clear up something about distillate so that distillate can actually be made with solvents or without you can do terpene separations with steam that wouldn't constitute as using solvent and then you can also see at the bottom here all of the different textures and types of oils that these various extraction methods can make now this is the current state of these extraction methods but whatever one should keep in mind is that things are evolving very rapidly across the space innovation is happening as quickly as anyone can keep up with core solvent lists and solvent based so one thing that's not in this graph that people might be wondering is what about flour rosin that's a product I've heard about I've tried I've seen it that is not a separate process necessarily we just lump that into the general category of rosin so one thing that might stand out to people that aren't as familiar with the rosin process or maybe even familiar with the hydrocarbon process is that there is a significant amount of textures and different products which we'll get into a lot of detail on with making rosin you know a lot of people coming into this think well you know I I would like to make a dabble concentrate product it has a high price per gram I've heard you know there's a lot of brands out there that really made a name for themselves with this but what can I really do with rosin and the answer is with minimal post-processing you can come out with an enormous variety of different oil textures and resulting products so live rosin coming from fresh frozen material straight separated terpenes which can be used for all kinds of things a very popular product category right now diamonds also known as diamonds and sauce sauce meaning separated terpenes kind of the street word or the colloquial sense of that you can even make shatter wax butter sugar oil there's all kinds of different textures that can be made now there is some variability in your starting material so that's why we've got dry sift and bubble hash there on the left and that you typically have the most versatility with all of the different kinds of robins that you can make when you are starting with bubble hash and bubble hash really consist of just pure isolated trichome heads and the same goes for dry Civ again really going back just briefly to what mechanical separation means we're trying to isolate trichome heads get rid of the plant debris and plant material that we're capturing the pure essence of the plant the resin which is contained in those trichomes and then that gives you a lot of a lot more flexibility to create all kinds of other products now you'll see one product on here that hydrocarbon can make that rosin can't is crumble which is a popular texture but for the most part rosin is capable of creating just about every texture of oil Under the Sun both in high end a beable concentrate form as well as food grade form four topicals edibles and all kinds of things and then well co2 and ethanol are both extremely popular concentrate and processing methods the actual end resulting products are a little bit more limited now those can be used in all kinds of things as well but the whole point here is to just give everyone a sense of how much variety and how many different textures can be made and that textures are not confined to one processing method or another in virtually all cases so moving along this is going to be for a full disclaimer the only time in this entire presentation that you're going to see anything about the products that we sell or what we do peer pressure is an equipment manufacturer in the solvent with space and this is an overview of the general equipment that's needed to make these kinds of products so not doing sales we're not doing plugs but just wanted to give everyone that disclaimer while I explain the slide this is about the only time you're going to encounter this so for dry sift how it's made is with a sifting machine I've got an example here the green bros alchemist 420 that's got stainless steel screens that trim or flower is put in it's graded against those screens which shears the trichome heads off which are then collected and can be used for a variety of different purposes just like we were talking about all kinds of different boy close in like we'll get into different SKUs and product themselves now there's a little note there plus static cleanup typically if you're trying to make a very high-end dry sip product the keys coming out of your grinder isn't going to fit the bill you're going to need to do some additional static cleanup to be able to get as much of the debris out as possible so that you can have better isolated trichome heads now bubble hash this is the extraction method that we'll spend a little bit more talking time talking about today excuse me because of the versatility that I was mentioning in the last slide and it comes with a little bit more equipment to execute on properly you have to wash it you need a drain vessel that the ice water is being used to go in it's being filtered and then it's ultimately freeze-dried so whereas dry sip is a dry process with dry cured material either trim or flour or popcorn bubble hash or ice water hash is done with ice and water which the cold temperatures and the water and agitation help detach those trichome heads which are then filtered graded and dried and then at the end of all of this unless you're selling just a straight bubble hash product of which there's a couple varieties or a dry security product which again there's different grades and varieties it's all pressed on a Robin press so all of the textures that we were just talking about in the last slide that large kaleidoscope of different products that can come out of solvent list those are all made on one piece of equipment and that is a rousing press so or we get into some data and start talking about them skews I wanted to go over a couple of solvent list facts and myths these are some important points that we get asked about constantly and I'm sure people in the audience right now are already thinking about this or we're potentially already planning to ask these questions so is solvent list less potent than BHO or perhaps other concentrates and the testing answer is no it's not depending on the product coming out the other end with rosin you can get potency ranges anywhere from sixty to ninety nine percent and on that super high end that's a THCA isolate so you can actually isolate thb a with mechanical separation a little bit of a long word there chain of words but the potency is absolutely comparable depending on what the starting material is second thing does CBD play nice with solvent list short answer is sometimes we're not going to spend a lot of time talking about this but for all the people in the audience who are either hemp farmers or are using hemp and are interested in how solvent lists will work with your CBD product it absolutely can it really comes down to the starting quality of your CBD so if you've got field hemp to be perfectly honest with everyone here that tends to not work so well with salt processes if you've got boutique high-end grown CBD it tends to work a lot better the solvent less offer comparable yield this is another one of the biggest myths that we're constantly combating you know with high quality material and we'll talk in depth about this you're going to find that yields are extremely comparable or right up just on top of other popular processing methods such as hydro carbon co2 ethanol things like that now yield is a little bit of a tricky question because it depends so much on what your starting material is what you're trying to get out the other end and really what you're trying to accomplish and that where we've learned a lot over the last couple years in the solvent of space is that with a solvent was product you need to think about it by making your high-end if that's what you're shooting four and then multiple washes or multiple presses to get all of the remaining oil out so that you can have what is more considered a full yield so that you're getting you know using all parts of the Buffalo as it were and then lastly is solvent less expensive to produce so very short answer is no it's not solvent list tends to be significantly less expensive in terms of equipment regulatory needs than hydrocarbon co2 and other extraction methods not only is the equipment quite a bit cheaper objectively you're also going to find that you don't need a C one D one room in your state if that's required for hydrocarbon regulators tend to look a lot more favorably on solvent lists and are more likely to grant it in your lab because the safety aspect of it is not in question due to high pressure or flammable solvents so it tends to be if not the least expensive extraction method to get started with so now none of this would be complete without going through some important market data so first we're going to start with a bunch of data that we've pulled from the MJ biz 2019 Factbook I plug MJ business back book every seminar that I ever do we are not affiliated with MJ biz in any way but they have some of the best data in the entire industry now there's going to be slides throughout this presentation that reference data from headset and other places but for everyone who's tuned in the webinar now if you are interested in really really getting into the nitty-gritty with market data product data every kind of cannabis data that you could imagine the MJ biz back book is probably the best place to find it so again we received zero financial incentives plugging them we just really liked their data and for everyone who's here trying to learn things highly suggest checking them out it's a great source to learn so most of this data I believe was pulled before everything happened with Co vid 19 but with that being said we're still seeing many of these signs happening now and that it seems that people are extremely optimistic in the processing market and we're hearing that for many of our other industry partners as well so cannabis processors in the next 12 months their outlook is saying 92 percent are expecting a better outlook that's a lot that is a major majority and if you even include the 4 percent that's the same you're looking at a vast majority of cannabis processors expecting to encounter better conditions in the next 12 months now that's a little bit open-ended they didn't explain exactly what better means necessarily but that means that a lot of cannabis processors who are already in the space and doing this are optimistic about what's going to happen over the next year now processors that are planning to expand into new markets over the next 12 months 81 percent of them are so that is a pretty telling number that another key figure here is that the vast majority of cannabis processors are planning to expand their operation I struggle to think of any other industry where this kind of thing is happening processors are expanding they are feeling that things are looking good and then this last data point here on the slide it stands out a little bit because it doesn't seem to fit in with the others but wholesale cultivators are indicating that high quality is 40 excuse me 46 percent of wholesale cultivators are going for high-quality as the key differentiating factor for the products that they're selling now that's extremely important because high quality material is one of the key aspects to ensuring that you can create some of the high-end solvent 'less products that we spoke about earlier so it means that access to high-quality material is likely increasing for businesses either entering the space or for businesses that are not fully vertically integrated and have to source material from wholesale cultivators so organic at 23% is also great because organic material tends to be very very good with solvent list and then you see below that low cost grown sustainably terpene content value and other those are pretty minor you know high quality material and organic material seems to be what more wholesale cultivators are focusing on meaning that processors are going to have access to more material and better material hopefully now the next slide and this is the number two executive summary take away in the MJ biz 2019 fact book this is a little bit to take in so a lot of numbers a lot of words I'm going to try and walk everyone through this so that you can really take this nugget of wisdom away so gray unprofitable blue break-even green profitable pretty easy to understand that now this graph is telling us that the number of SKUs produced has a dramatic effect on reported profitability from the businesses that participate pated and answered the survey that mjp is put out to gather this data so that red box at the bottom what you're going to see is a massive increase in reported profitability for businesses that are having 11 to 15 different skews compared to 1 to 3 so if you're a processor and you're only making a handful of different products reported profitability is absolutely tiny whereas businesses that are producing multiple SKUs and again it seems at this time like the perfect range is around 11 to 15 83% of them are reporting profitability again it's hard to overstate how dramatic of a difference that actually is and even you're seeing businesses that produce 7 to 10 different unique products are reporting three three times as many of those businesses are reporting profitable or profitability over businesses that are doing 4 to 6 and then it's 16 plus you start seeing a little bit of a drop-off although it's still a strong increase over the businesses that are only producing tenfold and then at the top of this graph it's really showing that processors that offer products across multiple categories meaning hydrocarbon solvent lists ethanol different areas of extraction almost half of them report profitability so when you combine offering multiple products in different categories with different types of SKUs that's really where you hit the sweet spot of being able to come up with a balanced product line that addresses as many consumers needs in a dispensary as possible there's always going to be consumers that are looking for the cheapest gram of flour they can buy just like there's always concentrate customers that are only going to be looking for the highest end solvent list that's on the Shelf it's important for any business to produce multiple SKUs and to have SKUs across different categories so tying all of these thoughts together with the data that we just reviewed adding solvent list concentrate is one of if not the least expensive ways to add additional SKUs to your product lineup and is one and a set of SKUs that are highly sought after by connoisseurs and influencers so make sure that you are offering enough SKUs to really help give you the best shot at increasing your profitability and becoming profitable and hitting that break-even point if you have not already cool so now to spend some time shifting gears pretty completely going away from market data and giving some more explanations about what kind of popular solvent with SKUs are out there so there's a lot of text on this slide and on the next one I'm not going to read every single one word for word I would highly encourage anyone to go back to the recording and dig through this a little bit more if there are some parts of these SKUs that you're interested in learning a bit more about or simply asking the question here in the webinar and I'll answer those at the end the number one SKU that we're seeing sold in the market right now is ice hash water rosin this has a very high price per gram it's the top sold rosin product and it's a connoisseur grade concentrate that build brands and loyal buyers okay I read off the first one I can do that for all them the big thing about having solvent with products of virtually any variety is that they can win over influencers and brand builders that are going to talk about your products a lot more than some of the more entry-level less expensive products and we've got clients who where perhaps the vast majority of the revenue they generate is off of some of the more entry or budget-friendly concentrates or products but that they really have built their brand on the backs of their ice water hash rods in their bubble hash robin and directly to that hash robin based cartridges becoming extremely popular now takes quite a bit of an RD but these are the most expensive the most sought-after and at this current time a fairly rare product we're seeing those go from anywhere from fifty to eighty dollars a half gram and it really is the ultimate cannabis product for multiple consumers talking about sift there's of course dry sift rosin tends to retail for less than ice water - rosin but it has a lot of versatility with a lot of different grades and quality now solve them with edibles are another area that's really seeing tremendous growth right now and another opportunity that multiple businesses should be thinking about if they're not already the number three edibles in California according to headsets state by state sales database data is a solvable settable in the past it was the number one edible and that's a key book product so these edibles tend to retail for 20% more than standard edibles or more depending on the market and you can use a lower grade starting material to get a food grade oil to make it work additionally there's a couple more SKUs that we're going to talk about here solvent was topicals and bombs the number one through five topicals or bombs in california are made solvent lessly and they're all Papa and Barclays products they're 50 milliliter tincture that goes for about sixty six dollars I believe their products range from you know fifteen dollars but they do command a premium and they are a true full-spectrum quality product made with again solvent list food grade oil that's put into premium topicals now you've also got full melt ice water hash which is something that a lot of people who've been around the industry for a while will be familiar with and this is the ultimate product for connoisseurs this is pure isolated trichome heads that melt without leaving any residue now the actual sales volume for full melt ice water hash isn't terribly high but if you have high enough quality material to create it this is what wins over connoisseurs like no other the bottom left we've got flour rosin this is an entry level robin product more popular in certain markets and others typically less mature or less developed markets because it's such an easy way to get started you can literally just take a dried cured flour put it in a Robin press squish it out and you've got flour rosin it does tend to retail for less than hash and stiff problem however and then finally we've got hash you use pre rolls this is the number five pre roll in Colorado it's been as high as number one in the past I updated all of these numbers this morning just to make sure that I was providing accurate data for everyone but they also command a pretty hefty premium on how much they sell for typically these are pre rolls that are infused with bubble hash sometimes with sift or key to but as you everyone can see there is a lot of variety here in terms of what kinds of different SKUs that someone can make in order to be successful with solvent list so through these this is kind of scratching the surface because underneath topicals and bombs and edibles especially there are so many different varieties from tinker's bone gummies brownies I mean you name it if there's a product that you're particularly interested in that you love that your market loves can be made with solvent list that product can command a premium and that you can do it without having to throw down hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment purchasing okay now we're going to move on to some of the most important parts of this presentation and why I think a lot of people are tuning in in the first place which is to really understand how they can be successful with solvent lists and what they need to be looking for in the first place to do this so one thing before we jump into genetic selection that I just wanted to show everyone real fast as a EndNote on the versatility of rosin is that these eight products were all made from a single bubble hash string one of our consultants that we work with and since Alden was on instagram whoever is on Instagram I'd highly encourage you to follow him he does some of the best work in the industry he took one strain of bubble hash and set out to figure out how many different SKUs how many different products can I just make with bubble hash that are dabble concentrate this says nothing about cartridges or edibles or topicals you can see just a loan this is eight different textures that are being produced from one single strain of bubble hash all at very different you know levels of interest depending on the consumer so just really driving home the point that there's a lot more versatility with solvent list than a lot of people realize you so now how do I take solvent list and make it successful for my business and the most important thing to start with when you're going down this road and really trying to figure this out is how to understand trichome structure you can't just put any strain in with solvent list and have it be successful and the reason for that is because of the trichomes and the resin content because we're not dissolving the resin out of the plant material with the solvent and we're detaching it mechanically the actual size and shape of the trichome that the plant produces are absolutely critical to getting a yield that's going to be profitable for your business and for making a product that consumers are going to be excited about the one that's sitting on the shelf so in this slide and there's going to be two slides talking about trichomes here we see ABC those are all mid-range or below so AC e and F these are tiny you can see that you know 20 microns 50 microns 20 micron 10 10 these are very very very small try trichomes and when you're doing an ice-water hash filter process or a sip process typically the microns below 45 tend to be food grade and they're still very useful but they don't get captured nearly as well as the example D which is the capitate stock trichome that has a large glandular head full of resin a fairly large stock this is a very resinous trichome at the large size it's pretty much the ideal shape and type to process ultimately whether you're making bubble hash flour Robin stick rather than whatever it is so the cheapest way that you can figure this out without spending a ton of money on a microscope or another product is just to get a jeweler's loupe it's not going to have a micron rating on it but it will give you a much better idea of what type of trichomes you're dealing with I mean you could literally buy a cheap one for 10 or 15 dollars on eBay so really getting into your plant or your plant or the strain that you want to put through your solvents process and looking at it at the nearly microscopic level that is what's going to help you first determine if that strain is going to be viable for solvents or not additionally and I just came across this earlier this week and I've got to give credit where it's absolutely do which is to farm house to do genetics they're based in the northwest and this strange sugar coat which is pictured here with bred specifically super saltless now something that you're going to start hearing a lot more about is trichome detach ability because again saying is over and over we're talking about mechanical separation how well do your trichome neatly detach from the plant material so that they could be captured isolated and then processed so the perfect hash trichome has a thin neck a medium length stock and a large glandular head now I think farmhouse coined this term because I haven't heard anywhere else before this is the week next trichome which provides optimal detachment so if you see where the arrow is pointing look at how thin and narrow that little bridge is between the stock and the head that means with even very very gentle agitation that should detach easily and be able to be captured so there's a lot of genetic companies out there that are now breeding strains specifically for saltless which is often to see making it that much more viable and that much more profitable at the same time again it really comes down to understanding what your plants can do before you commit to large runs whereas with a solvent based extraction method you kind of just throw it in and run it and go from there with solvent lists you need to pay a lot more attention not only to the quality of your material but the types of trichomes that your material is actually making so you're probably asking okay this all looks good these trichome examples are really cool but what kinds of strains are we talking about here so I've got good news for you if you want to screenshot this please go ahead again this will be available in the recap that will be sent to everyone but I've come up with a nice healthy list of different strains that people can take advantage of and their own grows and start feeling hunting for now what's important to also understand is just because you go pick up a Ken dog off of one of many seed websites or from a friend that does not guarantee that that strain of Ken dog is going to have that trichome structure or the resin content by raw potency that's going to be a winner with solvent list these are strains however that we see our clients running constantly that we see mentioned on Instagram constantly and are a great place to start for anyone that's either struggling a little bit to get some strains that are really producing well for saltless or if they're before they're even getting started and you're vertically-integrated going to grow your own material these are ones that you can actually look into getting seeds getting cuts talking to people and starting with these you're you're going to see many of the best hash makers across the world are washing drying and pressing many of these strains crosses of these strains these are some of the most popular lineages in the entire cannabis space for solvent was processing now with that being said things are changing all the time there's always new genetics that are coming out and for those of you who are tuning in who are not vertically integrated meaning you're not cultivating your own product you don't have quite as much control over the supply chain of the cannabis that you happen to be processing it's really important to ask the wholesaler that you're buying your cannabis from that you intend to process has this material been washed do you have other customers who have watched this material is this going to be a strain that's going to play nice with solvents we never advise customers or people who are looking to get into solvent list to blindly go out by tens of pounds of fresh frozen hundreds and start washing it and hope for the best you really need to talk to whoever you're buying your cannabis from or whoever your grower is that's responsible for growing strength having a much better understanding of will this strain provides right trichome structure and have the right resin content so that I can be profitable with my solvent with processing methods so really doing a little bit more digging putting a bit more of the onus on the cultivator of the provider to help provide you with some strains and material and some solutions that will be successful for solvent processing so my favorite of all of this list right now is the Tropicana cookies by Oni Seco there are too many genetic companies to name that are excellent but there's so many good profiles and these are some of the top shelf screens just for flour in general that are now being refined into you know what are considered to be the best concentrates perhaps in the entire world and that sugar-coat strain that we were just showing with the weconnect trichome farmhouse genetics farmhouse studios you know excuse me told me that that strain and those seeds will be available pretty soon so I would definitely make sure to follow them on Instagram and get an idea of when those are dropping because we expect that those will sell out very quickly but hard to go wrong with starting with any of these ok so we're going to get into the end here and really wrap this all up for everyone now before we do the full wrap-up it's really important to understand what kind of space you're going to be operating in and for a lot of businesses and the question that we get constantly is how much space do I need to do all this this sounds great I want to make these products this equipment sounds good I've got good material or I know someone because how do I get my space going less than a thousand square feet is very common for saltless operations or divisions you would be surprised to see that some of the best concentrates in the solvent list world and in the world in general are being made in what almost look like closets and very small areas so that a lot of square footage is definitely not necessary unless you're trying to really scale up your operation and do very high volume now the scalability of solvent list is something that has changed a lot recently there's a lot of innovation happening and that this can scale well above that and you've got operations that are saying thousand square feet you know I've got 50,000 square feet to work with how can you help me there short answer is you don't need a lot to get started but as you scale of course you'll need a little bit more space to produce more proper force and ceiling height planning is also important you know getting started with this and this is something that we offer as a service as well is helping with floor plans but that really understanding how all of the pieces of equipment that you need to produce the products that you're trying to bring to market how do they fit into your lab how many of them do you need where do they go these are all very critical things to think about before you put pen to paper and because most regulators demand this information before you're even allowed to open up shop or make any changes anyway and then again wrapping that up developing a predetermined processing space flow will save you time and money and it can always be modified as you grow as you change as you make different products you're not set in stone on these things but just making a point that having some adequate planning ahead of time will really save a lot of headache and increase your profitability long dress now take everything that we just talked about here are the top four ways that your business can succeed with solemn list and the number one way is know your market and what it wants you know people on the west coast in California Colorado very mature market their appetite for 60 to $80 or more grams of hash rosin is a lot higher than it is on the East Coast at least in the illicit markets now what you're going to find is that every market in its stage of maturity or development is going to grow from extreme interest in just raw flour to more concentrates more products more flavor profiles so it's really important to understand you know what are dispensaries that you're trying to work with or already working with what are they saying what are they selling so before you go all-in on trying to get the holy grail of making a robin cartridge there are some steps along the way that you need to make and you want to make sure that your market is ready for that product and that you're going to be successful with it the second is the source or cultivate premium quality material for dabble products only that's the key here is that if you're trying to make a dabble concentrate the quality of your material is tantamount to success or failure out the other end for what you're trying to do make sure to test that material before you commit to a full batch processing you know just like we're talking about jeweler's loupe look at the trichome really understand what you're doing now if you're making a topical or an edible I'm not saying that you can use lower quality material you can you don't have to but that more of a food grade oil a trim anything along those lines can absolutely fit the bill for edibles assuming that of course it passes contamination testing because the solvent 'less process does not offer any sort of remediation the same way that your tain does for example so premium quality material for dab mobile products is absolutely critical additionally environmental controls really are the difference maker for true top-shelf solvents concentrates you know having a cold room when you're making bubble hash ensuring that your room is clean that you have a good process down these are all things that we've got numerous videos and blogs about that you can dig into the details on but environmental control is extremely important to really make those ultra high-end concentrates and then my last big piece of advice for everyone who's taken the time with me so far to get all the way here a be mindful of creating multiple products with your source material don't just make a bubble hash and then sell a full spectrum bubble hash make and pull so make and sell a full spectrum bubble hash and a food-grade you know topical or edible or take the extra leftovers and put it in a pre-roll there's so many different options to get your full yield and to make more money from your solvent products than just coming out with one thing or two things you've got a lot more options at your fingertips so check in see what people in your market are interested in what they're buying and then work from there so that wraps up the presentation I really appreciate everyone coming pretty much right on the dot 15 minutes for QA Eric if you want to start shooting some questions my way I'd be happy to start answering sounds great well thank you so much Eric that was really fantastic and very nicely detailed we do have a number of questions that have come in and I'll just remind it or when you'll see a questions box on your screen so please do type in your questions we've got about 15 minutes here Eric we've got a number of questions about about yield and trichome detach ability I'm going to try to sort of bake them into one question however however they'll probably a couple questions here really but how do you measure yield and how do you in terms of sourcing genetics how do you know what you're getting before taking out the jeweler's loupe and looking closely I guess some what should what should folks be looking for when trying to measure trichomes and trying to plan for yield yeah great question what it comes down to is this selection process that experienced processors have really refined over time you know coming into it as a newcomer where you don't have that ability it's almost a sixth sense where you can look at a bud or fresh frozen plan or a plan even before it's been cut down and say wow this is a very resinous strain it smells really good the blood structure is not super dense or super lar fee you know very light so you know for everyone who's tuned in that doesn't have the sixth sense of the master processor it's really important to know you know has this strain been grown before by this cultivator and what's it testing at if you've got more juice to squeeze you're gonna have a better shot at having a salt most product you know whereas if it's a very low potency strain there's just not as much resin there to expel to extract so that's the first component of it too and then having an honest conversation with your grower with the cultivator whoever is involved and just asking them questions you know do you have any experience excuse me with doing the solvent lessly either with your own business if they're legally allowed to process or do they have they talked to anyone else who's familiar with the strain that process it solvent what it's really a combination of you know using your spidey sense to say is this plant got enough resin to work with and does the person who's producing it have details about whether or not it's been processed solemnly before or do they think that it will process well solvent lessly and then I'm sure you've got a lot of questions about yield so should I just go directly into that or do you have one specifically that I should answer yeah one one question maybe just a frame the conversation about yield here is how can folks know that the yield is deriving from this extraction process is the greatest potential yield meaning how can they know they're not missing or missing out on the program the catch ability we're talking about yep another or another really important question and it's it's really hard to drill down and say that strain X I will get and reclaim 98 percent of the available trichome mass because of the budge structure versus strain Z which I can only expect to get 95 percent total reclamation or something like that but what it really comes down to is taking an experimentation process so if you're washing bubble hash you will wash two or three times until all you're getting anymore is basically just plant material and debris and then you said okay my trichomes are spent or if you're pressing hash or flower essence if Robin you know pressing those first couple bags multiple times to understand like where does where is the road end with this material one can I not get any more out of it and then backing into your math about what are your yields what was your cost to produce it or acquire it and then you know getting into your spreadsheet and trying to figure out did this strain make money for me or before committing to processing a whole bunch of it you know moving on to a different one we have a little story we're talking with a client of ours and they washed at Angie strain that they grew put it all out there boss program to produce that strain was about 135 dollars that was just their production cost and they said whoa you know I can't you know I'm not going to make any money on this so they only did a small test batch figured out the yield wasn't too good and now they just sell that strain either through hydrocarbon processing or is just whole flour it's very successful whereas for some of their other hash strains I think it might have been Tropicana cookies Alain but I was talking about you know their cost per gram to produce that was closer to eight to ten dollars or a little bit more of hash rousing because it made so much hash it had such a good yield that their production cost went way way down and that's one of the winners that they wash and produce and sell constantly so you know you have to take a little bit of a holistic approach but really trying to get as much out of whatever you're doing if possible and then working into the numbers to see if it makes sense yeah we have a couple questions here about just the different factors that go into these products and obviously we've talked a lot about source product and that the genetics that are going into solvent list products but what other factors can kind of folks influence whether that's temperature or pressure what other factors might go into this process and what are some quick tips to really improve those yeah so all along the solvent list processing chain you're going to have all kinds of variables assuming you know if you're either growing the material yourself starting there you know how is the material being grown is it indoor/outdoor there's almost too many variables to mention on the cultivation side of things so I'm going to focus my answer on attraction side which is where I know significantly more about and that's having high variable control is extremely important to be able to come out with a consistent product so that's something that we at peer-pressure really really focus on is having the most precise and replicatable you know variable control with the equipment that we make and sell so that being able to create a consistent product by controlling your time your temperature your pressure how hot or cold the room that you're working in is there's all these different data points that someone is going to want to understand so that they can compare one strain against another in the most scientific way possible in order to better understand you know is this a product that consumers want it's a product that we're producing consistently and is the end result something that we feel that we can replicate consistently so with the extraction process it really comes down to time pressure temperature for rosin and then with ice water hash its water temperature environmental temperature sift a little bit less variable control a little bit more post-processing cleanup so because we don't have a ton of time left here I would again encourage anyone who's interested in getting tips and tricks on pressing rods in on making ice water hatch I'm making sift anything in between our YouTube channel go peer pressure our blog which is on our website go peer pressure com we've got in-depth articles on all of these topics so I would highly encourage everyone to go check those out and do some reading some watching excellent yeah a few folks were asking about additional resources that's great um there could you speak to the impact of freezing the material before say a bubble hash process and whether that might yield better results yeah absolutely and this is a webinar that I gave trying to reach a very broad audience in the future I will give a webinar that's more intermediate and advanced solvent lists we didn't really touch on fresh frozen very much in this now fresh frozen is when you take cannabis and you D fan it take all families off and then you immediately freeze it now doing a fresh frozen product is what can create what's called a live product so you I'm sure you've heard of waif resin made with hydrocarbon or live rosin which is the ice water hash process that's then taking a material that's never been dried or cured so when you don't dry or cure your flour you d pan it and freeze it that tends to give a flavor profile and a terpene profile as well as changes in the cannabinoids because it hasn't been dried or cured that many consumers prefer over a dried and cured starting material for the concentrate now there's a lot of debate about this but for a business owner having fresh frozen material as your starter for bubble hash specifically is one of the smartest moves you can make because not only are you creating a product that the majority of dabble concentrate consumers are looking for anyway but also you don't need the infrastructure or the time to go ahead and dry and carefully cure your material which as many growers and people who have grown who tuned in understand is one of if not the most difficult parts of the entire cultivation process drying and curing your flower perfectly is and more than it is a science and that that can be very difficult to do so by having freezers and freezing your material to make a fresh frozen you are skipping that headache entirely you of course need freezers to store your material in but that the cold temperatures also actually increase trichome detach ability because they are more brittle so for multiple reasons both from a consumer standpoint a business ROI standpoint an equipment standpoint a space standpoint doing fresh frozen makes sense for most businesses excellent we have a question here if without access to specific screens at the moment could you talk about the idea of practicing or optimizing the process using lower quality strains that may have less optimal trichome structure and whether that will whether that practice will will really help the grower or whether that I'd be leading them down maybe an unhelpful ya know that that's a really good question um typically when someone or a business or a group of people are trying to get familiar with the solvent list process using material that they don't necessarily expect to process and then ride all the way home to the bank is a great way to really get your chops under you because you've got a lot more margin for error and you could really get the techniques down a lot better if the stakes aren't quite so high so I would say that you know lower quality starting material mid mid grade and below is actually a very important tool in the solvent was processors arsenal because it can a teach the team teacher extractors how to do all of this very well before your top shelf top cola buds are on the line to be processed perfectly and also a lot of the mid grade and below material is the perfect material to use for food grade oil there's definitely businesses out there that use their top shelf for their food grade as well but if you're not super confident that the material that you've got or that you're working with is going to make a light golden kind of blonde hash robin it's great idea to just turn it into a food grade oil and then put that in a topical or edible excellent we've got a few a few cost questions here and I realize we're bumping up against the hour but any we can end with this one in general terms can you describe the difference in say overhead costs associated with starting with dried or cured product versus fresh frozen product all the equipment that might go into that and how it grow or how a how a manufacturer might keep keep those costs in mind yeah absolutely so it's just tough one to answer because every business has many businesses very different objectives about what their weekly throughput should be what kinds of SKUs and products they're trying to make out the other end um what you're going to find is that with fresh frozen you don't need as much space to do the drying and tearing and you don't need quite as much environmental control in that specific area of your lab because you're filling freezers full but what that does mean is that you have to understand you know what is the electricity requirements for you know drying and curing your material versus running a bunch of freezers you know every business is different and electricity prices are different all over the country some places are off the grid and they're full solar and it's not really much of an issue for them but most businesses don't fall into that category so overhead wise it's hard for me and I'm hesitant to say that well if you do fresh fruit when it's going to be a lot cheaper for you I promise I know that I cannot make that promise because it depends on your area but the vast majority of our customers and we work with labs all across the world many of the biggest solvus processors across North America who make literally be best concentrates in the entire world mmm the vast majority of them are doing fresh frozen and turning that into bubble hash and then making a variety of products as you know maybe their flagship solvent let's concentrate so I apologize for whoever was asking that if that was an exactly to your answer you're looking for but please contact us we would love to help you better understand what this equipment would look like in your operation we take a very hands-on each customer is different approach we'd be happy to run you through an equipment list and show you what things look like that's no cost no obligation we'd be happy to talk you through your needs excellent well yes I would echo that and recommend everyone jot down the contact information here and I'll also remind everyone that a link to this presentation will be hitting your email inboxes very soon here and Eric and everyone at pure pressure I will not thank you for the presentation today this has been really fantastic and really insightful okay hey thank you for having us I really appreciate it and great job moderating thank you so much and once again everyone for attending thank you and have a fantastic day", "B5_REnwB-Jc": "hey guys Billy from oz investigated 231 Graham drive safe squish for you on the squishy and if that thing in focus would just click the packet in there and see the next 25 micro stainless steel check it and just letting it warm up a little bit nobody see some oil show it up in there we start in the stairs and you see it right in the middle that fill it up can you go when you're flicking drive sister bubble you also apply pressure very slowly especially if you're going on a low temperature we're at a hundred and eighty degrees here and I'm at just barely over a ton can you see the oil just running out here we go yeah what about 1 and 3/4 stones on the gay no blow outs in the back anything for doing good so sift we just tumbled a few minutes ago nice flow going here colors awesome stuff we can leave it a shattered oh butter up really nicely as well just clap some two times here check out Roger gotcha comm is here we just did my Swisher it is on sale right now for $19.99 99 through the end of May you have any questions or anything feel free to ask us a question through the contact section there it goes right to me with my trouble all this stuff [Music] oh yeah for those of you think you can't do you know production late on such a small machine I present you this video had four and a quarter tonnes now we're still getting a pretty consistent flow slowly keep going I'm on a five inch by three inch by one inch aim steel plant so 300 40 probably have a heat cartridge over here in the Senate Samus Aran support starfish presses are made in Ashford Oregon well it looks like it's really starting slow ups I'm gonna pool just package and maybe give it another squish by itself again but there you go 31 grams of dry sit on the Swisher thanks for watching", "DwfFsR_AE8s": "[Music] okay so today is tremors bonus day I'm going to be taking a bunch of trim and lar from a recent harvest and I'm going to be showing you how I go about making some simple safe solving this crisis if hash [Music] there's many different ways that go about taking care of your trim in life and this is simply just one of them and by no means of mine expert I'm just going to show you what I do in terms of sifting my trim and life to further extract the cannabinoids just to get as much as I can out of the plant with that being said I'm going to leave a link down below to a video with bubbleman and D for 20k going over the dry sipping process and in that one particular video they really do go over a lot of key points so I do recommend watching that video as well after you watch this video of course guys come on now when it comes to dry sipping trim lar for actual flowers dries in the name so make sure the material you're using is dry enough otherwise the trichomes they won't fall off the plant matter as easily now I'm using trim and lar from a recent harvest and after hang-drying the flowers for 10 old days I trimmed the flowers up and place them into jars for curing and I left all the trim and larf from the harvest on these screens to further dry I had it on the screens for over a week before placing into a freezer bag and storing the trim in the freezer for future use now on top of making sure the material is dry enough to dry sift also ensure your material is as cold as you can get it during the process of sifting the cold temperatures causes the trichomes to become brittle and more liable to break off the plant so it's best to store your material in the freezer right before getting ready to sift it try to set up your work area for sifting in a cold environment I'm using my basement and I live in Canada where it's currently minus 12 outside and my basement is sitting around twelve degrees Celsius or about 55 Fahrenheit if you happen to have a garage or perhaps a spot outside that is blocked off from the wind you may want to put on a jacket and take your sift area outside this way you can achieve the best yields from your trim [Music] now let's talk zip screens so each zip screen has a different mesh count which allows different size materials to pass through your top screens are classified as you're working screens and the top screen I'm using is the ninety lines per inch this is the main screen you're gonna be working all the material over it the trichomes will be breaking off and falling through to the next screen which is the hundred and ten lines per inch this screen is an important one because it's going to continue to allow the trichome heads to pass through while catching most contaminants which are going to be your decapitated stocks and pistol hairs the trichomes will fall on the screen or roll around until dropping through the screen while the contaminants toxin hairs land flat and gets stuck on top of the screen now this leaves us with the very bottom screen which is the 200 lines per inch this screen catches all of your trichomes it has a few purposes from being the final catch system of your trichome heads but is also used as a cleaning tool to further clean and purify your drive shaft heads of contaminants this is where you can take some farmers grade hash or Keith and further clean it down into pure heads there's multiple techniques to go about cleaning your dry state further from the carding technique to static dry sifting I'm gonna leave a link down below to a couple detailed videos on how to further clean your farmers great hasher Keith [Music] so the way I sent my tram in large is I like to do it in three separate runs the main difference between each run is going to be the time and the amount of agitation the material goes through the first run is going to be quick and it's going to produce the cleanest heads while the second and third runs are going to produce the most amount of heads but they will be dirtier and not as pure the first run through the screens very quick the material is simply being dropped onto the working screens and then picked back up off the screen and set aside for run to the main point of the first run is to collect the nicest and cleanest heads the longer the material is worked over the screens the more containers will fall through into your pile of clean ash so for the first run it's important to be quick and diligent and avoid being too rough and leaving the materials on the screen for too long [Music] now as I drop the material on the top screen the trichomes are going to be falling off and passing through and hitting the second screen and then rolling around until the finds will hold a pass through to the bottom screen so what I like to do is collect what's on the bottom screen already because it will be the cleanest pile of hash with minimum contaminants I will set this aside on a parchment and then bring back the second screen and I will just give the top of the screen a flick to cause the material to bounce this allows majority of there are many trichome heads to roll down to the bottom screen these are still very clean heads but because I'm flicking the screen more contaminants are gonna pass through which is why I like to collect them in separate piles keep in mind this is just what I do you very well could flick the second screen right away and just collect it all out ones and label all of that your first one the reason why I do with this waste because that first collection with the least amount of agitation is always going to be the most meltia sand cleanest heads that you can do and in the quickest form [Music] to prepare for the second run I just make sure the screens are clean because any condemned is left on those screens will block the trichomes from rolling down through the screens to the bottom so after every single run I will brush the screens down I also like to put the material back into the freezer too brittle up the trichomes usually a wait about a half-hour before starting the second run [Music] the second run is where I start to get rougher with the material on the working screens I will start to move around the material with my hands for about 10 to 15 seconds and typically for speed I move the material to the side of the screen and then grab another handful and drop it on the screen to repeat after a couple handfuls I will remove the material and place it into a bin for its third run and then continue on until the rest is finished [Music] now there's plenty of ways to go about dry sifting your material and you don't need to do a first second and third run personally I don't like to clean the hash so by doing a quick first in second run it allows me to collect a lot of trichome heads that require less cleaning the third run is where I spend the most time working the material and will end up with more farmer's grade hash that requires to be cleaned to further purify it from contaminants that's where the carding technique and things like static dry sifting come in handy they help further clean dirty hash from removing pistols and decapitated stocks [Music] oh that's good piping hot though last night I only ended up doing two runs just ran out of time it's gonna take way too long to do the third run and it was getting pretty damn late I am gonna do a third run probably like next week sometime I placed all the trim enlarged back into the freezer what we ended up with is like three point four grams of second run sift on the first run the quick run we ended up getting like the Eagles a gram so what I'm gonna do now is actually I want to press some of this the second run hash out into some rosin this is gonna be maybe my third time overall ever pressing hash out into some rosin I'm gonna do all of this wish me luck this is the very very first run and then this is also from the first run but that's after I added the screen a bit so probably a little bit more dirty than this stuff so we're gonna go ahead and take a dab of this and will it melt it probably will I mean I've good suspicion it will never timer Londa we're at a minute at a minute so this right here is a point four and probably gonna end up doing all of it let's go oh yeah she bubbled oh yeah that was super low ten in WoW is that tasty oh yeah you can see it evens these little dirty in there whoo that was nice okay guys well let's get set up the press some hash [Music] [Music] okay so first up we got a bag the hash now I've seen on Pedro's grow room he double bags his hash frozen I've seen him use a few variations I've seen him use 237 micron bags and I've seen him use a 25 micron bag with a 160 micron bag so no reason why I'm gonna go with this variation of double bagging so well let's get this stuff so I put the three point four grams of sift the second run sift into the 25 micron bag you know what I'm gonna do I think I'm gonna just pack this down a bit with my body weight and then so the 160 micron bag I don't know if I should have packed that down before or after look at that so there we go we got 3.4 grams of dry sift inside a 25 micron bag which is also double bagged inside a 160 micron bag these are from rosin evolution and I do have a coupon code down below along with a coupon code for the low temperature and press what you're about to see in two seconds so I think I need a pair of scissors just to trim this up and the way we go give me a second so that way we could just fold it a bit and get ready to press cool so the way I'm going to be pressing out this sift is using a directional flow method now it's very simple and what it just does is it presses all of the rosin of the front and it keeps it from going out the sides of that so you're going to basically cut this parchment to the correct size and there's a simple s just like that and then you fold in each side this is the way I do it very simple takes no time to set up and then you're good to go yeah because I'm pressing out some dry sift I turned down the low temp press down to 71 degree Celsius which I believe is about 160 degrees Fahrenheit and yeah anyways she's ready to go so let's press some rosin [Music] I'm at one minute right now [Music] I really don't know how much pressure to add I don't want to blow anything l things just gonna wait two minutes it's about now and I think we're good oh wow this looks four-way go and suck your blood that alone so that alone is 1.75 grams 1.77 grams and still got all this stuff on it and this looks definitely worthy of press pressing twice so okay guys that's this week's video I really hope you enjoyed it don't forget I'm not an expert when it comes to dry sifting you can actually grab farmer's hash and clean it down and there's multiple ways to do that so a few videos on that will be down below I'm also gonna link Pedro's grow rooms Instagram profile and YouTube channel down below as well as he presses a lot of hash rasen so if you guys are interested in learning more about that that's where I learned this double bag technique my phone just made a noise guys I'm not gonna redo it we're keeping it also don't forget that links to everything you see in this video there down below included the coupon code so if you're intrigued by anything check those out you want to help me out please just leave a like if you got a question or a comment just drop those down those helped so much and that's than that we're gonna see you next week for a video and I know I'm gonna go take me a dab of this hash resin peace out guys [Music]", "-t7wYRlkFVY": "yo what's good everybody jp here checking in respect my region.com back with episode two of a west coast youtube review featuring calya extracts rosin uh today's product we're gonna be reviewing the ice water extract it's a sun cake rosin your boy justin is back so we're gonna dive right in one dab each we'll talk about it two dabs four out of ten saying yeah yeah let's do it all right let's dive into at least some of the percentages real quick 68.5 on the thc 77.08 percent on the thca cbd 0.32 and cannabinoids total 77.08 so in terms of rosin is it the most potent rosin we've ever dabbed no it's not but no but sun cake right i have a feeling this is going to be cakey earthy piney maybe a little spicy hopefully yes yes and this is the i know the exact cross this is sunset sherbert crossed with ice cream cake something so right off the bat it's like an indica

right for sure this this definitely has a better color than the other one yeah right this just gives that look of like wow this is six star a grade what is the what's the um you check that out i mean i'll give you a little you know just so you can see it it doesn't say the uh the use the 70 or whatever yeah it should if this sticker might have uh oh it says it on the lid so you to 120 [Music] all right i'm excited man again i believe i've dabbed italia with you a couple times maybe two or three times at this point i i can't sit here and honestly say that i can name one strain or remember one and so at this point you know i'd really like to give these ones a fair shot and the attention that they deserve because i think you know calgary does get recommended as one of the best rosin brands in the state of california yeah when i go places so they definitely have the most exclusive drops uh it's something that's hard to acquire like it was hard to acquire that sweet and sour as well as this sun cake because uh it just sells out very quickly in the shops so now make sure you line it up this time there you go you see you see saw the first time it was showing you a lower number but once you get in the middle diameter of the banger gave you a proper reading all righty turf timer no octave no technology errors on this go we are doing it the right way all right also this is a highly educated quartz banger both of them are the same same thickness same everything so yeah this is the way the dad works on instagram italiax.com i like it i like it fresh frozen it says nothing but fresh frozen they're uh you know tell you that's why they call it it's ice water extract because it's coming from fresh frozen interesting interesting get your dad ready oh no [Music] you take dabs at whatever temperature you take that which is traditionally hot in my experience so we both have these turf timers set we both have these two timers set for 500 degrees okay once it hits 500 like to kind of let it sit till like 480 470 and then go in for the dab what is that that's usually how you get the nicest milk this is sun cake sunset sherbet times ice cream cake you dropped a video thank you sir you're gonna go no it's too hot still all right see i'm saying you take harder grabs harder sometimes when it's a little bit bigger you might you got to go like 20 degrees a little you know that's a nice milk i've been dabbing rosin since you were in diapers that's a nice melt yo look at that oh let me tell you it is delicious that [ __ ] is loud yo i do that [ __ ] [ __ ] smack me in the face oh wow mine still says 490 484 479 475 all right so in terms of the flavor that i'm getting sweet sweet pineness sweet sweet gassy earth and in terms of like the kind of high that i'm experiencing it's it's both energetic and relaxing in terms of the body height right it really does wash over your body and i had you saw me crack my back earlier before this episode oh my goodness wow this is wow took away all the aches that i had because i literally just had so much pain a second ago i had to roll on my back wow gone yo wow what do you think hit me with more than one word on this okay this is this is you know this is more than terpy this is like where you're like you're like trying to figure out like what is that is that vanilla frosting is that is that like a cookie you know but um ice cream cake and sunset sugar you said yeah that's delicious so super super i like the chirping profile if if this was a girl this would be my type um and i definitely go for this one over the sweet and sour because the sweet and sour was you know i think by the name is kind of like hybrid sweet and sour i like sweet this is some cake this is the crust it's it's a different kind of high at the end of the day this is ice cream cake gassy pine sweet gassiness i mean makes you want to go back for more like that we have a second dab to review it out of 10. well my i went like super low in my [ __ ] oh so you still have a second down today all right well [ __ ] okay pass me that torch really yeah you had to see that was the last little bit yeah and that tastes like i'm telling you i get that i get the really nice vanilla ice cream i still have the taste of it all right college yeah i still even need a vanilla ice cream on that side is this the first dab where you don't actually need a second dab or almost like sun cake they should have called this your angel was that angel cake they should have called this [ __ ] like heaven cake vanilla [ __ ] clouds it is sweet tiny gassy the nose on it is wonderful like as soon as you start like that's the word nutmeg i was like what smells that word that's that's not the side of this wow it's literally loud that's what i'm saying it hit when you smell it you're you're like your eyes squint yeah it's impressive i have a score of mine out of ten the second dab is not going to do it you know aside from human error [ __ ] it up so for me my score out of 10 is going to be 9.5 that would that's my score no no you told me what what genetics this is but it needs to say it on there yes and then i need the terpene information on there and that's the last two points for me the last half point point two five each i got you this is a problem that's a perfect product i would i want to dock them for the branding instead but repeatedly over and over people recommend kalyan as one of the best and so am i always at this point it doesn't matter the bartenders don't care that it looks like this they still think it's one of the best so i'm not going to take anything for that right 9.5 for me where you at i'm at 9.5 as well i'm at 9.5 as well i think uh wonderful i think yeah like really you hit it on the t with exactly what you said that if call it if you just provide that little bit of information so it would have been a 10 out of 10. like that yeah this is great you know and the packaging is not even that bright or like poppy but you know once you dip into it i mean you know what you're going to have a box like a cool acid wash box version of this but let's be real let's be real but it has to shout out to colleen because they the collabs they do are actually where they go crazy with the packaging this is actually a collab that's sweet and sour right that's the vesuvio gardens uh yeah yeah that's dope well big thank you guys you know calio you guys do a big shout out appreciate you guys checking in coming in hot at a 9.5 from both of us definitely go check out the sun cake rosin sweet and sour on the previous episode we'll see you guys in the next west coast video review respect my region justin curious love y'all peace", "mTsoEEmz7Rk": "hey guys today we're gonna talk to you about rosin not only are we gonna tell you what rosin is but we're gonna show you how to do it the right way so throw away those hair straighteners and let's get right into it rosin is a concentrate extracted from the cannabis plant using nothing more than heat and pressure the result a translucent sappy and sometimes shattered like product that is potent and flavorful enough to rival any of your favourite BHO products but what is the difference between rosin and other concentrates out there one word of solvents most concentrate extraction methods require the use of a solvent such as butane propane for co2 rosin however does not but how does the simplicity of heat and pressure transform cannabis into such an overwhelmingly great product the accumulation of trichomes trichomes are those small shiny bubbles that appear on marijuana believe it or not those microscopic bulbs actually contain most of the cannabis plants cannabinoids which provide most of the sense flavours and effects but can anyone easily make rosin themselves yes yes you can and will tell you how before you get started you will need a couple things a nug Smasher fresh flower micron extraction bags parchment paper and a dab tool grab everything you need aside from the canvas of course in a bundle at knucks master comm so now you're good to go let's jump straight into one very important factor starting product

I get started I went ahead and made some changes to this because I had the wire hanger go over the corners of this because the front plate like this broke off so I wasn't able to put a hanger through there but I did find a little tab on the back side that I could slide the hanger in front of it actually is removable but I need my players I don't really I don't think I have oh here we go but it comes out it's from the plate is removable so if this shorts out or anything I can change it easily just put some new plates on it all right so all right so I here I have just over a ground before you get started I always like to squish it through so it doesn't slide around when I'm pressing it so I'll just go ahead and before it's turned on it's not hot and the nice little talk like that might even just press these together [Applause] when I try and stick it these together and then I'm gonna turn this off after all right so what I have here is just some parchment paper make sure it's parchment paper and that wax paper all right so I got you squished together let me see what a good there we go nice and frosty all right so you want to make sure you got all the debris off of the parchment paper that'll be in your roster what I'm going to do is I'm going to put it on this side and then I'm going to probably squeeze it squish it about 2:1 once the two more times turn this on first I'll let it warm up and I will get back to you guys when it's warmed up all right guys I'm back and it's all heated up we're good to go so I just put that right there in the middle close to the edge and I want to put it all the way at the edge because I want to get you guys a shot of it through the side seeing all those good juices fall out so I wanted to do just realize I made a left-handed vise grip press all right so get it in there push it towards the back yeah let me see if I can focus into that all right you just keep pressing you hear some sizzling might that go on for a little bit you actually can see someone coming out right there it's bubbling all right and then release that was a good one and as you can see right there this works just as good as the real deal and I can probably squish this about once more looks like I got a lot of it so I'll go ahead and do that are you guys here I'm gonna do another close-up of the Rosen oops snapped this one's a little longer it's gonna sizzle and then you're gonna see some coming out on the edges squeeze a little bit more and then release there's really no timing for this I mean pretty much the school by ear line as you go if you haven't done this before all right so I'm gonna throw this in the freezer real quick and then I'll just try to get it all stuck together then I'll show you guys once it's a hardened alright I'm back again and I'll just show you this real quick a little close-up on this the Nugget that I pressed you can see some oil this is gonna be left behind you know can't really help that it's just a little bit though this is not completely done though you can actually probably press this one more time and after it's brown and decarboxylated you'll be able to you can just pretty much eat this like a chip grind it up put it in some coffee I mean look at a lake at least a little high depending on how much you ingest cannabis so I did go ahead and I threw this in the freezer for about 30 seconds and the dial on hot plates was about at a 10 to 15 so about half way you can see that this is a nice golden color this is right here is the first one and you can see how just [ __ ] gorgeous this is it is a bit warming a show it is still kind of gooey but I threw it in the freezer so I could hurt it a little bit when I scrape it this down here is the second round not bad at all for just over your grand all right so I am gonna scrape this and I will get back to you guys so in order to make this easier for you guys what you're gonna want to do is put a little bit of water and a baggie freeze it and then put the parchment paper on top of that baggie and start scraping it's going to make it a whole lot easier it's going to come up with ease thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed it and

jar [Music] earth is [ __ ] cold and her alright so I would like you yet in my day did you imagine dabbing that whole thing just like here we feel [ __ ] half the Banger ease and the easily I wouldn't even try it it'd be a waste and a half that's good enough for me enjoy that for the week [Music] the 160 press was man very little in there so that's what that looks like when I end up putting it in the jar and then a lot of people would ask me how did you get that [ __ ] rossington to stick to the bottom of the jar look so neat [Music] here's I take the glove and you're just going to push it down around the edges towards the center you're doing a cold room that's good rosin a clean glove and just like that now it looks like that [Music] with that's hard to see but yeah that's how that comes out when you end up doing that push it down it comes out real nice and clean looking perfect for grams or so it's upload a bird [Music] all right so I gotta move my dad station over now I'm not pressing it back over here well I like it Kiyo is : grab yeah you can do with parchment - I have a little bit more control with the glove I feel like and it rarely gets sticky but parchment works to a

pictures of the plants I haven't even posted to Instagram yet pausing to share them with you guys real quick [Music] [Music] turn down the lights already this whole side is just [ __ ] Mileena should be up here these ones dried back a little bit too much almost too much but not too two months still prosti of [ __ ] 12 cars black out there my Spade going over there [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's the current status in the Guardian you know just like oh my flesh for usually you're about seven days it's that but you know [Music] I had issues this run just like Ross Leafs his issues because he's in cocoa they're harder to detect early and so he faced the consequences of the buffering that cal-mag provides in coma cocoa I wasn't in at nursery iam so I was able to turn my issues around a little bit faster but you know basically what I'm saying is you know I had issues this run and the crop is still coming out pretty good so next run you know those issues will be corrected I'll make a video covering the issues that I ran into this grow and how I plan to correct them and I'll throw it up on the patreon hopefully you guys can learn from some of my mistakes you know I talked about on the show doing your own research and shape one of the things I researched if I should have used top-down broward rivers and when I talked to mango tech Abadi he told me to use two gallons per hours to avoid clog and that's what each use is but then I ended up getting water channeling that is too fast on the float and I cost a lot of issues I never really fed high enough of an ECE to have the easy build up nor did I ever push the plants that hard to cause them to have any lockouts it was all because my irrigation was wrong from the get-go with the water swim [Music] are you taking off right now that's one of the changes I'm implementing is not only am I going to get rid of the 2 gallon per hour but I'm going to go all the way down to like a point 3 gallon per hour dripper that could eat drawstring and stuff up here so yeah that'll fix a lot of issues right off to that that I believe uh Charles and pastor [Music] that Daffy got me hired balls rolling in on me now [Music] oh my bad I look here looking up and showers my phone [Music] there's no broad my issues going on in here all it is is either a they were different cuts or they were microclimates right he talked about the water channeling so you know phosphorus deficiency can learn to purpling stems and the plants that express themselves differently also has purple stems where I was the ones that didn't have the red bugs didn't have purple stems so I think it was more of a microclimate issue water channeling issue causing different uptake different nutrients and it just got exacerbated due to the lockout because of the water channeling so next one I'm doing is with wedding cake and I should be getting those clones in about two weeks so I have about two weeks to prep get the plants chopped harvested and everything I'll flip them right in the room that they're in right now I'm basically going to push the tables to one side of the room and then I'll go in and use a light rail for this up against the wall and I'll cut down on the one plant out of time and hang it on a trellis hanging from the ceiling and then I'll just hang all the plants from one light all right [Music] when my moustache hairs on the know it wouldn't happen I got trim my mustache geez so yeah basically just go one light at a time right down hole lights worth of plants hang them go to the next one cut those down hang out on a different trailer that's there the next one so I'll have three trellis nets hanging on the side of the room I'll have to retry this netting on that side of the room so after I cut down the whole left side of the room and those plants are hanging up there on that left side I'm going to disassemble the tables and walk them out of the room and then I can push that whole other table completely over to the middle of the room hang up all those buttons on the back side of the room or wherever in the room right and then basically I'll be good to go I'll get everything hung I'll turn off the shaker fan I'll just keep one of them on probably maybe turn it down to low or something and I'll just have to DEET you and AC going in there I'll be able to scrub down the you the four by twelve that's in there now scrub it down and get it reset and start making my adjustments to the room while I wait on my new 4 by 12 American Girl products they're probably they told me it was going to be issued early June like June 8th or 6 but they might be able to get it in sooner so I mean worst case scenario the room will be down for about three weeks while I wait on the new table but I'll just match all the plants on one table while I'm doing that perfect and then when I get my new table in I'll be able to go ahead and transition the plants over throw up my trellis mats and pretty much switch so you know that's the plan and like I said I'll document all the changes to the room it said of everything that I'd be like want to document the changes and yeah my keeper fee no cuts from honest genetics should be here in the next two to three weeks and solved a whole room full of wedding cake in there veg and flour that while I have a child my keeper he knows from our genetics and my new keeper you know caked up cherries wedding cake crossed with cherry something f3 I'm going to do the three-tiered setup but I'm waiting on him to send me the updated invoice for the new poles and as soon as I get those I'll be able to set it up and I'll have pretty much what I was thinking of doing them what happened to rekey poofy nose and I could basically put all of them on their own tier if I wanted and then have clones next to it or I could just put all the moms on one and then since I'm doing two tables at a time I'll just pick you know I'll have two tiers for clothes you know cherry cookies have three thank you thank you thank you I never remember like my keeper he knows from honest I don't remember what I was are either blue hurricane 27 crossed with white sunrise for the blue lion keeper and then scarlet sure is chocolate frosting crossed with something I think [Music] I trust my man on his genetics he tells me yo this is a [ __ ] you should run for a hash let's fire fire fire legs all right now you got it [Music] like I remembered it enough to purchase it and you know that's all that matters now that's all that matters now I need to show up in the garden [Music] so stoked I have I'll have the blue Hawaiian which is gonna have exotic super crazy unique blue Terps it's gonna be highly sativa dominant as far as the high goes and then the truck not the truck cherry but the cakes of cherries that's gonna be my cherry Fino right there so I'll have a blue of a cherry and then I have the gassy out of scarlet shirt so it's gonna be dope [Music] this is real the kind of light that I use for clowns are right behind either the raging raging kales and I actually got sponsored by science LED yeah so I will be getting now raging candle LEDs probably twice a year during two biggest ways that I do and it couldn't be [ __ ] dope it can really know and then every other month or so I'll be giving away a bunch of science LED swag hats ashtrays shirts things like that all be put on there grower spotlight on their homepage pretty shortly here I have some pictures that I have to take for them and type up some some information and what else asked me to leave to help them do research spectrum tuning and hash production so I'll be doing that so and then also the big thing I'll be an authorized reseller for their lights on my webpage as soon as it's up in a few days so as soon as the page is up I'm going to try and get them on there and I'll be able to resell a life through my page so that way you know they don't do they don't do coupon codes like people in the industry you got to use to coupon codes because of for flex and all that but what that does is it makes it so that you can't sell that product in brick-and-mortar stores anymore and in the hydro industry almost need brick-and-mortar stores still surprisingly to you know expand and survive because still a big commercial facilities go through these hydro stores and you know direct to these manufacturers a lot so they don't do coupon codes they're like let's say they offer a 10% discount code here in California right and somebody purchases a light from you know from me and using my promo code but they're in Oregon or something and or somewhere else where they maybe don't charge sales tax and now not only are they getting the 10% off but they're also getting like seven or eight maybe taking even up to 10% off of that because of no sales tax right whereas if they were to purchase it in the store you know the store would be able to make a profit but in order to compete with that price that they would get you know from using the coupon code the brick-and-mortar store would basically have to not turn a profit so it doesn't work out for them to be able to give people who coupon codes stacked as representatives of the brand so instead I'll be able to be a reseller and then just a very very small portion of the profit that they would make from that light will go towards me instead so I'll be an authorized reseller and then basically helping do research and you know passing that information you guys like I have been this whole time so anyways this is what we're working with they bought this is delicious delicious it's called cookie dough and it's amazing [Music] I don't suspect this is gonna last long you won't need a code to let them know who sent you because you're gonna go through my website to purchase they're working on other programs like referral codes and things like that but [Music] yeah I guess I should keep this on camera so people don't think that I'm like lying and I say I got a grandfather drive here we did well today it's real I wouldn't had a couple more but honestly you guys want to get jars of the grape Cosby and literally all I have left of this [Music] that's it but in this drawer it's maybe maybe seven grams six seven grams of the grape Cosby I think the other jars been scraped empty already yeah scraped empty great cause be gone on that one and then the hell a Koosh cake [Music] there's like maybe two to three grams to scrape out of here [Music] and this one I think is scraped completely empty yeah there's maybe like point two in here it's empty so there was 70 72 grams of the La Push cake and 60 grams of the Cosby [Music] but every time you come in here you [ __ ] promotin be real oh no no no who was it last time it wasn't beaver oh it was your boy the other one that's not good Bernhard that's who it was last time [Music] about your ass sorry yo for real alright here's the funny story that's how you guys are quick so the reason this one got called rape Cosby because [Music] my wife and I dabbed it and she got so [ __ ] high off of it it was like she got roofied like straight roofie I could have done anything I wanted to so I was like mother kali shake great cosby it tastes like grapes and knocks you the [ __ ] out like you did this it was between grape Cosby and roofie colada you know think of work 12 but you guys got to make sure you do it right [Music] it's great cause be like that lowercase G Capital are [Music] all right let's get [Music] a little credit given to me I need a label hood [Music] it's not for grams but whatever [Music] you know [Music] so we're gonna get some cookie dough on there a menace [Music] they push tape on there [Music] [Music] [Music] me up a man popular science [Music] my episode 5 right there alone [Music] [Music] there was a five [Music] [ __ ] bones knock out maybe this is episode [Music] all right hold on okay [Music] but right now it is [Music] but few days that idiot that ain't the one all right well [ __ ] it I'll get it uploaded I was trying to do it right now but I'm having a little bit of a hard time finding a you write for [Music] oh here it is [Music] [Music] that's not it either I have like a lot of different files in here that I have to go through [Music] that's three lighting maybe this is the right here number four [Music] okay yeah here it is and as this little my everybody [Music] alright I'll go ahead and get this uploaded to YouTube right you know [Music] I'm kind of done editing these I'm just gonna start uploading the RAW files and if people don't like it they can kiss my ass I don't have time to edit them together anymore that's why I put the PowerPoint how I did you know if I do the PowerPoint I don't have to worry about putting an intro and all that into the video it's just boom okay boss [Music] alright crap dude my science for plant nutrition are a cool description I'll edit that later now don't care playlist crafted science done no it's not made for kids don't have to restrict [Music] monetization please do [Music] public [Music] boom what is instant premiere oh [ __ ] we could watch it together at the same [ __ ] time let's [ __ ] do that right now I did not know we could do that that is really cool we can watch the video together yeah three minutes five all right it's 321 I'm gonna go in at 3:45 and help the wife for the day because that's the way it is [Music] I find on finishing of the loose jars oh that's the one section of illustrator [Music] this is it makes a great Cosby and Kush cake [Music] I don't know what I did mother two minutes [Music] okay a little poison for 30 minutes okay no accident since a wait okay I'll be in by say like 3:45 okay okay [Music] 59 seconds left [Music] very good dogs very good slowly giving them a little bit more freedom and hoping that they don't [ __ ] pee anywhere [Music] green jeans with Superdome [Music] Greenjeans was sooo Oberto 11 seconds 8 seconds that's called your video will premiere what's uploading and processing finished as well as the hundred percent uploaded is 95 percent process I have no idea how this is going to look for you guys I don't know how this works I've never done this before it is [ __ ] top-down so we're gonna check it out oh my god dollars people my DM right now [Music] all right you guys let me know what happens on your end when this is done hopefully I mean it doesn't take forever right now it's an remember you two processes videos one definition at a time so the low definition stuff is going to process and then like for whatever and then 720 and 1080 [Music] my phone right now it's just doing the load F [ __ ] the standard definition version we'll see whatever the [ __ ] back [Music] I'm really curious to see what this does though man that was such a good [ __ ] good [ __ ] episode and then episode 5 I'm glad we took a break because we were really [ __ ] burned out both of us and we needed a skip a week we came back and we didn't even have a PowerPoint or anything but it was still an amazing discussion Garrett jumped online from science at levy and he just [ __ ] to talk about what we wanted to talk about which was great just you know [Music] we just talked about troubleshooting it was [ __ ] awesome you know he get his perspective on things like walking into like a huge commercial facility and how you would troubleshoot their [ __ ] to figure out what's going on why certain part of the crop might not be doing its good versus another part things like that so it was really cool to get his perspective because you know as far as lost leaf goes he's a commercial facility but he's a one-man army and it's a small commercial facility it's the size of a house basically a one-story house and so and that's that's no diss whatsoever [ __ ] it's amazing what he's doing I wish I could be at his level but in the realm of commercial grows it's relatively small so you know his perspective is one and then Maya the home grower is another and then Gary brings a whole different perspective being that he's kind of more on the large large scale commercial and so it was really cool you know and go with it so unfortunately during this whole Cove 8:19 thing all of the HD recordings for webinars are being limited and only being allowed standard definition so this is not going to be best of qualities for the uploads that are going on right now from the webinars and there's nothing that we can do about that so you know [Music] check it on the patreon real quick make sure you guys got your post real quick [Music] are you guys waiting on me to take another dab is that what's going on [Music] I guess [Music] it's not what you guys I feel like a little [ __ ] a dab [ __ ] for you guys it's all you guys wanna take your dad show me his plan it's never hey SB Andy how's your day go what'd you do today need some help no I'm just [ __ ] one shot I already forgot what this one is again that's the coach tasted positive and he's more paper towels real quick cuz my house got so high I forgot to clean the [ __ ] banger after the last job that's [ __ ] I I guess I Cosby myself whoever said don't cause be yourself I can't be myself go clean it out real easy paper towels to clean [Laughter] [Music] yeah all of the rapidly science episodes go on patreon pretty much the same day or minimum a week earlier than YouTube a minimum and Matt doesn't post on lost leaf as a poster or anything like that out of respect for my patreon supporters he knows he waits again he's a week two to three weeks even suppose I mean it's not that I don't want the information out there for everybody but I wanted to I want to give some [ __ ] love to the people on patreon and economic access all that and they can pick my brain talk about it on live sessions or whatever brain different [ __ ] you know [Music] all right the tip of my II now is 395 and I need to grab another roll of paper towels real quick [Music] [Music] damn [ __ ] oh yeah [Music] oh [ __ ] [Music] in the filter [Music] oh Jesus son 525 that is a very very high [ __ ] gasps Jesus [Music] [Music] so the reclaim catcher works by basically a when you draw on the dab it gets stuck down here because all that reclaimed can't travel back up pretty much so what you end up with really is just tiny tiny pieces of the vapor that condensed back to rosin in here versus a shit-ton of replaying and if you have a really good deep-dish banger and you do low temp doubts your your reclaim actually can look really nice how well that looks but [Music] seeing us a thing FPV not everybody's email setup is the same not all coils are created equal so you got to get you know a good coil setup with this I can go three eighty and still get clouds [Music] you need some sort of cloud [Music] all right [Music] my emails from 7-10 coils and you have promo codes with them but up go my man go in the house [Music] did I even bring the [ __ ] Paper Towns yeah I did oh yeah okay don't really need to take another dad titanium holy [ __ ] [ __ ] son if you don't swap that over some glass you can get like a full email kit for around in 250 years [Music] [ __ ] [ __ ] that olive oil will get you bro oh alright you [ __ ] I'd have been dying for this dad for some reason or she dies or more yeah I got ahold of the giveaway winner and he commented all over my YouTube video and everything that following morning Jesus sweet baby Jesus my nose is already like crying thinking about these Turks [Music] Oh titanium is not 2008 oh my gosh bro oh [ __ ] that's funny I've already got throat tickle mmm take him to any dab my throats already got that little scorch to it oh but I'm a man up and finishing [Music] [Music] [Music] we [Music] that's how you beast down and down right there [Music] fire [Music] [Laughter] [Music] I'll have a lot of patience going back up there to deal with kids right now oh yeah [Music] cruising today today is flying by I feel like I woke up two hours ago [ __ ] took five dives I blinked and boom it's already about four here had to clean that tonight [Music] just blowing our play too much [Music] the function on Agentry is crazy [Music] so FPV ahead I wasn't enough cloud for you where are these jars just ridiculous [Music] [Music] [Music] well can't even open it with one hand [Music] you're saying horrible with the [ __ ] up-close [Music] so so good [Music] this lighting is any different was natural lighting appear it's that cookie dough [Music] all right you guys [Music] I'll catch you guys on the next one I'm gonna call it a night I had a bunch of other [ __ ] I gotta get around to these", "ylc16phLqDE": "i mean this right here is some live rosin bro this is really what you want to do what's good everyone it's haikai as you can see we're at the dispo right now pick up some fire and i'll show you guys what we get when we get back all right we just got back from the dispensary we picked up some real nice stuff for sure she was expensive but um definitely like i'm just gonna say now this is honestly worth it to me um we picked up some rosin and rosin right now is going pretty crazy it's a solving this extract it's like the top-tier extracts in my opinion like because it's solventless and there's no butane or anything extra added into it it's just literally using heat to get the extract from flash flooding flower or regular cured flower it's some fire bro i've only tried it once before and that was literally last night that's why i wanted to make a video about it i picked up and i want to go back today and get some more and bro that [ __ ] was i did one dab of it i only take i only took one down because i wanted to save more for the video but dude just one like it just hit so much different like i can't even describe how like how much different it hits your chest and like your head it just like feels because the the high doesn't even feel like groggy like you would from a distal high like when you get high from just slit you just get like i guess high and then you just like want to go lay down and just like i don't know want to [ __ ] off for a bit but if you take a dab of some like real live browsing bro that should just like i don't know it just makes you feel so much more uplifted and good like it gives you the actual like i don't know feeling of high like it re it really gave me like flash faster like when i first started smoking because like right now my tolerance is pretty high since i've been smoking like every day for like a while now so dab of rosin is just like up here compared to like some shatters just like all the way down here this is completely different experience in my opinion at least solving this is definitely the way to go we picked up three different types of roses actually and we're going to get into like the different types of rosins you can get we got some aged cured rosin we have some live rosin and then we also have a full spectrum rosin yeah it's going to be dope video for sure because like this [ __ ] smacks bro uh we're gonna get some cool we'll get some cool milk shots and everything you know the vibes but yeah first let's get into the aged cured rosin from the well it's a hybrid one gram of solventless cannabis extracts that's what you like seeing um get a little shot of the back as well and as you can see it says whoops it's age cured rosin as you can see um which train is it uh melon rings and yeah on the inside it gives like a little uh biography of why i like solving this extracts are really the way to go so we at lowell love concentrates but we don't love the chemical solvents used to create low quality extracts we also know that cannabis is far more than complex in thc alone and that's stripping out the rich and complex variety of cannabinoids and terpenes found in the plant undermines the whole plant cannabis experience our artisans worked tirelessly to perfect an extraction method encompassing the whole plant using pressure and time instead of solvents and volatile extraction we knew with the cold pressing of cannabis which preserves all the natural properties we can finally create concentrates worthy of the well named alaskan fire bro um this is just some regular age cured rosin it's a bit different from regular live rosin this can be full spectrum anything can be full spectrum uh it can either be full spectrum or live i'm not sure if it's live or full spectrum because age cured is referred to um the process after that and the carrying process usually involves rosin being collected in a suitable jar heated and then treated with some variation of hot or cold temperatures and then stored in a stored in the jar for a few weeks or longer and then if done well can result result in some jam that can be like some of the most flavorful important and potent uh concentrates imaginable and that's what this is exactly and yeah dude this should definitely smacks like no other bro like i can't wait to get some more of this because it really isn't that expensive like i was saying um hq rosin is from the well i think that's like one of their it's like specialties i guess because i don't really see any other age gear rather for anywhere else but yeah there's just gonna be some fire bro we'll take a globber of this um let's get this shop set up [ __ ] globber boys [Music] smoke down smoked out positive squad protect dj smokey at all costs [Music] [Music] all right bro that [ __ ] just smacks so different i i can't even describe it like i'm i'm just like so much [ __ ] iron than i was before i i i like i didn't i've been all right yeah i haven't smoked like at all really today i've like to rip the card maybe once or twice but bro this [ __ ] just smacks me so differently than just like a regular like live resin dab or something like that like this [ __ ] just makes my whole body feel so different but in a good way just you could really taste the full flavor profiling and all the chirps in them and that dab it just tastes so good dude whoa i forgot which string that was i think it was like melon rings like you could really just taste that [ __ ] it tasted so amazing i can't wait to take some more uh take some more [ __ ] globs of that bro it's some fire like seriously this it was really worth it and i think the melon rings honestly wasn't even that expensive either like that for a gram was i think i think 45 or something and that's really like that's pretty cheap in my opinion for some rosin and it was it's still pretty good quality and like you can get some live resin or diamonds for about the same amount and this is solventless and i would honestly rather prefer this and it hits like so much so much better dude i can't even like i'm not over exaggerating or anything because like i'd be smoking every day and like and i'll be smoking some like like i think in the last video like it was like some purple punch like it'll give me high and it made me feel pretty good but it doesn't give me that like full body high like this is giving me right now and this is like it's just smacking for real but um yeah let's get into the next thing the which is this full spectrum hashtag so what basically what a full spectrum extract is is about preserving the natural ratios of compounds within cannabis while removing the impurities that can compromise the full experience and then full spectrum exercise can also be called whole plant extract just because it keeps all the properties of the flower it doesn't remove any of it but however because heat is involved in this uh solvent extraction method compared to like a regular um full spectrum extract with uh like bho or co2 however since this is a salt in this extract and the only extraction method is like through heat basically um it is a concern that full spectrum extracts going solventless um can lose some terpenes if it isn't done right and some other profiles of cannabis but if it's a well-known company not some like boof they know what they're doing for the most part and like have it down to its science really but yeah that's basically the difference between full spectrum and live ones originally coming from a dry flower and then the other one's coming from a flash flowers and flower which is live resin we just dabbed on with some cured aid frozen i accidentally got that mixed up with uh with this the full spectrum live rosin so everything i just talked about i was referring to this which is a full spectrum like i was saying like you get the full profiling of the flower and everything from full spectrum compared to my bras and you get my rods and you only get like parts of it because it does remove some um profiles we'll get into this full spectrum now i pretty much explained everything about the difference between full spectrum and uh live resin but yeah this [ __ ] looks fire as [ __ ] as well um i'll read the little things they have um this is from honey butter this is their brand uh the last brand was the wells like it's cool how like you can tell the difference about the brands that really care and i feel like these like saltiness extract brands because like there's so much more work goes into it i feel like um they really care about their products and stuff and you can tell like they have like a whole last thing it shows you like what temperatures you should be taking your dabs out of stuff and like if you have a puffco or i think the other thing is the aura or email it even says with temperatures to take it out and that's really [ __ ] helpful like no other thing does that and like it says you should be taking them at low temps and like low temps is definitely the way dude you can really taste the chirps at low temp and it's the move and then mainly it says thank you for choosing to support craft cannabis our family business small farmers of uh meniscento county from the soil to oil every step of our process performed with love and intent of delivering the best experience for you down to the last dab we are incredibly grateful to share our patient we are incredibly grateful to share our passion for this amazing plan with you thank you kindly the honey butter team and then message us anytime we're always here to chat honey butter rosin dot co so yeah this is that honey runner rosin this shit's fire bro i haven't even tried it i can't even say it's fire but it sounds fire it's peanut butter cup bro it's crazy i'm allergic to peanut butter so uh bro imagine this like gives me an allergic reaction i've never even like had peanut butter so i wonder it's gonna give me the taste but yeah this is that um this is that full spectrum rosin and like i was saying full spectrum rosin does come from dried plants not um fresh frozen plants so that's why it does look a bit different it also could be different press as well from the live resin but yeah it still looks fire as [ __ ] and smells it smells like it's gonna be super tasty um like dude the other the melanie smelled super good too but yeah we'll take a nice uh nice glob of this too i'm already [ __ ] hiding and i'm working like an hour so hopefully i can get this video finished [Music] check [Music] so that peanut butter cup um that was pretty fire too as well and that was the cheapest out of all of them there's only like 38 dollars before tax that's really not too bad for grandma rosin um but i can understand why it is the cheapest it definitely felt like the quality it wasn't as like refined as maybe the cured age rosin and i just felt like like i said i mean like in the name said this just feels more cured and like they like the feeling of that one more i feel but this definitely gave me a good uh full body high more in the head i felt like yeah but this for sure with some fire bro and again it's solving this and if you can get some cell phones the same price as um some bho or um other [ __ ] like that i don't understand why you wouldn't cop some solvent list because it's like honestly like better for you in the long run i felt like personally and yeah it's honestly it's just really some fire it's worth the extra couple bucks in my opinion and then right now we'll get into like the most expensive one which is the live rosin that i got bro that's just some fire i i can't even describe it that's definitely my favorite one i think it's just some um banana korean premium live rosin it's a banana oj um mixed with a creme brulee so it's a hybrid this is definitely the most expensive one at 85 before tax and which isn't even like too expensive for rosin because there's there's jams there that are like 110 120. i mean that might be a little taxed just because of the hype i feel like right now but like 80 80 to 90 is what you're usually going to pay for raws and like i feel like no matter what unless it's like i don't know for at least for some live rosin and like bro this just smacks differently so any products that are like immediately frozen like after they're harvested or called like live so that's why this is called live rosin it's referring to the flower that was immediately frozen once it was harvested and basically what live resin is is a solventless hash oil made with full milk bubble hash that was made with freshly frozen materials and as you guys saw in like my other video i was um smoking some full melt bubble hash it was no it wasn't full mount bubble hatch because i wasn't able to dab it if it says full melt you are able to dab it but if it's bubble hash um just regular bubble hatch you can't dab that it will like it just won't burn correct but you can put it on top of bullets or inside joints but yeah that's basically just like all trichomes and then you go from that to uh you basically take the water hash and that gets pressed and then that's what becomes a live rosin and that's basically what this is bro i'm gonna open this up now no time to waste bro just some fire um yeah it doesn't even have like a long description like the other boxes though all it says on the top is flavor as nature intended in a smaller batches let's fire around i mean this right here is some live rosin bro this is really what you want to be smoking if you can some fire bro um just take a bobber of this [Music] [Music] like i was saying that should just hit way different than like all of them honestly don't get me wrong it's not like the most insane high ever i just feel like it's like maybe the cleanest high that i've ever gotten from at least the the papa select this is the most expensive rosin that um that i picked up it was the live rosin and like it tastes great and everything but i feel like the chirps like aren't really there compared to the aged cured rosin and then the i think this was the full spectrum rosin this is definitely worth it and it gives you the i felt like it gave me the cleanest high it was 85 before tax which is pretty expensive for one gram if you want to know you're smoking like the best [ __ ] possible you can definitely be getting this um these two as well any type of solvent this extract is honestly gonna be so much better than any bho or a co2 extract which is like um like shatters and stuff you can for sure always still get good batters and i'm like still going to get that of course because they're always going to be cheap and everything but like that means solving this is just honestly like superior just like it's just a step above it's honestly really worth the money i don't understand the hype now but like out of all three of these i'd say that the cured age rosin was my favorite and it was only 45 dollars for the gram and like this should super tasty bro like you could really taste the chirps on it i'm gonna take another glove of this before i go and yeah that's gonna pretty much be the end of the video uh thanks guys for watching if you can try out some solving this extracts bro definitely try if you can uh definitely worth the money if you've ever been thinking about it like comment subscribe i'll see you guys next week", "eWwPWBO5TJE": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the canvas small EA I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis extract reviews it's so awesome that cannabis has been legalized in Canada and now we're able to have these new product categories like essential oils extracts all those great things that we've been waiting for with legalization 2.0 but luckily enough everybody in Canada has been able to grow their own for cannabis plants since October 17 2018 and it's totally legal to share with your friends and so I'm lucky to know few great rosin and hash makers now before we dive any deeper into that what is rosin rosin is the process of excreting an essential oil from cannabis using heat and pressure so under heated platen you squeeze cannabis and excrete its oil you could do that with hash as well in a more refined matter and these are ways that we've now developed a hierarchy of the quality of rosin and different names that are associated with them from flour rosin hash rosin and live rosin we'll dig into all those things later so today we have some wonderful hash frozen a full spectrum hash rosin I believe and this is from the Tom Cruise of rosin absolutely fantastic product here and what do we have ice cream cake number four an ice cream cake I believe is coming to us from seed junkie genetics and it is a cross of wedding cake at gelato 33 so now you with their back crosses you get a bunch of different cookies and mints in there I believe July through three has triangle mints or the wedding cake story and then there's some sunset sherbert in there some pink cookies bunch of different things that all add up to those great California strains that have put a lot of companies on the map so that's our ice cream cake number four hash rosin you can see in the bottom it just looks creamy and delicious I think this is handsome heat cure going on inside of it let's crack into it and see how it looks and see how it tastes mmm fantastic just punch it in your face right away doesn't that look awesome see it's wet and Turkey mmm looks so good on the nose it is just a gas bomb creamy rubber gas confectionary like cookie dough oh it smells almost like Neapolitan ice cream the vanilla the chocolate the strawberry ooh so so good so much gasps so much creaminess going on absolutely great genetics and so as a shout-out to the grower this is just incredibly smelling so bright and so fresh and excited which is crazy too because this isn't a live rosin this is a cured hash rosin or a dead rosin because the plant isn't alive Wow and then I get lavender I get fresh lavender and and like sweet chemicals and that rubber and that gas and that fruitiness and that creaminess mmm smells just delicious delicious I can't wait to taste this mmm the smell is actually making my mouth water that's how creamy and fragrant and overall yummy this is I don't have a better word for it so an extract like this you know there's there's not more that you much more that you can get off the nose off the appearance from the that just looks so cool before I dig into it sorry creamy delicious let's have ourselves a dab shall we oh and it's just bada in there it's it felt creamy when I moved it will take a video of me really playing in it because it's gonna be delicious I'm sure that is popping up in the corner wherever right now probably this one that one I don't ever remember but here's our nice fat dab of this delicious gassy ice cream cake so I think everything goes back to a cut of OG the end of the day when I think about those lineages it's all just good fee knows of a G crossed over and cross over I got my puff coke peak we're set to the green setting and which is the medium low and I have a quartz insert inside of here for the best flavor and let's give this delicious ice-cream cake up Huff thanks so much for watching while you're here make sure to subscribe whoo it was a big dab we can fire it up holy surfer coughing everybody it's a lot of gas there's a lot of gasps creepy cookie dough petrol skunk ginger under ripe strawberry hmm it is so good and massive clouds of vapor - that was excellent absolutely no taste of what you might assume uh if you tried rosen's before great Roslin should have no taste of plant matter of any sort but should taste like all those amazing smells no we smelt it first and this one definitely does this has a great balance of complexity that's balance between the aroma and the palate it's unique its strong continues its flavor I would definitely be excited to puff more and more and more of this so absolutely fantastic great job Tom Cruise of rosin great job to the grower I apologize that I don't remember who the grower was I may have got that information somewhere but I forget so if I can remember that I'm gonna put a little shut up to the grower down here because none of this could be possible without the grower at the end of the day it's fantastic browsin

your results are going to be and the fresher it is the better the clarity as material tends to age it's gonna oxidize and you're gonna find that that rosin is gonna come out darker so if you're looking to make the best flower rods and you possibly can get stellar material and press it as soon after its dried and cured as possible tip number two relative humidity makes a huge difference with flower rosin now you can go check out our other video where we did the full in-depth test but what you need to know is that your flower should be at least at 55 to 62% humidity before you press it this makes a massive difference in your yield so just make sure that your material is properly hydrated before you press it tip number three choose your temperature based on your desired results so we encourage a lot of experimentation and you're gonna find that most people are either pressing on the lower temperature range which is about 160 to 190 degrees Fahrenheit or the higher temperature range which is anything from 190 to as high as 250 degrees so depending on what kind of consistency you want to achieve that's where you're gonna set your temperature on the lower range you're gonna be looking at more of a butter on the higher range more of an oil or a shatter so when you have some material that you're playing around with we encourage you to try both ends of the spectrum and see which one you like the most tip number 4 choose the right micron bag type now you can absolutely press flower outside of a bag and get great results but that's usually only a gram or two you're gonna want to press in a 90 or 115 micron bag or at the most 150 we recommend not going any lower than 90 because that's when you're gonna see a huge drop-off in yield so if you're pressing flour in a bag make sure to stick in that range and finally tip number five if you're looking to make the highest quality flour on possible you absolutely don't need to overdo it on the pressure now you can definitely over press your flour rosin by applying way too much force at your bag and in fact we've seen great results not only with yield but of course with quality pressing at the lower end of the pressure range anything from around 550 to 1600 psi at the bag so when you're applying way too much pressure in the many thousands what can often happen is that you're pushing out plant fats lipids you know the waxes as well as all of those undesirable plant materials into the rosin really over pressing it so if you're looking for the highest quality rosin we recommend trying the lower pressure range and seeing your results thanks for watching we hope that you found that was helpful for more tips and tricks make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel and follow us on social media at Goa

you guys can see by that little intro man I got a bunch of goodies right here man and I thought I was just gonna smoke this by myself this weekend but why not make a video for you guys and let you guys know I think it's gonna be a review slash smoke sesh that's just vibing out man so right here guys I got some 710 labs live rosin some bootylicious number one it's tier two I just picked this up as you guys can see right here mint fresh super super super fresh might have already been taking add a bit too out of it but that doesn't matter because we got something else right here guys 710 lives of their 8th right here this is called oh gee KB and man I have heard nothing but good things from like their products man they the fact that 710 labs takes so much pride into the products that they all they do is just put in hard work and the results speak for themselves man they got people talking all over Instagram YouTube Twitter like I'm talking about like everywhere that I go everyone asked me as I have you tried seven ten have you tried seven ten and I've tried their hash rasen but I have not tried their what their Weed Man so I'm very very excited to get into this but for before we get into this man I have to give a big shout-out to today's sponsor man gothic comm where they sell bracelets pendants and rings super sick ass rings man well you can go buy some for your friends girlfriend whatever the case is man and you could use my own personal code savvy G to get a discount percentage of well I'll put everything down in the description below man go show them some support because a support of today's video guys alright honestly we're like I said I was ready to be smoking on both of these guys they both cost me around this one right here was $80 this one right here with $70 so a total of 150 it is a pretty hefty price to paint but you know if you want to smoke it you got to pay the price so we're gonna save this for the second part of the video we're gonna roll up a nice joint with that but first since I do have my rig right here MJ Arsenal and my torch all the goodies right here I think the only thing we can do is take it out all right so I'm already have been dabbing it so I'm bushed shut you guys in there it might be missing some so this right here guys is what I have currently right now and it's honestly some of the turkeys like 710 miles has to be some of the turkeys but I mean wax that I have ever smelled man like the the Terps in this thing is just so amazing and I kid you not man stabbing on Psalm endless like wax is just so freakin good man thinking about doing is heating this up for 30 about 30 to 35 seconds and then waiting about 45 seconds to 50 seconds I feel like that gives it the best the taste and it's not very harsh smoke yet you get very very milky clouds so let's go ahead and torch this thing up boys cheers i heated it up to 35 seconds I'm gonna go ahead and let it go till 45 just because I had you have the window open man and I'm gonna go ahead and meanwhile though let's go ahead and choose a nice little chunky one just to start things off boys because honestly I have I've only dabbed it once today and I feel like man this one's gonna catch me because I'm telling you the hatch frozen is so smooth that you only really feel it when it starts building up in your chest man so we're about during your second day and still got another ten and yeah let me know in the comments below if you've ever tried 7-10 labs man if you have make sure to hit that like button on this video and if you haven't we'll hit that like button anyways cheers boys oh dude that tastes so freakin good I already look at the depths what's already coming in that was the perfect dab I kid you not watch this I love waiting all right the reason I love waiting that much time it's because you just get the smoothest hits the milk is hits and then the Terps now I'm tick I'm talking about I can taste everything in this I can taste everything man it's phenomenal and after you're done your your nail should look like this man you should still see oil in there and man there's seven ten laps definitely definitely worth that's the $80 that I paid man I would I want to buy the Percy that one right there is $100 I believe or $90 so if you guys want to see a video on the percy live rosin let me know in the comments below like this video and subscribe so auntie dad dad got me super high and I just remember that we also have to smoke another joint so I'm probably gonna step aside from the dabbing and we're gonna go ahead and crack this open man this oh gee Kb your see you guys see how fresh it is man I have not opened it brand new look well you can see the seal right there man this is gonna be the first time guys that I have ever seen this flower in person and I'm kind of excited already it's like a little glimpse right there so let me go ahead and pop this sucker out oh dude oh now just follow my computer oh dude it's as beautiful as the oh oh my goodness dude yo I know my camera is not gonna you know pick up every single watch I'm gonna have to use my phone for this guy's but this but right here you guys know the phone camera picks up every single trichome everything that's why we use the phone and look look at this guy's just look at this you guys are gonna be in all all right so this is the og KB right here look at this dude the beautiful orange hairs I'm talking about look at the trichomes look at the purple little stems think you know oh my gosh the curation on this dude is just so phenomenal I haven't even smelt it what does it smell like I have never saw anything like this smells like me but it's just a different type of legal officer dude this is like literally one of the most aya peeling pieces of bud that I have ever seen and now it's just a fact so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna roll this up I don't know how much help I roll it up but dude this thing is just so phenomenal looking I don't even know if I want to break it apart but I just want to just put this in a casing and just put it in a corner of my room do you never touch it so this thing looks so phenomenal I'm gonna like I said I'm a roll up a joint and I'll see you guys in a little bit right here we got the joint right here man it's honestly I rolled there I've been getting so much better at rolling these freaking joints so all we got to do now man is pretty much just burn off the paperboys and basically here you go here you have it your perfect little or joint now I want to say there's like 1.5 in here man but does it really matter though because I just want to know how good this is man I want to know if it's worth the money because this this 8 was more expensive than a cookie so he hasn't gonna be the first one to find out boys choose only through the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal statement choose wood hmm after that personation I did get a little bit of some a little bit of paper tape so [Music] whoo it's actually pretty freakin smooth man so far so far I do i I did roll these in some raw hemp papers organic hemp so there might be another reason why but honestly so far it's burning a really really smooth I am getting a lot of earthiness from this plant itself and it's giving off a little bit of a sweet tone but honestly it tastes very very very good like it's something like I know we did we'd look I know we do sweet guys but you can tell the difference from something that is properly cultivated to some [ __ ] that you know that that is make that is being made in mass amounts and things like that like these guys they take so much pride because it's small batch all the time they never they never overdo the batches man because they want to make sure that every single planet that they grow is growing to a hundred percent perfection on their own terms you know but so far man I haven't I'll any clips of this this it's burning very very smooth like I'm telling you let me give you guys a little close-up of pilots burning right I rolled it really really good it's burning even all the way through you got the little tip right there if you ask them to see that and it's an enjoyable smoke man it's currently 10 o'clock in the morning and usually whenever this is the first time I'm smoking also unusually whenever I smoke first my eye like I started coffee or [ __ ] to him whenever it's the first work of a bit but this is smooth like I was saying and it tastes very piney earthy but it's enjoyable as heck I don't taste any really fruitiness flavors of it no I taste a little bit of sweetness but it's not overpowering this thing is chiefing though it's obviously getting me super super baby I ended up waiting a little bit after taking the dabs and then just I mean I rolled out the joint while I was high a [ __ ] and then I roll I waited a little bit more that way I could get the full effects because I didn't want to go from being a super stone because that was a super fat that that I just took I don't want to go from being super stoned to you know getting even more stunning I even being able to differentiate the type of high that I'm getting in the flavor because my mouth was dry as heck I kid you not that dad got me so tight but I was brick and faded for it for a minute I'm not gonna lie I have not been that faded in such a long time and it's such a good feeling now and then they finished chugging milk for sure all boys that looks like we're at had a lighter fluid on our centers [Music] this thing is McEnroe I hope you guys like the new location I mean I'm just in my garage and I hope you guys not like the current location man I was gonna do it in my car but I was like man for a special day like this my mind let's just do it somewhere where you know you guys can see all the smoke around me not the same setting give you guys some a little something different I just in used to Macanese well I'm about to finish this whole joint to the face but not on camera because that would literally turn my videos so freakin long all right guys so my review for this ogk be it's about its max I'm high right now like super faded and it's such a different height such a soothing high but usually with wheat it's either I don't get high or I get like you know too high to the point where I don't even enjoy the high because my head's hurting but this right here yeah but this one right here is honestly just hitting like every single aspect bro like I'm sure I know I know for a fact after I'm done with this I'm probably I'm probably gonna have a better good morning you know I'm already have me good morning gonna go better and EMA like like I would say though I would definitely would not mind dropping another 150 hundred 60 on some 17 laps again like because there I'm telling you they're rosin smack nice it was just the perfect gap the turf through there the taste is there that I was there everything about it was so good and I feel like usually I don't get that feeling with other concentrates you know with other flower so yeah man I would definitely purchase this again time though I do want to try the Persie rosin you know want to try I'm not even sure what kind of strain this was it was like an indica or sativa guessing it's either hinder guard hybrid so next time I want to try just a straight-up indica and see how much that smacks me because I feel like if this give this is smack at me right now I can only imagine what a straight up in meter with you so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and hand out the video here because I'm high as a hack right now I just want to enjoy the rest of this man hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video and you know and if you did go ahead and leave a like comment and most importantly hit your boat with that subscribe button and reach so let's try to get 400 K subs I mean 40 K subs boys that's the next call right and you guys are gonna help me do that guys so I hope you guys have a blessed day and we're out", "N3vDm9HXWOU": "welcome back to turkey eyes in today's episode we're going to be pressing one ounce of fresh frozen full plan ice water hash we get big yields using the directional flow method as well as show you how I butter the rosin after being pressed [Music] let's go over the items we're going to be using during this week's episode we're going to need parchment paper any brand will do I always go with the unbleached version pressing bags I ordered these online in a custom size to fit my pressing plates perfectly allowing me to maximize the amount that can be pressed at a single time as for micron science I go with the 37 micron because I mainly deal with ice water hash or teeth if you're going to be pressing flour but with ninety micron and I always remember to double bag your product a couple Dobb tools and a set of tweezers lastly obviously the material I'll be pressing you already know from the title we're going to be doing a single press of one ounce the material I'll be pressing is fresh frozen ice water hash this was from one of my previous grows it's a blend of green crack barber bud and Harley Quinn bx4 this is also material that's been freeze-dried I'll be doing a video shortly covering how I made the ice water hash and using my freeze dryer so be sure to hit that subscribe button you can notified when that gets posted as you can see the material is getting pretty sticky once it comes out of the fridge making it very difficult to talk the pressing baked properly [Music] using one of my job tools I packed though ice-water house down into the bag as evenly as possible my hand I give it a good pre-press evening out the material as best as I can at this point the ice water hash has already become warm and it's very sticky not allowing it to be moved around much in the bag [Music] for today's press we're going to be utilizing the directional flow method a benefit of using it is that it allows you to watch the flow during the press you can see the flow from start to finish allowing you to adjust the variables accordingly this becomes very helpful at all stages as you're about to see I forgot to double bag my material which resulted in my bag being unfolded squishing out the ice water hash out the one end this became noticeable immediately allowing me to stop the press right away unfortunately I forgot to record me collecting the material and just putting a second bag over the other [Music] [Music] I stopped the first pressed short not noticing the flow of the rosin still happening [Music] I then folded the pressing bag in half and did a second press giving additional amount of yield [Music] letting the freshly pressed live hash rasa sit for a few minutes allow it to cool carving the rosin eyelet cooler temperature helps with a collection of it using a long-handled dab tool makes the collection of the rosin very easy since the second press was very short I'm going to collect all the rosin together after collecting it all into one patty I like to put it into a glass jar it's process butters the rosin to texture I find more appealing [Music] I simply put the glass shard in between the two plates with the lid tightly screwed on and let it sit for about one hour at 150 degrees Fahrenheit then I open the jar stir the rose and whip it around mix it up place it back in between the plates I had a hundred degrees Fahrenheit for ten hours after the ten hours I collect the rosin out of the jar and place it into a storage container if you enjoyed this video

kind of respond to some of the questions that I've been getting in the comment section some of the comments as well we're not necessarily questions they're trying to tell me different ways to do things so I'm not opposed to taking advice only a fool would be but I am opposed to taking advice from people who are just talking but don't do if you don't actively press rosin don't tell me [ __ ] about how to do it because you don't know how to [ __ ] do it yourself I actually do it one of the comments that I had was that on one of my videos where I left a pre pressed puck inside the plates for too long while I was trying to prepare the camera so he did the material up a lot and when it came out it was a little bit darker than normal so a lot of people like to comment on that one and a lot of people are you know one person told me use less less pressure because you get more plant material in your end product and just let the heat lose it all out well that time [Music] Oh [Music] whoa whoa all right I'm still not over being sick completely sober all right so that's what I was saying um that's Bob that's backwards straight-up backwards you want more pressure less key you're not going to get more plant material in your product by using more pressure that's just not how it works the rosin bags that I use are 160 micron there from rosin evolution and they work perfect with my pre-press but you guys have to remember that when you're pressing out rosin the filtration bag excuse me those bags are not for filtration actually they're guesswork [ __ ] look they're just for containment so when you have that puck of flour and you go to press it it wants to expand and as it expands it will reach outside of those pressing plates and then you're not pressing that material anymore right so what the bags do is they don't filter to keep the plant material inside they just they keep it so that the plant material doesn't expand too far out because you could press nugs without any bags and still get all the oil without even collecting plant material the plant material only stays right along the very edge of the Google oil so again those bags aren't for filtering anything they're just for containment and make it a little bit easier what else pressing temperatures so temperatures - depending on your material you're gonna start as low as 180 and go anywhere up to like - 30 to 40 the fresher the material is the less heat that you need to use also the less time you need to press it if material is not the right humidity you're gonna have to press it for longer and you're not gonna get as good of a yield usually 60 to 70 percent relative humidity for your but it's good to start with and I'll usually press it fresh material like starting around 185 190 and if I'm not getting the yield I want but I'm getting the quality then I'll increase the the temperature by about 10 degrees until I start seeing the yield that I want now when you increase the temperature got to remember it's like a it's like a sliding scale right and right where they cross those two lines cross that's the perfect like settings right temperature time pressure so what you're trying to do is you're trying to get to keep high enough to make all of the oil lose out without degrading the actual material right so it's heat that degrades it not pressure so ideally you want as much pressure as possible without blowing out your bags right or breaking your parchment with as little heat as possible necessary to facilitate the flow of oil out of the material usually that ends up being around a thousand psi on your plates so for example my plates are 22 square inches right now to hit a thousand psi you know you're gonna have to get up there around like 13 14 tonnes because you take the max pressure that you're putting out so let's say you're putting out 10 tons that's 20,000 about 20,000 pounds of pressure now you divide that by the surface area of your plates which for me is 22 right and so I end up needing to be somewhere around like what is it I think like 15,000 psi or 15 tonnes will give me about a thousand psi so do the math on your own the base of yes the max pressure you want to get to and then you just change your temperature based on that so the higher the temperature the faster your product will start to flow right now this is where it starts getting tricky and it's a sliding scales because your temperatures too high you degrade your product but if it's too low then it has to sit in there and between those heated plates were too long even though it's a lower temperature it has to sit in there too long in order to start flowing and get the final yield so now you end up with the degrading product so like I said it's a sliding scale you want to have a high enough temperature so that you don't have to press too long but you don't want to have it too high to where it's degrading the product and then your pressure you're just going to keep ramping up the pressure until you don't get any more yield out of it so that ends up being like like I said fresh material 180 to 190 and about two and a half to three minutes for fresh stuff and then for older stuff it's usually I go a little bit higher and press rike around 210 or so for about three or four minutes but it also depends on the type of rosin that you want so a lot of people would see this and be like oh man that looks like like a big bunch of doodoo but this is your super Turkey stuff that's been pressed out at about 180 185 so you're gonna get more of the oily sheen on there right you're gonna get a lot of Terps and it comes out more like a sauce and this is cured this has been cured for about two weeks now and so this is just super super stable and this is really [ __ ] bomb but a lot of people don't like material that looks like this and keep in mind this would be super golden if I were to thin this out but a lot of people want like ghost rosin which is the stuff that is so clear you can almost see through it but people are into the purple rosin now there's a lot of trends but you can't let the color dictate everything because it's not just about the color right because of this stuff fresh bud pressed out at 180 there's a little bit darker and more Turkey than stuff that I've pressed out at higher temps of the same bud I pressed out at 2:30 you know and I've gotten slightly different looking material it was more shatter consistency way lighter color even though it was a way higher temperature right almost 40 degrees higher same pressed time actually was a little bit shorter with the higher temperature because it started to flow faster so I didn't have to press it as long you know this is some more 190 190 180 but you know you can get all different types of colors and consistencies and the point is that it doesn't necessarily dictate the quality it just dictates the parameters that were used when they pressed it so let's see what else you guys want to know cover filter bags temperature pressure time collection don't collect on anything too cold I made the mistake of collecting on top of some dry ice there was a protective surface in between but still the cold got the the rosin too condensate and create some moisture on top of the rosin and that's just because it got too cold so now I added moisture where I don't want to I want to remove it so that's a conditional time to cure and get that out properly but make sure that you have I would say like a couple is regular ice packs and then put it like a cookie sheet and I still look on mat on top of that and that should be enough to keep it just cool enough to collect easily but not getting moisture on it Oh a lot of people asked me about the the paper I use PTFE squares so I don't use parchment the reason I don't use parchment is because 90% of the markets parchment paper is covered in silicone silicon is very very easily broken down by a lot of different terpenes specifically D limonene which is very high and a lot of Turkey buds and so when you go to press you'll notice you have your little circle your puck of Bud and then around that puck there's like little box where it looked like it seeped through the paper or the bud is eating through the paper and that's actually the the terpenes eating through the silicon and then getting through the parchment paper so what happens when that happens is the silicon gets broken down by those terpenes and then when you're scraping up your rosin you're actually scraping up bits of broken down silica that get into your rosin and then when you when you ignite that or vape it burn it whatever that's toxic silica is extremely toxic when ignited and ingestion so those of you that are pressing on silicon treated parchment paper still chances are they're silica in your material you may not notice it but it's there now it seems a little bit easier to collect material off of parchment compared to PTFE if you do not have the correct temperature to collect it on if I were to place ice packs underneath this and then collect my material it comes up extremely easy way easier than parchment nothing gets stuck to this it's the most nonstick one of the most nonstick surfaces known and unlike parchment paper that is only heat treated or heat rated up to like 400 450 degrees PTFE is heat rated up to 500 degrees and pressure rated up to 500 pounds I think it is which is pretty significant nothing breaks through this in my experience I have not broken through a single PTFE sheet so that's why I use these I got a pack of one thousand four by four squares for 125 bucks from turkey roof comm or you can check out the version PTFE roll if you guys are doing bulk compressing with larger presses get a whole roll of this this is 14 inches across and I think this sheet was like maybe safety ET or something like that and this was like I think 100 something bucks it's worth it so think that covers and yeah it's depressing show me what you guys got if you guys have any questions comments please drop them below this was a very impromptu video I was gonna do like a whole little script and make sure I covered each bullet point but dabs happened and then I just started talking and here we are now so that said you guys have any questions about processing material growing anything like that drop them below I reply to almost every single comment if it's worthy of a reply show me what you guys would like to see in the next video and if you guys have any material that you want processed and you know the Southern California area hit me up and I'll press your stuff for you and I'll show you what it's like happy dabbing I'm about to hit this and I'm gonna be out of here [Music] [Music] we're hearing all the stuff in my email probably today because I'm impulsive and I have money right now all I need is another control box similar to the one that I built for my rosin press a PID controller and a plug-in spot for the coil that I already have so it shouldn't cost me a more than about a hundred bucks and I'll be able to build the control box for for the email and I won't be torturing anymore because [ __ ] this shit's annoying especially because I smoke in the grow room now because my wife is pregnant and I'm not trying to have her getting all secondhand smokey up in this [ __ ] so I don't smoke in the living room anymore which is where I usually chill and play video games so I got a run in here to take dabs or smoke and then run back out there in between rounds or games it's like man I wish the [ __ ] was just always lit always torched up ready to go I could just come in here drop it down and be out but I got to spend like a good minute and a half [ __ ] torching this [ __ ] up to get it clean and then let me cool off but it's all good oh yeah the I don't have any packs in here with me but I did make these little gel packs I rosin in coconut oil this shake is for I take four of those it's a wrap a rat I was in Chicago for business with my lady over this past week and that was what I would do I didn't take any flour and dab anything to smoke at all all I took was those pills I was a pill-popping animal and she would hate me like 3045 minutes after I take them and it was just kale like chili Hey [ __ ] dog barking for no reason Cheers [Music] I can't wait to not be sick [Music] whoo [Music] alright that's it for me they can be about catch you guys next time", "cHz4xTYET24": "howdy howdy there beautiful people guys are all having a amazing start to your day night whatever the hell you're watching this hope it's going great for you we've got a little video here I haven't really done many of these but a lot of other cannabis content creators do these videos and I think a lot of people enjoy it we've got some strain reviews coming up today and of course we're starting with the hottest hash on the alerting rec market happy cabbage farms so happy cabbage farms they came into camp in probably about four months ago I don't know exactly when they came on to the Oregon rec market but at the time it was a pretty Minzy era in the Oregon rec market here in Benton there was just a lot of the companies have really slipped towards the end of the summer and a lot of their stuff really wasn't tasting as good as it was towards the beginning of the summer then comes heavy cabbage farms with hash robison and we don't see hot rods in a lot in the rec market because it's such an expensive and kind of niche product there's not very many people that are searching to pay a lot of money for hash rasam but when you [ __ ] try this hash frozen you're just sucked right on back in guys it is ridiculous this stuff I will tell you I have tried tons of hot rods and a lot of the times I'm going to say that's my favorite hat rosin because I don't get to try it very often happy cabbage now has been around for about four months and they are a group in our circle it's just been around I've gotten to dab it a lot and I've gotten to dab a lot of other hash rosin because I don't have to pay for it other people have it and I will tell you guys there's a couple strands that I have not liked from them but these four right here that I have are so titties I would stick my face between all of them and motorboat myself to death this is hands-down the best half rosin I have ever smoked and it's on the wreck more kit if you are over 21 you can buy this you don't have to [ __ ] buy it black market you don't have to pay the $120 for black market six star hash rosin it gets it cannot expensive for a while there guys so to see a company coming out with stuff that's between sixty and seventy five dollars and medic maybe even cheaper than that that's super impressive and just such a breath of refreshing air so this guy I've got open right here first thing when I open it this is the purple starburst og six star like just what in there is just a bad thing to say let's take a look at what we going got going on in this jar alrighty here we have the purple starburst og 6 star you guys can see it's nice and flaky there's no real huge clumps partly because I dabbed a lot of them partly because it is 6 star and it is just gorgeous look at that color sorry for the shaking I'm filming on my phone they check that out just absolutely gorgeous I am completely enthralled with the look of this rosin I'm enthralled with the look as well as the smell a second you open up this up you get hit in the face with the real ocean groan oh gee smell and it's been a long time since we've gotten that we're getting more chem more gassy oh geez out here this is real ocean groan oh gee and then on the end of it is like this almost faint hint of like purple lavender not in a floral way at all but in a very very gassy way like I can't even begin to explain this we're gonna go ahead and take it yeah we got two rigs out today we first we're gonna start out with the prophecy glass and get a little function shot and I'll shop for you guys we don't have the cleanest rigs or bangers today just kind of caught me on an off cleaning day but maybe we should still be able to see that function right we're gonna start off with the purple starburst it guys this stuff is absolutely amazing I cannot tell you how much I recommend going and trying just the strain right here all of happy cabbage farm is fantastic this strain right here hands down my favorite let's go ahead and get her heat it up and get into some freakin turf skies I am excitement for this video you can not believe how hard it is to have four jars of happy cabbage sitting in a drawer knowing you can't smoke it because you have to come with it it's literally heartbreaking I also want to give them a huge shout out for sponsoring the 420 of it at the Pacific Circle that was absolutely amazing they set up a tab bar anybody that came by could have their stuff a company that produces this high a product of this high quality of product just allow anybody to come up and smoke it no no [ __ ] questions asked is just amazing huge shout out to them for that call that good set a timer for 45 seconds alright we're gonna go ahead get in here and scoop ourselves out a nice flaky dab of this gorgeous six star here we go guys first dab of the half cab farms Cheers [Music] oh good lordy that is so delicious straight to the head immediately my whole head warm fuzzy dice feels delicious but you just know media we have strongest it because it hits you momentarily after you take it down man is a good video to be filming guys yeah I also got to say this is mind-bending how good that flavor is and how much flavor there is usually with a lot of even really good tasting dabs only a small percentage of flavor this there is a large percentage of flavor in that [ __ ] strain it is amazing how much you get out of it I love it for our first thing to have in the morning like if you got one dab to set your whole day straight that's it right there that purple starburst og alright move on to the next string I believe this one was a collab width Oh pull on a stick and throw it into my house I rip the [ __ ] alright I threw the Box away in the heavy collab on it [ __ ] oh no without gaps in garden Gadsden Gardens okay this one is a collab with Gadsden garden and this is Tropicana punch now this one has a much much different look to it let me give you guys an initial smell test it was like pomegranate and man what is that that is a good [ __ ] smell right there it was like pomegranate and fish I'm not like just weed but the actual cush like when you're exhaling a cush strain it smells like that oh man that's delicious now this one has a much different look to it way more waxy was this one what was this one called no just Tropicana punch hash rosin not six-star not their batter or their jam just hash shots but still absolutely delicious looking kind of looks like peanut butter and this was not what I do what it looked like when they gave it to me when it was cold it was much much more pretty and hadn't like waxed up into this solid state yet still [ __ ] beautiful we're gonna switch it up we've got the DBE 503 slimeball rig all ready to go over here a dab of this junk ambush I believe this is the one that gave me a job on the night of 4/20 and I was just absolutely mind blown by how good the flavor of it was so much rudiness to it but still keeping a really nice base in the OG gas cushy that kind of a chem that kind of a taste so I'm keeping it sweet waste in there but still having some food on top I'm a big fan of fruity strains but when I have to smoke all day every day it's not my favorite I really really want the Kim gasps og scum push stuff like that all right that's all set a timer 45 seconds that's not that's not the right dance isn't it there was a dude I'm just gonna stop him all right if vijaya tease this one's a lot easier to load up I'm just gonna take this a nice big chunk here boom I am gonna be so blitzed by the end of this guy's four dabs of hatch rosin and that I haven't gotten into this yet but I'm sure you guys read the title we're taking out Widowmaker at the end but yeah let's do it [ __ ] drop the dead Cheers [Music] [Music] get right with that safe before really really fruity but it keeps its [ __ ] feet planted firmly in a nice little og tastes good very clean - I mean like of course there's no solvents in it but a lot of other people's half-frozen I get a a wheezing in my lungs and that's usually the reason I stay away from hats Rossum as you guys can hear [Music] there is some coffee but there's no wheeze and that is what I love about this stuff it just seems so clean so pure you're tasting exactly what this amazing weed was meant to taste like guys we're going nips out go the [ __ ] nips out Jesus Christ two tabs of hash rosin in we've got the purple starburst and oh wait no the Tropicana punch and the purple starburst yeah okay yes yes boom so we've got punch breath up next this is their jam and this one unfortunately has slowly disintegrated in a series of very unfortunate dabs that were completely unavoidable but I think a little bit left so we have something for this video right here I'm gonna zoom the camera in so you guys can see it's really really clear and very very light in color but it is so ganbei good I can't even begin to tell you guys how many Terps they've got packed into that gorgeous little [ __ ] doing GM glove there when you get in this one it immediately has like a purple smell I use that to describe a lot away I don't know what the purple smell is I don't know what I'm describing there I'm sure there's some people out there that are gonna be like yeah and there's some people are gonna be like what the [ __ ] he's that high already but it does it smells purple purple with a hint of fruit punch on the end that's exactly what I'm getting clenched breath and it's really really cool how true their flavors are guys like you can't even begin to tell you how many other hot rods and strings like taste we're like this one's strong in and you taste it that's great it's amazing how many people just they'll name their strains anything just because that's what's hype that's what's selling right now these guys they've just got some fire a sweet in fire ass hash on the way out switching it back up again to the prophecy glass for our punch breath dab here I'm gonna go ahead and heat this up man guys given that Widowmaker at the end it's gonna be so brutal I have already baked like a cupcake my gourd is gone stone to the bone I just [ __ ] rent I think you guys a good idea of how ripped I am I've taken two gaps and I already am starving I don't feel like I need a turf map two naps like I thank you I'm taking seven gram damage guys this we just took like maybe point one maybe and I'm already ready for a turf down at the end of this I'm going to pass out right here after I've ordered new greens call it good BAM wham Shazam set timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla alright let's go ahead scrape ourselves out some of this leaving just enough left to put into our Widowmaker jab guys we got we got some crazy stuff going with a maker jab this punch breath was definitely one of my favorites it was a lighter high than the six star starburst og but had just about the same percentage of flavor it's fan-fucking-tastic really allowed me to go about my day if I was smoking it in the morning before say a meeting or something it would be really good for that not if you were gonna go out and want a dad that was gonna last you three to four hours that would be the purple starburst six star that stuff is just [ __ ] tits it is so strong BAM Thank You Carla let's take this damn choose people it's tons tons and tons of flavor [Music] [Music] now we got the sweats going big time holy Jebus how is it is hot in here oh my god keeping you close holy [ __ ] this was a good fight hey promised the Widowmaker again oh [ __ ] turf sweats aren't [ __ ] real oh my god whoa next up we got some margarita punch six star don't let the nips cool off for a second here wow that overheated a needle is in the red Oh rubbie oh my god I completely forgot we have water over here not sponsored by but shout out the can event for carrying the happy cabbage four guys are in Central Oregon looking for a place to pick this stuff up get a man got it they got so many different strains oh yes we got one left guys we've got the margarita place six star same with the starburst og let's go ahead and take peak here in this jar very very flaky but it is all stuck together none of it is gonna fall out I don't believe ya all stuck in there when I first got it was flaky like if you sneezed it would go everywhere like a pile of blow it was pretty [ __ ] flaky oh man oh man this one probably actually I'm gonna have to take my my vote back for the smell this one has better smell than the purple starburst dojin form starburst oh gee I do believe tastes better but god damn margarita punch they're definitely a hint of that tropic punch in there but there is a kick what is that kick gasps that is straight gasp oh man yeah once you get past that punch just gassy oh that is good it doesn't have the og smell of the purple starburst I mean it is just Tropicana punch instead of deep purple starburst OG um but it does have a massive undertone of some gassy flavors go ahead keep the slime ball ring up last one and probably take a little two-minute walk around the house and then we're gonna dive into that way a but nothing's more currently done I am so big guy so I can feel my hind legs coming down [ __ ] just set a timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla thank you very much I can feel my eyelids coming down like heavy hard it is I'm gonna be in for a real long afternoon here we got a photo we got the Gus glass show circle tonight [ __ ] I'm gonna be licking windows all night long guys so yeah super flaky super super potent smell let's get some [ __ ] taste in here oh yes oh yes wants to scrape it all off the bottom it is super flaky again yep all right we got a margarita punch six star and hash browns and over here I bring a ball right up in clothes for you guys kitchens function off the first initial hit oh my god I need a new cord after this video it's not even baked out of it it's just oh [ __ ] cheers everyone a lot more gas when you smoke it less of the push flavor than the go wow they're really not my favorite in terms of flavor definitely not bad whatsoever it's still delicious I'm probably ranked this number three the Tropicana punch probably be my least favorite out of the four but honestly I would buy all four strains again thanks they say that they're that good all scraped up on a piece of paper see if we can get it um damn er and then we will take a lap mop it off a bit and take this [ __ ] Widowmaker all those cobbles alright we got our four grams right here I have completely forgotten which one goes to which cap so that will be interesting we're just going to go ahead and see if we can take this damper here and get some of each of these on here it's not going to be a monster dabbe but I mean big enough for some fun boom there's our starting scoop of the punch breath now this is this is the margarita punch now this is gonna be a little difficult this stuff is so flaky I'm not quite sure we might have to get like a spoon for this so I'm gonna just take some of this and yeah there's no way it's gonna stick on there take that off and then last but not least we need the what what was this I forget [ __ ] I think I've lost more oil in here than I got out definitely alright well there's that there's what I've got and there's also some on this damper too this stuff has all different consistencies let me see if I can't like splurge some of this long as dabber just smush it all together that's kind of working I'd say that's working pretty damn good alright let's look at our dab here guys oh [ __ ] yeah oh Jesus alright alright let's let's get her going oh my god this is gonna be fun I literally didn't move any of this because I was terrified that the dab would fall off the dabber I think we are very lucky and fortunate that we got all that hash onto a bro without any of it falling off I didn't I think that was going to happen as this on a monster Widowmaker but like I was saying before guys - dabs in I was pretty [ __ ] toasted we're at a point now where I am just I'm good at I could be good for today for smuggling I am [ __ ] why are we doing this because you got your [ __ ] awesome but I love each and every one of you that's why we're [ __ ] doing this get in

amazing people please remember that as always please be kind to one another Cheers I'll see you guys soon", "M1jAs45a4Zk": "what is the dumbest family alright guys well it's been a little while since we pressed some rosin so well I mean it hasn't been that long since I put some rosin but it's been a long time since we've pressed some rosin so yeah let's just go grab a random random fatty nug out the bag oh it looks pretty good should we should we weigh it on the scale sure why not alright where's zero and that's 1.06 cool should we look at it hopefully that will be in the shot and not all blurry and whatnot yeah pretty little bud so yeah just go ahead and press her down and see how she goes so not sure how all of you guys been doing I definitely like to know but since you guys can't respond to me I just tell you how I've been doing so been working on these presses been getting them out as most of you guys know this is prototype early release whatnot so you know this is pre-production as you as I would say pre-production so but this is going to be in production for 2019 so expect expect your friends to be able to get it and yeah hopefully everything's great do that but uh yeah now that I'm done with this project pretty pretty much wrapped up the project now I can send it to the manufacturer and have it made and professional packaging and all that but uh I'll be starting on my wall completing my other project of my nail and we'll all be enjoying wireless tabs by the holiday hopefully and yeah everything should be good on that so let's check this out it looks to me like it's not bubbling anymore but you could see that's a pretty decent return right there just squeeze the F out we'll go back and press that again whoops wake up everybody in the house I like to work at night so yeah look at that looks pretty good you could see a little bit that didn't come out right there but that's irrelevant at this point let's see Thanks judo chop all right nice and nice and clear Rosen let's just [ __ ] with this guy for a second okay you got a clean burn and we'll just go like that this is a cold plate if you're wondering and or a cold box I guess because not really a plate it started out as a plate and one day I woke up I went to sleep with the lights on and I woke up and it was a box yeah so when it's sappy just put your dad's up there and it gets right hard not a sex joke yeah no it looks pretty good I guess it could be a sex joke if you wanted it to be so oh yeah let's uh let's do like this since we calculated it we might as well finish the calculation all right we're zero it out beautiful some beautiful beautiful rosin so these buds are freshly picked well freshly cured about that they're probably three or four months old but freshly cured so that's why the color is like that so it looks like we got point one four should we should we oh this is 0.15 well at least it's consistent right that's uh I can tell that there's nothing left in this but for shits and giggles let's go ahead and press it twice shits and giggles or giggles and shits I'm not sure I got it in the middle there at least a little bit of pressure so I'm not killing myself I guess I could have kept the pressure up I just use both hands I don't think anything's gonna come out of it since it's consistently 15% but let's see nope nothing came up a little bit a little tiny bit so yep rosin jr. alright you guys my next videos I'll be talking about my nail so stay tuned don't forget to like subscribe hit the little bell icon so you get notified when I make updates to products and stuff especially if you're a customer and I'll see you in the next video", "apauT0_ovWA": "yo what's up YouTube alright guys today we're gonna present some rosin I already started this is a second run a bubble how should I made it was a little darker so it came out a little bit darker it smells [ __ ] fire though I'm using the Dooley Tech [ __ ] bags I just left over from when I purchased them to be honest Dooley Tech [ __ ] sucks they're at least their bags do I don't know how the rest of the products do but they're [ __ ] bags they suck [ __ ] ass I had a blowout on that one there and I was the 3 grams or 2 grams two and a half grams of bubble hash I was running at a high temp so I dropped the temperature down this is what I'm gonna run at seven grams of some full melt bubble hash this [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire guys it's sticky sticky one it's really really really sticky really fire you could just see how sticky that [ __ ] is it smells [ __ ] amazing this is all of my strings together so it's pretty much a hybrids indica it's actually Kryptonite gelato and gorilla glue you can just look at the quality of this [ __ ] hash it's [ __ ] fire but yeah we're gonna go ahead and pack this up in the bad guys and give me one second so I can get this set up so you guys can get a little bit of a better look get some parchment paper cut out [Music] so what are you guys up to today you guys having any time for Tuesday I don't go into work until tonight so I'm pretty much free all day long until the evening falling so by MIDI mid mid day and then I go to work but until then I meet this hash yesterday oh it came out pretty good I ended up getting about oh I want to say I want to say I got about 10 grams I guess of bubble hash and that was - how many how many ran it watched it twice I didn't do it any more than that the second wash I did I was doing a little bit aggressive and came out a little darker it was an amber like this first one here it was still sticky it just came out a little bit darker actually came out a lot doctor that's the bow hash like that's the rosin I just showed you guys in the and the other one I went ahead and flipped the bag inside out there's and that's the actual hash but yeah I went ahead and flipped the bag inside out and I'm gonna go ahead and load it up in the bag now what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna slide it in there as best as I can without hopefully it doesn't stick too much to the bag all right it went right in so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna fold it over on itself guys got a nice little puck in there I'm not gonna cut this bag I cut the last one little Desai's just uh hope you nothing bad would happen but I don't know I might even double bag this guy's cuz I had a blowout on the last one I don't want to have a blowout on this one but maybe I just want press as hard maybe I'll just go a little softer you know I think that's probably what he's gonna do so let's go ahead and head over to the press guys this is my press face it's a 12-ton press and I'm running got pressed as far as the heat plates I did drop the temp a little bit but I think I'm gonna drop that even more guys and I'm gonna do a real real slow press on this so I'm gonna go ahead and set these temps a little lower I'll go to 175 I was running at 200 earlier and I dropped it down to 180 but it wasn't all the way down to 180 when I pressed it was like at 190 I want to say so I'm gonna run that in a lower temp 175 I'm gonna bet that go ahead and drop for a minute until then I'm just gonna go ahead and get set up here I'm running 3x3 dad pressed plates these [ __ ] plates are [ __ ] pretty good guys I haven't had any issues with this press or this plate these plates for since I bought it actually is still pretty new I've only used though I've used the hell out of it I've pressed a lot of [ __ ] flowers as you can see I pressed there's some rosin chips right here this when people refer to rosin chips this is what they're talking about guys this is the leftovers of your actual presses and they're still resin in those guys you can save those and you can use them for butter I'll go ahead and show you exactly what I'm talking about guys let's up here see that stuff right there that's coconut oil it's a little mouthy because I have it on the top cabinet and I have the heat on now but usually it's pretty solid it's just like a butter it's coconut oil pretty much you just boil it in coconut oil and sift it all out and there's your edibles and you can make whatever you want I actually made some cookies the other day and some brownies and they came out [ __ ] amazing guys matter of fact I still got some right here I used about half - half ratio we took my cookie between the butter and the coconut oil but I like my [ __ ] strong guys and I put actually about a half a pound over those rods and chips I want to say not a half pound maybe about 7 ounces 6 ounces of these rosin chips into about 3 cups of that coconut oil and that [ __ ] came hush 204 guys literally came out strong with some good [ __ ] but yeah the temps are starting to drop two hours you could see the right side drop in faster than the left side is that's just the top and bottom plates but it'll match up real soon here guys but yeah at least this [ __ ] rosin press is [ __ ] kicking ass guys I really like pressing but I used to do a lot of BA chose but be honest that's just it costed me a lot of money than butane and my time and it was dangerous [ __ ] this is way more easier it's safer and not to mention your terpenes man this [ __ ] [ __ ] you preserve all your terpenes on all your flavor of all you of all your Rosen's you put your Preston guys she just comes out [ __ ] fire but yeah man I ever since I've gotten my press and and started running it I actually love it it's it doesn't get any better than this I should say because like I said it's just the terpene profile itself if you're doing a really low dab really low press as far as the heat you [ __ ] flavor profile of the buds it's [ __ ] amazing especially if they're fresh buds and there they were within three or four weeks of being picked or harvested man you're gonna have amazing amazing [ __ ] rosin I've actually had a almost clear rosin come out I bet you that's what this is gonna end up doing it's gonna come out really really amber really clear it's not gonna be dark at all especially if you're running on a low temp you're gonna get some [ __ ] amazing I used to press this windows breath and I'm not even lying dude it was stink my whole house up it's not like like fruity pebbles it was amazing I I was amazed the first time I pressed that stuff I was like [ __ ] and just the way it smelled my pressed is the way it tasted and it was amazing it was good stuff just the act rosin is the way to go especially if you're doing it yourself and you got that you can do it with your own product it's just so much fresher taste so much better you'll never want to go back to being chose again be a chose or thing of the past as far as I I think I'm gonna have a pretty good little run off with this at this amount of hash but I'm not sure we'll see it's only about it's actually not even a full quarter it's about six six point four six point five and then there's my six and a half grams but it's still a pretty good amount of rosin so I mean of hash so we're gonna go ahead and press it out and see what we get I'm not really worried about my turn I'm more worried about the bag blowing out his [ __ ] bags and I'm not easily tech bags they suck man I haven't had one good experience and and I've tried different microphones actually when I purchased these I bought them for zoo they were cheaper and I figured well [ __ ] maybe it's just uh it's I mean it's got to be the same micron regardless so I figured I don't know there's ditch quality or whatever but these bags I've had blowout so I'm pretty much every single bag that I ran even in flowers flowers a little bit easier to contain and then the oils as far as hatched when you're when you're pressing so I'm gonna take it real slow on this one I'm not gonna force it I'm just gonna let it melt its way down through the people bed I'm gonna take it slow and easy on this one I'm not gonna force it I got it right on the edge because uh it's not gonna be pushing anything out it's not gonna be expanding too much so we're just gonna go ahead and paint it down so about right there I'm not pushing it too much we're just gonna let it start melting and you can see immediately it starts it starts shooting out rosin so I'm just gonna let it go ahead and mount melt it through the bag and let it do it low and slow those times I might even drop the temp a little bit more to 165 which I think I'm gonna do right now so that way by the end of my press it should be cooler than it was when it started over water 167 that should be good yeah they do that gold and honey okay I'm just painting it down as on just taking it very easy I don't want to blow through this bag and [ __ ] this batch of hat or bras it up even if I have to press it halfway through and then take it out and redo it again I will I don't wanna blow through this bag and you can just look at that color guys and you know what I'm gonna give me one second alright guys sorry about that [ __ ] bag blew through if I have to go clean it up repack it [ __ ] put another bed over it Pam [ __ ] ass I wasn't even putting that much pressure on it these [ __ ] bags guys if you ever buying Dooley Tech to be honest they're [ __ ] shits garbage stay away from it from what I can tell they're a [ __ ] rosin presses are half decent I wouldn't say they're the best but they'll get the job done like I say get what you pay for pretty much so I'm gonna go ahead and pause this video guys I'm gonna keep a good eye on this that way I don't [ __ ] it up and I'll start the video up as soon as the rosin starts coming out alright guys we're getting some rosin off the side I'm trying not to push it too hard I don't wanna blow through the bag and [ __ ] up my [ __ ] so I'm just taking it really really slow that's why sorry I bought the video being so long guys looks like it's starting to come out on this side as well I would when it came off on the last batch I cleaned out around where blew out on this corner you could tell the change in the color looked like the raw slick the rosin like the hash I'm sorry so I went ahead and just cleaned up what was cleaning on the other I tell it from the other parchment paper in the kitchen guys but yeah I got it on a really low temp it's I 165 166 it's jumping up and down between the 67 or 66 we'll see how the the end product looks I'm just applying light pressure I don't know why these Dooley tech bags do that [ __ ] man they're [ __ ] garbage every [ __ ] one I've used even for flowers it's just garbage I guess if you're on a budget but even if you're in a budget it's not worth it because you're gonna [ __ ] get you're gonna get plant matter in your in your rosin or you're gonna get hashing your rods depending on how you're pressing just almost better just to press the but by itself and use their [ __ ] so I got my hand on the handle as I'm just pulling it down slightly as I as I see the rosin coming out and it's coming out of all sides days looking pretty good so it's Laos [ __ ] amazing just to know what I can smell it looks nice color nice and amber and I know this videos longer I started about the length of it I should have maybe I'll edit it and I really don't have a lot of pressure on it now guys I'm barely putting pressure on it I don't have a gauge on this to tell me how many tons I'm putting on it but from [ __ ] that I pressed in the past I'm not putting very much weight on it at all just with the way to my hand on here I can pull the lever down that's how much that's I mean that just goes to show you how hard I'm pushing on it I'm not really pulling on here at all wait until it all melts goes through the screen and then I'm gonna try to press out at the end maybe I'll hold off and just let it let the pressure push out what's there and then I'll clean it off and then I'll press it again afterwards but I'm gonna go ahead and cut this video guys it's really heading on 20 minutes 17 minutes I don't want to make it too long he does have a good day be careful darkness", "CM7BgO_-Huk": "[Music] [Music] [Music] Mina McCain Katrina over FEMA it's like Virgina when you're barely green

size press rosin press from D nail you've seen the one with the five by five plate it's about that size well this one is the 15 inches by 15 inches so it's a fairly large unit it's definitely going to give you a lot more area to process a lot more material I'm not going to go and do an over board review on it today I'm really probably gonna focus mostly on hash as it's outside and I'm not really confident in the whole four but it's very simply you can take a piece of parchment or you can use an oil slick and I'm wondering if oil slick is going to get in touch with DNA land there are that if they're going to make oil slick pads in the five inch by five inch as well as in a 15 inch by 15 inch because it would be wonderful just to slide that right in there put all your buds down or your hash your envelope however you're gonna press simply put another one over top and give it your 10-second press but I do want to talk a little bit about you know getting this machine getting it out of the box it's extremely heavy so I really would want to warn you guys that if you have any back issues or you have any sort of elements that could be increased by moving something heavy please get help with this unit it is awkward it's got the top piece here that screws down to lower the plate and because it's not tight because of course you need leeway for the plates to move up and down you get this sort of motion in the unit so you want to be careful with that once it is on you should understand that these top and bottom plates get very hot I've got it at about 120 degrees Celsius right now which is around 245 to 250 Fahrenheit there's a whole variety of temperatures that you can use with this unit and I'll talk about that a little bit but first I want to really discuss you know the getting this out of the box and and starting to get it working so let me just turn my phone off and make sure we don't get interrupted there so like I said you're going to want to figure out the perfect distance with my smaller unit because this unit I could literally close it right right to the bottom and there's a space here about an inch or two at the back of the unit and it allows us a little bit of leeway if we're not getting enough of a press and you can see I'm getting a really good press on this one so it's good enough I don't need to lower it anymore it's got the two units so here's one of the problems that you're gonna have with this unit if you're using it at a small house and you're not actually at a commercial processing facility is the power it takes a lot more power than the smaller unit and for example the smaller unit I can plug both sides into one extension cord and plug it into a plug well with this one if you plug both of these even onto the same circuit in your house you'll most likely blow blow the fuse which I did a couple of times trying to figure out I have one plugged in over here with an extension cord and I have one plugged in fair distance over there so it is much a little bit more work to figure out how to get this thing to work you know it might not be a problem for many of you you might have it all set up with your power and you've got this plug here and that plug there and they're on different circuits perfect but do do pay attention to that because it's something that happened to me also like I said very heavy you're gonna want to find out where you want to put this thing and pretty much leave it there so yeah we've got our temperatures up to temperature I was thinking of of using the oil slicks about pads but you know I think I'm going to press a good chunk of hash for this and really sort of utilize the surface area that we have to go with because you know it's it's the amount of hash increased isn't the problem on the five by five I can keep putting more and more and more and what's the problem is is how far the rosin the resin excretes out of the hash when pressed with that little X amount of heat it pushes further and further out and what I was finding was as I started going over around three or four grams I was able to push the rosin right to the end of the parchment paper on the five by five unit the small d-mail press this being the large d-mail press I don't think we're going to have that problem I guess we could probably just get right to it so I've got myself a pressing screen and this is a pressing screen that's already been used to collect bubble hash and I found it laying around and it was a little bit dirty and what I did was it simply cut in half and I've had the the piece removed from the from the edge which is the rim the the blue rim that went all the way around there and basically what I did was because it was very sort of not holding together I just folded the end up and I stuck it in the press and closed it for about two seconds and now you can see that this is nice it's staying it's staying closed and I so I did it to both ends and what it did is it allowed me to make a little pouch basically what I'll do once I get a lot of the bubble in there I'll fold the third side over much like just like that I'll have my envelope and I'll be able to lay it down nicely in the parchment in fact why don't we even get that to go down just like that there we go it's actually quite efficient for you know using none of the pressure whatsoever just the little bit of heat that's coming out of there a couple seconds not to do it so yeah that gives me a nice big unit here a nice big filter bag now you can pick up these screens right now as blotting screens pressing screens rosin screens we sell them afresh Hetty's calm or bubble bag calm and of course I share a lot of information with you guys and I'm never gonna be more happy than if you if you turn around and support a support what I'm doing by supporting my company we try to have great customer service we try to give you the best dollar bang for your buck and yeah so you can pick those up what I'm going to do is I'm having my manufacturer develop these small bags like this we're not quite sure how we want to do it whether we're gonna make them fold and stays whether we're gonna sell them all up we'll figure out what's gonna happen but I want them to come in one grand five grand 10 grand Honda gram potentially even 500 gram envelopes and then I also want to have special ones for cannabis flowers they won't be quite like a pouch but maybe more like a tube I found some good luck in pressing with a tube of screen I wrap it all up and fill it up with ground-up herb and I've been getting some decent returns and don't get me wrong after today when you see this and you're saying oh what about the flowers are you gonna press flowers I will do some flowers I'll make a little second review on this for flowers this is the D mail large rosin press hash review so that's what we're gonna do I've got some beautiful public-house here it was a gift from a friend these are breeders Steve strains and it's very gooey and gummy nice quality presses together good I'd give it about a four star maybe a 3 in its melt category it was grown outdoors a greenhouse - field and basically it produced a very lovely profile of resin it just wasn't able with with a Canadian Sun to get that powerful enough boost to really push it over the 5 and 6 star level but that's not going to be a problem for us today we do have the ability to unveil quality so that's what we're gonna do for you I'm gonna take some of this actually let me go get the scale because I you guys are gonna want to know the amounts alright so I grabbed the scale grabbed another little dish I am not even sure how much is here it's got to be 40 or 50 grams total in here I'm not sure if we're gonna run it all but yeah this is about 40 grams forty point three grams it's gonna real lovely smell to it look there's some blockheaded some sweet skunk and maybe some plum some nice varieties from Steve over the years that these guys are growing it's you know really it really is nice bubble just not quite at that level for the bubble connoisseur you know great stuff for making coconut oil extracts great stuff for me all different forms of Matta bowls and even the addition of a Remo style supercharged joint you know great stuff for such a bang it's not gonna melt off the plug plug your whole unit let's see how much of this we can get into our little our little our little unit here well looks like it all went in pretty nice yeah that's real lovely so I guess the best bet is to sort of get it all even so it's there's no empty spots in the packet all right a little a little bit of a hand press and the mothership I guess we'll wait till we press some of this loveliness and then we'll have a little little so let me get this open to the desired size these d nails are very much the size of the parchment paper so it becomes quite convenient [Music] see if we can't feed that and if it means a bit of a a funny thing when you start playing around with this parchment it starts rolling like that so it actually becomes the smallest bit of a challenge to get it in and then get it straightened which I just apply the smallest amount of heat I don't want to apply too much and put any sort of ripples in the material but you might as well get the machine working for you and this is just one of the things that I find is very convenient about it but a little bit of press and heat I mean it's basically a large iron so you put yourself in a situation where if something's rolled up if your screen won't close well I mean one of the things I found amazing with these screens is if I take the smallest amount of rosin and I clip it on each corner I didn't have to do it with this because there was actually resin present on this screen already so the minute I just heated it up the slightest bit that resin warmed up and sort of became like a glue that's holding my screen together and I definitely that's about the only kind of glue I don't mind personally so let me just get one more piece of this cut off for you guys and I'm using unengaged art parchment paper this is another issue that many people have been discussing we've been discussing it on hash search all the different sort of footprints and the sort of different things that can be present and all the different products pay attention be conscious you know learn if you learn something it's ok to admit that you didn't know it before and that now you're gonna do your best to uh to try and keep things as safe as possible and that's you know from the example of saying use using a very bleached parchment paper not really the best idea especially with the heat transfer you don't want to be transferring something like bleach so we got these boats sorted out here all right nice big size there semi ready like I said I'm gonna give just a little bit of a press and I know this table is probably making you guys nervous with the mothership and then and the d-mail press it's got a tiny little bit of motion but I promise you I'm paying very careful attention so I've got this organized so when I press it I showed you a little earlier there's four screws four springs on each side and you know you could get this to a point where it becomes so difficult to close that it's actually close to a danger especially if you do get it closed when you open it back up the whole unit will tend to jump up like like a little frog so be careful about that as well I have a good maximum pressure going but I certainly wouldn't you know suggest to people that that they go too far with the pressure I think that the safer units will be the pneumatic presses the hydraulic presses that have you know either air or hydraulic that allow to get that much more pressure when you when you close it and some of these units are work with a single button or two buttons that you push together so quite a nice alternative so here we go my single largest press of rosin ever 40 grams of bubble hash and what we're gonna do is we're gonna get this in here first nice big thing in there [Music] all right there we go this one on top of that first time actually feeling this what seems to be okay working all right guys we got this on the ten-second timer let's give it a shot ah there we go you can his hear it sizzling beautifully 7 6 5 4 2 1 boom you feel that boom snap up when it pops up all right so let's check that out yeah that is just lovely kind of hold that up for you guys to see it's really quite something boom and I would say that that why don't I slowly start collecting it now we want to make sure because we're outside and though in the wind here that none of us blows away of course so now this is a fair amount of rosin when I think I'm going to do is I'll collect it off camera I don't want you here in the sticky ticky tacky I will give you a few options for how you can clean this up you can put these in the freezer that out of there actually well it's still nice and warm that's one good idea actually to do if you can get your packets moves away from the resin saw is that beautiful really beautiful we're gonna have the most amount of room here so I put this over here for now I can tell it there's still lots more gooey goodness left in there so I probably haven't gotten quite my 50% but man I gotta show that to you guys there's a nice big drip lit of rosin and you can see I will of course take some macro photographs of this I know you guys appreciate the macro photographs and well you know what I think I'm gonna do I'm going to just right here and go for another shot this time use a single piece alright so let's try this again in this process he's probably like all of you he's been watching the internet he's been paying attention to the hype and he wants to know should I get a rosin press alright so there we go that's down on that bad boy I've got the ten-second timer set which is very cool it just counts down the minute the actual unit hits that was 10 seconds give it a few more shots booyah all right and not to disappoint she squeezed out another great amount so I'm gonna clean these up alright guys so I'm gonna share a little bit of this with you just because it's easy and quick I went and found a marble slinger pendant that he did years ago for me actually this is the bubbleman marble slinger pendant and I just you know some people doing it with the glass of the glass on line and I knew it would be easy but I'm not sure if you can see this middle section here how it's this really light it's the greasy stuff that's usually the hardest to pick up well this is picking it up absolutely simplistically so if you've got any glass I can show you right here that the shape isn't even that important I could easily move the blast an angle and use more if I want but I'm finding that the edge is quite efficient but watch the speed in which I can pick this rosin up I think if I had a frame holding this Roz and paper down I could do things even faster all right well that is very rewarding how well that cleaned the parchment even still I can go over it and grab those last little remnants and basically clean this part up to a like-new substance nice a little bit of rosin sitting on there why don't we move into our second sheet fold this one out of the way as we will be using it again I don't want to get the stickiness that's on the back of this unit onto the front of this unit so can we have a beautiful really nice results for this particular batch let me guess God the feeling of this is just incredible I wish I could describe it picking up literally grams if not an ounce or more of rosin off of machines I mean wow this is probably at 10 grams and the other one is maybe 5 grams eventually we could we could get up to the ounce not a shot we'll see what happens we still have more ability to press what I have as well so we'll see what happens with that I think the best way to remove this rosin will be to hold I'll probably hold the glass much like this and then just heat it up so the rosin can drip off on to or maybe I'll even crack it off once it's cold I don't know either or that's a really nice chunk of rosin right there and that's only the first to complete so see what we got over here oh that just looks great that look great in the Sun all right so clean up a lot nicer this time around still a little bit of resin on the edge of this of this guy here but you can see here how in the center it's cleaned up really really nice not leaving - too much rosin on one side of the parchment but leaving a very nice amount on the other side so all right kind of getting almost too much rosin on here now it's starting to get a little bit tacky for me to change change my format change my technique I'm now doing d the quick pull which is what I usually do when it's not working the whitening technique sometimes when you go to wipe you're just not gonna love that you're looking for that's not a problem you can be just as efficient with your cleanup now imagine if I used a small titanium you know dabber I am pick all this up that is a lot of rosin as you can see it is now completely covered the pendant so let's see what we can do here a little bit more hair the other side is not cleaned as as well as I would have liked it to be I did take just a few macro photographs of the rosin to give you an idea of the quality back close and there we go there we go a nice chunk of rosin by anyone's standards right guys so I've been collecting I got just over 13 grams here you can see it's a quite thick I'm gonna press it out in a few seconds here I'll get it flattened out so it looks like a nice big half ounce that it is we used 40 grams you know I forgot that the hash we used was a lower grade than my stuff that I'm using my 4 star that usually gives move-up 50 to 55% this stuff actually gives me closer to 33 to 35 percent return we've got 13 grams so far I just pressed oh that's cracking off very cool this is a small batch I don't think there's much more than maybe a gram or two there what I have done is and I want to talk about a little bit well before I finish the review here is the the act of collecting I did go and grab my little bubble man pendant I know they also have these big stamps that people are using glass stamps with a large glass bottom that you can just sort of do this too great idea if you don't have access to that and in particular if you've already pressed your material a few times and you're getting towards the end of the press and you're leaving it a little bit longer accessing more heat you can end up getting a material that comes out a lot less stable than the original batches this is very stable very hard very thick the last little batch here that came out was a little less than stable I can still get it collected if I have a trick up my sleeve so what I have done as I bought one of these cold freud's for paramedics actually reusable hot and cold compress and it's been in my freezer and what I do with this is how I like to collect with this is simply I use a dabber for this particular batch and I don't leave it on this thing because it'll get so cold that as you start collecting it exactly what it's doing it just starts cracking and flicking the stuff away so what I do is literally move that out of the way get your shame back onto your paper and once you've cooled it a little bit then you can go and do some collecting and now it's just picking up like nobody's business beautiful beautiful pickup job so don't be too tripped out if you end up with a sappy material you've been you've been pressing hard and you can't collect it you might think that you can put it in the freezer get it all frozen and then try to collect it I find it that is a lot a little more difficult than the simplicity of using a cold plate underneath something cold underneath even frozen peas for God's sakes just something that you can put underneath to give it that little bit of cold so when you go back to collect it you don't have any problems this is collecting really nice just collected a whole chunk of that parchment right there nice a little dab mountain man dad maybe not me not me not me dab but I have a problem with people doing huge dabs I mean why not that's if that's what you do and that's your thing then you know that's fine I I'm good with that I personally like to take many many - throughout the day more efficient in size and you know giant large huge grounds but do i straight-up applaud those that want to have fun and they're blasting big monster rips through their rigs good boy you I'm going to get back onto this coolness here just for a little bit but just gives me just the tiniest bit of cold and let me collect the resin without without it greasing up and wanting to stay behind on the parchment paper I'm just using a task rock or educated dabber and car cap to pick this up right now and mostly what you do is you collect the resin on top of itself so as it starts building you can you can actually just start rolling it much like a ball and the minute it starts getting too tacky just go right back over your cold plate to your you know whatever you have it's giving me that access to immediately different temperature because this stuff is very very sensitive to temperature changes alright so there we got half of that done another side I'm suspecting this will be at least a couple of more grams get us up to 15 grams for for the total return on 40 grams of pretty pretty nice bubble like I said it wasn't melt it was definite no melt but the really nice flavors well grown just not grown to that final fruition that you know us as the hash lover as the connoisseurs like to see but what a beautiful thing that rosin is what a beautiful thing that d-mail has done to come out with these modified t-shirt presses with d-mail standards d-mail customer service and you know hopefully sooner than later we'll be supplying them with some pressing screens if not please you know it's always appreciated when you support the company fresh head ease and bubble bag comm we have your hash making needs whether it's for Rosalyn presses we will be carrying these very soon on the site whether it's for bubble bags we have them all sorts from standards originals and lights whether it's bubble boxes tumble Mouse dry sit screens whatever your hashish needs are for the solvent list quiver bubble man and bubble bags has you covered so please support us

your social media is how we get out there my social media only takes me to you but you take me to the rest of the world so much appreciated I'm gonna continue here collecting this last little bit I'm gonna have to go through my macro photographs I didn't take as many as you guys probably would have liked but I got a nice three or four that can show you the quality of what was pressed here maybe I'll throw in a little I guess the melt video is not as exciting with rosin because if it's it's an oil it's not a hash so once you've created it as an oil of course it's gonna have a melt faster of seven-star because more oil is material that melts every time every single time which I've never seen oil in my life but didn't melt so there we go collected another couple of Jeebs to get that on the scale real quick we'll take a final dab let me get the D nail on here brought over always nice to have a oil slick to put your pipe down I hate that sound and putting the pipe down on on something that's a hard substance that you haven't you're not paying attention to and it gives that that hard that sound that glass sound that you put down so shout out the oil slick for hooking it up saving bongs one bong at a time alright so obviously for a process like this the less heat the better I'm just heating up the tip of the alright let's see what we got here what's the final number gonna be final numbers thirteen point nine thirteen point nine so let's have a dab of it because I'm sure it's wonderful oh yeah um elongated let's see make sure we're up here I'm 300 well let's just collect that all up and we'll wait a few more seconds for that to get up to temperature come on it looks like beautiful bubble bubble rosin I should say the bubble hash was a variety of 120 micron through 73 so there was 7390 micron at 120 present in that bubble hash we squeezed it through a 25 micron screen all 40 grams of it and well we ended up with so far 13 grams I think I'm gonna be able to squeeze a couple more grams out just by giving what I'll probably do is I'll open this up remove it from the large screen that it's in and I'm gonna fold it upon itself to get it a little bit thicker I'll put it in a separate size screen and I'll squeeze that through and see if I can't get to anything more so here we go yes I like that turn this guy off here want to thank you guys for watching if you guys have any questions please comment in the comments below I'll try to answer as many as I can I do miss some comments here and there but all-in-all a great unit just a few key things to keep in touch in mind don't plug them into the same circuit in your house or your your commercial place make sure you don't tighten the units so hard that when you go to close it it's barely able to open I wouldn't want to see that and otherwise just you know keep your temperatures down experiment you can experiment with temperatures as low as 90 Celsius and go up to or 80 Celsius for that matter and go up to 120 130 Celsius now in Fahrenheit that's gonna be around 190 Fahrenheit upwards or 180 Fahrenheit upwards to around 250 personally what I find is when I'm extracting from hash I like to keep my temperatures a little bit lower and when I'm extracting with cannabis I usually keep them a little bit higher however for this experiment I actually pressed this at the temperature that I normally press cannabis at it was around 245 degrees Fahrenheit a little bit warmer than usual I do have some of this hash that I'll be able to compare to the rosin oil I should say I have some that I made some time ago and I'll compare it to I'll compare the colors I'll compare the tastes see if the terpene profile was that greatly affected by the excess heat and the only thing I'd really add is that if you get yourself a little laser temperature and you close this up and you get a you're at say 250 degrees Fahrenheit and you pull the thing out like right away and hit it with the temperature you'll notice that the oil itself is going to be closer to around 90 to 120 degrees Celsius so sorry not Celsius Fahrenheit a hundred hundred and fifty tops so it's all interesting we're learning every day I definitely want to hear from you guys and if you have any more questions like I said just answer them in the comments and yeah that was the D nail review we ended up with just over 13 grams 1/2 ounce made it in a very short time compared to the video I did with D for 20 K and how I'm gonna leave you is simply by pressing out this little bit of rosin that we have here and showing you what it looks like you know not in a giant puck so let's see if we can't it's interesting to learn how to how to work with this stuff as well and after you know for me not having worked with oil for so so long and I I know a lot of you consider this stuff to be hash but I really still call it oil I'm not sure if that's very important or not the aspect of whether or not we're gonna be calling this oil or hash but I'm old-school I go with what the old-school guys are saying and when I see Robert Kyle Clarke explaining the differences between oil and hash in in hashish it just leads me to believe that there are indeed some differences between oil and hashish all right there we go guys thanks for the rosin press really appreciate the kindness of Dean ale sending these out for me to test and you know so far the the small unit I've absolutely loved it I love the ability to clot plug it into the same plug but this unit is a whole different ballgame you really could see how you could get your production game on with one of these things I'm to see if we can't get this open here it's so nice to have this cold pack here because you just you give this a little a little press just to cooler top half removed real nice but that bottom half is still still holding on just a little bit there we go alright guys thanks for watching bubble man's world I will leave you with the rosin hey guys so I turned the unit back on I have my 13 plus grams I was doing the math just didn't seem like enough what I realized is I hadn't shown you what the hash looked like on the inside of the screen and I sort of wanted to show you guys that so when I opened it I noticed that right away a lot of it looked very like almost this Kalish tan color almost not white but white ish and it sort of shows that oh everything's almost out of here but when I opened it further on the inside trapped between the two layers of very very dry material was still what I would consider a decent amount of resin so I turned the unit back on I just literally did another press which you can see right here is this parchment you have to open it up again with the colt with the help of the cold so always best to not forget this thing it's a it's extremely convenient vent so yeah sometimes if that stuff's not opening properly this looked really greasy I did have to use a little bit of excess heat to get at it but I suspect there's another couple of grams there at least a gram and if I were to press it maybe one or two more times I could squeeze another gram out each time just having to use more pressure I did press it off-camera but I had tightened it even more you should have seen the way this thing kicked up when I lifted it up it felt like I won't be doing that again I'm gonna open it up just a tiny little bit on the back here and the way to be safer than sorry I suppose that came out quite nice you see another big nice press through the XL the thing about that's really nice about this is that I would have me hard set to do this in my smaller unit I was nowhere near you you know 40 grams I was pressing 4 and 5 grams and it was already starting - oh yeah that's starting to feel better now starting to feel lot less sticky then it's been there is a couple of sticky spots in each middle and we'll get to those see if we can't clean this up nice and quick this stuff just turns to shatter almost immediately upon the contact with the cold in larger amounts it'll stay together yeah chattering we'll just take it off and put it on the oil slick a little bit pickin it up here with the highly educated Gabbar so I was rolling it around and then it gets to a point where all of a sudden it won't roll anymore and it's you know the pepper the power of the oil overtakes the weakness of the parchment so just be careful and be patient as I said that a piece of rosin just jumped up onto my wrist but you have to be patient in your collection this is actually quite a bit I'd say this is going to be another couple of grams so I'm feeling better about that already I've got my returns up in the 30 percentile 30 to 35 anyway and that is a lot better so never jump the gun and throw your your end product away always always put well it doesn't take a brain surgeon to believe when you when you open it up and you see that it's gummy and sticky this is not what it's supposed to look like so for people that don't know that that's something that you can learn a value right here and right now when the material is done hash in particular it really won't have any stick left to it you'll be able to you'll be able to know that you've got everything out and as long as you're doubting and you're thinking I don't think I got everything out the problem we didn't so go with that and get back to your press and you want another shot each time like I say you can experiment around with the different amounts of heat that you're using the amounts of pressure that you're using all right so I did bring the rocker arms over here kind of wouldn't mind finding out what the xs-extra is that we got on here actually I don't need to do that I never have in the past I've always just closed it the beauty of rosin and just pull them pull the pin we twist it a few times just so it doesn't hold on to a lot of excess but there we go let's see what we got there two grams 1.9 grams so that was a good press you know leaving that behind could've but would have been detrimental there's another great way to clean Ross enough using itself as the main clean we've got rosin on the side to the parchment paper you've seen a pretty good like this all righty beautiful beautiful is that back in there this is too hot right now but eventually once I turn this back down you know quite a bit like it really only needs to be warm rather than hot and I just will give it another little press and turn it into one solid piece but I think for now we really are gonna have to hit another batch of rosin see how that goes fairly hard I can always lower it and raise it with this piece here but obviously not when you're in the middle of a press go we go again I'm a cool plate and I suspect this is really getting down to it now maybe a gram there maybe a half gram every little bit helps I'm certainly not gonna say no to it I will continue to collect this and once I've got to collect it next we're gonna open up the packet screen envelope and we'll we'll see if we can't show you what's in its fifteen point five grams I added all the extra right here it was actually a little bit more than I thought I was gonna get but the part I really was interested in doing with you guys is showing you what's in here so you can tell close up and bring it to you you can see that there's a little bit of resin here but for the most part the screen is actually fairly clean there's some here as well and this is old resin that was on there earlier that I mentioned so if we flip it over to the other side we got the same thing we got these two Center batches and that's where the resin was really feeding out but you can see that the rest of the screen maintained quite a beautiful clarity so these two little spots in the center tell me that there's the tiniest bit more resin for me to acquire but I didn't want to kind of open this up a little bit and show you what is inside of here so you can see how that little bit of resin that I put on there at the start really closed that up nicely and that was a little bit of bubble ingenuity I'd love to hear what you've done with bubble I've done a few varieties of funny things one time I got myself out of a locked bathroom in Jamaica using bubble and some other things so there it is that's what it looks like right there you can see towards the edge that it's quite done and then as you go into the middle right you go into the middle and you can see there's still some resin in there there's still some good gooey goodness so I'm going to continue on pressing this it's not going to be part of the review I will let you know in the comment section but I've already gone overboard on this video and extended it longer than I thought I would by coming back and doing the rest but there you have it guys D nail press large in the house I gotta give it I gotta give it a couple of thumbs up for certain it's definitely an efficient unit if any of you realized the last time D 420k and I did a video where it was turning you know the half ounce into outs thirty grams into a half ounce that was a much nicer bubble that took us almost three hours using hair straighteners two of us we both ended up kind of giving ourselves a little bit of a shoulder injury on it it was kind of ridiculous so if you're finding yourself with us with an injury due to a hair straightener this unit is definitely going to be for you so thanks for watching bubble man's world everyone [Music] you", "PwwxFh01X-U": "what up YouTube we are gonna be doing that rosin press video today this must set up some what we're looking like when we charge all my product in there what we have right here is about 2 grams of some outdoor pineapple Thai what I've been doing lately because I've been using these right here instead of parchment paper I've been getting a little better return and also [ __ ] hell of a lot easier to to collect it off of these the natural parchment paper so this is just what I've been doing baby I'll get it over it up like this talk about that you can see I'm trying to do all this show one hand cover it up like this and I'll set it on the heat pad for a minute close them like uh that these get a little warm for about 10 seconds but I've been doing then just give it a press let it do its thing for a little bit and get my get my product in return about in I don't get none of that crazy using [ __ ] out of the sides I don't press that much so I'm not gonna give you guys like a little run like that the most I do in this little setup right here this is a half ton it's a thousand pounds a thousand psi is right here so pretty much half ton so long only do about two grams sometimes I'll do four if I'm being lazy I'll throw two sets of pucks like how you just seen in that one I'll throw two sets in there and smash it if I'm being lazy and but other than that I just do about two grams out of time and seem to be getting a fairly good return well I guess the puck felt already nice but that's what we got nice is a fairly good return I just liked it it was immoral over there but that's decently I'll give you guys a scrape and then show you what we're looking like I'll be back what up we're back I'll show you the next step that I do um I'll give one of these ice packs out the freezer and I'll just set this thing on here for about two three minutes let it get cold just cold enough so that that'll oil is nice and hard and then we'll move it to the table and we'll get the screen I'll see you in a couple minutes we're back it's been a few minutes since this thing has been sitting on the ice so uh let's peel it off and see what we get you know just a little bit stuck to that so we'll collect a little bit first and we'll move on to the better yield and get a better better - look at this and then when we're done we'll get a I give you guys actual close-up on the clarity and all that other good [ __ ] stuff that you know matters more but yeah I found this way right here to be the so far that for me the best way easier for some reason this particular strain no matter what temperature I ran it at when I ran it imparts me it was just [ __ ] soul oily that didn't want to collect and we'll just drive me [ __ ] crazy just having to go back and forth back and forth to try to get something that it's just always doing this smearing so I try to figure out easier and better method and figured might as well give these ago he compares on them so I don't know I don't see why you can't smash with him we're gonna do this bigger one now I'm getting nice little collections he will be got going in there get all this little [ __ ] on the outside first just so that I know I don't gotta keep [ __ ] witty I just like to click my [ __ ] so I can get at the dabit I got more in the backroom of this actual strange who that for some reason so I'm [ __ ] reason that [ __ ] turns it turned green when it's in parchment when it some parchment paper that's another thing this oil right here will turn green it wouldn't get this clear wouldn't you nothing it was just straight green so it's another reason why I'm trying to try not new things with my prayers you know I just dyed it so I'm learning regardless so all I gotta say it's a lot better than my first few runs I was [ __ ] up when I was first learning wasting product smashing that to higher temperatures I'm getting it out in it's getting there but uh let me get this all finished raped up and then I'll get back to you guys when it's all collected and I'll show you the finished result all right we're back do you with the final product see if I can get it to come up real quick another reason why I like these I could get this whole little hold it all opinion nothing too big but you can see ladies they're gonna use any filters when I do never ends on time I use filters and when I'm smashing [ __ ] I'm smashing hash only time I use a filter but what we're looking like what I'm dabbing on pineapple tiny outdoor stood that about maybe like an ounce live for this I'm trying to just dab dab slowly what what we're looking like I just wanted to show you guys a little clarity video thanks for watching rate comment subscribe and get your little close-up view of this thing well clearly you look good before you get out of here mmm thanks for watching", "a_Y8loBehR4": "[Music] [Music] guys welcome the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny and we are back for another concentrate review today we are checking out some rosin from 7-10 lives 710 labs they reformed their Colorado company and now they came out to California here we go got a shovel a because it's hard to get on the Denver yeah we actually took the close-ups for this stuff yesterday when we left it in the fridge it was a little cakey but still have a little bit still have a little bit of you know greasiness to it gooeyness left it out overnight after you know basically destroying it [Music] Turkey I'm not usually a huge rosin pin mm-hmm I was just gonna say is it flavorful for rosin or is it flavorful for just an extract in general honestly it's flavorful just for extract in general I guess we should talk about what it is we're smoking we are smoking on some z-cube today now Z cubed is apparently a I guess there's a little bit of a debate on it it's either a three-way crowd like basically skittles back crosses itself a couple times or it's skittles across with OG then cross the skills again either way some skittles taste the rainbow type [ __ ] it is very flavorful and ethylene packs a little bit of a punch it's a little sativa T definitely made me feel a little more like alert who's this barking this is by a dying breed seeds yeah originally third-gen fam [ __ ] i mean i think they probably won 40 50 cups buy this [ __ ] at this one how much every cup this is placed at some point or another multiple times the thing about the skittles is it doesn't look that good when you look at the flowers of it it has about zero bag PB on it does not look good in flower form but goddamn does it taste good I mean I can still taste it on my palate it definitely gave me that opening vibe you know what I'm saying one of those strings that has a super-high terpene content and a relatively low THC content right everybody gets so hung up on the THC numbers and they forget that like without the terpenes and the cannabinoids the THC does out basically nothing for it it all acts together people it all packed together so you know as a result this is one of those strings in my opinion now we're talking about the skittles this is our first time smoking thank you but just the regular old skittles not really my favorite strange smoke if you're talking about flour no not at all but it does make some good concentrates it is a very short flowering plant which on the production side is great you know seven weeks right seven weeks our times so and that's that's amazing I mean eight weeks she's fully done yeah right right so I would love to throw that in my garden strictly for concentrates because you know the flowers trash yeah it is one of those streams though that you know can kind of surprise you as far as when you look at you like oh this right this you look sweet this is some [ __ ] meds but when you smoke it it's one of those sleepers that kind of does pack more of a pleasant you would think right right especially you know it's not the strongest when you talk about dabs but it's right up there with some of the most flavorful [ __ ] the lemon geez a lot of those like orange lemon Terps that just like come through really well on oil for some reason this kind of falls in that same class of church yeah I mean honestly the flour it smokes really good and like a joint or a backward - like I'm not gonna lie but it just doesn't look good you know I'm saying but that concentrates great alright I'm gonna go in and see what to do with the taste you see were to do it with the taste it is hard to get on the batter though that's the one downfall got it the one downfall hard to get on the diver that's the most rosin though we forgot to keep it in the fridge and then you know boom it just waxed out you know I've got the little pocket on it's not a pocket purge because it's not a little but they you know it kicked up in the pocket and that was that now you gotta use shovel to break cover on this stuff I'm gonna discover super blonde yeah how's it taste [ __ ] yeah that was a dabba doo honestly though on the flavor I wasn't very scary to me really no here's the thing about rosin for me especially bubble hash for us and I'm like 95% sure this is Posche rosin is a lot of the stuff you see that looks like this now right yes you know it always kind of just tastes like bubble hash and I don't mean that in a bad way you guys know obviously we used to do it's one of the full-mouth Friday videos like we will have good water to Michael but I like good bubble hash more than I like good rosin that tastes like bubble hash you can bubble there's only those few strings that are really good for you know making bubble hash like sours and all the really greasy strains like that that really make like a bubble hash that actually tastes as true as possible to the natural product one good thing there's GDP in it no there's great babe I got you guys so I wish there was GDP a really original skittles right is wasn't like a grapefruit and a great finish great free really it's a grapefruit and a great page supposedly River and great buddy it should have an eagle everybody knows great babe it's got some peanuts the effect of the shooters pigment it's definitely more of like a head for head as far as the body feeling goes yeah it's pretty much immediate too we had already taken a few dabs or some oil today and feeling it a little bit but this stuff I do Efes is hitting me harder this stuff grab me hot I'm not gonna lie like I think you can tell the baby packaging I'm just gonna say what you think about this packaging this packaging pretty sweet it's pretty slick I do like it I'm not gonna hate on looks like it's got all the regulatory standards on there open up the top here and these flaps right here have a couple little sayings on it this one says oh jeez make better oh gee that's cool I like that and then this one says preserve your Terps keep refrigerated yeah that's one over here to quality drives every decision we make from the garden to the lab to the jar that holds your cash happy beautiful that's beautiful beautiful words from 7-10 labs I'm diggin it packaging 907 as far as overall concentrator I think we shall give this ready yeah I mean this is really good Rosen its fire like I said I just haven't we're not about the rosin yet that gets me to fully commit right you know we're not rousing people we're just gonna wear em I'd rather say that rosin is not the first thing I picked out of the lineup to smoke to some of y'all that might be the first thing you picked out and that's fine by me I'll pick some here BHS it's almost like it's sort of like you know if you looked at it on a spectrum it's like that spot right in between bubble hush you know full mouth and boy right you know right it's just he has never really been a friend to the extracting process when it goes like keeping your terpenes intact and everything and yeah I think the best rosin that I've smoked are at least the turbo is another smoke doesn't in Flour mm-hmm every time I smoked some rosin that's made from bubble like this it kind of just always tastes like a slightly different version of just right so back to the rating I think what your regular right yeah that's great okay overall concentrate rating I think I'm gonna probably have to give the effect on this like a fart like a heat you know I'm not too loaded up but I definitely did get a head change as far as smell targeted in a Tazewell and looks looks our popular tonight because it's really really really Blanc got great looks so I'm gonna go eat 58.5 for Rossum I'm gonna go higher on the effect right now the effect of this is like a nine or ten for me well like from one day yeah I'm taking one dab of that the heck change is really nice cool so I'm gonna go with the night on that smell it was pretty good I'll probably go with a seven their appearance I'm gonna give them a plus one for the packaging so I'm gonna go probably eight so somewhere flavor that's why where I go lower probably six and a half seven something like that yeah so overall I'd say probably a seven or an eight whatever that method is some probably seven or eight eight five I'm being generous today I like it it's a great concentrate 7/10 labs skittles cubed thanks for watching I'm Danny I'm Shane these [Music] you", "9ZbZxhnYIjg": "this is captain dink we're in the Spanish lab again today I'm going to be showing you how to load bottle textile rosin bag extraction what we're going to use today is the nut Smasher 3 point 5 gram 160 micron bags and again we're going to be loading it bottle textile versus slat style like that and bottle textile first of all we have to invert the corners and as you can see here adjust it a little bit with your fingers but that's what you're looking at the corners are going to be overlapping to each other so as the extraction happens it's going to fold in on itself so let's load up three - grams of this beautiful fortune cookies here fresh flour and as you can see there there's 3.5 grams as beautiful once again this was donated to us by the folks up at Bullis farms in that a city California so a bottle textile again what we're gonna do start dropping our flour into our bag and what you want to do is build a foundation as you load your flour I want to fill on the air gaps as you put it into the bag smells beautiful and as you can see we've built our base here we're filling in all the air grabs with the flour so once again on the bottle Tech or Barrel textile whichever you prefer to call it this particular style that happens is again during the extraction itself the bag is going to collapse in onto itself and we're gonna have a nice little round puck left over again on barrel tick you want to leave maybe a half inch at the top of your bag everything else you cut off it doesn't suck up any of the extraction itself and then once you get it to a half inch the other part of barrel tech is you're going to fold the bag over like you what a present one side to the other and then the rear like this kind of load in to the machine this way so let's go over to the note Smasher touch here I'm going to load our bag into the machine as you can see how it folds in and it will accordion in onto itself but instead of going through the whole press process I will show you the result this is the fortune cookie three and a half gram press as you can see beautiful golden rosin and that's what you're looking for is a puck like this using the bottle textile with a nug Smasher is going to give you optimal press and optimal yield using the nug smasher bags once again this is captain dink here in the smash lab until next time", "eRz_xP24Zew": "[Music] little lamb

another video on the king cali channel today and we are going to go ahead and try another gram of rosin by callia [Music] i think it tastes like weed [Music] thanks for watching guys this is a live rosin here so i've kept this in the freezer at home i have it on an ice pack here because i'm visiting lizzy and jesse today i kept it in a little ice pack bag today so that way i could come down here and now i've had it out for a few minutes i'll open up the gram here we're gonna go ahead and use the popco this isn't the pro this is the original um puffco but the tropical rainbow colored one and we're gonna go ahead and use this one just because i didn't have the other one with me this one we're gonna go ahead open brand new now if you look this is ice cream cake this is beautiful i personally love the strain ice cream cake in flower and almost in basically almost any form of cannabis that has been coming and i love the live rosin smell because it's going to come off super sweet inside the dab here i'll give you guys a little info as well on the ice cream cake as i usually do in my videos now for thc it comes in at 69.5 activated chc it comes in really high at 78.84 it has 0.25 cbd and 84.18 cvs let's go ahead and open this up for the first time on camera here and try this out all right it's super pretty super beautiful [Music] oh this is gonna be good let's smell it when you smell it it has a really strong strong cake smell to it just really strong there oh super sweet are you guys our other friends are coming over so i'm trying to film this little video real quick i'm gonna go ahead and get into this who's making some sound we have some puppies in the background now i got this new dab tool i ordered it from gypsy stixx online on instagram it's super cute i did a little post on instagram of it if you want to see it a little more up close there's some rhinestones up here um there's a pointy side and then a little flatter side i personally for rosin do like the flat flat edge side which i'll show you guys on another dab tool i have here oh this one's going to be a little dirty but um this dab tool is a little flatter on the bottom i'm kind of like how a flathead screwdriver would be but a little thinner than that that's really usually nice for rosin and we really hate to break this up but we're going to go ahead and try it so that way we can take a dab of it in the puffco okay i was worried if it would come out too much like a shatter and just break but it doesn't it came out really smooth we're going to get a little bit bigger of a dab here and we're going to go ahead and see i can just get this straight onto the puffco right here perfect now the puffco hasn't been warmed up i haven't taken any dabs just so that i could do this dab and not worry about it melting on me as i put in the puffco and let's go ahead and set the puffco up here we're on white i'm gonna double click it so it heats up and it vibrates we're gonna let it vibrate again because this one is pink at the bottom and i have like pink accents on it it does make it kind of look pink when it lights up but it's not like the puffco pro that lizzie's here watching me film it's not like the puff gopro where i have it set up where it actually lights up pink which i think is my favorite thing but i do have it all set up here it's cute it's little we have the pink accents what more could you ask for let's go ahead and try out this ice cream cake it vibrated it's ready to go what that's really good okay at first i didn't know if i would cop or not i think man third try i'm gonna cough it's gonna make me cough um i really like this this ice cream cake is strong the aftertaste of it is really super strong you really taste the ice cream cake there it's a really strong sweet cakey flavor tastes a little cloudy and i really like that kind of just tastes like i said i like ice cream cake i like gelatos um i like wedding cakes and all that that's something that i personally prefer so i really do like the flavor of this i think that ice cream cake is really nice as well um and yeah so thank you guys so much for watching this is just a quick little video i wanted to do a review as far as the high i get from it you do instantly kind of feel like a nice little head height especially when you use it on a piece if you have it um set to go a little hotter or if you use it through a piece of glass you're going to feel like an instant kind of little headbrush from it but it's nice because it does mellow out it does smooth out it is something that um you will make you feel high for me personally when i take a dab for the next hour or two i'll feel like the main major high of it and then it'll die down um not like a blunt where it can be super instant and then it goes away or an edible where it hits you like an hour later and just stays there i thank you guys so much for watching this video if you have any questions i'll link my social media down below and thank you guys for watching this video alyssa is out bye guys", "GTr1IBU7i0Q": "people bring them from here yeah i'm surprised i still have this many but i made a lot because i was practicing for the cup like those are all [ __ ] yeah i'm getting a bunch of wood wow those are all fresh pressed wow and then these are all fresh pressed seafood solvent with santa claus rock and roll just not for christmas and it is my birthday so i'm gonna have to get it to have a turkey birthday and uh celebrate here and uh there we go these we can dab out up to you right here these are mine these are mine so wow just the ones that didn't make it damn [ __ ] insane doesn't it look insane it literally looks like i like the uh the banana macking door it looks like that same [ __ ] well that's outdoor and that's whole spectrum we can do that yeah let's do that awesome [ __ ] yeah yeah that is the best pipe right now i've been [ __ ] around with this tower with the thing on it and it is actually super intense this way so with the banger on it didn't work but this thing this way it works very well uh jim you have a pipe too yeah and you have two um wands huh sweet jim saves the day together we have a whole set i have two pipes uh and and one and one no no no it's good that you have the two because i'll break it or lose it and i do have two but i break something again yeah i did i stepped on it and broke up i threw it on the ground yeah i was already on the floor yeah thank god um all right so direct in contact with the coils onto the glass and so you do it with um does that work too with like the sticks too where you just put it you can we did remember we did it we did it yeah we did a temperature test on his on the sticks that he uh last time he was doing it on my switch jesus it broke you can't the thing to stay on damn broke in my backpack from being just in there tossing around yeah so you can hold the button on the back now you have to hold it there so this one doesn't have where it works all the time so i have to use a lighter yeah but i don't mind that still is completely functioning torch mode for me yeah mine's not probably functioning torch mode except for when your thumb's on i got this one from frankie because he didn't like having to use the lighter so i was thinking about the book too so what were we planning on covering maybe like what we cover in the class well so honestly i mean that's really up to you i was also thinking though for real there might like when we first started heli bank right in 2018 we just wanted to like see if i personally want to see if there's any literature out so i bought the only book that i found that was a rosin book and it isn't it was a piece of [ __ ] it was a stupid [ __ ] i think we talked about it so we focus on rosin a little bit more it just it like it talked about like kind of the idea of rosin before no one's really put no paper what raw like techniques of ross in and like information information for somebody to grab on how to make surprises and straight up no one has put up the whole process to how to make good rather than why they're bronzing is coming out black and white they were literally making like bro like brown rose and they're like yeah and that's a lot we can cover on that too exactly literally just on um on like product quality cured versus not here there's a book there but to go into everything that you teach in the newest class like the solvent that's why what i sent you was the trichome textbook the idea is just like how to really like you're going to make it into a whole like it's going to be a series that would be like a 100 book that's what i thought was a big fat book 60 to 100 or something like that it'd be fat somebody that really actually wants to do this is gonna invest 60 is like you know i feel like it wouldn't even that would not like give honor or whatever the [ __ ] to the amount of information we're gonna try and the time that we're gonna put into it but it'll make it accessible to people so that's the only reason i put yeah number there but i'm not like stuck on those numbers i'd be 100 willing to be like no we're saying 100 so only people that really [ __ ] want this information are going to buy it i guess that really will determine on how much we want to invest in it making it like well that's controller-wise picture-wise it's gonna have to be that's the thing yeah it's gonna have to be like the best [ __ ] be exactly depending on how much money we invest in it to do it um we'll really directly relate what we're gonna have to charge for it exactly and honestly though you know if we worked with the right kind of people there are definitely someone in publishing there's somebody in publishing that would be interested in this that could actually that has the right you know whatever the [ __ ] if we were to try to really make it really nice you know and stuff i don't know because also i'm not sure entirely the scale to which you you know you want to make this because i am very into trying to help people to make the best medicine they can you know and putting a book out i think it's the best idea i think that's a good idea i've been i thought about it for three days after that that's all i could think about in the background i think it's a really good idea for us i think for for the people for hash community like you said yeah there really isn't very much information out there for you to get told at all i've been trying i tried to buy books on it too when i started and it's there's really not anything out there it's good it gives you any good no one that's doing it has spent the time to explain to you their techniques really is the thing totally that's it no one's actually they're either doing it or they're not you know and so um no that's it for real and yeah i think it's a great idea i think what we could do is i mean i don't know what your plan was on it we would just split everything that we make on it in half oh totally yeah and then well i know you're always not worried about money because you're [ __ ] afraid oh don't worry about everything's great we'll just but we really should figure it out a little bit like so [Laughter] it knows me for real yeah i think it's really like everything's fine it'll be all great but no but for real though like i so we just split everything we make and what we do is i guess i'm pretty much what i'm expecting is i'm pretty much gonna have to finance anything that we do well no that's the thing honestly to be 100 with you i would actually just gear all of the production i put in like i've been putting a lot of money into the studio and uh my teeth for a while last year was paying for [ __ ] surgery and [ __ ] like that but i make a good decent bit i just like to project it towards something so like i've been putting my money towards my camera and stuff i'm saving for a better lens and [ __ ] like that so it's like that's thousands blah blah blah i'd rather seriously we're going to focus on the book that's why when i texted you i think i said something 2021 sounds to me like i'll focus a lot of energy on that yeah i think that's gonna be amazing because i think there's a lot of you there you're adding a lot of value to it on how much you'll you'll focus on it too straight up totally dude so um what we'll do is we'll just split everything um like what we would do what i was thinking is um 50 50 on on all our outgoing costs yeah and then 50 50 on whatever we make on it totally and then whatever we could especially if you have some funds on it we'll be able to split that up and be able to finance it i would imagine fairly you know um decent i don't know how much we don't need to spend a ton of money i don't think to make it but it would be definitely going to cost some money to be able to get it published and to be able to get it printed um and i think that um i mean we're probably not going to make very much money on it but maybe in the long run we will and uh i think it'll really give us not really the word credibility i would say because we don't really need i don't really need credibility right but in the sense that the emerald cup winning gave me credibility it will do that it'll solidify my our teaching of it i think in the sense that like uh people will want to learn from us more have more access to want to know to learn from us have the ability to find out information and pass our information on to other people and get our information just out there definitely all right cheers in the book cheers i have one question for frank after this one in regards to what you were saying with publishing and talk that tastes like fruit no it is fruit what was that one that was the secret orgasm happened wow fruit pollution yeah it's like those phenols that they did this year they killed three or four different oh yeah there was there was a lemon head and then there's there's limited seat four i think oh okay i'm confusing it all right there's eliminated 48 lemon head like seven so you're right yeah yeah okay two women had ziddles okay and then there was lemon head they used to otherwise elsewhere that's what i think you're remembering because i've seen that we did that too but that [ __ ] tastes better oh wow second that read actually it's ridiculous that's so that's the technique i'm gonna do i don't know about consistency but i've been really refining my washes and that's how it got cleaner i feel and i'm gonna this is what i'm gonna replicate for the cup and just sweet for the lemonade zittles c4 so just to break it down you took the fresh press and then it let it butter and then whipped it crushed it would play it you had bird tech yep yep i just pretty much did bird check to it i filled the jar up shut the jar and then um slowly let it let it just warm up and then you divide the grams after that yep after i day after it has to sit for a day because sometimes it'll like dry a layer or like look dry because you didn't remove all the oxygen out it's like almost impossible to sometimes some strains is that the bubbles in the fresh press uh i think a lot of that is that but it's it's also just when when you have hash cure it is gonna have holes in it from from the curing process god that shit's good yeah that is a [ __ ] very uh unique program [ __ ] good isn't it yeah is that what it is it's the lemon that i'm feeling oh that's so good i hope i replicated just like that for my tough entries because i think that is a good chance to win the motor breath is that's i'm going with whatever that's why is that the whole plant that you talked about harvesting no i haven't watched that yet oh jesus christ well that's exciting i haven't watched any of that yet yeah wow that makes sense yeah that must be ridiculous that's gonna be ridiculous yeah wow and i'm gonna watch all that and then i'm gonna watch the stuff that my wife made at our house i grew up in our house too she's like an ice cream cake by white mango oh [ __ ] oh wow that's crazy what the [ __ ] is that gonna be know i'll watch that that might be the fourth one i entered for the cup wow how it turns out i just haven't decided what my fourth entry will be mango cake wow that's awesome wouldn't that be cool and nice day for a white mango wedding nice day for a while my wedding yeah yeah that would be good that is amazing that is the white wedding yeah so so yeah that's what i have to do to that to get it to cure like that though because sometimes like even this one right here it's it's not as wet as it would be if i crushed it down one more time whoa so if you had done that with the whole i did the whole run you're saying like all the way together if you would continue one like sometimes like this lemonade settles if you just crush it down once it's like so derpy and so like its own weight kind of helped you do that process and it was like so so like uh um the um the viscosity of it was was was less of like thinner viscosity so that when you crush it it's helping you do that process it's where if you got like a thicker denser mask there's gonna be harder to actually crush it a hundred percent down and perfectly without still being voids and still sometimes hash kind of cures again like it just takes a second you know like you you think it's all done caring and and you crush it down and it'll look wet and then the next day you'll open the jar up and it will be dry looking because it's still needed a little bit more time too and like because like gravity kind of crushes it down on itself too you know so the viscosity of it i think is what plays a role because when the viscosity is thinner like this lemon head zibbles you just crush it once it'll be fine it'll stay wet the next day it's only when the scarcity is a thicker viscosity when you're pressing it or any you know what i mean like if you can grab your gloves and it's easy to grab your gloves that's like usually a thicker viscosity um like if it's if it's so thin like you try to grab with your gloves it'll like smear on your gloves so like that viscosity is going to lend you to easier crush it down and get that process you're trying to achieve to happen because what you're trying to do is just remove all the air it's doing that for you in a gravity sense in its sense of how it's laying its terps you know what i mean so like a denser one as it cures and the thc binds with itself in there it's gonna be like crystallized and the terps won't be like washing them off like kind of like interpreting making it really derpy so some some strains i have like that happen faster and some take longer and it's when it's terpier the viscosity is higher it takes longer because the thc account buying through it is easy it's like terpier and so you'll have to crush those down a couple times sometimes so you'll want to wait a couple of days if you see it at room temperature for two days sit like that terpe you know it's not going to change whoa okay you know what i mean but if you make a jar big ass jar like 20 grams or whatever i crush it all down and i see if i go and i come and open it the next in two days and it's it's dry then it wasn't done i gotta crush it down again and now if i was to put it all out and portion it all up then you wouldn't be able to redo that so you got to do it all right and have it where it i would say two days is a sufficient time sometimes you can do it within a day you could definitely tell within a day what it's going to kind of happen if it if it's going to be a dryer it'll have changed a little in a day if it's not going to stay freezer that was my question yeah freezer or yeah yeah i i so the freezer is going to slow your preserving when you put it in the freezer so you're going to slow this process down so it's going to take longer for you to be able to tell anything so like when i'm trying to find out if i'm trying to make something wet like a whipped consistency then i'm really i'm very i'm leaving it at room temperature for it to happen and that happens a lot faster than like a temple ball if you take it and age it in a refrigerator you're stopping the process of making the temple by preserving it inside so you don't want to do that to make a temple just like when you make wine you don't store wine in a refrigerator you store wine in a wine cellar and that's because wine is fermenting just like the temple ball is so you don't want your temple on the refrigerator nor would you want to put something refrigerator that you're trying to achieve a consistency if it is over a time process so if it's going to take you so that would take a longer time to do it and you could probably figure out on how to do it that way with time but you're gonna have to like probably wait a week or something before you can come back and get it to achieve the same thing it would achieve sitting out for a day just like making wine if you put in a fridge it might make wine but it's gonna take forever it's not going to make wine like it does it normally because it needs that that somewhat of a ability to not be in a frozen state or preserved state so that it can happen so like if i was trying to make fresh pressed i put it in a freezer directly after i press it now by doing that it locks it all in to stay clear longer at room temperature afterward but considerably longer if i don't take the fresh press and put in the freezer right away the thc can start binding and it will in the freezer it'll just take longer but it can still happen but if you don't let it ever bind and you froze it right away when it was still translucent like right after you pull it off the press it it froze those thc crystals in in state before they could find each other so it takes longer for them to find each other because it's this thick ass dense oily mask that you put it into now and it's all cooled down because it's in a freezer so it's going to take a long time for it to get to that side and body with itself on a molecular chemical level wow so yeah so you can like make fresh press last longer like if i want if i want to make it have a better shelf life that's what you have to do you have to put in a freezer and funny me and bloodsmith both found this out separately testing separately and both came to the same conclusion separately without talking to each other and then talk to each other about it afterward and both had tried this and found out that yes if you put your first freshly pressed fresh pressed in the freezer right away and then you portion it up that's the one of the reasons we found it i found it was because you can't portion fresh press very well and it doesn't look very good if it's not perfectly like in a jar nice coin in my mind so if you put in a freezer right away you can take it out of the freezer and break it into chunks and in a cold room even if it's really gooey [ __ ] you have a tiny bit like a minute that you can shatter all your trunks up get your grams weighed up and you can even like throw it right back in the freezer if you need two per second it's like really going to be strained and pull right back out and you'll have enough time to like squeeze it into a ball kind of then you can put it in your jar and what happened was i started doing that and i had leave left in the freezer overnight so i wasn't going to prepare it until the next day that's when i started finding it out and then putting two and two together and trying it to work noticing if i put my fresh press in the freezer right away for like at least a few hours to fully fully freeze if the whole hour dense puck however long it would take to fully freeze that maybe eight hours depending on how big of a chunk you did you know maybe 10 hours but fully freeze it then pull it out portion it up you could after you portion it up you could leave that jar at room temperature and it will take considerably longer for it to butter up than if you didn't do that if you didn't leave it for you if i never put in the freezer oh okay like or if i grab them all up like if i pressed the rosin and then grabbed all the rosin up and then like let's say finally got it into the freezer hours later that would still take that butter up way faster than if you put in the freezer right after pressing it because you freeze that state right away before the th that's like right when it's translucent that thc has not valid itself yet and that that's why it's not cured at all yet there's no whiteness to it so you need to freeze it in that state immediately then you can grab it up later after it's been fully froze and then you can pull it out and put it at room temperature and it would take way longer to to turn to fresh press or to turn to a cold cured than if you just press some rosin grabbed it up and put it out that stuff would turn to cold cure right away right away there's something about that it finds itself if you let it just be gooey warm and then cool down and then even put into a refrigerator it doesn't like freeze the state even if you grab it all up put in a refrigerator that's not going to achieve it you gotta press your oven put it in the freezer right away the way i do it is i put it on parchment paper and i fold the parchment paper into like a a pouch and then put in a ziplock bag a freezer a freezer bag and then freeze it right away and then i'll pull that out and break it into chunks and then that's how you can actually manage it to where it's it's a manageable piece like a ball and then push it into a jar like a perfect coin because you made a ball first and then you put the ball in the coin and you can push that ball out into and if your room's cold it doesn't really matter how gooey it is especially if it's like fully frozen you have a little bit of time to kind of get to manipulate it play with it so that's just one technique and trick i i have done that i can for sure say is significantly uh extends the shelf life of fresh frozen staying as fresh frozen versus it turning to a cold cure it'll give you a longer shelf life of it staying translucent it'll last longer as translucent like if i pull a jar in the fridge i mean it's no joke because i was wondering because the uh the lemonhead skittles that i just bought most or actually i'm sorry motorhead fresh pressed that stuff stayed fresh pressed out of the fridge for a long time it could be that it's cold in here but for a minute yeah that's one of the things that i've noticed is when you do that it'll it'll lengthen the time that you get it as fresh press well that's badass it's cool to be able to do that because people like having it as fresh press and it's really hard to give that to somebody because it create changes right away like if you don't try to do something to it right if you don't at least freeze it right away it won't stay like that i just now know that you've explained this too i just now have realized the difference in the rosins that i've been getting where they were either fresh frozen or cold cured so it was just now that i just realized those two different consistencies kind of well so like um then uh bud smith's thing he um his looks similar they're both buttered nicely but his was fresh pressed one is fresh frozen and one of them is is cold cure and that's actually where you kind of see this they're both fresh frozen fresh frozen they're both fresh pressed too though yeah buttsmith only does fresh i believe yeah right that's all yeah okay then when you say the cold cure it to it so but smith whenever you get something from him it's going to be frozen first like i just explained to you yeah because he's making it uh to sell out as or to be used as fresh pressed um now whenever you just take a jar fresh press it's eventually going to turn itself what you would like to call maybe cold cured because it is sat into a cold room after it had been fresh pressed so now would be called cold cured right wouldn't be considered whip because he doesn't remove the oxygen from it no one actually whips anything there's no actual whipping going on especially and [Laughter] we know he's not whipping anything but yeah so then it'll have a different texture and and i i feel like a cold cured fresh pressed gram is going to deteriorate and break down faster than if you would have crushed the oxygen out of it and allowed the terpenes to actually separate from the rosin in a sense of peanut butter doing that with the oil that's mixed into peanut butter and preserving it and allowing oxygen not to permeate through and actually break down the rosin so i don't agree or like or think anyone should promote cold cured i think cold cured in in my mind would be one step away from making it correct would be removing the oxygen from it so you're actually one step away from doing a really good job so if i explain if i understand this correctly the the bird tech is the crushing right and then the whipping it is literally it like literally they would almost they would look identical if people just look at them so your tech though actually preserves it and makes it last longer whereas this one is exposing the action doing the exact opposite what you're talking about exactly so intense so i do understand it yeah okay so that is so crazy and when you first explained that to me i was overwhelmed because all the whip stuff is what everybody posts online and it's called whipped and what you're doing looks like that but it's the more intellectual actual functional part yeah we're like breaking it down a little bit on what we want to achieve and what should be done to to make the process of it um lengthen shelf life and make it better and it's in its process and people are just trying to achieve a better color they're not trying to to think further ahead right that's the problem last longer it's just gonna be a color for the day okay they buy it it looks sweet right there had this like really cool consistency with these like filled it full of deteriorating pieces of oxygen you know very fragile yeah exactly exposed so like like think about it egg if you made like a really good like i don't know what it is like like it's like a souffle or something right when they're like the dude's like folding the [ __ ] the cream like the phone right he's like folding it in like what if you were just over there beating the [ __ ] out of his phone that he just made and you're like just whipping the [ __ ] out of it he would lose his [ __ ] mind right he'd come over and slap the [ __ ] out of you yeah you know hey he's like what the [ __ ] did you just [ __ ] do to that [ __ ] foam i just made you just thought you'd whip it like a slave master they just whip the [ __ ] out of it it's ridiculous i see videos of that [ __ ] you know who does it really bad as blue river turps oh really i see like he has those tall jars like those big tall ones they're like this big around yeah and the whole jar will be like you could tell you've been whipping because it'll be whipped [ __ ] all over the jar i don't have like this much in the bottom of the jar yeah that time they're [ __ ] just whipping the [ __ ] and it's white as [ __ ] [ __ ] let me tell you it looks [ __ ] gorgeous expected they turned it into butter though wow and so this shit's gonna break down rapidly and it's gonna taste like [ __ ] from the inside out i mean come on there's no way around it wow so that you have to you have to think about what's happening like also i mean we should i mean i have a really access to a really good microscope at the farm i should probably be doing some more um studying and figuring out things with the microscope because a lot of this i'm telling everybody is like i don't have a picture to show anybody but like i could show you the super i'll show you a cold here what cold pure fresh press looks like under a microscope would look [ __ ] ridiculous yeah no you could see all those crevices i'm talking about so that would look like a cornbread on the inside not a cream as a as an example of these two are these the whipped and you're whipped and you're a fresh press are these the example of the fresh press held in its true fresh press position with that and then the whipping being the cold cured one yeah so you know what the next episode is reviewing the two of those yeah yeah one for the yeah exactly that's what exactly it is that's what it is it's my version i call whipped i tried to change the name while back um to um crushed cold cured or cold care crush or something nobody liked it and and nobody understood it i started explaining it to people over and over and then i could see like when i was explaining to them i was going right over their heads it was like too much information dude i'm gonna look into it because there's definitely some something in the food industry that is doing that to get the oxygen out of something like pressing it with it love though with not pressing it you know there's something i want to figure out this makes total sense yeah like he said fold it when you let's see instead there's a there's a technique when you when you've made um foam when if chefs made foam and when you introduce that to like a a pie or something you want to make or you want to make a meringue pie look at making meringue pies it's exactly that make the meringue the meringue is like really airy full with air that part of it you don't is not directly related because they have to introduce the air to make the meringue like that but once you've made the meringue you don't just you have to fold that in so gently to the rest of the ingredients to blend it in correctly it's very gentle and and but if you don't do it correctly you'll just have big ass pockets of foam and it won't be blended with the whole thing when you make a cake like a meringue i mean yeah i mean wow that's interesting and so it it's similar to that but like um i i think really breaks down to is just visually the ox the the cavities that have surface area available to the available surface area to be broken down is what we need to break down that's what we're trying to achieve is the only less surface area that's available for oxygen to break down the rosin just like why we why we don't want bubble hatching in a bubble hatch form too much surface area exposed to the trichome we want to crush it yes so that now the surface area is very minimalized like it's the same thing you know like you're still needing to do that once you've made the rosin so you think you have done it and you're done well you're not if there's a bunch of surface area that can be very interesting in there you need to still now further refine that down to be removing the oxygen in it that's why i call it crushing it because realistically that's kind of what you're doing is crushing it and i crushed it into the corner of the jar now we should talk to nicotia about it more at this class too because i heard him in his live video the other day explaining whipped then he explains it the same exact way it was really funny about how you crush it into the jar he said it's the same way as you explain it yeah yeah okay so that's crazy yeah and we don't really work together nothing you know what you mean yeah for sure yeah and it's like he totally explained it that way you're not whipping it he said you're actually crushing it down in the corner of the jar he said so it's definitely that's hilarious well recognized something we're figuring this out and he's a very smart guy he's probably figured out more on a technical level too what i'd like to hear what he has just well just like yourself i mean damn dude that was interesting as [ __ ] on the technical level just now so that's exactly how i like i'd like to hear what he is his take is on it too because it would be really weird like if he came up with the same hypotheses as me doing this in a totally different state far from each other not really using information from each other like in the case like if scientists were developing something in two different areas we we're not using each other's information to take our studies with his information you know making it to where mine's not you know so it is it is really crazy and weird to hear him say it like that right away too and so that's what i think is happening is it's just no one's realizing we need to further finish the process because you think you've made rosin you think you've done that and you have you have right then but if later on it it still cures up and it's dry looking then you've needed to do it again you need to remove that oxygen you know what i'm saying so would you recommend doing that once every some amount of time then i would recommend doing it one time right in the beginning letting it sit for maybe 12 hours or 24 hours and checking on it and if it starts to dry up then i would do it again if it doesn't you don't need to do it again that'd be possibly introducing oxygen into it that you didn't because you did it correctly and the process worked out with the way the terpenes are maybe like i talked about more viscosity the viscosity is a lower viscosity so it's like more more more of a thin so that it can crush down on itself easier already so like if if it's done you don't need to do it again it's done if it stays wet with that terp layer on top then you've achieved it it's not going to do that if there's surface area for those terpenes to go lay in like if there's cavities or crevices inside that rosin now if it has cured up more not necessarily dried but look dried out because the thc has bound with itself and then caused a little cavity inside there now once it bow itself because crystallize is kind of when it binds it's going to have little gravities cavities underneath it and then terpenes are going to go find it and lay in it and then you can't see them now they're inside the rosin in those little tiny holes they're puddles made all throughout under a microscopic level so you need to go back down in there and remove all those tunnels those holes all those things that were where the crystallized like because crystals aren't square or circle or anything nice so when they lay on each other there's gonna be spots all over the place where it can be a big hole wow i was just starting to get like really into figuring out about hash but i feel like it's on a more molecular level with rosin yeah that is crazy that's awesome this i think this is the story the science behind why everything is not shelf stable in this world why it's you know that's one of the freezer if you care about one of the things that you got me it got me into thinking about these different processes is trying to extend shelf life yeah boom exactly you open my mind to that whole aspect of it and why i think that you know things are the way that they are it adds so much price i feel like to them and all that stuff because it has to be in a cold truck the whole time and all this [ __ ] so and the end consumer it's like most people just they don't even know what's up not only has it been a cold truck it has to be a cold truck it has to be sent at just the right angle it can't be on its side or upside down so when it's like packaged it has to be packaged in the truck on a different level i keep i've done any weed or any other product that these guys have touched wow because they could just throw pounds of weed in their truck like these guys have to like put it in a box that's like strapped down or something or like secured correctly you know like in a bigger box that closes or something you can't just have them flying around in the back of your truck um totally it's like way more steps to this thing like you said of course the value's gonna go up yeah because there's so many more hands having to be involved and it takes a more intelligent person that's not just more intelligent a more educated on this aspect person to be able to yeah to be able to manage all the steps of it to get to the store so you have to have somebody that wants more money because he spent the time to to know how to talk to to to touch these things you know to to like to to to to take them from one star to the next like you said you have to have a refrigerated truck you have to have a [ __ ] you can't have them upside down you can't be [ __ ] you can't be crushing in the box that they're in or the you know i mean you can't be [ __ ] them up like there's a lot more to it you you can't you got to be more delicate and there's more steps to the process and since there's more steps to the process it always adds more money straight up just like when you make a tiffany bracelet it costs a lot more money and it's only a silver bracelet it's not even that much like i bought my wife a tiffany bracelet one time and it really opened my eyes though because you're like what the [ __ ] did they charge someone [ __ ] money for this thing for silver it's just silver solid silver but it's like 600 for a bracelet right just silver links you start looking at the links though and like touching them because you spent 600 on it so you're really going to [ __ ] look at it you're like what the [ __ ] wow sure does feel nice like you can't find a link like a cut into like oh like wow they put them all together now they're like perfect perfect like you can't find where it was split you can't find an imperfection in each link every [ __ ] one of them and they like is polished to perfection and it feels like different than you've ever felt and it's like okay i'm starting to see why this thing costs so much money now like wow someone spent a lot of time on this yeah someone went through a lot of trouble to make sure i couldn't see one line where it was split not one not even just a line you can't see where they grounded down and made it it's perfectly the same size all the way around somebody had to you know how hard that would be to do right that's why they have their name and that's what i appreciate you know it's like that's why you have to appreciate time and and someone's art that's when someone does that and they put their heart into something like that someone's but the machine made that thing perfect like that and they put their heart in that thing and then you go okay i want how much time did you [ __ ] spend on this john yeah we're charging 700 bucks for these and everybody's like sure i'll take one straight up not going to get anywhere else oh i just bought my wife a tiffany uh necklace for christmas that's what her present is she doesn't know but that's awesome it's pearls and silver and like nice dude you know when it comes from tiffany's i didn't even get to see it but like like we talked about i know the quality is gonna be on another level i can see in the pictures that it looks like it is but i know that's how it works when there's somebody like tiffany's and that's what i always try to strive to be is something like that where you just know it's going to be that quality you don't have to even you could see it but you don't have to you're not going to question it no without a doubt yeah you know it's going to come like oh okay i see why you charged me so much for that i just used them as an example the other day i feel like i just used tiffany's as an example yeah it is it's a good one i use it even like i take i took pictures of tiffany's in the box of tiffany's to my my designer i'm like dude check me look at this [ __ ] these [ __ ] get a lot of money for this box you know it's like special box right mm-hmm dude for real no it's because you're not a chick yeah so like for real i didn't either okay yeah so tiffany's box is special it's this special color that their boxes are it's like this bluish teal and it's a standard box that you would think of and it has a lid on it and then above it's like white and it it's like just their their their brand thing you know like tiffany's box let's pull it up he's pulling it up right now oh this is office yeah you gotta see it this is something i wanted i took it to them and i'm like dude we gotta copy this [ __ ] too they're on it they know what they're doing see it's like this special looking box like so if you see that box you don't even nee you just know you got a tiffany something from tiffany's the color and the the shape and the bow mm-hmm it's all this like like they have different sizes so they have something whatever it is it's all there yeah they have like they even have vases bosses and [ __ ] you know i mean like they have all sorts of [ __ ] yeah oh yeah there's all the information on it and stuff yes and then you like open it up there's another box inside of it there's like another one inside of it wow yeah see wow yeah so you you you go and you can tell though like when you get it like my wife draws the box in our safe yeah like that's that's that's where i started to steal my ideas from is what companies like that because that's how everybody works i mean come on and they all were all they spent a lot of money on that show no no joke 710 labs have the nicest [ __ ] boxes yeah they're the nice and they're the one and the other one of the boxes i always take to the to my designer too i'm like i want one like this magnus yeah totally i love that like i was that's one of the ones we're gonna do next is a a thicker cardboard box like theirs is where it's like and it's a clam shell like a wedding ring they magnetize it's very similar to theirs because they're not they know what the [ __ ] they're doing yeah no totally this is the center wood yeah i mean they did the research because i've done it too and i've looked and i couldn't find anything better still to this day if i put my logo on one of those boxes you know it would look like it would be [ __ ] good amazing yeah so i'm gonna do that for like some special special a box or something i'm thinking like you know like a limited edition temple yeah yeah cool probably like different one of them different strains mm-hmm 20 strains of stuff yeah no kidding yeah i got like kiwi oh you have old oh okay like the the flavors that otherwise would never be made into temple balls oh my god that's extremely exciting yeah like a whole bunch because like i've been getting more and and uh that guy that was here the other day um nick nicholas black yes okay yeah was uh he's like wanting some more loved it dude he loved it loved and he was like dude because he he needs medicine like real medicine like he'd been in bed body pain been bedridden for like a year and that's why he had to quit his job and [ __ ] like so he he was like blown away he's like dude this stuff's different he's like this is like [ __ ] medicine bro stretch what he said he's like i never i i did yard work all day it's like i'm about to do that in a long time he's like i put in eight hours and i'm like sore but like normal sore not like dead sore like he's like did i [ __ ] feel i can get my life back that's honestly amazing yeah it's [ __ ] amazing it's amazing to hear that so it's like and and like i was been thinking that i feel like uh there um i need to treat it more like a currency kind of like me putting gold in the safe because if i make a bunch of temple balls it's just money no straight up i mean and man those are that's the coolest expression the people that appreciate it yeah [ __ ] love it so that's awesome bro and you're starting to get more people that are actually appreciating it straight like i kind of went away from it and i have plenty for just me mm-hmm if i'm just smoking yet yeah yeah but if people are going to be appreciating them more like they are and i i do feel like i told you before i feel like temple balls are going to come back i think it's going to take i think it's this quality maybe maybe six years i feel like maybe less because i feel like the society progresses in a um what they think is cool totally you know totally good right totally so so um and so like then once they start doing that then they'll do research on it once they feel like it's cool because then they'll figure it out straight up but like like dog food like people fired out it figured out it's cool to feed your dog good dog food so they all started researching dog food and now nobody buys kibbles and bits for their dogs anymore dude no straight up when you said that to me it clicked and it made sense that like we are definitely fighting the same war because i had been saying this [ __ ] about food about just like literally go back to long island where i'm from i left there and you could not find any quality organic food as a food desert no local food nothing like that i go back there and there's like quite a good decent bit of health food stores and i'm like oh okay it's starting there even in a food desert you know where food is getting imported there yeah it is very coming here it's really it's actually coming quickly yeah i think like even in the last two years from when you would like have to go find somewhere to eat if you were a vegetarian you were harvard i'm having a hard time i am into exactly now you have a lot more options literally and like tenfold exactly and so i feel like that is is is the exact same way the weeds gonna trend is becoming cool now weeds becoming people are finding out it's medicine people are finding out okay then they're gonna go okay well we've been smoking bho yeah exactly they're gonna be like wait what all it's gonna take is once you start figuring out that you're shining arms you're not smoking you're not you you don't want to feed your dog kibbles and bits anymore the second you feed that found out you were feeding your dog your body kibbles and bits you're gonna go whoa see man would you like to collaborate with me on my book because for real i've been working on this project and i feel like you you have the same passion for it and you can help me to write it it is the cannabis conspiracy and that's why they've been oppressing it the whole time because once you [ __ ] really learn about cannabis and love it and see that the people that are growing it are [ __ ] working hard they're not lazy that is a [ __ ] mind control thing you know once you really get in comp into the lifestyle and stuff you realize that it you know i can grow this i grow my own food i'm gonna consume everything that i'm doing that and put it out into the world you know just the best that i possibly can i think that's the kind of what's going i think that's true i mean i think that everybody just does it what and then once you find out and you think it's cool then you do your research on it and you go oh [ __ ] it's not cool to feel my dog pills in bed which one is the cool one to feed my dog you know no seriously though especially with a dog is a good example because i always say about weed like um people young kids 20 year olds they're not they're not like yo vegetables i'm going to learn how to go grow vegetables but straight up with weed the 20 year old kids are excited about it the food that is the thing dog food is something that is going to get people to care about their health or that people think about more than they care about their own health because they want their animals for 40 years 10 years exactly exactly i'm willing i thought i was feeding my dog the best dog food because i was looking for like the best most expensive ones straight up and i thought that was the best one i didn't do my research i would look at the bags the bags would trick me it would like be cool like i would give a pro plan because they sold it the dog the vet my vet would tell me to sell it because they get money on a cut on all the bags of [ __ ] dog food i wasn't thinking about any of that i just thought i was dude go upstairs walk out of the room walk out of the [ __ ] room guy jesus christ i was just thinking that it's the you know what i mean is it's just definitely was the best that i was supposed to do that was telling me to feed my dog this food and straight up any research on it and then my wife was the one that told me to get it and then once you do was you like oh [ __ ] i thought i was feeding my dog the best literally shay has the exact same story yeah i had no idea i was [ __ ] killing my dog and then i was lining your pockets just right in the world it's like bho is similar to that in the cannabis ministry you go to these places and they're pushing it because they're making the most money on it at this different tree they're making the most money on the bho product so that's what they're pushing and then the people that are coming in that are uneducated or just buying what they think is the best [ __ ] and some of these companies are putting good bows and ribbons on it and then making it look really cool and really cool names of different things to trick you they're stealing the same names too live resin and then they're they're now doing like they'll put like numbers on there to trick you like you know how you'll see 70 to 120 and uh for like a u for like rosin yes yeah yeah no bho will actually put things like 70 to 120 and if you look really close it'll say hours in an oven back up no dude oh my god that is nuts just 120 they'll say 120. and you're like oh look it's 120 of you that says 128 hours in an at a vac oven dude that is [ __ ] cool so they're not just playing gimmicks with people that don't know what they're doing so it's not i don't think it's going to take six years it's what started me on this you know i don't think it's gonna take very long at all because people are picking up on it trending it's very trendy and once people picking up on a trend they're gonna just google it mass consciousness it doesn't take very hard for you to figure this out so fast nowadays [ __ ] google cannabis and google what your box that you're smoking just start googling that [ __ ] the bh what is it made of let me google that that's it you'd be done just like we did with dog food what is on the dog foods bag we start reading it and going son of a [ __ ] look what's on the ingredients list for our dogs food look at your [ __ ] hash box that would be the same thing blow your [ __ ] mind on the bho [ __ ] that's on there and that's not even all the [ __ ] that they're telling you that they're dealing with just like just dog food [ __ ] so like of course if you could break it down to like they did with dog food they took all the ingredients out that are fun just limited the ingredients down to barely anything just like making hash you make it from the barely any ingredients ice water heat pressure that's like all that's involved so of course when you make it out of the most basic things you know it's going to be better that's how everybody's finding out too i lasted the test of time thousands of years making instead of [ __ ] you know that's why it won't be very long people finding out no i know people still to this day that i'll be like um you know what bh people don't know what bho is they don't even know that bho is made with butane my father didn't know this not very long ago that he had no idea that to make stuff that he would smoke live resin that it was made with one of the [ __ ] these yeah exactly he had no idea it was literally not even figuratively like literally with this tip they put it over a tube that they blast this over the cannabis and then once it rinses over all of it it just drips out the bottom this liquid drips right right right that is what then they try to get this liquid out of it and then you smoke it yeah no totally it's the most no clue the most insane concept that is really how he was smoking because he didn't know he had no idea he'd seen it and it looked cool like diamond shapes and it's kind of translucent color it's pretty bho looks pretty for the most part yeah i mean until the raw you become educated but when you first see it and you see it and you think of concentrate you're like oh cool stoked on the gimmick of getting concentrated cannabis you know exactly and you see it you think it's an amazing idea and then you start smoking it and it looks like cigarettes too you smoke bho you don't realize it's [ __ ] you up like when you smoke cigarettes you could smoke packed cigarettes all day long if you smoke cigarettes you're fine with that right if i smoked a cigarette i would die yeah it would just ruin my throat totally but if somebody smoked cigarettes they could smoke a whole pack a day it doesn't [ __ ] their throat up doesn't mean it's not [ __ ] your throat up yeah exactly [Laughter] [Applause] that's not what's happening it's not that you're getting hurt more than me i mean i'm going to hurt more than you because i'm physically showing signs of it it's you have done now tainted your palate so much that you don't even know the bho is [ __ ] you up and the reason it [ __ ] me up is because i haven't smoked bho and if i do smoke a tiny bit of it i will pick up that and it'll actually [ __ ] me up like if i smoked a tiny bit of tobacco it would [ __ ] me up if there was a tiny bit of tobacco on my bong rip it would [ __ ] me up but i could smoke bomb roots all day long because i've used it like what's the opposite it works the same way too if a guy just smoked tobacco all day he tried to do a bomber he's done you you bet you you have to be used to it and if you're not he's gonna [ __ ] you up and that's what's deceiving too because people are like vho doesn't [ __ ] me up well it doesn't because you smoke it all day because you're used to it just like cigarettes don't [ __ ] people up that smoke cigarettes all day long yeah your throat doesn't hurt when you smoke vho all day long you're [ __ ] yourself up you just don't realize it because you like [ __ ] that thing up like telling you yeah that's what i was trying to say exactly um what's called the bio um [ __ ] but yeah you know your body telling you something yeah it's like you [ __ ] that up you don't even got that one to tell you it's like you [ __ ] that thing up the good [ __ ] angel has left you're dealing with the devil now that's it so it's like what it is it seems like two so you yeah you just have to be educated on it and then exactly bottom line yeah it is it's the bottom line because like i say also about food i still eat taco bell i still eat jack-in-the-box i'm not as good as you but i don't do it every day well that's the bottom line too exactly i've always said that one of the reasons i'm so hard on my diet is so that i don't i can if i have to eat whatever the [ __ ] i you know right in the apocalypse i'm gonna eat whatever the [ __ ] and my body's ready for it yeah that too that is part of the thing too i feel like as long as you eat it once in a while that's all yeah you just can't you just can't eat it every day exactly you just can't eat mcdonald's like you saw that movie right or that yeah yeah super size me yeah so exactly you can't do that you can't that's why i tell people about bho you can't super solve it with me you can't do that right make a documentary too now make make somebody just smoke solvent all week no dude that would be so they're a look they're like a full look one of the kids that that'll fight for it to the death though i'll just be like okay cool cool man you're going hard on the bhs we'll make your diet happen this week but we're gonna we're gonna switch over next month it's a 60-day film instead of the third year by the end he's like a fully educated like a lawyer [Music] yeah that [ __ ] it's just like it's just knowledgeable just like damn food just like we did with our organic food a guy we talked to you about millions of times you when you went to the grocery store ten years ago how big was the organic food section it was [ __ ] non-existent it was just a section like you said yeah non-existent in some stores even like in the in the poor areas where i'm from in san diego totally didn't even exist because you weren't going to afford it it was a waste of a space in my store totally like no one had that so it was like stupid we couldn't even witness we were lucky to get a [ __ ] apple you weren't going to be buying those expensive apples right yeah i didn't even know [ __ ] roma tomatoes existed like i was like oh my god there's different totally different heirloom tomatoes and [ __ ] i'm like oh my god what the [ __ ] is this but yeah nowadays just they're [ __ ] not even just a section it's like just mingled throughout the whole store now at this point the organic food has gotten so big they don't even have an organic food section number one straight up no i agree with you it's like just mingled in with everything now straight up it's like you got your organic [ __ ] sour cream next to your sour cream now yeah yeah and it's like that's just how you do it now two shoppers it's not gonna be no no like tiny little section like when we're kids it didn't even [ __ ] exist some of it is just marketing and branding too though because some of this [ __ ] was already organic like some of these places were doing this [ __ ] and i didn't even like market it organic they're like we should promote that we do all organic [ __ ] here no that's hilarious straight up exactly that's the whole point it became you know literally it's it's something that um as i've said about solventlessness and hash in general it's like it's bigger than the people doing it it's a big big thing that's a wave we can't stop it no one can [ __ ] stop it get the [ __ ] behind it or be in the [ __ ] motion that it is on and be part of your [ __ ] move you know i've seen it once once i started having people's moms mom their grandmothers wanting to smoke that's when i started seeing this [ __ ] change though because that's when you're like whoa [ __ ] like grandma is intrigued on this [ __ ] now for her [ __ ] glaucoma right for real and then like finding out like [ __ ] i'm willing because grandma's willing to do whatever at this point because she's trying [ __ ] hydro hydro hydrocut whatever the [ __ ] some crazy pill you know what i mean they put her on i'm sure you know that she gave her crazy side effects at this point she's like what do you mean some some weed that sounds sounds about like the best idea i've heard yet you know what i'm getting straight up straight up let's read what the doctors are giving you in the hospital yeah no not good for real you don't want to know how any of that shit's made that shit's horrible for you and that's like your only option or some pain medicine that's like horrible for you yeah no for real so so right like you said it's a wave is way bigger than all of us and it's coming just because it is many ways hips [ __ ] good for [ __ ] everything and and cannabis is good for everything and it brings people to something that takes like passion and love to two that brings out things and i think everybody too is something like to make the best cannabis it takes someone with passion and love not just some joe show mo [ __ ] [ __ ] that wants a bunch of money that's true though he won't that's friends it doesn't matter yeah chad brad do you see that what she did oh my god she went off bro oh [ __ ] oh my god i was blown away damn i wish i watched that one yeah she's on her page oh today okay it was on she said that all the chads and brads and she went all through because it's like yeah i don't matter how much money you have you'll find out real quickly you still need that guy that takes or a girl that takes pride and passion to grow that plan period bottom line it won't won't happen joe [ __ ] [ __ ] with all the money in the [ __ ] world will find out really [ __ ] quick [ __ ] like they just even did in working with some of them they [ __ ] went big with that and some of them fell on their [ __ ] face because that [ __ ] wasn't as easy as they thought um it's all molded well they started fine some of it they start finding out if they brought it on the stock that it brings up the cbd and drops the thc so you can guarantee a temp wow i remember frenchie saying if you do that never i would never work with you yeah that thing we were at yeah like if you write your plans on the stock people do that a lot like that was a big thing going on in oregon this year in washington where they rotted it on the stock because it brought up the cbd levels and dropped the thc levels so some people were actually doing strains they were ta they were actually cannabis strains because they had too much thc and they were good yielders and they produced really well and they had a good cbd in them and they knew they were just going to rob it so they can get rid of the cbd or the thc in it they did it all intentionally some of them from the beginning right like they started a straight they knew they were going to how are they going to make use of rot just extracts no no um cbd yeah what are you gonna do with that though yeah you totally just turn blast it yeah just like to blast it i guess to make tinctures and [ __ ] yeah yes you just blast into whatever you want not just teachers you can make anything you want yeah whatever you're making whatever you want you just go right to extract if it's just whatever you want food anything you want yeah yeah i'm saying because some actually some were actually selling um him but there was some guys that were trying to really sell like nugs of him i saw when i went to oregon too and there was like it was like high quality hemp like it wasn't bud rot though no no but this guy had small small amounts these guys were rotting it were like that's hundred thousand acres yeah right to extract people grow that for direct extract and they would just provide a few members and then they just grind it up into just a few they grind it up into biomass yeah exactly whole plant fresh piles fresh biomass yeah exactly yeah so yeah it definitely is what it is that's why he takes takes a little bit of um just education because all these companies are just gonna bring in somebody they're just gonna bring in somebody that smarter than me on all this [ __ ] and then just pay them to figure it out because that's the only way you can do it they have to do it you have to bring in somebody that knows what the [ __ ] he's doing and then you can still are going to need a whole team of people that are going to have love and passion for this planner else you're going to produce garbage and that's what that's the separation i think similar to budweiser you're always gonna have a bow wiser you're always gonna have somebody that walks past all the really good beers and decides no i don't want any of those really good [Laughter] at each beers four hours driving up to humboldt me and him screaming each other because he's like people still buy mcdonald's yeah he's like you know why made a very good point we're gonna make mcdonald's because they still buy it and their money is still good he made a very good point they're not really trying to stop us from what we're doing but we are trying to stop them from what they're what they're [ __ ] doing so it does make it a little bit of an uphill battlefield for us like you know the mcdonald's people first yeah you know but it's like you know it's a battle that the consumer in the end it's in the hands and the eyes yeah you're you're never going to stop that guy that goes so past all the good beer [ __ ] bubble eyes you're never going to stop him and to to think you are is crazy you're never going to stop somebody from feeding their dog kibbles and bits yeah exactly yeah we're gonna stop that's a sad battle and you're never gonna stop somebody there's gonna be somebody that's gonna still do that even though you tell them all the education on it even though you show them the proper one and and they find out they get it for really close to the same price or or even the same price just not even going to be the deterrent they're going to be like but my dog likes the red and the green ones totally boom yeah i mean 100 and then how are you going to argue with that yeah and then that's that you're like damn it it's like i had to argue the other day with a guy for like hours she's on on messages uh and he was like telling telling me that he knew how to make a better uh fire rosin than my hash awesome and he said this is the troll right dude no you're dead serious and he's like the reason that i don't think that flower ross is as good as hash rosette is because i don't know how to fresh flowers i'm good like he does he's saying that about that what about your opinion or show you i didn't have nothing to do with that because i saw the means that i wanted to talk to the guy and i wanted to tell him like hey from a decent perspective like i know these guys are clowning you because you're a [ __ ] idiot pretty much but i didn't want to go on your page i told him i dm'd him and said hey i didn't want to go on your comments and [ __ ] be a dick i wanted to to give you a chance to explain yourself before i took that comic wrong because what he said was his flower rosin is the same as ash rosin yeah and then it was like okay dude so like everybody starts ruining him yeah like bashing him so bad dude like he was like even complaining to me saying that his followers don't want to follow him anymore because they were all bashing him so much and it was all over the instagram thing that sucks jesus your instagram notoriety your book is [Music] like you wouldn't believe this [ __ ] he was like crying to me about it too and then but he's still telling me this stupid-ass [ __ ] like that i'm like dude okay he's like telling me well how come my rosin comes out perfectly clear there's no fats there's no plants there's no plant matter in it nothing it's just the same when you tell me under a botany's perspective of what's the difference in this i we both liquefy trichomes there's no different honestly my response would be like dude you would literally you would need to grow a flower that was 99 i tried hey i tried telling you i said why so much lower in thc yeah how come that you tell me that that's what science though that's what i said i think of science first of all i said first of all i'm not a botanist nor do i think you are right so explaining botany terms to someone that's not a botanist is ridiculous right yeah so let's let's not go there i said that's why i was like just tell me what tell me about it like what's going on can you grow 99 percent trichos dude you should just be like all hash on a planet he went dude he went on and told me like that's a really good definition i was like dude i'm not trying to be a dick this is this is the comments that i had in him oh yeah long conversation that's exciting so finally i ended up telling him look because i said look he's like my rosin just looks just the same as hash rather than i said a picture i said i don't think your rosin looks like that yeah dude i said so obviously something's in your rosin cause he's here's his oh i mean honestly it looks like a really nice flower rossignol oh that's what i told him the very first thing i said was curious nice flower russian yeah like the insane oh yeah that's actually beautiful yeah that's why he said there's there he was like going off about how i wonder if he even still has it up yeah but i bet the fresh press doesn't look as clear as that fresh press that's all i can say yeah but it is beautiful though no he has gorgeous work yeah for sure when they say flowers and hashtags on a different do you know what you're talking about or yeah he's just being a dick about it because he's like butthurt because right because he got bashed on he doesn't want to do the hashmaking process that's why right so i'll hit him up for an interview i'm gonna be like bro please i'll pay you for an interview not only that he would do one probably last week because he was like really dude like we talked for a long time you want to see if he'll come on right now while you're here while you're here because we're going to talk about you trying to tell me nobody nobody makes flowers and it's any good that's on the market yes yes i know that might be valid too have you heard of honeybiter i said oh true very true but honestly though nobody makes draws and like you like that [ __ ] like you're willing to do and stuff like that nobody makes it on the market either so i'm just trying to be devil's advocate but but his is beautiful yeah he's like yeah yeah this problem is great news he said no you're right though honey butter too yeah but the problem was like i told him you just can't you can't compare the two because they're not in the same category i said first of all you need to go do your own experiments do your own side-by-sides that's what i told him do a side-by-side experiment yourself and and do flower raws and pressing and that same stuff makes some hash out of it rosin and then smoke them next to each other let's see and you tell me because i ended up just telling him after he told me that i don't make as good of ha flower rosin as him is why i don't think flower rosin as good as hot rosin and i said you don't know how to make hash rosin is why you think flower ross isn't as good as half possible yeah that's the thing because if you knew how to make good ash browsing it would be a joke when you put it next to good flower awesome straight up and like if you can make that out of flower rosin just imagine sir you could probably make fire and then he tried to tell me it cost too much money to utilize the equipment to make hashtags and i said you're they're completely wrong and 100 machine you can do it with just water or you can do it with a [ __ ] paddle yeah no that's right exactly you don't even need anything but instead of that straight up we'll get a set of bags that are like 60 dollars with the wood you can cut the wood that's like 60 dollars for bags you can get all the bags boom yes cheap ones and they work great you don't make good stuff 100 they're i'm not going to say to put the best material in them but they're the best [ __ ] if you ain't got nothing to use and you're trying to tell me it's too much money that 60 dollars cost too much money that's it because that's what it would cost you for real and you can make ice in your house and honestly it would increase that [ __ ] to where it's like that coloration is what people [ __ ] on full spec for is having that yellow yellowish tint but honestly like that that flower rosin could be [ __ ] fire hash rosin definitely if you can make that out of fat i've never seen flower awesome look like that no i've never seen flowers that's why i'm very surprised i thought he was impressed yeah oh no dude i was gonna be dude the very first thing i said to the guy being nice is i said yo my name is brett bird i didn't want to post on your page and cause conflict i wanted to ask you what you meant when you said flower rosin and hash rosin are different do you even know what you're talking about i pressed lots of flower rosin in my day but i know the difference between hash rosin i wanted to give you the chance to explain yourself explain yourself before i took it the wrong way and where was i said i thought that i said that right away i said you're flowers and cause i told him at one point i said your fire rosin looks fire that's it yeah there's nothing i just don't think you know how to make hash rawson because then you would know i said i remember the first time that i had made good hash austin and it blew my [ __ ] mind so like that's the difference is when you actually make some good ass ash housing straight up i imagine yeah i imagine because i never made flower rosin but also i've experienced it a bunch of times and it was it seemed to be just like with hash from cure or rosin from cured material it's a lot more likely you're going to get browner darker material and from what i know about flower rosin it's very sappy so it doesn't last as long because it all will uh oxidize yeah he tried to tell me he tried tommy and we are alive and we are recording that live yeah it um he he he um tried to say his doesn't deteriorate breakdown in arizona he does it yeah it's like yeah he just explodes i'll narrate if you want to read them he said when you take it from a botany point of view it's resin compared to store-bought material all the time i don't know what what yeah what he's trying to tell me that he's flowers he's compared to hash rosin in arizona no difference he said there's no difference is what he said and that's what got everybody going well honestly there's obviously a terpene profile difference if you can get just the flower to go get this i would love to taste that like i would actually like i would literally hit him up when going to the gym show in arizona next year or whatever [ __ ] i'm gonna hit him up and be like bro i'll buy like any small amount just to try it because i i really like i'm very curious if there is some type of like you know flavor either but you should you see that flower rosin that we pressed here didn't you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah totally no i was buyer too but yeah totally and i've seen one time very fire flower rather than get pressed but i just i wonder how it would be aged and just because this guy has a claim to fame for it so you know it's like awesome yeah he is very good though david goliath you know oh he has a bird video on there no this is yours i had some i was trying to find some flowers and then i'd get back in the day nerd for real i'll [ __ ] if he responds he went off and talked to me like nope he seemed like a fairly decent guy tell you the truth no and that's it that's really more so this is the battle of a lifetime oh wow yeah no that's fired auto buttered half of it autobuttered see i'm just curious because it's like that auto butter part would have maybe been the trichomes that popped and squeezed out and you know i mean it's like so it's like that's the fire and if if you watch the hash obviously that's what you would have gotten or something you know or something like yeah you would have got like the whole thing to be like that tiny little piece right there but not contaminated [Laughter] he's like trying to tell me like it doesn't fill your [ __ ] thing full of [ __ ] i'm like come on dude if i don't even use a bag when i smash my flower i'm like oh my god so you're like just picking all the particles out of it like what a [ __ ] layman wow that is some [ __ ] that is some [ __ ] yeah i'm sure he'll he'll talk to you though because he he he talked my ear off cool no that sounds like a great conversation he was the one that and he was all crying because nobody wanted to go to his page and none of his friends that's what he was saying as i was gonna tell you none of his friends wanted they were all mad because he's like i forgot he said how he said it everybody was [ __ ] all over his page is that him i hope oh no i wish yeah i hope that i wish and keep thinking about it is it easy that's all that means i was like oh no what did this guy do but that's still all right i mean i'm still impressed by his flower rosin regardless of his statement hash trolls just took that statement and ran with it and blew it in out of proportion when they yeah it's a bunch of hands is it one word oh okay it's two words well either way i'm gonna hit him up be like bro we are the hash trolls thank you so much took that statement and blew it out of proportion when they could have cleared it up with the conversation and spread that [ __ ] about me on ig like a 19 year old now i have all my followers dming me for the help because they don't want to be harassed in the area that they want to hang out and learn it no way oh my god the people are just around they're losing their ability to share and learn from each other as well as me learning from them in a public discussion and it's all hidden in the private comments what is happening because everybody just went off on him they all probably all deleted their own comments and privatized their comments or something like that or like or remove themselves from being his follower so it like [ __ ] up the whole threads that they were all reading that is really [ __ ] up if it was like a hash thread i'd be like dude but it's like there's literally a whole thing dude you don't you don't get it it's a whole [ __ ] thing everybody hates on flower rosin man everybody [ __ ] hates on it there's like a science why people do it the other way man you know it's like primitive technology that's all it's and it's laziness he even said dude the real truth that he held back was that he doesn't want to pay the money and spend the 60 dollars and [ __ ] do the effort he held it back and then he was like and that's it there's no like you know pencil drops everyone in the room is like wait what dude that's exact that's the whole point is doing a little bit extra work that's all i responded back yeah yeah oh my gosh that's just crazy because that probably the material he's watching would probably or he is not watching we probably watch amazing so great material he isn't watching a great job he's i'm sure it's beautiful the whole the listen so washing you know you're washing it you're cleaning it up you're washing it that's what you need to do to your material friend i tried to tell them that's what i said i said you'll someday you'll wash some hash and then your mind will be blown and then you'll know that's what you should have been doing straight up straight holy [ __ ] straight up it's hilarious he will life changing that's a holy [ __ ] type of thing it's just it's flower rosin is flower rosin i mean it's it's it's got its place that's why i try to tell them i was like dude i teach it at my class straight up i was like i was not trying to be a dick if i was trying to be a dick i would have just laughed at you like everyone else that's hilarious no and that's the whole thing is a teacher cannot even teach when a mind is not open no exactly but you're taught me a lot of stuff you're just trying to tell me just closed-mindedly that oh just tell me on a botany level and then i try to ask a question like well tell me the why the percentage of the thc is considerably lower on flower rosin and hash rosin would you not explain that to me then obviously there's there's your number like that should be your math right it should tell you percentage of thc is how much percentage of thc and then he didn't respond to that but then he's telling me how clear his rosin is when i sent a picture of my rosin and said well i don't think your roses is clear so there's something in it because it should be probably translucent like your [ __ ] is nice looking but it's not white and it's not clear so it's not those two right and then he said it's not all about color i see literally bro you just brought up and said it was yours is clear and then there and how is there any different because we're not people who care about color out of all no of all the raw this guy is not going to be somebody that's going to push [ __ ] you know but he knows enough about it to be able to tell you and make you think about your [ __ ] a little bit that's what's right and i don't think you knew what i was at all that i like try to promote it that i was like trying to teach people that is the funniest part too is that you actually promote using power off yeah more than anyone you know exactly and that's why i don't it she kind of made me feel like obviously you didn't take any time to figure out who i was or what i've been doing because i've been promoting that for a long time and i tell everybody all the time that you know you need to learn how to press fire rosin and then step up to pressing hash browse in and because he's like trying to tell me too well you know everybody can can make hash rosten and i'm like that's fine i understand that and it's a good way to start to get yourself to making hashtags it's not i've made plenty of fire offs i mean someone that say and not everybody can make hash dank duchess insisted to me no mila is a grandmother you know and she makes ash and then also it's like anybody can you know do a very small batch maybe not everybody can do a [ __ ] big ass badge right well you know it's like for real everybody can do a five gallon bucket you know everybody could turn a five gallon wash machine on and buy a [ __ ] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah there you go straight up you know more than anything beyond anything else you can use a machine a small machine you know but for real very simply use a little bag a little wash machine you get for sixty dollars on ebay you don't need to retrofit it like we all do all this cool different things you have to have always clean your tube really well make sure you don't leave anything behind and wash it with hot water and some rubbing alcohol out afterwards you know and you can even save that ribbon out over use it over and over for that same process and and if you ain't got no money or no ability to like modify the machine if that's too much for your to buying one that's already modified because they sell them now bolt bag sells one like mine wow i'll modify with a valve on it and everything in the front bigger hose so it's not the crinkle hose oh it's like you go by it's like 300 bucks so i think okay it's like i think it's seven gallons or something i've seen a few sets a little bigger is upgraded yeah yeah it's like fully retrofitted like like weed like frenchy digs and so yeah you could buy all that [ __ ] it's like 300 dollars too that's not much it's your come on yes really it's all excuses like that's what i tell everybody too that's some [ __ ] because you'll see that person right there has a ps5 or something you know what i mean like it's all [ __ ] oh i got no money i can't afford that but i drive a sick ass car that i do a ton of modifications to wait wait a minute oh [ __ ] you can afford whatever the [ __ ] you want you need priority for like what i said about the frenchie class i had no money to get to the frenchie class i couldn't stay the night in the hotel down there i drove for seven hours that day or eight hours to go to his class and come back and spent all day learning of class i was stoked that i could spend my food money to be able to pay for his ticket for his class you pay for what you want you make what you want exactly that's it dude that [ __ ] dude cedric took a bus down to l.a to get seeds that okay yeah yeah you think about it oh okay that [ __ ] took a bus to l.a you ain't got time ability to figure it out you don't want it no bam wow that's that's intense he took the track of the lights on yeah wow he took a [ __ ] bus to l.a yeah long hours oh actually yeah two days right or like a day and a half yeah if you just if he if you took the bus train bus train thing yeah could get down at like 12 hours like 12 hours one way wow one wow plane is an hour and a half so i will tell him that next time but march pits if he probably got a bus train bus straight 25 dollars yeah [Laughter] he probably got that exactly because if you want it it's [ __ ] happened no you're right holy bird that's you're the [ __ ] man of that you make me believe in inspiring a good question for you for why homie also would be really inclined to besides the work and extra effort that's involved when you were saying last time you were saying how much practice you get out of pressing material yeah which means you also i'm imagining get a little bit more material just to then disperse somebody did tell me you got a good yield on fire yeah like uh 20 percent that's what i would imagine yeah but that's not very much i mean because you're not i mean you're getting like 90 percent off hash oh [Laughter] right because you've already gotten the [ __ ] yield off of turning it into bubble hash yeah yeah so like that that's where it becomes where i but the problem would be more profitable for him so i think that definitely is what it's about though is just like we were saying it's all education and it's straight up it's not wrong present flower but it's just hilarious that i i did i did want to kind of break it down for him but i started feeling like it was a waste of my time to even break it down yeah because it was like he was making like you said actually i didn't think about it that way you can't teach someone that's not wanting to learn so that's what it felt like it'd be wasting my time because he wouldn't absorb any of the information i would be giving him you know a light that he could use it later ever because he would always be negatively thinking about everything i'm saying to to just argue with me or second guess me exactly bias yeah because he's already doing he's got like all his flowers he's got to stand by exactly exactly somebody's gonna grab him and make him watch hash you know his best friend will do that for him you know somebody needs to you know well that's all i mean like so you're you know who else would grab you and shake you in you know i mean like he said i said i understand you know you might not have access to material and stuff like that and that's a big difference but there's a lot of different aspects of it too you know like having access somebody that has access to a lot of material is gonna have more material in the long run if they freeze it all because you could have more stuff to learn from if you learn out throughout the whole year but like if i turn all that and dried it i'm going to have very limited time to be able to press that into flower rose a very small window of time that i can press good flower oz and it looked like what he just did a very small window and so um it's fine for him because he's only producing such a small amount and he's only got flour but if he had like if he had like a real farm to deal with that would be like a joke it's just kind of funny because he has no idea and i was trying to explain that to him a little bit like if a real farm was like here you could have this and for you to turn that into flower rosin it wouldn't be realistic because you're not gonna have the room to dry all that material and you're also not gonna have the ability to get it all dried at the right time and put into a bag and then press into rosin before it dries out and goes back so like the only way to do a whole farm would be you have to deal with it on a different scale like and you dry it and then you can turn it into hash rosin because you could dry it and stick the weed into a freezer then you can deal with that throughout the year because you can pull the flour out and wash hash rosin that would be a viable way to do it but just making flower rods it's not really going to be a viable way you if you had a farm that said you could take this whole farm and turn it in whatever you wanted fire rising would not be a valuable option for that at all because this is not realistic like to dry all that and to turn it into rosin in a realistic time sense it wouldn't happen it would be garbage some of it would be good and some wouldn't and and so but you could turn it into hash rosin or live rosin the whole farm i'd have a consistently quality product and you wouldn't be able to with flowers just literally wouldn't be able to because there's such a small window of time that can be pressed into a product would have to be like a week you could so if you had like a whole farm like my family's farm you physically couldn't sit there with and press flowers and fast enough before it went back amazing so that's very intense cost and space and like where would you put it all no for frozen doesn't take up as much space as you think you could take a whole farm because you process it down off the stem and off the big leaves so you actually take a whole farm and you can put it down into turkey bags and freeze those turkey bags and turn a good farm into chest freezers and you can't really do that same scale and drying it to to dry what i've put in my freezers you would need a [ __ ] massive dry room massive to be able to dry the amount you can put into a freezer to get air flow yeah you know what i mean like if you're really just trying to like you hang dry weed in a room and they would you would just be really just really huge amount of scale and you're going to be very limited like the day that you can start pressing fire rosin you're going to have like two days or three days or a week and then it's going to be garbage so if you have little [ __ ] rooms full of this [ __ ] and you're going to press it and then after you press it it's not gonna be as good because it's full of [ __ ] other material because it's got a lower thc percentage straight up there's a lot of problems there's a lot it's one of the reasons why this is not a viable source to take all that material and turn it into a concentrate which is like why tim was kind of being a dick when he was talking to me but was right and that's why he was being a dick about it was you're wasting your time pressing foul rolling he was just a dick about how he said it to me he could have been a lot nicer and more considerate on like yeah you're really learning your craft that's awesome good job you're doing a good job like i was trying to do to that guy kind of that's what i was just thinking literally i was going to say that before is that you tried to give this guy the nice yeah what the [ __ ] exactly is [Laughter] [Music] oh i didn't put you on blast like everybody else wasn't my war i couldn't i could have been a dick to him so it's so funny and i didn't when you so you'd go right from a turkey bag do you tie them up and then throw them in the free in the chest and just let it be full as you can [ __ ] stuff it full doesn't really matter too much all right and that and that's how it basically dries or is that waiting until it's frozen in state it's exactly just like you cut it off the plant and then when you go to work with it again well freeze not right no no such thing no freeze drying later after you're removing i imagine that that freeze drying occurs like same way frostbite and like the condensation occurs if it falls out it's moist and wet so i accidentally let some thought out right when i was loading so that's not really the problem you're occurring here because what's happening is it's freezing the trichome so like it probably frost bites the flour but you're not extracting the flour right you're getting the trichome off of it it's just freezing so so you're freezing the whole material wow but the the the material might be frostbitten like if you were gonna eat the the flour like you were gonna eat a steak you know what i mean in a sense you freeze the steak and get frostbitten because i thought about this too but the trichomes not getting receiving frostbite because it's not water right and it's not it's not water soluble like that well no you don't have it in water either right well i'm saying the water being the ice water that's not in it oh it's next to it yeah it's not like in liquid water exactly it's just next to the frozen state of material because it's not you're and you're just removing the trichome yeah so like you probably do create some frostbite to the flower if it sits in there long enough but from my experience i'll wash it that's a year and a half two years old and it doesn't seem any different when you're washing it because what's happening is the trichome has been just frozen in its own separate state as a flower and you've just removed them and then you discard the flour they've just probably been frostbitten now and it could have excess moisture and everything else obviously froze inside yeah so but the trichome didn't matter because it was a different liquid that was frozen on its own and it doesn't have water in it or oxygen in it for it to have a frostbite actually uh effectively any agent or damage at all yeah it's in its frozen state yeah and it's not connected to anything else so it's just waiting for you to come and knock it off later that's awesome i was wondering how long it lasted the other thing that i was thinking is like you said um one large chest can hold probably like a green house yeah i mean like if you've got a 20 foot chest you could probably fit a [ __ ] huge green a big big-ass greenhouse in there if you wanted you know and if you really have to do what you do is like you can if you you can kind of like grab the turkey bag and squeeze it just a tiny bit to remove some of the excess air that's in that turkey bag and that when you when you twist it and just put like a twist tie thing on the top the turkey bags come with and then put it in the freezer that'll actually give you a lot more space in your freezer without really damaging any of the product at all because you're just kind of barely squeezing the air out you're not like and you don't put in the bag and like squish the [ __ ] out of it valuable information for next season straight up yeah for real seriously yeah you should be delicate don't cut anything with scissors don't expose that leaf surface to leach water out in to the chlorophyll into the water so you don't want to use scissors on the leaves at all when you process down so that would be but you wouldn't buck it with the scissors no you could do that that's not not with a scissor though i wouldn't do the scissors that that but you're not i wouldn't do a scissor because i'd be more worried about other things happening and there's going to be less control with the pair of scissors because you won't have any of the feel that you'll have with your hand there's a technique that you get when you do it with your hand that you can actually feel it achieving what you're trying to by popping all the buds off and not grabbing one or grabbing the next as you grab them and like [ __ ] them up at all and without the the feel of your fingers you won't really have that and you you could possibly grab some leaves while you're doing this in the process that are just in there and then cut the leaves with the scissors and if you're doing this with your hand you're not going to actually cut any of the leaves that you do grab in the same fashion i really would tell everybody just just leave the scissors alone don't even don't have your scissors like touching any of that horribly so because if you do you could like buck him down the scissors to like put it into a bin and then have somebody just sitting there bucking it into a bucket well part of it is is i guess everybody's used to or where i'm coming from with the bucking ideology is from dry product and so bucking a dry product you can feel that pop with the scissor and it goes and also if you did it by hand you would just dust all your [ __ ] nugs in this sense you can't because it's a full [ __ ] plant it's not just going to pop off easy yeah it's different snip if you were gonna snip them yeah it's different when you push and crush like that [ __ ] what would normally dust the whole nug is actually just gonna pull it off because it's a [ __ ] live plant yeah and string it and stuff like that so it's just different yeah you wanna you want to just ideally you'd want to just pop each nug off no and put it in the bag [ __ ] yeah man um so here i'm gonna i'm gonna end this and yeah we'll figure that stuff all out here", "xkqXJdUFe6Y": "hey folks rod here from caribou organics so it's a very special today day today in the caribou heart household and that's the reason we're here but first i want to share something very special with you now this is some huckleberry soda purple growing fire some very good friends of ours canada's finest now this is some of the most purple dope i've ever seen i'm not sure if this camera can really do it justice but i tell you it is like a kick in the head once you smoke it we just got to give them a shout out and say keep up the good work guys we love what you're doing all right now let's get down to business so a couple weeks ago the wife and i decided that uh we're gonna invest in the rosin press so that's what we got right here now what should be here is a nub smasher oh geez like christmas good to see customs of a furry opened it up for us all the way through the border i guess that means it's there all right a box within a box okay well very strange all right okay so there should be dude like where they gotta keep the inspirational music all right so first off we have so i don't know are you able to zoom in on this and get it a little better but uh pressure release there it's gonna be uh temp gauge dials on the back side there's our power switch power plug-in a little bit of weight there throw this over to the side see what else we got in here all right so looks like we got ourselves a silicone mat like a smasher and now we've got rosin bags coming out the ass okay it's raining rosin bags around not a here more seriously though let's see what we got so looks like we got a bunch of different microns and a bunch of different sizes so we got some bags that are 14 grams in size bags are seven grams in size and there should be some three and a half gram sized bags see if we got anything else all right looks like we got the handle for the pump and then it looks like we got a whole bunch of stickers we'll uh give those to the kids to take to school i'm sure that would go over really well eh no we're not giving the stickers to the kids over well that seems to be about all that's in there now so i bet you you would really really like to see us do like a couple of test squeezes now right and i you know i'd really love to do nothing more but uh if i did that then you'd have no excuse to watch any more of my videos so i think we're gonna make some uh go squeeze some raws and make some more videos check us out later have a great night bye", "D5C2ET32OIg": "okay here we are we're gonna do a fresh harvest travel boy I used coconut oil mmm bright and early it's 8:30 here in Edmonton Alberta Canada and getting a head start so this is a trim and there's somebody engine here too for my that I just took down white widow [Music] I just start from the beginning bear with me I just even I just spread it all out pretty even and you want everything to be plenty if you have a lodge you want to do two choices but this is probably the most great so then what I'm going to do is just cover this in tin foil and put it in the oven once it reaches to 30 and then I'll leave it in the oven for about 50 minutes not should help dry most of it out it'll still be a bit soggy and the probably some condensation on the tin foil and I kick it off but that's all really normal and we'll be able to get the rest of the water out when we infuse it touch that for now okay so now we have it covered up I'm still waiting for the oven yeah I'm making dog food I know it looks delicious dear carrots really garden from right anyhow while that's cooking the oven I'm going to get my coconut oil ready with that amount I just eyeball it if you want to ask questions about how much closer how much usually when it's dry it one ounce to prep or you can make a mark for I make for lots of different people so I have to attend a back in mind I can't make things [Music] yes so I'll get the coconut melting a little bit okay back so it's almost done [Music] [Music] I'm not quite sure America thing yes they can drive [Music] so I'm not going to use two cups and use one cup it's just for me and swag so here I'll just measure up [Music] and you felt one teaspoon per cup I use this during the few infusion and after it's strange as well I put one teaspoon let's add that all together and I'll get the temperature stabilizing okay so you're gonna start it on really low because it burns pretty quickly and learn that the hard way thankfully to work with the lead in your men slowly as the temperature gets to be where you want it you're gonna that's gonna look like and then accordingly so here's my candy thermometer in the sweet spot that I'm looking for was 200 between 200 to 20 anywhere between 200 and 250 is fine we're just gonna be carbo what's left [Music] not deep harm out we're D carbonite now I need to do this this Jay in me be right back so I'm back doc food's ready also making a coffee here the last - that I made is my last [Music] and put the temperature together and probably edit this whole card out effect I'm not going to that's our supper for tonight [Music] and I'm hopping around here [Music] so I'm gonna do that and then basically just didn't give it oil and mixed it up you know yeah I gotta catch the soup oh this is totally normal freaks out sometimes it gets really frothy dude it only does it look [Music] but basically the reason it has it you know to thundered for a while is to just boil off any excess water that might be left in the bladder and you only have to do this with fresh harvest we used rhyme in your own head probably could use it a little bit more oil but [Music] Oh [Music] you'll notice when they come back that water [Music] so it's been about an hour I'm starting to lower the temperature as you can see all the water [Music] and even if there was a little bit it's coconut oil so they don't separate no biggie so Singh simmer back down to it once between 170 and 1 three hours [Music] already we're back like four hours I was able to keep an eye on it because I was [Music] okay so this is ready to go temperature stay [Music] I think it's time I got the keep hot and it's a really good expensive so I'd advise if you're gonna do this [Music] and then I'll just like is my spatula of that all out so important I am NOT a gentle person [Music] I'll lick that out later this is a potato ricer and that says so much extra oil from this bad boy and if you're super strong like me you'll be able to get lots out you doesn't like to get the most out of their product [Music] watch how much oil [Music] so much all right that's precious five and a latte and usually I get my partner to come and squeeze up the rack because he's a big guy needs a lot stronger than me that's probably good this is just off for my chairman stuff so I'm not like I'm not gonna get ridiculous and like water baths or anything like that I'm just gonna throw it out YUM tastes good and I already had the sunflower left listen in here

done so the material that's in there isn't a work bag with two bags of ice layered like a cake with demineralized water it just soaked for 15 minutes and now I'm gonna do my first wash first wash I'm gonna do is five minutes you don't want to do the first wash for very long because that's where your primo stuff is first and second wash mostly so I got to put my bubble bags in the bucket here so I can drain what comes out of that washing machine into or through the bubble bags so I'm gonna start this anyways and then I have to properly layer the bubble bags you want to start with the best

moxie viper cookies okay uh this is i haven't i haven't pressed a lot of moxie uh in a while so this will be fun this stuff is ringing in at uh 26.9 percent combined thc thca we've got a 121 micron bag here and the crd 30 ton triptech rosin press is set to 180 degrees fahrenheit i don't use timers i don't use the gauge that's on this pump so please don't ask me how long i leave it on just watch the video and you'll see how long i leave it on for okay so this has been rehydrated with hydra stones and we're going to load this bag up hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there just a reminder if you are a medical marijuana patient in the pittsburgh area and you have dispensary flour and you would like to have it turned into gold please come and see me in penn hills here at the studio i do that for patients i press form for free that is a patient's helping patients initiative that i've been doing since 2018 never charge a patient to press their medicine for it it is important that patients get good quality medicine at a price that they can afford and i am trying to help in that respect so here is our quarter get this thing all put into a nice little package and move these lights up here and get this placed right where i want it to be there we go that paper of course anytime you're doing live stuff okay all right so let's get that out of the way and get this centered up where i want it to be get the light in there on it real good so you can see it get real close and put it right there all right here we go let's get this valve closed on the pump let's make some medicine there's nothing i enjoy more right now than just getting the best that this flower can offer and as long as you treat this plant with respect she will give herself to give you the best medicine that you can have much better quality than anything you will get in the dispensary as a concentrate solidness is definitely the way to go and rosin whether it be hash rosin or flower rosin is a step way bigger than any of the commercially available chemically extracted concentrates so let's just remember where the quality is and the flavor because this is a full spectrum extract and take terpenes and winterize it do all kinds of crazy stuff they just you just get the buds and the essence of them their soul that's the way i like to approach it so as you can see it's going to get harder and harder to see so i'm going to let this go now and start concentrating on this press i'm going to let that heat soak in for about 30 seconds before i finish get the full pressure i don't know if there's any big drops tomorrow for the weekend but i would be watching the healing center my tree rise all of those guys because you know how that goes friday if you get a big drop and if you're not ready to grab it online you can lose out real easy all right almost at pressure there we go that's where i want to be with it let it sit there for a minute i'm going to pull this shot back out oh yeah this should be fun so again moxie doesn't come out with a lot of flour they've been coming out with more lately and i don't get a chance to press much of it because it's usually at the high end of the price spectrum not a lot of patients bring it to me so i figured i'd grab some and we'll see what see what it does you know and there isn't a whole lot else you can do except uh try it and it goes into my database you find out how it stacks up against the other grower processors and the other strains that they're putting out so i'm just getting the scale ready i already have a jar make sure i get the tear on that first seventeen yep that's great okay are you ready you ready to see it here we go okay viper cookies what'd you give us oh oh yes oh yeah i'll tell you what take a look at that that looks mighty mighty fine to me so let us get that paper off of here turn off the i am done pressing unless unless there's a patient that comes over with something for me let me get the shot out and redirected all right a small blowout no big deal take my tools here clean a little bit of clean rosin off the end of that but like i said blowouts happen no matter whose bag you're using luckily they don't happen all the time so let's get this fired up tara and philip she looks like a happy plant this thing was coming off looking like it was made from washed flour uh and that it didn't just come from straight flour some of this consistency is very reminiscent of a lot of hash rosin i see being shown on ig gas rosin's fantastic it's just not practical for medical patients in pennsylvania because of our prices you know so pennsylvania and the medical marijuana program flower rosin is king of solidness because you can't get the good stuff good ash rosin at the dispensers they don't sell it they don't make it people who do make it aren't making it for the legal market so best you're gonna get medicine wise from somebody who can craft it immediately for you somebody like me who's doing flower rosin just like this gotta love this plant with all your heart to be good at doing this consistently you got to be having access to flour that is of amazing quality to get this kind of result oh this stuff came out so beautiful oh yeah oh moxie my good friend dave perlow gabe pirlo who is the ceo of moxie he and i have had a very nice relationship as far as his business ideas about doing solventless believe me when the feds lift the the lid off this whole thing and deschedule this plant you're gonna start seeing a lot more solventless on the market because it will be on the recreational side probably but you will see it moxie has always been a concentrate centric company it started off they didn't have the canopy enough to to sell flowers so all they sold were their really nice concentrates and their cartridges i love their cartridges liquid moxies melon wreck is awesome ellerange is fantastic a big fan of their distillate cartridges but their flowers always been kind of rare you know now they're stepping up their their production ability and now they're coming out with more flour which is really cool so let's see what we got for a yield and wow 0.61 well when you take away the 17 grams for the jar that is well that is not what i would consider an acceptable yield okay again my bare minimum acceptable yield is half half a gram per eight this comes out to be point three per eighth which i mean here's the thing though the quality is amazing okay and in terms of the look of it it smells incredible you know but there it is maybe i can get it you can see the better light i mean look at the quality of that there's no disputing the fact that moxie makes really good flour the problem is the flour that they make or that they grow doesn't have the wax and lipid profiles to make them a good candidate for solventless extraction via rosin press so always bear in mind that when you're going to buy flour you need to pick strains that work for you and you have to be willing to accept that you may get a strain like this like this viper cookies which looks to be amazing probably going to taste incredible uh but the yield is not sufficient for for me from for me personally it may be for you as a patient you may be a baller and can afford to buy enough eights to get enough of this pressed to make it worth medicating with it i tend to look for the higher producing strains i think this is an excellent strain i bet it's a great strain for the other uses dry vaping quote unquote um but for rosin it's one i would probably take a pass on personally but if you're seeing this and you're liking what you see grab yourself some dispensary flower and get on over here to penn hills and come and see me and i will do this for you too stay safe stay medicated be good to each other everybody have a good day", "4Jwgy80QvrE": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "o7yToj8NgbU": "yes i am going to be pressing two strains of flour today picked them up at the healing center in monroeville big shout out to them and what we have today are some really nice strains i hope they press out really well we're going to find out because we're pressing 180. first one we're going to press is the cresco this is the pineapple express ringing in at 30 percent it has been rehydrated with hydrostones i'll take those out now and we shall get this ready to press hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there if you are a medical marijuana patient the pittsburgh area and you would like to have your dispensary flower pressed into rosin i do that for free for patients right here in penn hills at asher's finest rosin world headquarters it's been a long day folks i am so glad to finally be getting down to getting some pressing done uh so that's that's it that's our quarter and let me see that these new uh press bags okay those are not the right size all right here we go i do believe that that should handle i could have sworn i got three different sizes nope just two okay because here's the size difference from a seven gram bag right there so let me see if this more suitable now this is what happens when you go live stuff happens and not everything is perfect those are the wow i am just having a heck of a day today it has been pouring down rain almost the entire day today okay so that's the one closest matches the size and so these are made by gutenberg's tank pressing and they they had those custom made to emulate as close as possible a nug smasher seven gram bag and i think they got it down pretty good but let's take a look and see how these hold up under the press my crd 30 ton rosin press so there's 120 micron bag we're pressing at 180 degrees uh this is the i haven't pressed pineapple express from cresco in probably two years so we shall see what it's going to do hopefully it's going to press out well at 30 percent i'm really hoping it will but you know as well as i do sometimes the thc level does not equate to a larger yield if the plant doesn't have the right wax and lipid profile so just trying to let you know what happens in the real world we're either going to get a really good result or not and we'll see what the quality of this flower is for the price i really hope it's good because quite frankly it i've gotten surprised by some of the flower lately that should have been good producers and were not but i give everyone their chance i try not to pre-judge anything uh this is really really sticky uh especially now that it's been rehydrated which is a good sign this all tucked down in here nice and tight and we're gonna get it all folded up here and we're gonna move the lights and put it on the plates and see what she's got for us hope she gushes that would be super nice get a really nice happy happy squish out of this we shall see this is video one of the two video series today pressing dispensary flower pennsylvania medical flower from our local wonderful dispensary here the healing center in monroeville i'm gonna move the camera now move it into a better angle for you to see what's going on okay let's let's get this here blow there we go put you right in here and focus is right there all right let's start dropping the hammer on this and see what she's gonna do like i said if you're a pittsburgh area medical marijuana patient you have dispensary flour you want to press bring it over to penn hills that's where i live real easy to get a hold of if you hit me on a private messenger i give you my address and i will do this for you for free because that's what i do for patients is my outreach helping patients who need better medicine and can't afford dispensary concentrates at the price level so i'm just doing this real gently given that heat because i'm pressing at such a lower temperature than i normally do takes a little longer for that heat to start working its way in there [Music] but i'm hoping on paper it should be a gusher you know 30 that's that's the magic number for the gushers usually but sometimes it'll surprise you you won't get the yield that the uh numbers said you should based on what it's telling you and that again goes to my point this is a variable plant it's always changing and as a result it's kind of hard to get a handle on it sometimes and figuring out what you can and can't do there we go there we go you should be able to see that nice cool here we go drop the pressure more now this is going to disappear from your site okay these plates are very deep and the lights will not penetrate past a certain point so once it gets to that point i'm gonna move the camera back out because i'm gonna need to pay attention to what's going on with it and when i pull those plates back apart you should see something really really nice but that's what's going on in there right now and now come right back out here focus right there keep this thing up to full pressure where i want to be don't want to risk a blowout so we're going gonna really go gently on this especially with a bag that i haven't used before too it's always always something new that gives you that learning curve all right we're gonna let it sit right there and at 180 you can let it sit on the heat a little longer without degrading it at 200 you have to react quickly but you can get amazing results at 200. some strains of 200 degrees though will shatter up on you and turn into ground glass and you definitely don't want that so i dropped my temperature profile to 180 and i am getting slightly smaller yields overall but it's not as much as i anticipated so it ended up being a much more acceptable range than i was thinking and you know so now i'm pressing at 180 this year and if i have to make adjustments next year to see what maybe 190 does or 185 then i'll do that but i'm always trying to to do better each year better quality because i'm a quality over quantity guy every time i promise you that okay so i believe we are almost ready to pull these plates apart and see what she has given us as we showed her respect you know that's the thing you show this plant respect treat it with respect press it well and it gives her soul to you you know that's what it is at least for me that's how i approach it i approach it that this plant has a soul i'm bringing that soul out making better medicine so give me a moment we're about ready to open those plates so i'm going to give you a nice view of that ready to see it let's see it pretty oh yeah i don't know about you that's looking pretty to me huh you liking that because i sure am all right so let me get the camera moved down here so as you can see the goodness and stay tuned for my next video where i'm going to be pressing moxie's viper cookies which is another heavy hitter not over 30 percent but absolutely gorgeous look at how beautiful that came out you can't even believe how it smells you know what i'm saying it is just filling this room with the dankness and i did it i got a tiny little bit of a blowout right there okay so i took it right to the edge and got the most that this flower was able to provide now it's time to find out what our yield is because my my own personal scale that i like to use is i want to see a minimum and that's minimum of a half gram per ounce per eight pressed okay minimum i'd like to get a gram per eight and some strains give me that and most of them don't so let us see what our jar ways i'm gonna back this back off now you can see everything there we go okay i got my scale i'm going to tear my 17 gram jar there we go and taking my tool down see how it picks up i did not put this on the cool plate because it's about 65 degrees in the room and cooling it too fast leads to shattering results i like the way this is picking up is sticking to itself it's very stable didn't crystalize up which i believe the last time i pressed this flower was 200 degrees i do believe i had an issue with it turning into shatter on me if that's him so i'm much much happier with what i'm seeing here right now for sure let's get this stuff off here and into its jar it's your home that's where you want to be other than my lungs look at that look how pretty no it doesn't want to focus but it's got a really beautiful color just gorgeous loving it let's get this stuff up in the jar give you guys a yield well tomorrow starts the weekend if you don't have plans get some dispensary flour if you're in the pittsburgh area come see me i'll have a present sesh love doing pressing sessions right now my wife is not in the house so i am going to be able to have people over and we can hang out got a big screen tv and lots of equipment to dab on so if you're thinking hey i want to go party in a safe secure environment where can i go well you can come see me bring some dispensary flour let's have some let's make some good medicine have a nice session you know the social aspects of medicating are every bit as important as the medicine itself in my opinion so anybody who's just sitting around medicating in isolation that's not really very therapeutic but you get it you get yourself around some other like-minded people have some interesting discussions maybe watch some tv or a movie or stand-up comedian or something that is just as therapeutic to me as hang on just a moment i got a visit all right sorry about that folks let's finish gathering this pineapple express up like i said i don't press a lot of cresco flour because i've had some had some bad results from some of it and i always found them to be kind of higher priced than their quality would seem to indicate but in terms of this pineapple express yeah i'm pretty pretty happy with it all right now we got it all in the jar try to get in the jar and not on my hands so much so that is 18.73 when you take the 17 grams for the jar away that's 1.87 no no it's 1.73 my bad 1.73 that definitely falls within the acceptable range for me so thank you for joining me for this video here's a good look at some really really beautiful rosin this is from made from cresco pineapple express premium buds so thanks for joining me on this video i will be seeing you very soon because i'm going to turn right around reset up and shoot viper cookies so stay tuned folks i'm out of here", "6qj_ybKWsqk": "hey everybody's Siobhan here with gross sisters today we are making bubble hash [Music] alright so we have got a bowl full of frozen nuts what I've done is added I just put them in the frigerator for about 20 minutes and they are frozen so what we're gonna do is we're gonna dump them into our bubble box and from there [Music] so I'm adding a little bit of water to the ice mixture to kind of aggravate it and what we're doing wife elbow hash is so cool is that we are creating a freeze of the THC of those triumphs and knocking them off why call ash is so cool it's because it's a solvent lift hash we're using blueberry muffins today 3 this oh hush so now what we're going to do is shake it around and aggravate all those trichomes the teach seat to fall the other thing that's cool about these bags is that they are gauged from a very high gauge to a very low Cajun so what we're doing is as our procedure we as we go through what we're doing is we're catching the different stuff so you're going to see that there's gonna be like more material and chlorophyll kind of like in with the bigger stuff as we get to the thinner stuff so the reason why I have separated my two bags is because these are really thin holes and we're just gonna go ahead and use all of the water that comes through all these ones there's because that's gonna take a minute it's gonna take too long to drain this just moves the process a little bit faster self [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "30ufFiDcALU": "[Music] one thing you know I talked about besides you catching up with a few other growers this morning the law were talking about winterization and fresh frozen so how much I mean you don't have to tell us exactly how many pounds you're pushing yeah but even just a percentage if that's something you're getting into and and how much of it are you allocating to essentially for lack of better term diversify your portfolio totally so I mean we have 50,000 square feet of outdoor I would say this is the kind of the first year that I'm actually allocating a good amount of a to fresh frozen just kind of seeing where the markets evolved on the scale of production where we're at limitations on where we can dry it so getting into that fresh frozen which means we just take the plant fresh bucket down clean it up a little bit and freeze it right away straight to the fre straight to the freezer and that's where the extract artists these days are that's where they get the most high-end product that's Tyson to live rosin rosin indoor live resins you have the live rosin which is the organic kind of bubble hash extraction and then pressing it and I'll get you the live rosin and then the other side of it is the live resin which guys are pushing the fresh frozen material through BHO gotcha and then and then just creates a different product yeah well together right totally different cuz I actually this year just as an experiment gave the same crop same thing you know same everything same greenhouse to a BHO live resin just manufacture and a live rosin and the product is so different if I didn't know they were grown even the same strain really it's just such a difference in the way it comes out and we might even see that amongst extractors as well because the different techniques so that's kind of fun and cool it's just to see the differences of like your raw material because when you drive the flower it's gonna be the dried flower the extract brings this whole other element to come to our party so I think a Frenchie cannoli I know he's really come up on the scene lately and there's there's individuals like him around the world but it really is an art that's one thing you know as crazy as Frenchie can be I love that he really puts that emphasis that it is in art when he's doing bubble hash yeah you know and it is a totally different experience for them and that's the only thing it takes different infrastructure so you gotta have freezer rooms ways to transport that and then what if a freezer goes down and you know 200 pounds of material in there you gotta have a backup in place like so there's a lot of things it's a lot of lot to think about a lot of moving parts I probably prefer I wish I could just dry at all traditionally and and do that but it's fun to evolve with the market and see new products come out and be a part of all that so just got to adapt and do a little bit everything so overall I'd say probably you know we focused on trying to keep the tops of the plants for a flower the best stuff of the best and then focus on the lower and it also helps with the harvest time because we can get all those tops that are more susceptible to mold or botrytis get them hanging and dry in gives us some more time to deal with like the lower but still good quality yeah you know as a grower I always smoke the smalls I don't the biggest artichokes aren't always the most flavorful it's funny how that transcends so many things or even like yeah lobsters shrimp and there are so many things it's your point quality over quantity right so it allows us to to time out she says big hands you know you're the one I'm like is that from a song yeah so it allows us to time out the harvest a little bit yeah and so I'd say we're doing about 25% fresh frozen this year pretty fair amount for a 50,000 square foot canopy yeah that's that's why I got 420 square feet of freezer space this week there are there are supposedly some companies coming up that are that are manufacturing companies that rely on that fresh frozen material I haven't personally run into a company that's sending troops up to do that work for us I am working with one of the the biggest brands and in the space right now in the industry and they're about to launch if they haven't launched it yet a live rosin brand and I can guess who that is I think they're based out of justjust not too far from here actually based in here in Humboldt yeah and so we're gonna be one of their their main three producers for their fresh frozen line nice I mean I think it's probably open now is they have an Instagram up so I think that's all good but pop in Barkley's is introducing a live one brand brand so it's gonna be Papas Papas select [Music]", "7Gvd89wO6ec": "Reef DBMS coming at you with an update of kind of what we do with some of the produce that come through the farm we technically freeze-dry it we have a harvest rate freeze dryer and I'm gonna show you kind of the assembly and setup this is how it actually arrived on the farm if you notice there is snow on the ground quite a bit of it and threes news is because I didn't actually want to put out a video on this until I truly knew it worked and work to the standards that I wanted this is actually how it arrived you know my business as a veterinarian can use this machine the farm here can use this machine this is this is a really nice tool to have but based on previous reviews I understood that the company was really helpful and getting through there you know pump difficulties and the setup difficulties and so forth but it made me nervous to just buy it and put out a review on it so I decided I was gonna break this in for a while like quite a while so I shot the video and then I've been using it ever since and I can honestly tell you I'm very very very pleased with it I put it in in the area of our shop where we do a lot of work butchering right next to a great big dehydrator and I bought a stand and as you can see I put the pump next to it and the assembly is pretty easy basically you uncrated you plug in these you know couple chords on the back side here and one is for the pump and ones for the the freeze dryer itself and then you bring in this no big kind of corrugated nylon tube cook the pump up which is essentially just you know two different pieces and then as its fill it with oil they send you the first you know cord oil from there you gotta invest in your own oil and obviously you know it's it's vacuum pump oil I I buy mine at Tractor Supply they have vacuum pump oil because of the dairies in my area big dairies tend to use a lot of vacuum pump oils so and then you fill it up when you're filling it up it feels like it's taking forever but really it fills up quite quickly as you know if there's a oil level on it you just kind of kind of watch that so you don't overfill it I wanted to show you some of the different things we put in it for us on the farm we like to do what rutabagas I love doing cherry tomatoes and I pack these trays a lot more but for the sake of this video I'm not going to over do the yogurt clusters or the tomatoes or the rutabagas that way you can see how it actually looks when it comes out the freeze dryer this particular one does five trays I'm just gonna do three you know energy efficiency is kind of a funny thing with a freeze dryer the more moist food you put in it and then the more you fill it the longer it takes the more energy it uses so it's kind of a double-edged sword sometimes when you've got really moist things doing just a few trays will actually get it through you faster and you can turn around quicker within a two day period because basically what you're gonna do is you're gonna put them in turn it on and as you saw it's gonna freeze and then it's gonna warm a little bit and then it's going to do a final dry and it's going to take that frozen you know product and basically vaporize the water out of it and then when you're done you're essentially just gonna open up the air valve on it and let air back into it because it's got it it's got a pressure on it and that's gonna suck air back into it and release the vacuum so you can open up the door if there is any moisture in there it's gonna drain out into that pail on the floor and the machine does have a defrost on it too so you could actually defrost it if you need to but this is me opening it up there's this nice little pillow in front to keep it insulated and then basically this is what it looks like when it's done the food essentially looks the same it's just very light because it doesn't have any water weed to it and as a somewhat Chris penis to it I like the yogurt drops we'll just throw those in a ziploc bag and eat those within 10 days as far as the tomatoes we just throw those in a glass jar and you know toss them into salads as need be and the rutabagas I'll show you ill vacuum seal those up at times but most of the time we don't vacuum seal we just put them with a little oxygen packet into the mylar bags and you know seal it up and it's good for a couple years don't have to refrigerate them or anything which is great you might notice too that you can see these silicone mats that are on the bottom of these trays they are an added on product that you can order when I first started using the Machine I did not use those and I was constantly working to clean the tray especially after things like yogurt and stuff apples and yogurt and different types of citrus fruits they kind of stick to the bottom of the trays as they as they freeze dry up and they leave sometimes a little bit of sugar residue so I'd rather not have that so I do use the silicone mats and I use them a lot as you can see they come off the mat quite easy these yogurt drops are very light they're fluffy you can actually break them I just wanted you to see that seeing see how different that is then when it's in the liquid form the tomatoes it's the same way we just take these you know little cherries and split them in half so they dry out nice they're somewhat I would not say hard but very very firm and light but again a little bit of salad dressing on them and you know they hydrate right back up or hacking and throw me on the dry state sometimes the rutabagas do have to be cooked they have to be rehydrated and cooked to work but it works out really good so again once we got the products out it was just a matter then of getting them bagged up these are the bags we use you can get these from harvest right but you can buy any bag like this Amazon sells them online you know it's a bunch of companies that do we fill it up with the quantity that we want our freeze dryer comes obviously with a sealer which is kind of a nice little gift they give you I'm not saying it's anything grand but it certainly does work you just push it down you know wait till light goes off and then you pull it back out and hey your bag is sealed up you're ready to go it's a nice way of storing toss this other shelf and it's up and going appreciate you watching folks please please like and subscribe to support our channel keep putting out great videos like this but I give it a two thumbs up this freeze dryers been working for us now for close to a year and we use it weekly and it's been doing great thank you for watching folks", "uIG-mBThhV0": "hey guys epicenter Brian here hey today I'm going to start a sequence of some tips for you guys now some of these tips are gonna be for new users some of them are going to be for everybody this one happens to be for everybody and we're going to be talking about the drain tube and that's where the water comes out when you do your defrosting of the chamber okay and most people use a bucket like this to catch the the water and the big thing is you want to make sure you get in the habit of emptying that bucket every time you defrost okay because if it builds up you also run the risk of having this one catastrophic thing happen to you and every single one of us have done this once and that is if the drain hose is actually sitting in the water when you open the valve then it really causes problems and I'm going to show you exactly what happens okay then I'm going to show you a little device that we're going to put in line with that that is gonna help prevent that in the event that you mess up I've taken the the rack out and the wire is just sitting in there we've got a camera here that's gonna catch that and we have a pump running over here and right now I'm just gonna go ahead and turn that pump off and we have a good vacuum doesn't really matter what the value is but this is what happens okay so normally you'd come over here to open your your valve and I'm gonna just kind of angle this a little bit so you can see what happens in this hose and here we go oh you hear that we just had water shooting on into our chamber that's probably enough let me just close that but you can see what a disaster this has just caused now that water has sprayed and gotten on all of your dried food in there which means you have to rerun the bat but it gets even worse if you don't clean this bucket periodically then that could be some nasty water and it means you're probably gonna have to throw out all the food that you just did okay like I said this has happened to everybody once and you know that the only thing you could do is is open that Valve slowly and and look to see if something's coming up that hose but the easiest thing to do is just get in that habit and go ahead also and install something like this it's super cheap insurance and I'll show you what's involved alright we've installed a couple of these fittings let me show you what it looks like so with two of them you see that the hose remain straight of course it's in the bucket of water right now and I like the way this particular part works out you know you can get something like this in plastic at any auto parts store but it's gonna be a y-you know it'll be shaped like that and you really need two of these installed to get enough air flow so that so that the vacuum can't pull up the column of water up that pipe okay so the cheapest way of course are with the plastic ones but anyway I decided to go with these I like the way the the hose lays and you know it remains straight and everything they're not cheap they're stainless they're about twenty bucks for a pair anyway if you can't find something that you like and you like this idea I could probably sell you a pair just get it get in touch with me you know you can go to our website and send an email and I can arrange to do that for you so anyway we're all set up we're gonna do this again let me just turn off the pump real quick okay now over here we're gonna open this valve up and here we go okay and like I said you do absolutely have to have two of these or it doesn't provide enough air to keep the water from sucking up the pipe okay so that's about it you see that that works very very well and really prevented any kind of problems so hope you guys liked that tip and that's about it for today for the epicenter comm i'm epicentre bryan signing out", "uiiyBZxyutg": "what's up homie murder bombs small tubes been a minute [Music] we here at the lab you know um yes that well like you can see it there's little circulator running that's recovering a run from the closed loop system but for right now we bounce in a little bit of dry [ __ ] just real quick nothing's nothing special just doing some quick bounce tech let me get that off here so it doesn't contaminate that just doing some quick balance tags you know it's been a long day i've run a little over four and a half pounds and i don't have any hash i mean i have somehow but i want different you know what i'm talking about so how is everybody how's your day going what day is it [Music] okay that's the this is uh 120 through 159 not the cleanest or anything just trying to just trying to get a little something together to rip with you guys oh we can't do it like that can't see [ __ ] um [Music] not bad huh for some midzies so you're looking to learn about some dry [ __ ] mojo jojo well then i i have wonderful news for you i uh i finished uh shooting and there's just a little bit of editing for the um second video in the patreon series and aside from that i had all this uh dressed up stuff out and i had some material that i was working with so i went ahead and shut up oh comprehensive driveshift uh tutorial-ish video really a sort of revisiting because i have uh i watched a couple of bubble man's um old videos and some john brothel and a d420k and i realized my dry sip tack is nowhere near what it should be and um well to give you an idea why i'm feeling okay about it i'll just show you here in a second we pressed some rosin we're gonna show you [Music] and what we're doing [Music] wanted to see what kind of a quality product i can get from this and still um this this will still maintain a pretty a really reasonable view um this is 120 through 1 49 159 dry sift but this is in a 50 micron bag um a little bit larger than i typically use for hash but not too let's see what we got right here again not not to clean just trying to bounce any particulate through the screen that's smaller than 74 micron obviously boom playing drum solos over here [Music] i tried to use the camera last time but i guess you can't focus when you're live on youtube oh [ __ ] can you guys see this not bad for how long you saw we just worked on it 519 canada here shout out to my dry sipped masters from the north marcus of course uh john six grams i don't know i guess i could weigh it should we wear it yeah we can wear it why not oops we do have a little scale right here anyway so shout out to whoever the hell this company is no more batteries [ __ ] it usb rechargeable scale and i charged i've charged it one time and i've been using it for almost a month all right so we're going to weigh this the easy way [Music] make it a little bit of dry ice sit and really i was just bringing you guys in to take a break with me but when i set up the stream i noticed i had all that sift on the screen and i thought you guys might like to watch that hey four grams 3.95 looked like more didn't it all right guys it's good yeah i am tired i'm ready to take a dab i'm not sure how much i'm gonna get done after that but i have put in a very full day all right um [Music] you guys wanna you gotta [ __ ] it i guess we could press this real quick i do have some wonderful things to show you that i pressed earlier today from some dry sift that i spent much more time with um so if this stuff comes out amazing i'm going to be a little bit disappointed because why did i spend all that time making that stuff nah it's just there's absolute technique that cannot be denied and then of course there's the advantage to you know fully mature trichomes very dry fully mature trichomes in a very cold environment with very low humidity i mean in that setting you don't even really have to be this very good at this thing with all your variables perfect like that you're gonna you're gonna get some decent hatch but for uh mojo that said in the comments there a little bit ago about getting some screens or recently got some screens for driving oh what's happening here guys i can feel just a little bit of loose sift that's around it you know i don't want that on the parchment obviously okay now where's the first one the one i'm on i don't know we'll see if we get any yold out of this this actually is some 160 160 to 249. huge very high micron hash i don't think we're gonna press that but hey let's see what happens with this step as a matter of fact i know i want to press this because [Music] we want to try to stream i guess by a little bit of dry slipping i meant a lot sorry sorry sorry let's go let's go let's go [Music] all right here we [Music] that's a go too close how's everybody doing how's everybody doing it was a little fluffy you know what that points to unfortunately a high uh count of a capitate and stocks so that's contentment um only only contaminant would have it looking so fluffy like that we both thought it was like [ __ ] when you said seven grams i was like yeah probably maybe even a little more and then it was half all right guys so we're gonna first press the uh which one is this i can't remember which one was the bigger bag now the bigger bag was the last one so this is the 120-159 this is the 74-119 i think yes this is the 70 419 that's the stuff that we thought was seven grams but it's actually get my big fat head out of your way [Music] [Music] should be ready to go whoa those are some big comments yo what up austin video is called miz uh mecca mccall man static oh yeah [Music] so i don't know who so so dare you you must not have been here for the beginning i was talking about the marcus um adding to your driveshift quiver that i watched about six years ago and then i revisited over this past weekend and it was a really it was a wonderful reminder um no we're not of course i didn't just do static tech i don't have the time for that right now just want to make some dabs [Music] no they're actually four thousand dollars so sorry to i'm sorry to so sir dirty i love your information i appreciate the help and everything but you're a little bit incorrect there brother um yes of course the video at least i well i mean bubble man pro had had published tutorials on full mel dry sift and static tech six years ago so that makes sense as far as the drying being done with a freeze dryer oh yeah sure it's a great way to do it but old school microplaning and and drying um on cardboard honestly if you know what you're doing if you know how to keep your room cool and dry it can be very dope aside from that even whether or not you're freeze drying or not you're going to have to microplane um unless you're just going to stuff chunks of well you know i have no way of doing static technique the same thing as you were thinking security i'd like to check that yeah oh of course we know that's v man yep it is you're absolutely right sir dirty it is very simple the uh well there's the [ __ ] [Music] oh he's always doing it dude that's that's all that's like every single day for solving this bacon big he goes live for like four hours at a time and washes and presses and you know all that that's what's up yeah so depending on if you want a pharmaceutical freeze dryer which for the record if you're going to get one through low temp um and we are we're only talking about harvest rate i am not going to speak on anybody or any other company's freeze dryer if you're going to go through low temp you're not you're only going to be able to get a pharmaceutical one and they're not and that's not 2 000. they do have a small freeze dryer that's like it has three shelves it's very very small if you don't need a pump or anything like that if i remember correctly i think it's uh we could just look it up i think it's like 25 maybe maybe 3 500 but if i remember correctly actually i think the medium one is because i was looking at the medium one with a pump and it was going to be right here just over four just over four grand i'm so interested in that uh [Music] i love it i love it um yeah i'm so interested in this static tech austin what you got what you got that's new yeah you and that's don't even get me started on that oil free clown so you know dope about fire fire driveshift if you accidentally [ __ ] around and get and get caught answering some questions on youtube and just watching your [ __ ] burn there's the 120 micron obviously buttered to hell because how long i let it sit on the press but i don't think it's gonna hurt it [Music] all right let's press the big one and then let's go take a dab and then i need to get the [ __ ] out of here but i like to say dear tate because it reminds me of joe dirk [Music] oh that's right yeah okay a moderator i understand i'm sorry i've been so into reddit lately you guys that it's just usually i mean bops are mostly moderators over there but anyway i get what you mean now you got a blue ranch when you go live with them and you help them keep [ __ ] together [Music] i know homie i'm waiting for my taxes to come back so i can make skunk man austin god damn it yo if you don't know anything about skunk man sam you actually don't even know anything about triceps and sir dairy that's you seem very knowledgeable and i don't mean to say that to be rude but i actually you're pretty knowledgeable so you probably know who scott manson is marcus himself bubble man himself shouted out to scott manson without skunk man sam we would be we'd be a long way behind in the full mount [Music] there we go there we go probably let that guy warm up for a little bit too long but that's okay that's the beautiful thing about pressing at 155 degrees you got a little bit of yeah a little bit of leeway looks like there's a couple of you in here hope you guys are having a good day i am wrapping up my work week we're trying to anyway i'm gonna have to come back tomorrow of course but here we go let's get a little bit of frozen banana dry sip hash rosin glow for you again remember guys i didn't really clean it we certainly didn't break out any static tech we're just trying to get some dabs for me to get going with skunk man sam is the [ __ ] man just i gotta say it again austin you know what's up hey thanks mojo i laven if you're old school weed too you remember brett mavericks using the static tech on a pool table with the playing card brett maverick used mavic was that that's that's long enough static tech ago that that's before uh i was seeing people regularly doing it with books and dvds and things damn see i knew we had some crossover man i love solving this bacon bank he's such a cool dude and you ain't kidding i do need a netflix series and i'm down for that pay too um but he is such a cool dude and i just like what he's about um i of course i'm i'm kind of busy doing the same same similar stuff so because of that you know oh i have the timer set for 90 seconds i'm gonna press a little longer than that it just we're probably about 110 right now um [Music] also i don't want to get too crazy with the pressure because i just want this to be fire i don't really care about you um that's a shitty thing to say yeah but solving this bacon baby's such a he's such a cool dude and he's just he just seems to be so like the thing i some people are like so you could say that but they're just so nice i don't get that with him i get to know [ __ ] from him i like that you don't need to be [ __ ] nice for me to be a fan of yours you need to be about your game and he is he's about his game i just don't know personally i get silly with trying to be nice to everybody again some presses you just don't [ __ ] care about the yield this was on the plant how long ago did we start streaming 21 minutes ago this was bud a little over 30 minutes ago now let's see here's our first press this is our one yeah this is the big microphone i think that stuff's going to be better 35 40 minutes ago for sure this stuff was flour in a plastic bin in a tupperware you know what's that you know what time it is only i had a [ __ ] rig ready over here [Music] better not take forever geez my desk is messy i'm so sorry you guys let's uh just bring you in on about that much of it so you don't have to look right at all oh i know what i want to show you so that's the this is a little bit of frozen banana dressing pass rosin that we just pressed together we made it [ __ ] around with the card didn't that card moved it around a little bit let some of the let's let gravity do most of the work for us and uh there we got those two processors from it i couldn't absolutely get a second press and i will later earlier today what did i press oh this is nightwing so here's some night queen dry swift rosin that i pressed a couple hours ago and this is the second press i never [ __ ] with second presses unless it's good hash good hash will press two sometimes even three times if you're not if you're if you're doing short presses or whatever if you're [ __ ] it out you shouldn't have to press it three times but anyway i just want to share that a little bit a little bit a little with you we got some super fire rosins for dab on and um we made them all from the plant to the parchment ready for the bag and it's just 45 minutes tops where are you where are you oh you guys wanna get silly little slurper dab i just saw the case over here don't do that that's how you lose a marble all right guys i gotta have that gauge up all right how we doing how we doing how we doing just so you know i can't see you and i have no idea what the hell is going on but i love you guys [Music] [Music] all righty then [Music] let's uh let's start this [ __ ] off right i'm going to start it off with that second press from the uh from the night queen oh [ __ ] i forgot that i'm working one thing [Music] and by working i mean taking a break i like to take a break about every six to eight hours yes i do work 12 hour days 10 to 12 hour days today is going to be a pretty short day though i'll be out of here i'll be out here right around 10 hours um anyway yes we'll slow down the recovery there a little bit so i can play with you guys for just a minute come on guys i think i just want to look at the picture of that deer pooping now so again give me something let me know what's up give me something to read in there sir dirty had all sorts of good information i do i hate that i'm so uh contrarian and so oppositional and i'm sorry about that but it seems like sometimes like somebody i mean regardless of whether or not he's right about the price we can agree to disagree or just look it up or whatever but i don't know why i have to oh no you're not right he [ __ ] cares if any of us are going to buy a freeze driver we'll find out by the time we check out you know what i'm saying you know what i'm saying there we go that blazer though all right so we're going to start this off with a excruciating dab of the night queen second press tricep hashgraph oh i barely even smoked last night i certainly haven't smoked anything yet today i've been working for since 10 when it's about 7 30. [ __ ] i'm at nine and a half hours now it looks like it's gonna be more like an eleven-hour day whatever where's that second graph that's not it that's not it that's a good problem to have right you like that you guys this is the other reason why i want to do a dab with a second press to start and you might be able to pick up you guys having fun watching me let me watch when i finally get my youtube page pulled up here on my laptop i'll be sitting here by myself i mean i don't know how anybody wants this [ __ ] i gotta be [ __ ] annoying as all hell but i love you guys and i love sharing my little bits of knowledge about how to make hashish with you well and don't worry guys if i knock this rig over digger gave this one to me um for court sales i want to say three years ago so it's a decent ring but it didn't cost anything surprise says oh that's me right there i was like i call myself a surprise set all right here we go oh that's that's actually a very big dab already cheers ladies and gentlemen oh my god i'm not even gonna be able to dab the president that's some night queen and really it's like trim then keith that i threw over a screen real quick and it was so terpy i almost couldn't even i really whoa that must be good where there's the very turkey dab one of you what whatever mcafee any cheers come on dude my antivirus pop up was cracking the comments and then thank you elite uh 27 m uh 27 32 and four and that's for the regular and that's in us dollars iso um but that's just a regular freeze driver it is a food grade freezer option but it's not the pharmaceutical ones which have way way way more um options and settings that you can play with as far as dry times dry times depth of vacuum temperature sublimation is a really amazing thing got me by the nose it really did too man it's like uh and honestly that's the oh that's the second press um mixed micron or whatever it didn't it doesn't have a very clean melt to be perfectly honest with you i'm a little less than impressed with that there's absolutely no char or particulate or anything it's just a little darker than i think it should know anyway let me set this down over here or not shut this down oh man yo night queen [ __ ] give me a break jesus i have never experienced that strain being that loud before um i i've washed it and pressed it i have some sugar of it it's just amazing but never had that happen jesus this frozen banana [ __ ] looks amazing this is not frozen now that's good man all right there we go now this should be the bee's knees wait that's the night queen again i can't do that it's definitely gonna be good that's the 120. the 120 to 159 oh all right here we go no he said it was 2k for a freeze driver and it's 2700 and if you're in canada that's more like three um so he was off by 50 number one and then number two that's if you if you have a pump if you need a pump too it's more unless i'm mistaken if that's the price with the oil pump the other thing is that anybody trying to get one of these to use it in a setting like i'm trying to use it in is not looking for an oil-free pump the oil free pump is like an extra six to eight hundred bucks so at that point it's 35 for the small one and for the record that freeze dryer is so [ __ ] small you're gonna be pissed at yourself for spending three thousand dollars on something that small when you could have spent four thousand on something that is significantly better but still goes back to my point i just i don't know why i always got to be right anyway that's fair and honestly that's the thing is if it's a thing to waste and you're like a hobbyist or whatever damn you're really going in on your hobby but for me i look at it as like well why would i spend two to three grand on something that then when i recoup the value for it it's too small so i mean um freeze dryer is on the schedule not sure what size i'll be getting but we'll see you know what's up it really does man what kind of class is on a dab right what would i say and then aside from that hello annie yeehaw right man damn i [ __ ] but i'm almost scared to go in on another job but we got but number one i need to wrap it up and number two come on jesus man i got dab sweats and [ __ ] my gloves all hashy man jesus and my hands are clammy now because they were in the glove that's probably why i was so hot it couldn't have anything to do with that dab i just took i'm sure it had to do with the gloves all right ladies and gentlemen you know how much i love you um i mean if you don't know who's being silly if sir dirty's still here let's haven't seen a comic i'm gonna walk but if you're stupid still here looks like we're going to split the difference um we're both no i mean to be fair i don't know i don't know actually i don't know about that before i think i just said they're not too um but also i was speaking about the pharmaceutical freezer regardless it is the morton salt girl except it's the morton salt girl taken and done by slinger which marble slinger is a glassblower but then he takes it and he puts an assault rifle in her hands and we have a salt girl that makes sense and this is a special february edition this one's called oh this one's called rain and blood that's right that was the other thing the slayer rain and blood um yeah i love slinger [ __ ] um but this is a this is the picasso version of the design super cool first time i saw it i was like that's like a morton salt girl and then i realized he's holding a gun and i'm like a salt assault like a salt oh god and i've been in love with it ever since because i'm an old nerd and when i see some [ __ ] like that and i think it's cool i never get over it jesus christ look at this [ __ ] frozen bananas you guys it's on was he i didn't know that was i didn't know that was with it but at the same time i was too you know hope you're still here if you're still here let me say something um that's what i was saying about the split the difference oh my god look at that melt you guys need to see the color this rosin is melting into uh [ __ ] dude i went in hot we went in just under 600 degrees holy [ __ ] you guys whoa hey what's up austin my homies in the northeast you know i love you i'm saying that a lot of them anyway that is a beautiful amount and if we were if you remember i was out of the right micron bag so i had to press that at 50. that's the 74 to 119 pressed in a 50 micron bag almost like the same size um you know not really but just a little bit so the fact that i knew that was going to be a little charry or maybe dark on the end as it did get a little char charlie when it dried up or finished but i cannot get over the color of that when it melted down was [ __ ] beautiful and it maintained its color for a minute tastes great tastes great it's a very interesting terpene profile um very very unique for me uh well you guys know it's got to be unique for me because every time i take a dab or a hit of anything i [ __ ] cough for 10 minutes and cry and that isn't happening so it must be different all right guys i was going to say have a great day but that dad was so [ __ ] delicious so delicious just like dog food tastes exactly like it smells delicious all right that's the low mic that's the that's the mids frozen bananas compared to this because this is way way way larger micron hash pressed out of a 50 micron bag so this is certain oh my god what do you guys think drop it i don't know sorry guys this [ __ ] is and i'd like to smoke something with some of my homies back home in missoula how is annie doing man thank you mom um reached out to me about um tincture help for either a sick person or a sick dog or i can't remember exactly but i wasn't able to find the uh micro encapsulation article i was looking for anyway uh it's been a while i'm glad you made it over so if anybody has the chance to try this strain frozen bananas this is my absolute first very very first experience with it [ __ ] uh don't get me wrong the guy that i the guy that i work with is an incredible brother absolutely incredible of the highest calorie so you know if you get your wheat from somebody that all the strains look the same don't be necessarily excited about frozen bananas it might not be that different this is very very exciting for me because it's so different than what i'm used to eddie peace 340. well that means it's 6 40 in california and almost 10 o'clock on the east coast cheers ladies and gentlemen that's exactly how you spell it with a k and one l oh my god wait you guys know i like that i like the flare for the dramatic but i tend not to exaggerate especially not when it comes to ash no cap definitely some of the best cash i have had hashtag that i've smoked so far this year period i don't care if it's from a hyperzone maker or if it's from the dispensary down the street this frozen banana ah find me um 120 to 159 the micron is dry ships hash rising is [ __ ] wild i cannot explain this taste to you guys i guess it is kind of mild like the way a banana is like a mild fruit but yo for real grizz that's what's up man austin where are you that's super cool yeah caspell's though also california's the only town county whatever it's the only place in montana that has a chick-fil-a so if you know what i'm talking about when i say there's nothing quite like the taste of [ __ ] hate oh you can only get it in council i got jokes open your heart let the hate out oh oh you guys i gotta lose some weight i gained weight during quarantine and then i just uh gained a little more love to michigan oh good luck with that because to be honest with you this is the problem the dab before this one i was supposed to quit and get and just finish what i need to do and be done but this [ __ ] is so good man so good nah anyway i hope you all have a wonderful week and hope you all have a wonderful weekend uh for those of you that are patrons or interested in becoming a patreon i'm sorry for those of you that are interested in patreon or are already patrons um i published uh one of the first of an eight video series um a couple days ago i've i have minutes maybe an hour left of editing for the uh part two part three is going to be wild it's going to be a celebration so far we're all only into hydrocarbon content but episode four if you can't tell from all these parchments around me is a dry sift and dry sift pressing episode so we got content coming go over and check it out if you like i and i say this because i encourage you those of you that are interested to just to go over and check it out it's you certainly you know pick the tier that you want with for whatever much you want to support me if you if you don't really give a [ __ ] about that and you just want to see what but what's up with the videos or if they're worth the money whatever then just do the small one you know either way you get to see with everything i just ask that anybody that has the ability and has any interest in helping to support me does that like mr david brazier has been like a [ __ ] high-level tear patron for a year and i mean i've while i think he's i think he's the longest that couple a couple of you guys have been rode with me and it's amazing but mr brazier from alaska i think he absolutely holds the record yes sir i'm gonna try i know this much up until um when i came to work today i had always had some hats you know what that or some oil or whatever but didn't really have any fire rotting feeling like my weekend's gonna be pretty sweet now let's get it started right cheers ladies and gentlemen after this i am gonna rock and roll and go ahead and finish my day pardon me i do encourage you to check out patreon if you're interested in processing a tutorial um hash tutorial but essentially processing tutorial content if you want to learn how to make some stuff make some high high quality stuff uh like there's there's a lot i number one i encourage you if you're gonna get into it to get a notebook my videos are you think my videos are long here the number two that's being published should be published tomorrow it's one right now i think i'm going to be able to knock down another couple minutes so if i should be able to get it to around one hour and 50 minutes it's just under two hours it's a [ __ ] movie i mean but it sucks and it's not entertaining however the amount of information in it is is probably pretty valuable um again check it out if you're interested if you're not i'm always here on youtube you can always email 710.consultations gmail.com you can always email the 7th extractions at gmail.com you're interested in booking a consultation and i'm actually i'm commenting from my 710 consultation so there it is 710.consultations gmail.com or you can text that number if you're interested in booking a conversation and for those of you that are interested in going over and checking out patreon that's great because i feel like i owe so much to the people that have supported me over the last year and the amount of content i i just fell short on being able to publish on time at all um i have this very very very comprehensive eight video series that i'm working on now and when it's finished it may be more like nine or ten videos but when it's finished i'm definitely going to turn off enrollment for a while um it's i uh it's hard when you finish a ton of content and then you need to get back to you know to work and or whatever you're doing and you have a new patreon patron or a subscriber or something come in and then you know their first question is when are you going to post something and i'm going like in my mind i'm thinking like i'm not even trying to shoot anything for a month so it's it's uh it's an interesting thing i'm not the kind of i'm not the kind of uh creator on patreon that like has a podcast going or anything that you would want you know that you check out regularly but there is a significant amount of information available to you right now and when i'm finished my a video series the amount of information that's available to you for the cheapest monthly subscription which is insanely cheap i think it's a pretty good deal i wish somebody would have put all that information together for me and been like give me a couple bucks and you can watch all these videos for a month all right guys yes you're absolutely right i didn't want so austin thank you um as far as things like if you might be interested in them like merchandise uh some personal time with me one-on-one stuff like if that's the kind of thing you're interested in there are some advantages to the opportunities but cheers ladies and gentlemen frozen bananas oh i'm under the same name i am everywhere brother however i do think it is all just one word i don't know why i spaced that either jesus that [ __ ] is so good i want to try a dab of it and save peace and kill the stream and that's my third day oh i love you guys but i gotta get back to it and get it wrapped up again i hope you have a wonderful weekend should anybody have any questions comments concerns anything feel free to go ahead and throw that in the comments section below and aside from that if you have any uh interest in a consultation inquiry you can email 710 dot consultations at gmail.com or you can text the number that i wrote in the chat 406-500-6698 peace", "hQ-2ooQuUkU": "[Music] hi and welcome to canada basics today we're going to learn how to make bubble hash [Music] bubble hash is one of the oldest and purest methods of making concentrated cannabis and uses only ice and water as a solvent it's easy to do but requires time patience and some elbow grease so let's get started here's what you need to make bubble hash when it comes to making bubble hash you are going to need some bubble bags and these are usually vinyl bags that are designed to fit inside of one gallon or five gallon buckets and they have a silk or micron screen bottoms and those that vary in different sizes 25 to 220 microns and you're going to need three to five different sizes of those you can find links to those kinds of bags on amazon in the description you're also going to need a wooden dowel to agitate the cannabis you're going to need some ice about 10 15 pounds of ice you're also going to need some cannabis you can use any grain of cannabis that you want for here we're going to use about three or four ounces of outdoor grown cannabis if you're using outdoor grown cannabis or any kind of cannabis you're going to go ahead and manicure it down to its buds so go ahead and pull off the major portion of the leaves until you get down to the pods unless you're actually using shake and trim which you can also make bubble hash out of shake and trim but we're using the buds and we're going to go ahead and manicure that down the next thing you're going to do is to layer your bags inside of the bucket we're using a five gallon bucket you may use a one gallon bucket also depending on the bags that you have but the thing that you want to do is you want to layer your screens inside of the bucket starting with the smaller screen first so in this case we've put our 25 micron screen in then we put our 73 micron screen in now we're putting our 160 micron screen in and then lastly we'll be putting our 220 micron screen back in and micron screens and that a micron is the measurement of microns with 220 microns means that 220 microns will fit through each hole in that screen and then so the smaller the number the smaller the size of the holes so and now that we've added our screens and layered them up and now we've added our cannabis into our 220 micron screen we've added about three or four ounces of cannabis and then now we're adding in ice now the ice is being used in this case to lower the temperature so that it freezes the trichomes and so that the stems of the trichomes are brittle and the trichome heads break off into the water so you want to use as much ice as possible so we're putting as much ice in we're covering up our cannabis and we're coming about six inches from the bottom of our pocket and now we're also going to add water and you want to add water so that it covers up into barely covers the cannabis which is in the the bottom of our top bag so you can tilt the screens or tilt the bucket to find out if see if you estimate if you have enough cannabis enough water to cover your cannabis but that's the idea is that you want to have enough water to cover your cannabis as well as up into the eyes and what we're doing is we're freezing the the trichomes so that the stems become brittle and the trichomes heads fall off and the idea is that to break and agitate the cannabis so now we're agitating turning and using our wooden dowels to actually literally just agitate and mix the cannabis being sure not to poke holes into our micron screens we're going to keep agitating as much as possible you can do this for several minutes 15-20 minutes or so and then after you do that you're going to let it settle and we've uh what we've done is we've broken frozen those trichrome heads and we've letting them uh fall into the water and then they've fallen through those micron screens and this larger micron screen we're now taking that out it's been several minutes after it's been agitated and it's been sitting for about 45 minutes and now we're taking out the the top screen the 220 micron and setting it aside and now we're going to pull up our first green which will have trapped some of the uh larger pieces of cannabis and our thc and trichomes and also some plant material so this first layer of screens that we're pulling out is going to be our least pure it's going to have our most plant material it's our biggest micron screen and most of the thc has actually fallen through this screen so but you can see there we've pulled out a little bit of bubble hash there and it's a darker color hash and then now we're pulling out our second screen and in order to uh save the cannabis that was left on the screen that we didn't wash off we're inverting it carefully and then dipping it back into the next green down into the water that's in that screen and that is to wash the trichomes off into that next screen so now we're removing the second screen out i believe this would be our uh 73 micron screen and we're we're letting the water fall out of that we're not going to squeeze it we're gonna let it fall out and then you can see now that the trichomes that are left there a little lighter color than the first set and there's also more of them and there's a lot less plant material here as you can see compared to the previous hash that came out it's a lot lighter color but again we're rinsing the remaining hashtag we didn't scrape off into the next batch or into the last screen so we make sure our screen is nice and clean and then we've come to our last screen and this is our 25 micron screen and we'll see this is the finest screen and this is going to make sure that pretty much anything left on here that's any thc is going to get trapped in this screen here and as we scrape that up you can see it's pretty easy to collect the cannabis or the thc that's collected there or the hash and it's a nice uh lighter a little more blonde color than the previous two a little bit more pure and you can see that's why those screens are used so that you can get different grades of hash and the next step now a lot of people would use a micro on screen here we didn't have a micron screen we're just using some cheese cloth or a muslin cotton muslin bag here and we're squeezing out the water it's just being pressed out gently with some palm pressure there to press out the water and what's going to be remaining is bubble hash and what we've got here is three different grades of bubble hash depending on the three different screens that we used and and in the end we're actually going to combine all of our hash altogether so i'm just showing you the different screens there for demonstration purposes but if you're only going to use one grade of hash in the end uh there's really no need to have multiple screens you might just use one or two screens in that case but for demonstration purposes we're using multiple screens to show how you'd get different grades of hash and now that we've uh we've gone one run of our canvas you can do this two or three different times or even up to five or more times with each batch of cannabis so this is the second run with the same batch of cannabis just with another run of the water and ice this one actually sat overnight this second run we got a pretty good yield off of it even better than the first and then we even decided to go ahead and run a third run off of the same batch of cannabis and so even after collecting two pretty good batches of bubble hash with it we went ahead and decided to go the third one and even after the third running we're still getting some more hash out of it you can see after the third time the cannabis is getting it looks like a lot like seaweed it's very foamy it get agitates a lot easier and it also gets foams up a lot easier as the last two or three batches were gone but once they pressed out the the phone goes away and you can see that there are three different batches of bubble hash there at different stages of drying out and you can see that the uh the newer batch is much muddier looking uh the batch in the center there is the first batch we did is dried out from overnight this episode of cannabis is brought to you by the roughhouse studios smoke shop selling raw rolling papers accessories vaporizers much more a great process save 10 off everything with the code kind of basic i do hope you enjoyed this episode of canada basics on how to make bubble hash if you did please hit that like

water hash hacks so our first tank today is going to be how to create a shield this is a picture of a shield just cut the bottom off a bucket then use the shield on the inside of your work bag as seen here this helps keep your bag from drifting to the middle and will help protect it from your drill or your paddle or whatever you're using the mixer batch our next hack for today is going to be using a siphon we have just pulled out our work bag and here we see our hash water in the bucket one of the easiest ways the siphon this water out is to use a 25 micron screen like this it's easier to push the bag down into the water than it is to dump the whole bucket through the bag get a pan or a small bucket to place the hose in you just need something to stop the screen from getting sucked into the hose another way to do this is to let your hash water settle for about 20 minutes and very gently place your pan on the bottom of your hash water bucket then siphon out of your pan to a bucket with your 25 micron screen bag catching all the water if you do that just in case anything good does sneak out on [Music] now that took me about five minutes and you can see all the hash is left in just a small amount of water that's a lot less to deal with and it saves your back and your time another little trick is when you're dealing with multiple runs is you can just mix them together you can do this easily if you're using the siphon method I'll mix my first runs together and my second runs together that's what you see here the mixing of two different runs now let them settle and pour it off later which brings us to our last hack of the day rinsing your hash this trick works especially well when dealing with low quality trim so now just fill the buckets with fresh water and let them sell for 20 minutes before pouring them off if you're in a hurry you can use the bag and the siphon and then you won't have to wait for them to settle [Music] [Music] now I've let those buckets settle for 20 minutes and I'm going to just pour them off slowly you can see this stuff's pretty clean already you'll still see some small debris that gets out once in a while there's still a little bits of stuff in there now with the clearness of the water you can start to see the hash down there at the bottom and now you can see a little hash trail trying to make its way to the rim so we'll stop it about there and now that's all of our hash and just that little bit of water I'm pouring these into a 25 micron Bay to catch anything good that gets out if it looks good enough I will add to my second runs or I will just use it for cooking I like to repeat this process until I can see the hash sitting on the bottom of a bucket full of clear water [Music] I have been dumping buckets in that bag all day most of the time it'll pull straight out with a little or no resistance so it is holding a little more water than usual but still easy to pull and it's draining pretty quick [Music] when i zoom in here you can see there is some stuff stuck to that bag it is a little dirty well happy hashing age [Music] [Music]", "DUJ3W85ZmMw": "hey what's happening I changed in the tube here the drain hose on the bubble now a hash washing machine figured I'd do a little video all you do is pop this little door off the back with two screws and cut the original hose off this one here with all the ribs it catches all your hash keeps it for itself but you just cut that right off with a knife get a hose three-quarter inch interior diameter and slide that get it warm put it in warm water if you get especially if you get this good sturdy one that I got and I don't know weasel its way right in there and connect right there put the hose clamp on and then I just did a 90 in a cat there so there it is another little tip if you don't want to pay the couple hundred bucks for the bubble now sticker you can get a cost way on Amazon for 60 bucks it's the same machine I got two of them this one that I got the one with the hundred dollar stickers so it's up to you I'm glad I supported bubble man on this one he's taught people a lot and so I'm glad to pay it I guess for one but to cheap to pay it for two so there you go and then put that door back on and get to washing pace", "sk9BI0-7A2o": "[Music] welcome back guys Johnny B and me in the house and we're about to fresh frozen dude I'm so excited that you came by with the fresh frozen watermelon today yeah no that's a birthday treat for real what kind of friend brings this problem now of course I'm not keeping the resins but just to be able to make it and smoke it with John to me is a perfect most beautiful of birthday gift so I've actually got a rarity here that you haven't seen yet I've got all three of the bunk bed kits that we're selling right now from the original the top grade warrantied for life durable as a mofo except that I have yeah exactly that's the professional house makers kit that's the most expensive fog gallon aid bag kit that comes in at 320 plus dollars number two which still has all the colors right just a slightly lower GSM thread count the bags are still quality right and I use an outside bag to change the color to show people that this is not an original kit so that they shouldn't be paying the original price this bag is about $50 cheaper this kit I basically passed the savings on of the slightly cheaper material for the bags and the cheaper out outer material and basically patch that right on to the customer so that bag comes in at about 270 thanks Canadians hey are you much sorry and then the final ones which unfortunately these look a little smaller than those other two kits because I only had a 1 gallon kit and these were fives but pretend this is a 5 gallon kit now these are the lights and these are the ones where I really went out hard on the savings I changed everything there's no eight colors like I took away the eight colors and put only three colors which was a pretty massive savings for me being able to not have to buy eight rolls of full color which is you know it's everything everything adds up it's very expensive to buy eight separate roll I was able to pass on a huge savings on the eight bag five-gallon kit of the lights at just a hundred fifty bucks that's like half price it's less than a half price for the original so you know what just lots of people always asking for deals and always asking for cheaper set so I like to accommodate we give deals and we have three different sets that can accommodate you for whatever your priced price it's not to sound too much like an infomercial cuz I like the fact that John and ionize videos are more chill and more real but I I never talked about the bags that much and this is a good time to do it and we use these ones already we use the lights and one of our other video exactly and we've used the originals I did the originals with Remo I believe and it's just a matter of one day running but it's your birthday today so what bags you use well for my birthday I'm using the top-of-the-line 100% full lifetime warranty bubble bag originals course you know and man that's soft like if you're going to travel with this bad boy as a hash maker across the [ __ ] plains of Afghanistan sleeping in the mountains you know and I open I think we might actually try and do that I think we will do that after Jamaica which we're gonna do in a couple of weeks we're gonna be in Jamaica in a couple weeks with Tony potentially Chibs Scott from rare dankness and a few other people I've invited down for kind of just a real cool hey let's get together and have an amazing time in Jamaica go hang out with some cool artists and Kingston go to a couple of cool parties meet the Rasmus go into the hills make hash isn't that what it's all about oh that's just like sweet alright so Johnny Cash John is brought over the watermelon today we've got the fret I won't pull it up just yet because we should fill when we fill this we will need the herb better go so we're gonna use the bubble now for our mixing and we're gonna use the barrel shaped bags I know a lot of people love their triangle-shaped bags which I will be bringing to market soon spoke with a few different people recently nicotine being one of them offered him pyramid shaped bags cuz we can of course manufacture any style of bag that people request if there's any professional Hashmi out there that want their own specialty kind of bag you know get in touch with us we'll make you anything you want and one thing you know about bubble bags and fresh Shetty's is that we make quality products that's it's a good offer anyway so we're gonna do the fresh frozen how much did you bring weight out of or hunter grams of wet for 400 grams and that's the watermelon that's the what a memo you showed me at the front door oh god dude you know it smells down here they just go up to the camera and show them this glisten the negative perfection whoa isn't solid it's pretty frozen dude look at that that resin was so sticky I did do a video of it alright layer of ice this is my birthday treat Johnny happy birthday oh it feels like little icy trichome rocks okay more ice now yeah now we're gonna put the chosen make nice little layer of ice and then a layer of or so yeah you can put more ice in excellent you basically want to make it so the ice is covering that layer of herb pretty much completely which it is they're perfectly yep we're going up for the camera okay just barely touch this herb a little bit God is that nice now you can put a bunch of more ice I'm just I just put that back in the ice right there [Music] I've done this before with me and without with in with them this is a perfectly that father was the 400 grams it knocks this bag perfectly yeah I was getting used to it I like my little Rubbermaid bin so once that's all the fresh I know I'm ready good to go and this the 2.5 gallon nine point five liter bin that I'm using good sign John we have five nice pieces of ice here perfect there we go back Sean so today we're gonna use ice in the bubble now machine as well nice just because our water is not necessarily gonna be the coldest coldest coldest you could start turning that water on now actually I will let that water run because it is an outdoor hose in a black hose sitting out in the Sun when it first comes out it can be pretty warm and we're pretty blessed with our water that just fits Oh perfect uh no real it's gonna be nice I can't even tell you how good that TGA strain smells I call it watermelon all the time it is the Astro Boy from TGA and it is a really nice strength there you go but I was gonna put some ice in here to pour in there so we're using the bubble bag originals I'll get rid of the lights and the standards and there's one more little bud I found would you like to put some ice in there so you keep that for photography reasons later nice it's on the gun no stuck to my fingers so good boy one away we will but what we're gonna have to do first to get a little of this mounted because it's such a perfect amount we basically filled this that's the cool thing about the the barrel shaped bag is that it fills the Machine perfectly and just allows you to mix as though the Machine the bag isn't even there you know what I mean that's what I love about this bag that's why I'm so surprised when I hear people say that they prefer the triangle bag and that they're getting a bigger yield and they get it I get my yield I get what is there I never get less you know what I mean if there's 10% that's what I'm gonna get and having a barrel shaped bag certainly isn't going to be it isn't going to make it that I get any less let's get some water on that yeah we'll bring over the hose over here I'm just gonna pass if I'm the camera here I think it'll just reach if we're lucky we're lucky I think we just happen to perfect there we go so we've had the pressure turned down there so we could do this we got lucky there I got it awesome you know I know this is good come you know what I want you to do come around and dab me out a bowl with the D nail I'm gonna be amazed you know that's great about that sliminess I can reach in here with a nice little ball yeah it's awesome all right oh yeah there you go dabbing and filling up the bucketful ice here getting the bubble now going it's just very nice asking beautiful oh that's nice what did we dab up there number two and three [ __ ] oh gee I like that pack indeed it is a very nice play I'm sure I like it a lot it isn't yeah this is filling up beautifully perfect yeah you're just hearing now what's getting up to the top which is great oh not even close it's actually about halfway perfect yeah and luckily it's got quite a bit of distance about an inch and a half all the way around the whole thing that can fill with water excellent yeah you know you don't want to take away all your water the water is definitely a very important component of making water hash water and ice always what you say keep it cold mmm-hmm keep it and I'll have you all know that this hose nozzle was cleaned by myself before I stuck it in here I made sure to get all the particulates or any little pieces that were on it off and I cleaned it up real nice I've been getting a lot of sort of flak lately because I show people how to make a bubble and of course I like to show them how to make it properly but I also like to show people how to do it easily with whatever they have available for where they are not everyone can afford an expensive hash lab with machines and ice makers and AH rows and so for those people it's nice to be able to show them a way to to be able to hand mix and you know how to get your house dry properly and all those things all right now we're getting close to the top okay I'm gonna turn that off so I'm about maybe two inches from the top and the reason I'm leaving that distance this is nice too now the bag will go sideways and upside down so I got it nice and upside-down all tied up we're gonna do about a ten-minute mix today and then we're gonna come back and we're gonna pull some bags for you nice and quickly the bubble now has been filled with water ice and herb john told us we put 400 grams of fresh frozen in there which is probably around 100 grams so if we can pull out anywhere from 10 to 12 grams of hash and return we've done exceptional so let's get her mix in it's my birthday batch it's your birthday so we're gonna continue to smoke hash while this bad boy continues to make cash yeah I hid yourself some Hoss oh you're nuts oh me oh well alrighty then stoked kind of let's make a hash in her birthday it's your birthday and always hitting it nice and all someone was saying though we take big bong rips I think no I think it's the quality of house that we're smoking you think we're taking a big one but it's so smooth it was pretty big okay let's bigger than normal what is your how can you not do a big birthday trip who's delicious that sauce that's nice too the more water and the more ice more ice [Applause] more ice merrier yeah you're gonna get a great extraction ratio [Applause] John's got the parchment paper here we've got pizza boxes four of them spread out which will be more than enough for 10 to 12 grams it's always great to use less hash for large area the more surface area the better and we've got the parchment paper unbleached for putting overtop of the cardboard I get so much flak for people a harsh and on me for cardboard I show you the cardboard because it's available to most people of course if you can have parchment paper and you've gone to your store and got some that's great just make sure in high humid areas that it's not stopping the wicking I do worry about the wax paper esque miss of the material but here we got John he's just gonna fold up the edges and we're folding up the edges on the parchment paper to just make like a little protected area so the bubble doesn't you know fall or get knocked off the parchment and we're gonna continue we're gonna tape the parchment as well onto cardboard thank you sir you're very welcome always nice to give a friend hand especially when it's you know about birthday hash patches there you go all right so that's pretty quick just picking the four together like huh yeah once it stays up nice nice little box that's perfect for keeping the bubble hash safe all right well let's go see if if it's time for us to pull the bank's tape down the corners a little bit looks yellow and smell it [Applause] it's almost like a beige yellow I'm totally excited to go how cool that is I can feel it when I opened it it nice and we're gonna get these bad boys working real soon [Applause] [Applause] all right we're back and our bubble now has just stopped mixing we did about a ten-minute err sample 10 minutes and water is pretty trippy it's almost like now that is funky I don't even know how to describe it it's got this light light green but the green is like a good it's golden oh I want to say smell my fingers but I'm not smelling a finger it's so yeah feel free to have a sip I always like to taste my rather a problem there's definitely resin you can see it floating right on the top in that right yeah it's nice hey yes I like it so we are gonna put the bags in the bucket real quick this doesn't have to take a long time and I'll just go through the colors and the micron sizes you start with the purple the 25 micron it's the smallest screen make sure our bag is nice our bucket is nice and clean because I do remember we got a little few nuggets that fell in there otherwise the only thing that's ever gone in this bucket is hash so not bad alright so 25 micron going into a clean bubble bubble bucket yeah we don't even have to turn it over but you can it's definitely not as necessary takes a lot longer if you want to do all the bags but it does help keep the screen nice open 45 micron the white this is our second bag and it's definitely a bag that produces no shortage of resin that comes out of the 45 micron bag really regardless ADA stream it's what I be pumping lately I mean that smoke is I'm 45 my little pony 73 micron that means he's out of 90 73 120 but it still goes to show you that it's worth puffing I'm actually doing a little bit of watermelon on top of that excellent so this was 73 yellow I'm not sure if I mentioned that I might have I might not have we've been dabbing bowls so there's 73 yellow used to be the gold bag until the black bag came along and stole its thunder yes the black bag is my favorite bag and it is the 90 micron today on this day of 90 micron I wear all black and honor of my friend Xavier from medical seats rocking the medical seat shirt that's job is there awesome oh great time with those guys just good dudes they can't wait til they come here we can show them you know our style we got beeping and bangin and beacon and dancer number 120 micron orange so that night it was a pretty a pretty good ad in from the 122 the 73 everything between the 120 and the 73 is delicious and awesome and you loved it but there were still thoughts that if we separated it it might even be more different and of course it was very glad to have my 1970 separated red 160 micron this is the contaminant bag but can also be a quality bag you know there has been resin that comes out of this bag that is melty I'm huffing on some also 160 no right now really yeah my little pony no I'm also 190 Green sorry to interrupt go ahead oh I'm just saying how tasty that 160 is because I have some good wow this is nice so um you can always try you 169 your 45 you have to be quite pleased if you're a good organic grower you'd be amazed at what you can get but they'll definitely know it's when it's special you'll see right away if you like waiting so this is the 220 now and we're still gonna use it even though that the bag in here the bubble now barrel shaped bag is at 220 I still like to use my 220 bag and just in case filter out any other contaminants that are a large particulate separate out from those smaller screens passion this looks like this bags been mixed once they pulled what was good to keep your bags clean it's good to check the bottoms of your screen sometimes before you shove them into a bucket it's a good idea you can have debris and dirt on the bottom of your screen and now there's some dirt that's right into your good hash and now you don't know how it got there but I'm sitting on the bottom of the 73 or the bottom of the 120 and you pushed it down and when the water and everything went through that little particulate fell right into your hash and it's just one thing to pay attention to so we've got all these now we're going to do the draining a quick little drain just over slightly all right and we'll just do the green on this boom that's exciting yeah that's fun I love this part make it hash they don't what boom you know what it's it's the most exciting part yeah so because this is fresh frozen watermelon and it's a fairly warm day thank God the Sun went a little bit behind the tree there we are in for some quick pulling of bags because when we pull in fact what I would suggest John is the 190 and the 160 no problem but when we get to the 120 I think we should I need to dab you up wick right away all right that there pass me your Tupperware container always make the key for a second one oh absolutely that was that nut so we can whip up a second run so fast to yourself when using fresh frozen of such quality nugget you got to do a second run I just touched it my fingers are sticky well that water was coming out nice and clear adding that extra gallon or two was worked out in our favor you're just gonna unplug this get the bubble now out of the way we go right and we almost killed me actually this will be a table there we go excellent all right so we've got our little area set up here with our bags I'm using a small bucket to flip the bags over and then we've got a spray bucket over here so that we're gonna be able to utilize it spin it in the ice for the whole time so it's excellent all right so even right off the bat there's spring to be done on this bag they do this is great so happy can't wait to see the night on that one bad boy there we go I'm gonna flip it up and you can do some spraying if you like yeah so this is mostly pistol at Harris stigmas big large contaminant if it was bubble it'd be moving a lot faster so this this part will be a little bit slow when you're spraying John's got it about half way cleans now yeah it's definitely I'm sticking really as you can see right now he can you can but it's it's just all right so let's just give it a quick little scoop what we can find we've got the screen nice and wet just give that a little scoop and drop that right there to 20 micron flip this take this here John we'll give it the clean-out over there just like right here it's really convenient that's nice to have that hose you're off camera but what John's doing is he's leaning over the deck right now and he's just cleaning the bag with the hose here I'll give you a little a little visual cleaning the bags with a beautiful ocean view in the background good Johnny no this is nice this is darn nice all right well let's get back to pulling our bags we definitely don't need to spend any wasted time leaving the water in the resin in the water so quick 10-minute rip on the bubble mouth and then pull those bags that was very little in that bag almost nothing see that every day although there is stuff it's kind of spread out on the screen it's invisible because of the orange screen in the sunlight I almost couldn't see it this is more resonance now it's already moving much easier than that other stuff was just pile it into a little spot very small little 190 keep that on and just clean it like that with the easier to clean when it's stretched I often clean my buckets my bag stretched over a bucket like that it's it's held in place it's easier there's no mob eases there's no creases that hold the bag shot in in weird ways and it's just like super quick alright a real small amount of 160 probably because it's just so damn good there's very little contaminants this herb that's something to come very small little piles but also not important piles alright now we're getting more into an important a bag that you want to see some resin in generally is your 120 it's a nice bag to see a little piling never a bad thing yeah a little pile of some some niceness show the camera here little pile of someone 20 goodness this teamwork there you go we're making bubble boom melt on our Gmail what snails by puking be skillet tools for me bubble hash galore alright looks good pick that up oopah so this is the bag that we put in the next bag to come yeah exactly you don't want to lose this resin that's a good point to be remembered by even this little bit of hash that stuck to the spoon right into the 90 quality is there no problem you're definitely not contaminating that bag by any means putting a tiny little bit of 120 in and white and then you'll still make sure we give it a good rinse alright 90 bike bum bag one of my favorites always good when it lifts up with a lot of water there's about a gallon and a half gallon and a half of water in there right now which tells me something's covering the screen at least a little pile this is always nice to get your yield in your 90 bag if you can a bad thing give that 90 you tiny little particulates but if I rinse the bubble around we should be able to pick them out which is like too much use the bottle in a second once I get these new guys Irish three or four just tiny little things that we don't want in there and let me tell you this thing does not want to pick up whatever it is all right you got a bug spray this up in just push the bag up put the lip up on the bag and it makes for easy even easier spring and I can just turn it boy there so you can just stay in one spot whatever works best for you looks like a nice pile there's definitely probably threw three grams there I would say where is that last one 20 was maybe half a gram 73 45 still two more good bags that we're gonna pull oh we're gonna how creamy that is oh it's delicious Rick's on the screen remember these ones need to go through the sieve almost immediately we can't leave this out for too long we can't waste all our time filling all these bags anyway we're gonna have to see some I think yeah that is like trim to the Krampus sound so there's that I'm thinking what I'm gonna do now though is potentially strain that 1/2 hour all right so we've got our parchment paper made into a big square here with the edges done up layer down here and I suggest we do that 90 micron and almost immediately let's get that done right now all right well let these guys see what's going on a little closer so I'm just gonna put the screen right here sure I'm gonna go grab that Oh sounds good man just gonna quickly um oh it looks perfect it looks perfect for micro plane itch for receive it for sea Vitch I should say sorry it was mixed the names huh all right so there's the ninety we're gonna gently rub it through the screen and you can see it's got that perfect right now that it's crumbling perfect so what I would suggest John is use the end okay and you you rather than make it awkward on yourself come back around here I'll show you here I can't show you without showing it there you go basically use the bottom of the spoon on the edge of the screen so I'm gonna try and he's gonna come back I'm gonna show this right here there you go now a lot of it right now is stuck on the outside but I give it a couple of whacks and it's quickly coming off oh that's beautiful look at exactly and see how we put the lip on there because as he's tapping away the lip is actually protecting it from jumping off of the lip is working for us very well yeah it does doesn't it Danis quite happy with that oh but you know what he's getting a little bit excited oh you got to get a little excited we're cleaning this hash off we don't want it stand in our seat we want it on that parchment getting dried all right that was 90 perfection right there well that's all you stuff coming off Wow worried about bouncing everywhere was it we just let this dry a tiny little bit this left little remnants that are in here we'll give it a good whack in about two or three minutes and it'll just fall and cover this look at what beautiful coverage we got with that sieve and in the Sun it looks so nice doesn't it job oh yeah it does some nice close-ups here I'll give it back to you there my friend oh dude beautiful right there cuz you already there beautiful beautiful job today is the birthday boy I know it's my birthday I should answer the phone it's birthday everybody's calling him he's making hash if that's what he alright that's awesome all right we'll be back in a second all right that didn't that 90 look unbelievable aren't you glad we received that right away I'm telling you right now if that 73 was still sitting there it'd be a done deal the 120 we could do any time as well but we'll pull these three bags and we'll do them all together we'll be quick though because the 73 is gonna be just much like that it's gonna be creamy deliciousness that 90 bag just made it all yeah right there and the 73 is doing it too just so you know just so you know it's also doing it yeah all right yeah the 73 is looking creamy too a very creamy I can I could smell it all right let's get that in there Oh thought I was gonna pull the Ricky ledee I thought you're almost gonna pull a rookie moves you know we do that even being we do we do we do I mean that's the that's one of the main reasons I don't mess around with chemical solvents but the fact that they're just come on look at this in the Sun look at the color of that that's just amazing you know what that's you know I can see it I wish you guys will bring it to them we're gonna be like this is one from here directly in this I'll let you pull that little chunk out in a second once I get it right there that guy and I think he didn't have a bit of an animal in that there we go a couple more perfect so stinky yeah this is gonna have to go all right want to get the spoon spoons right here oh yeah this is just like that night he was just like that it even wants this just stay on this that last little bit dang keep it the you know what it's almost the same amount with 73 is there it looks beautiful it's even like hardening on the spoon here screen the next screen is coming up the next screen the next screen I should not be the next parchment the next cardboard and parchment we're hitting gabs it's easy for us too alright so take that guy right here we can rinse this guy off ASAP because he's already starting to dry and that's one thing we talked about is don't let your screen one of the things they were doing in Spain that I couldn't wrap my head around that I really was thinking that it's just something they shouldn't be doing and I saw more than one person do it they pulled all their bags out and then they hung them and lean them up against one another put them in a bag and high-quality resin is gonna wick moisture just sitting on top of that screen so much then it'll be very difficult to see if micro planing will be one of your only options at that point and you'll have to of course freeze the resin before you do that because it's a warm environment in Spain especially in Barcelona even it's hard to get to a cool temperature that you can actually you know even just playing some some hash without having it just start melting your fingers all right it's richer bags very very devil there the better yeah no it's good so we're just given the resin and ice the resin is so clean Beth Lee Mort I see you yeah it's like four grams at least I'd say we've got our 10 to 12 grams anyway Joseph just from the like two and a half to the two to three two three four five six yeah we've got about ten anyway we still haven't pulled 225 either though just give this a couple of good squirts to show if there's any contaminants in there no it's beautiful then we'll scoop it all up how's that for not a drop drive would you like that that's cute dude that's a nice pile that's a huge problem that's not even done yet that's thanks thank five times of everything I'd say it's at least five times of everything yeah I think there's about six grams just there that's definitely close to five maybe 456 you know I'm just guesstimating just like you and I'm like you know no no more accurate and my guess we're gonna weigh it and we'll find out what its gonna be like yeah we're definitely let you know I'd say we're gonna get that through the plane real soon if you want to start sieving yeah why don't you come over here and see why like bags all do the cleaning on this bag I'm gonna grab this 73 right off the hop sure man yeah get that going right away it's good looks good hey you blow that off nice and fast tech I can just do that nice work though well easy going easy going so yeah this is a nice easy way to clean bags isn't it yeah isn't that nice haha totally digging it all right excellent excellent so remember the cleaner you you get your bags the better it's you get that resin stuck on there and you're the one that's gonna be dealing with it that is the truth of that never a bad idea to just use a little extra couple extra minutes and make sure you get it real dry well that's looking great John that's the 73 73 all right you could probably afford to card just a small section of this over there real quick you might even be able to do it just with the lightness I wouldn't touch it with your hands but and then we can put the 120 right here I will draw a line and then we've got two more in there that we'll have to make i'd say we're gonna need at least a whole one easy-easy for that 45 right now yeah then I'll pull the 25 bag this is a bag that everyone has a real problem with a simple technique you can see that it's holding at least 3 gallons of water but a simple technique is to lift it very quickly and the water just releases so a bag like this generally when I start doing this little jerk upwards method I can drain it in about 10 seconds fresh frozen John but I still have more that's sitting to be run again like we'll put it in the bubble now again and run another batch so I'm going to grab that we're not going to film our second batch but we will let you know what came of it that will do many push maybe a little couple days down the road notice how I filled the bag with air and slid my hand down the bag to actually get some of that excess water out do not physically grab the hash in the screen and squeeze it that is not a good idea it's just something that definitely is not a good idea and then finally here we've got our 25 oh yeah looking good John the 120 looked beautiful the 25 is one of the unique resins that you can actually gather with a spoon almost as well as you gather with the spray bottle but why that is if it's the size of the heads obviously it is it's the only thing that's really different about it just clean it so well 25 micron the grade that will pay for your bags whether you want to use it in a metal bowl or an ax joint or smoke it in a bone I saw Franco from strain hunters recently going off on you about USF's 25 micron bubble so you know that there's something to it there's some actives in there depending on where it was growing on the strain this color of this 25 is absolutely beautiful yeah awesome I got water spraying in my face this is awesome it's beautiful look at the Sun just just goodness this is totally beautiful totally awesome birthday thanks for coming over John oh you know what I mean you always come over but put a nice guy to bring the fresh frozen and hey plan this like this is a day it was something that I you know it's I'm gonna I'm gonna give me this cut I've rushed this home now about Christmas I brought him here from my friend Ron's yeah we were laughing about it today it came home in my pocket in a plastic bag and I'm gonna go get the second parchment paper so we can get on seething that 25 and that 45 I'll be right back and what I'm gonna do here as we know this side here is the ones one and this side here is the 73 so instead of drawing a line on the paper here I'm just gonna write it on the cardboard gives me an idea I put the 73 and the 9v fills up that whole tray and this 45 is definitely looking so sweet so I'm gonna wait for mark to come out here right now move this whole dollar bags we've seen the 90 the 120 the 73 and what we have left is the 45 and the 25 we're not bothering with the 222 190th 160 it's just schwag Isles I'm gonna pour this water into my garden down below that's terpene rich hey here we go that right there is what we call koala tay 445 I'm gonna smile on your face look at me dude you're 45 below is that Johnny already five is this your 45 over that's the 45 Oh John do you think that III think it's just a beautiful thing what are you my friend it's for you I'll look at that for you I think I think I think listen maybe just a little bit tiny little bit if it's no good you let me know if we need to we'll add a tiny little bit of moisture it could be perfect it could be perfect oh yeah it's coming through nice it's sticking so gently give it a gentle little smack on the edge as you move it as you yeah oh yeah that's perfect John oh this smells amazing it looks unreal II hear ya believe how the smell this is the colour is written this is probably the nicest 45 I've ever seen it's definitely very nice for me that what I've grown so I mean here and there you can also do a light scraping on the outside make sure you move it when you do that or you'll get clumps though move the whole unit around even towards some of the empty spots so this is a real important process the sieving or the micro planing we're doing the sieving technique it's good to keep your tools cool we're doing this in the sunlight so you guys can see it really well obviously it's a better idea to do this in a colder environment not that it's SuperDuper warm right now but it's definitely probably ten degrees well we are so filler up nice little pile right off another piece and just kind of working yeah gently sieve it through the screens you know there did this did have a little bit more moisture removed even though it's sieving perfectly if I left a little bit more moisture in it it would have probably sieve even a little bit more perfect both the to the 90 and the 73 were like that as well but this looks great you're gonna get it all the way through and you'll be able to to cover this parchment paper nice and evenly so wherever you see it to be the least amount is where you kind of want to spend some attention whoo nice yeah I like that I moved the paper open just as you did it all right I was like team I was like team work you're like very receptive to the motions John hi you know what we work well together we do get the job because we're just having a good time but now it's cuz we love what we do we do love what we do and we seem to be very much alike in our in our just in our histories and the vision involved with and we just seem so damn happy to share with the people out there you know what what's what's the best thing you can do is show people this yeah baby it's my birthday hash look look at the bottom of this I'm so excited oh yeah let's look at the bottom of that in the sunlight alright give it a gentle smack rather than brush it with the spoon you can smack all most of that off sometimes I go high like on this on the top part that's good and then of course some more loosening of it up as it dries as we're taking time that bubble will dry out a little bit more and it'll even break off easier sometimes the little bits that get stuck on the outside you can gently brush it off with a spoon or you could use a brush you could also use one of the anti-static brushes to get this bubble off and that's just a nice even amount we'll give that a few more good whacks on the edge of the stainless steel strainer with the spoon real good ones give it a top whack like a nice hard one yeah that's where you see it really start see how I see it bouncing and releasing them yeah excellent beautiful alright well we've got our 45 we're gonna move on to the 25 so we ran out of space on our parchment paper we don't really want to rip out another batch and the 25 micron of all the hashes if you get it into a thin enough patty it seems to be the one that can actually dry in a patty so we're gonna do a little experiment just with the 25 we're gonna leave this little patty as is and we're still gonna get it on to the wicking table here we've got a nice little spot in the corner of our 45 we'll put it on the parchment there and we'll get back to you and let you know how that kind of turned out it's been an unbelievable birthday batch with my amigo Johnny I mean such a good friend comes over with the beautiful mess whips off a batch with me and this in this beautiful area that we live and yeah I mean basically the only thing really left to share which I'll end with is the macro photographs of the resin that we just made you know starting with that 120 micron beautiful heady heads all stuck together in little clumps beautiful color dropping down into the 90 and suddenly it's like whoa that stuff is surreal Dimond like glistening amazingness with the 73 looking almost exactly like the 90 to the naked eye I expect that it'll look pretty beautiful under the macro lens and then down into the 45 and I'll shoot the patty 25 and we'll share all this greatness with you guys so once again Jon thanks for coming out such a [ __ ] pleasure dude always a pleasure hanging with you bro I'm excited you know what dude I'm excited too this was this was a
