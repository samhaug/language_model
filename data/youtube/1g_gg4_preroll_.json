{"IZmbM787F3s": "t-h-e what is up my tac family it's been a minute since i've talked to you guys um if you follow me on instagram you probably already know why but if you don't go ahead and follow me right there thc dot re but um anyway i was just telling my instagram people that uh i wouldn't well i can't make any uh marijuana content because um i had a drug test so yeah i had to get clean for a little bit but uh today i took the drug test so now i'm free to do what i want and uh i went to mission dispensary i picked up two things two things uh i think i'm gonna just do uh one thing for this video and then the video after this i'm gonna do another video explaining the other item but i wanna let you guys know mission dispensary that's on 85th and commercial mission dispensary in chicago was great service great experience i love the setup of the dispensary um the prices were good like everything about this dispensary gave me good vibes and you know i got to let you guys know how i feel about the dispensary so you guys can see for yourself and i wouldn't just you know let you guys know if it wasn't true uh but yeah let's check out what i got today no matter of fact let me show you guys the inside of mission dispensary i got a little footage right here reported online and um yeah i was in there like five minutes you know that's the best thing about it so right now what i'm going to review is a brand that i've never had before so it's my first time reviewing this brand and we got some igm pre-rolls ibm stands for i believe i'm not a mistaken illinois-grown medicine um let me see if it says that anywhere on here yep it does it look illinois-grown medicine and it's a pre-roll joint these are one gram of a strand called sunburn i'm gonna give you guys a closer look you know how i do it um by the fact i'll give it to you right [Music] now [Music] but yeah back on the sunburn um this is a one gram pre-roll uh coming in at 25.01 thc uh you ask how much this cost because usually illinois at dispensaries pre-rolls like for just one single one gram pre-roll you're looking for anywhere to 18 to 30 bucks probably this maybe 16 bucks too but this ten dollars ten dollars for a gram so it had me kind of skeptical like why is it only ten dollars you know and i've seen the strand i mean it looks you know sunburned 25 percent thc i mean full grand prix roll you know it looks nice um you guys seen the inside it smells amazing sunburn wow pre-roll it looks nice it looks like i wrote this myself because this is how i close the uh close the front of my my joints you know i don't do the normal twist method like most people and um it's a little space right here but you know we can just burn that off or cut that off snow no biggie i'm pretty sure that's the full ground though because the king size raw and um oh man it smells great actually smells great nah like it has that funky that funky aroma to it for sure um i get some some good some good stuff whoa why is that joint doing that i don't think it's supposed to bend like that i hope i didn't just do that okay let's see how this um let's see how this smokes let's see how it burns you know let's see if we get that white ash you know i love that white ash um now there's all that's left to do is to spark it up you guys know the rules we don't just burn and flame it up we you know burn it you know gotta let it burn a little bit you know so we get that that red circle so we can know it's like burned evenly you know smoking sunburn on g you know i think it's og but cheers to you guys you know just cheers to you guys for anybody that's watching this you know i appreciate you big time heavy especially if you support me on a regular like man you don't know how much it means to me uh like it means a lot seriously so this one's for you guys for sure thanks wow before i even start reviewing first things first you guys see it you guys see it that's the white ash beautiful that's what like that turns me on man like [ __ ] the money [ __ ] the sex like when you know when someone passes me a joint with white ash or i flame up with joy white ass that's that that right there that's what gives me you know [ __ ] gets me gets me going and i'm just [ __ ] with you guys i'm [ __ ] with you guys but look seriously though uh our first rips um it's a very weird taste i'm not gonna lie to you um i never had sunburn before this i say the taste is weird because i never tasted this before um it's actually not a bad taste though it's a weird taste it's just like because i never i wouldn't expect this taste i'm trying to find out how to describe it bear with me let me take another poll honestly guys this is a tough tough review because it's not bad it's not a bad you know um strand i know it's been a while since i've smoked but i know weed doesn't taste like this i'm gonna try to describe it as best as i can it tastes uh like a fruity you know um fruity weed basically that's what it kind of tastes like it has a sweet taste for sure um it tastes very good you guys see the stacking white ash man i'll see how long it goes too i'm not even gonna ask it i'm just gonna see how long the white ash is gonna go for but um yeah quite feeling the effects though the effects aren't as heavy as you know normally when i give you guys a review first few pools i feel the effects um i don't know if i mentioned hold on what is what is this i don't know i don't know if this is a hybrid or or indica or what you know i don't know or sativa oh i asked it on accident [ __ ] okay i guess the effects are coming in um that very sweet weed um it tastes very good it's just a weird you wouldn't like i don't know like someone passed me this i'm like damn what kind of weed is this you know never like you know because the taste is just like you wouldn't expect it you know would i buy this again yeah for sure would i recommend this yeah for sure so what would i have to rate this pre-roll with the beautiful white ash the beautiful taste um the mellowing effects not too strong i'm still able to function um i would give this this sunburn i'll give it a nine you know um i was gonna give it a uh eight but i i find no reason to give it a eight you know i'll give it a nine out of ten for sure oh i recommend you guys trying this for yourself maybe somebody will be able to explain it better than me sorry about that um but yeah it's it's fire that's what i like one word to describe it's fire for sure wow it's like just like that a sweet aftertaste that's all i can explain like imagine if you just ate a piece of pound cake that's what this weed tastes like damn i just described it for you guys thc re hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please like share subscribe head over to my

it's 22 percent THC which is actually a really [ __ ] high really not th see right there that's a TiVo that's pretty good Jannik and the guy was telling me he's like this is one of my personal favorites he's like dude this isn't gonna get you these Oh smell that okay really blue baby now I'm excited to some other stylish it's being huh okay piss like Bobo it really does look at this y'all look at this and it's like groans so nicely bro like look at that that's how you know it's like kind of like we're getting to you sell me out like I love movies like that this is like yeah this is like really healthy as weed because it's like if you look at it it's not it's wall growing it's well flushed and everything and then the compare to a really heavy indica yeah take it out let's compare and contrast that this is an indica in here and see how it's all compressed and yeah that's what I'm saying look at that this is the your indica right here this is my indica we're not smoking this right now but it was here a little bit later look at that we got that so here [ __ ] smells good but yeah this right here everybody we got some yeah the Mendel breath that she's fired [ __ ] we got today we got ireia I did the real damn some live I'm gonna choose that eight if you don't mind me after [ __ ] was thirty-five bucks that was 30 bucks my fault thirty bucks there let's get a 3.5 for free yeah there's thirty bucks yeah thirty bucks but he told me it's like do this [ __ ] right thing and I'm like dude honestly I'm like we're about at [ __ ] raw what how about having a hoop we're about to roll a [ __ ] of them in a joint so [ __ ] stay tuned y'all again everybody the SEC really glue some sativa I'm juiced man this is about to be five then we got this [ __ ] T you gets literally smelling it out of the container like you're just smelling it rocket almost literally like it reeks through the [ __ ] container I've been using this when there's we don't care how mad you house think is it oh damn that stink match sticky and I even break it down I literally just broke it just little pieces and I want to break the [ __ ] by hand now look at that you look at you look at closely like super super closely again this camera doesn't really do any justice but like if you look at it super close a [ __ ] is [ __ ] yeah that's just something bad so you know what you could do to grind it minimal yep do a couple just do a couple turns here let me show you how to everybody let me show you how sometimes like I think about it on my dude if you grinded if you grind the [ __ ] load out of it bro it could potentially take away some of the like trichomes engine you know anything a lot of people press down when they're grinding and like yeah you have to obviously present but like to a certain extent press down it only do like do one full turn another full turn another [ __ ] that's it that's it you need okay yeah that's really all you need you just kind of need them kind of like break down this little bear looking good yep was looking good nice fallin grinded and everything too so it's good I also today I'm the one that rolled it let me know how I did I'm usually not I'm not a roller definitely not a roller so it looks it looks nice from this side it doesn't mean he's good from far apart from good this side is likely what I'm gonna show you guys this a yeah a little ugly except for me I'm gonna taste that just takes to just take a hit and just taste that [ __ ] bro that girl that gluing on [ __ ] joke bro that guy was - yeah thank you yes make sure you acts nice impressing this oh you should have put a minute just a little oh [ __ ] no wait hold on I'm just thinking it's up to you but I'm just thinking on the bug I think now would have been at from the inside yeah yeah but no I was thinking I'll think I do that other container has a little layer like honestly with your Pig we could've just have my seat where's it now but my shits at the house let me check one of my things oh yeah so we slapped on some regard and well hold on you miss egg let a book all right yeah what is that some longer than what this is the the fire oh gee turns over whoo it's that one pass out that one book one book yeah that's just fire wrong oh let me see the right there oh nice yeah you're kind of just melting at huh yeah should it be warm yeah oh yeah huh yep even better yep there you go now it's getting more moist cheers gorilla glue with some OG fire wubba Oh some by someone the way that the og og well but no no no no let me rock rock introduce me man you introduced me to a new technique on how to spark it I knew it yeah whatever guys like this look you gotta make the usual somehow get into the facts how much cheese with that she's so [ __ ] loud you think about that first couple of heads bro what's up first couple hits I had a little bit of a stress on my mind my mother from whatever I had stressing from where our stressing banana just like kind of like weight the table my shoulders I'm just chilling I can just not worry about it and just be chilling and bright so what I'm trying to say is that I'm lit what was good though y'all have you guys ever smoked that gorilla glue what's poppin let me know in the comments down below makes you guys drop a comment there's no way guys a friend what you guys are smoking on mm-hmm but yeah this is some gorilla glue some Gigi number four so I'm really cool for so g-g-gee it's definitely paid like hella good like better or worse from your previous experiences hmm can't say just yet but I think this is good who knows actually because I know we had some guerrilla glue not so long ago honestly if you're right nut so that's what I'm trying to remember I was like you remember Johnny's guerilla game that's what I'm saying that shows fire to it look like an indica yeah and gorilla glue or also known as GG 4 created by Gorilla Glue stare decisis Evo dominant hybrid and multiple award-winning strain famous for its high THC content yup it a verge is 18 to 25 percent THC this one average is 22 this batch that we got 22% so with the imagine with the wax to this Pilate Helen oh yeah no [ __ ] regard and wax is looking like 50% but you may find it as high as 32% some dispensaries 32 some dispensaries have this [ __ ] at 30 to 30 when you get to 30 percent THC that is that's 5 [ __ ] right there that's that's fire yeah cuz the 30s that's why what the yeah yeah and then the CBD is very low ranging between a point zero five at a point one I honestly don't like I really don't like [ __ ] homes in CBD I don't like that should be giving me headaches in shape so let's see this is a 5 a 5 star out of 5 Gorilla Glue number 4 this is a really good strength and it's crazy too because the guy was like I asked him all that what do you recommend and he reached his hand on the back of something pulled some [ __ ] up and I was like GG floors I looked but he put his hand in a in a black pants and a black hole you just put that he just needs wet his pants and he's check out that [ __ ] and I was like Oh fire it's yeah I have two of those it's wait I don't get it so it says sativa but it's recommended to smoke at night interesting very interested if uhrin types of sativa yeah let's see in different types of engine typical typical effects relaxed card mouth sleepy common usage depression pain and insomnia okay that's kind of cool gorilla glue for us on itv4 was created this is that the strain gets his name because of the resin that collects on the scissors when trimming gorilla glue number four has several parents parents due to extensive background Sour Diesel sour dub cam sister at Kansas City Kansas and chocolate diesel the hybrid strain has won awards at the 2014 catalyst Cup in both LA and Michigan I usually don't cop that much unless I'm smoking like taking a nap described as a bunch of trichomes with a few but leaves in stocks sticking out the aroma is very strong true that and as most is mostly diesel with notes of chocolate and coffee although sweet and earthy is also it's also used to describe it you'll be going back for seconds due to the full-bodied and flavorful spot you mention it I do taste the chocolate milks in the smell is really [ __ ] nice I'm gonna lie this is gorilla glue this gorilla glue I'm not gonna lie it's Pollock in my top five best smelling weed flowers top five it's in my handful for sure not top five for me not me right now what I'm really on is all like the the oranges all the of the sours like the line technically yeah technically I try to choose I try to choose one of every category if that okay that makes sense yeah so out of like the ones that smell like these the gorilla greens like you said sour diesels and honestly cuz like Sardis let's just smells fire stuff too we really can sister [ __ ] and chocolate diesel I've never tried that sour dub neither so our diesel initially actually trying to a chocolate it's a strain called chocolate peppermint you remember that fan it's [ __ ] it tastes similar to this but [ __ ] now that I think about it I'm like Sour Diesel does [ __ ] smell like this too and I just gotta have both comparative we got to start doing versus versus yeah yeah like this versus this huh I'm Donna another hit 11 a campaign stepped out let's see the buds are green with orange hairs that's it is very oh it's spongy resinous and covered in trichomes it was yeah yeah the little dents what are the parts yet because it says it's this very dense spongy president then the trichomes you can see all that [ __ ] you really can't I really want to get a camera week the [ __ ] young man well imagine how high-quality are [ __ ] video get a microphone a microphone a freaking the colors the microscopes doesn't just end up looking at the [ __ ] well when our tree looks under my physical eyelids green that they know people have a bunch of like [ __ ] that in German and the little Tigers well you date that [ __ ] just marijuana a [ __ ] a cannabis plant looks really [ __ ] crazy then you zoom in and you see literally every little detail you see the trichomes are like little little crystals on there it's like it's like clear you know like orange hairs they're nuts like do this it's such a it's such a satisfying view like a whole nother filing Wow it's a home of the funny hobby like yeah that should say that [ __ ] has a lot of information though you know the glue is because it's really popular I know a lot of people like it with new [ __ ] a lot of people like been emoji to vent emoji remember the one that we smoked the vent emoji or do a send us upload that video curl igloo makes you chill medical and recreational users boat it gives a full body melt and despite the sativa dominance the body effect may be a result of the THC CBD ratio but let alone the copies a lawyer buddy if you guys ever smoked on some Gorilla Glue I know a lot of people out there it's kind of crazy bro this is what I really like about having this type of channel and having the type of community that I'm trying to get together you know it's like everyone's different parts of the world I have people commenting from the UK people from the East Coast and I'll shout to you guys try people from [ __ ] Antarctica but even from [ __ ] marty at what gods it Mars I don't know why I was hunting Bush out there but and you guys be smoking on like [ __ ] that I've never even heard of honestly people will drop a name or a strain or some [ __ ] and I'll just play what the [ __ ] I never heard about that I'll check it out yeah they did for sure I always say oh yeah I try this one we bro you don't have like if you guys are from California then we might have the same strength but you guys are from like somewhere else y'all have different strains like in London in a night like over there overseas do they have cookies like they should but that I'm pretty sure burn it would be smart enough to yeah setup with cookies club and in the UK especially London [ __ ] yeah oh yeah oh that's just legal out there hey Canada - mmm but maybe he already does have dispensaries in Canada and UK Glasson it's Canada cat in Canada that's just the legal legal that's just like you're smoking a cigarette you just have to be on personal property at urine which is the hostas personal property and you have to be of age we're both we're both 23 or 96 babies this is an 18 and up channel but it's all literally for all educational purposes I'm loaded with let us know if you guys are loaded and bloated with us learning gluten for sure I feel like I've been lettered in bullies inside that was 13 since eighth grade this is just like Lil D freshman year we started smoking it's crazy we should make a video on how I first started song in breath why we started smell good I'm there because we wanted to get our tolerance off for the under the influence we would have smoke sessions uh-huh and by his crib my house we would like kick in by like these offices because we are apartments are connected to like pretty much you can say abandon offices and [ __ ] so we just glad kind of walk to like the offices in shame and we just be like smoke and [ __ ] we smoke a [ __ ] blunt it's crazy back in the day everybody loot all it would be like six of us and we don't opt like two dollars and fifty cents each literally two dollars to fifty cents these food walk the shell end up then and we're all like 16 17 and no no we were younger yeah we were younger and the guy the guy that used to work but at the gas station that we used to go this guy he would let us buy [ __ ] like Swisher's and [ __ ] he just wanted to make sells you know so he's like [ __ ] which works for us and yeah yeah exactly and I'm pretty sure bro we all like tell a little to the video server to keep making dropping videos like that bro that [ __ ] I should have a funny bro [ __ ] that's just really crazy bro we don't drop $2.50 clothes if you go to the gas station get changed and by a blunt go to the walk walk see if we can get a ride to the plug house and so now we would walk or it was an adventure yeah it wasn't that far the plug look over the bridge for the bridge yeah cop like a good like a 10 sack or a 1.5 roll that [ __ ] in a blunt maybe two maybe like [ __ ] split that point what point eight point eight in the black yeah yeah well I think gave us dub we just rolled both blunts mm-hmm and we just smoked one both of them and we'd just be chilling and I just having hella fun like six seven of us is hella loaded just not going on adventures don't have a fun [ __ ] we'd be stupid loaded and out of the consume but a display survivor like you know that was live yeah one time we had these like these guys dressed up as girls chases yeah right and we like we really we were young [ __ ] 15 so just imagine and we were this is like this is like a 25 2012 2013 yeah yeah yeah you're right we're little well technically we're like when I brought what the [ __ ] we saw like these guys in like dresses put with makeup and hair case abroad so that [ __ ] was like awesome well and that was a time we're like [ __ ] tap-dancing bunny you're like two three years I never ran that fast do life went out dancing bunny was the scariest [ __ ] I watch it on YouTube when I was like young or dude yeah from from the house from the house after to to to the store to one this thorn yes I'll take it is like a quarter-mile problem so yeah so check this out like I'm pretty sure everyone seen that tap-dancing

soul will really envy me bleedin boxing skills to the test [Music]", "6-qXy-MVgh8": "[Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another bear laps cartridge video you know saying we got the gorilla glue 4 i actually went to the club thinking i was able to get another lemon sorbet but it sold out quick and i was just kind of like sitting there thinking about what cartridges again i was just like well let me just try another gorilla glue but i was kind of like iffy about that because if you didn't see my video already with the other bear labs video that i did randy got the strawberry cheesecake and it wasn't that great it wasn't it was a cartridge that i probably wouldn't even buy so it kind of was just like oh there's like a 50 50 chance that this might be bad as well so i don't know i got it anyways we're gonna see but i did get some boba as well so let's just [Applause] yup mango peached green tea so this is my old lemon sorbet one just pop that out put that right here let's just open this so uh let's see what this is running at did i even tell you the box didn't even see what percentage i think it did last time but here it is one gram that's weird let's try this though so i mean even though it says live resin cartridges i believe it's they use the same method as royal garden because it's very light or the same method as buddies i don't know what exactly they do but [ __ ] it let's crack this open and let's just see oh wait there's some sort of uh wrapping on here some keys for this but yeah hopefully you guys have been enjoying the content and let me know if you've tried bear labs i've only tried two bear labs cartridges and only one of them was good i'm not saying the strawberry cheesecake one was bad but it definitely was not good [Music] so [Music] let's try this this was 32 out the door so definitely not bad i'm not bad at all all right cheers why was it clogged already i'm thinking when it's clogged i think maybe they transport it in a little bit of a warm temperature and maybe it clogged it i don't have no idea but cheers boys not bad a very lemony zesty type of taste but definitely not bad uh i was dreading that it tastes disgusting or at least not not tasty at all but this is very good i would say it's a very minimal tasting lemony one uh kind of like the lemon sorbet but it has its own gorilla glue you know like that piney-ness i'm gonna take another hit though [Music] [Music] it's definitely a hitter holy [ __ ] oh gorilla glue 4 strong sativa hybrid oh it's a bit weird that they didn't have the the can uh cannabinoids or or the yeah i think the last ones i had they had the cannabinoids in the front right here i could be wrong honestly my memory's not as good but definitely not a bad cartridge for 32 i could definitely see myself getting this again and i'm going to take one more hit because why the [ __ ] not it's gorilla glue it's around three it's around 3 p.m right now and what better way or what better time to smoke gorilla glue right then right now you know so cheers i'm about to meet up with the homie be legit maybe do a video after i don't know but cheers wow might even try the other ones because they had because they had a triangle mints but i remember stevie saying that it wasn't that good because he had the wax form i might try it um but they only had three i believe they only had three raw uh i mean i believe they only had four strains when it came to bear labs cartridges triangle mints lemon sorbet strawberry cheesecake and then gorilla glue four so i've already tried three out of the four and triangle mints i might try but like i said my homie stevie tried the wax version and i remember him saying that it was it might have been something else but i'm sure i mean triangle mints is a very strange name something that you probably that would stick out right and uh i just remember him saying that it wasn't as good but i could be wrong so i might try it in the future other than that uh very very good cartridge 32 bucks not bad at all not bad at all i'm gonna take one more hit and we're gonna end the video here cheers oh look how much i hit it all right guys that's gonna be it for the video peace out [Music] uh you", "_fnIWDmaWHA": "I would up y'all there's a little bit of controversy on the field of lyrics

biscotti so hard I almost named and Scott Storch is my witness the big pescado biscotti like literally almost named to my album biscotti and I rapped about it in so many songs and trust me I really campaigned hard Frodo's and on transe is this without getting into too much detail this doesn't even matter I'm in a good point in my life if I put in all that work and all that effort to hand select

"-cTVj0tqW9k": "i'm not george working used to vacation products and you're under the age of two and go ahead and get out of here right now so i am currently walking to where i would like to smoke uh today i'm gonna be smoking a marlboro red cigarette and i'm gonna be taking the filter off i'm gonna be trying a filtered cigarette unfiltered so i thought that might be an interesting video so i'm just gonna go find a smoke spot a little bit quiet a little bit of a quieter place it's not very quiet right here um and then i will uh start uh taking the filter off and smoking you know what i'm saying so uh hell yeah update y'all um this spot not very good it's too noisy i do like having a little bit of quiet in my spots so i think i'm gonna go to the typical park where i uh smoke and uh smoke there instead i was thinking i might try to find a new spot today to record but i think i'm gonna be finding a uh new spot you know what i'm saying so i will update y'all when i'm there you know what i'm saying uh you know what i'm saying yes sir yes sir um but yeah i'm gonna go there and uh then i'm gonna record yes sir so i'm finally here i'm finally at the little bench you know what i'm saying uh finally here uh i finally made it to the smoke spot so i think i'm gonna go ahead and get the video started let's see i'm gonna go ahead and put my little vlog stick down you know what i'm saying let's get that and uh put that up a bit you know what i'm saying and there we go all right all good for the video and everything alrighty see ya uh today i'm going to be taking the filter off of a cigarette and trying to smoke it so i'm using a marlboro southern cut today i'm going to be doing that and i'm just going to go ahead and just go ahead and get that filter off let's go ahead and do that let's just get that filter off there we go there we go got that filter off and there's a little bit of tobacco in there but there ain't too much just uh put that over there you know what i'm saying and i'm just gonna do a little bit get some of the get some of the stuff out so i don't really get too much in my mouth and uh yeah i think i'm gonna go ahead and try it let's uh yeah hey yeah definitely problem with these is that there's gonna be tobacco in my mouth but there's nothing i can do about that i might honestly smoke it like it actually is probably a bad idea but yeah i'm gonna go ahead and get this lit up and uh try it taking a filter off of a cigarette let's try it let's see how it is all right all right it's not too bad definitely definitely much rougher than i'm used to i got to be completely honest this is way rougher than i'm used to but that really isn't an issue because as said no filter it's to be expected it's very rough but you can definitely get the taste a lot better i've never tasted an unfiltered uh southern cut and honestly i think this should be really really good as an unfiltered cigarette it's definitely more rough than the lucky reds i assume simply because these are designed to be used with filters whereas the lucky strike reds are not designed to be used with filters but they are much much much rougher but honestly these are really good i am really honestly enjoying these this is um it is a good smoke good smoke all the way and as you can tell no filter so definitely definitely a good smoke yeah got a little tobacco in my mouth that's the problem with these unfiltered i'd be trying to pull as lightly as possible but it doesn't really matter i always be getting tobacco in my mouth anyway so but yeah that is really really rough that's like taking a big bong hit man that is a rough that is a rough cigarette but honestly no complaints i think i'm going to be smoking this whole thing you know what i'm saying i'm getting pretty buzzed i'm already seeing how much the filter cuts out on your buzz because i smoked a cigarette right before i left so usually i wouldn't expect to be buzzed and i haven't gotten a buzz today but i'm getting decently buzzed you know what i'm saying this is kind of crazy i'm not expecting this at all just keeps getting rougher and rougher man man that just keeps getting rougher this is really good though and you can definitely taste the taste it's a lot more sweet without the filter actually is it it's a lot more sour without the filter i would actually say it's a lot more sour um and i think it's because of the roughness the roughness really sours it up so i honestly i do prefer i do prefer the marble southern cut with the filter but honestly without the filter it's not it's not too bad it's not too bad man that's good cannot complain in the least you know what i'm saying oh man i can't believe it though that smoke spot i tried to go to it just wasn't open there was so much noise uh there are bugs all over the ground i was like i'm not sitting here there's sand spiders everywhere i was like i'm not getting no sand spider on me so i had to i had to i had to come over here you know what i'm saying a bit of a longer walk but it was worth it pick myself up some water on the way don't have that out right now i wish i wish i did but uh yeah you know what i'm saying i think i'm honestly just going to take one more hit because this is so rough this is such a rough cigar and i'm expecting this next hit to be the one that's going to kill me definitely a very very rough cigarette but honestly really really good honestly if you're looking for a buzz if you're trying to get a buzz or something like that you haven't been able to get a buzz lately take off the filter off of your cigarette it might honestly help a little bit and uh it was definitely good now of course it's not as healthy for sure um that's pretty bad for you getting all the tar directly into your lungs but really really no complaints you know what i'm saying um but yeah uh thank you very much for watching guys you know what i'm saying i hope you guys have enjoyed this video and uh if you

is talking about it something smells like weed in that back part of the library no one has located the source of the weed smell but witnesses say that it seems to come from that area of the library behind the computer desk between the magazine rack and that weird couch head librarian cookie Stevens and library volunteers Margaret Mosier and Gale Frederick's were in the middle of discussing the upcoming used book sale laganja when they smelled something strange smell marijuana somewhere we're like shocked yeah and so Doug goes do you smell it oh I thought it was my linguini than that message I'm saying funny like it was on fire he thought it was cookies laying cause he's on fire I couldn't believe it was drawing up with a library again you guessed this is not like a couch and Chong or something without any way to confirm that the smell was indeed weed cookie Stevens called her husband sheriff Stevens who called in local ceramics teacher Dutch Gibbs who lived in Seattle for a few months in the 70s yeah that's weed sheriff Stevens has begun compiling a list of potential suspects including that boy Lance who has girl hair and hangs out down by the quarry greg Franchi who was spotted this evening really going to town in some potato skins at stake Jake's Steakhouse and mr. Thompson luckily one young reading enthusiast seemed unperturbed by the illicit smell I hear a lot of people talking about I mean I don't I don't smell anything I mean yeah yeah I don't smell anything I I really really really love the library the weed smell comes on the heels of last month's discovery of a gigantic pair of women's Underpants in the children's fiction section according to Stevens

tried to give her a break man but I love my baby bro couldn't do it I love my Susie couldn't do it you know what man so what kind of couple card is that right now you know I'm smoking on that check ROG Jack Herer oh gee it's on its last legs but you know man you've been kind of my inspiration I do yes yes you have you know you've you've been on the hike trade for Suzy for quite some time now uh-huh you know so we we try their dis list let's show the flow hey there flower all right so I picked up a rule from Cali next room okay yeah you know that's my boy shop in the boy yeah it is it is a gram yeah oh [ __ ] I could smell her out the [ __ ] wall that bad dog give it a good little missile it's gonna be our rub to their teeth as well I also picked up some unicorn tears from Kelly connect you know I'm actually really excited about that [Music] yeah what's up what do you think I don't know let me check this out this says founded in 2017 this is sole mission is to provide premium cannabis products the fuel's are packed with 1.2 grams of topshop flour coated in a clear oil and rolled in heat for maximum potency so if we got some oil we got some keep beer over my bad we got some clear oh you got some Keith and some top-shelf flour this is the the Blue Dream so we're smoking on some blue Jade initiative apparently okay that's a very classic sativa if you know that's one of them stable phenols table Sorel through also did you also say it was a ICU I'm sort of like they all done tested tested okay okay I see that yeah I feel like all their stuff is SE se lab tested Susie is here to set the industry standard to influence and inspire through innovative methods oh I don't know what's to innovative about this particular this particular fear oh yeah pero I think it's pretty bomb where to go yeah it's making its way back did they start off with three rules or did they start with the pods I think they started I'm not too sure I believe they start off with the pots I was like their main selling point okay because I I mean I mean you smoke them that's it's actually really bunk the popular plugs are we go they I think they set themselves apart with that mango cart oh wise I've never had a car like that obviously now in Italy that almost tastes like the only pot smoking a mod or something like yeah you know buddy that's like that CBD so you know that it's like that whole body and there's not a lot of cartridges in the game right now that have a CBD option there's a couple I can only coq10 at least in my area on one hand I know Alpine has it I know dizzy has it who else has okay there's a lot of new options now that let me nice clearly with Evelyn I haven't seen she been out there with a CVD part yet so it's cool that that Suzie is [ __ ] trying to save with the curb you know with the times they were founded this year so oh you're right you know that's how good this pyrrole is man yeah yeah this is good this is really good yeah both sides yeah you're right speaking on that I think or even I know that like four months ago Suzie was nowhere yeah I didn't seem in any of my local clinics I know you you were the first one to bring you up to me and then all the sudden when you brought them up to me you're like yeah man I'm at that red my demo you know it's just like oh [ __ ] and then all set it popped up bro there's there's literally at my local clinic CSN there's a floor mat that says dizzy at her front door yeah there's a lot of marketing dollars being pushed at the clinics that there's a lot of marketing dollar dollars being pushed at the clinics the I frequent towards this friend you know yeah and I wondered is it because everybody really represents this brand and they feel like this is the future or is it money you know Lori doesn't have the most money exactly exactly saying hey I'm willing to spend what grasssnap was it spending before that product placement but it's cheaper this is Suzy is that a butter knife like is it cheaper in the breast muscles if you're looking at like grams and 1/2 grams oh so I'm curious is there carts go around with the market price $30 for a hat but they're not car supplies and the supply at least in my area good here in the surrounding communities the city so not like that bro and when they're out of the clinic like iPhones they do sell not like iPhones because it's so put the hot ride out and because the representatives aren't reopening the clinics as fast as the 510 carts are being read up it's harder for you once you invest into the students dizzy ecosystem to continue to smoke applaud once you're empty if you don't already have those stats you know so so yeah they're selling out so quickly so you almost feel as if the company itself like reached out to farm like it almost took too much because it can't can't like maybe they were sense yeah I can't really like to resupply like all the demand that it has as its reached out to the point where it's all of Orange County at least I don't know about too much too much I don't know I don't know if it's a complaint because yeah I'm not mad as I've been pushing the demand that's not I don't know because the demand is [ __ ] there does the man is there this good at the same time if you're gonna make it so that I can only smoke your father out of your battery my name is your products be available if you're gonna be the best option I don't want have to [ __ ] look for your I want to be able to copy the second I'm are walking to the spot you know I feel like ditional speeding miles ahead and as far as flavor which I feel like they are maybe I think the only other card that I've smoked that is comparable to flavor would be room and that's just because they spent so much time on it you know I know you think I know you're only a meal right now to their armies in the field I tried the other field too much so maybe it'll change my mind who knows I mean that's for I guess a later time yeah yeah so I'm appreciative of the hype and the super dope demand that Suzy has created all the marketing dollars the best in the [ __ ] market to be available especially if you're putting yourself on the display next to [ __ ] brat stuff of which is hardly a problem but I understand it's an emergent market so overall why don't you eat the right now grace for you this was like like the carts you know I don't want to like to sell myself on one particular but Susie has been close close to my favorite right now let's say they are about us like a 7.5 to eat [Music] [Music] I gotta be I have to be a little bit more reserved as much as I love the Stygian spot experience exploding their cartridges this tree model was not that impressive to me I stuck to say my favorite hero love your blackout through mobile company does

hey let me go get a pre-roll let me go cough a pre-roll you got rules no I'm not doing that I've always had trust issues with pre rules but I don't know what's really inside of it and I don't know who ruled it yeah so I got my two free pre-rolls last night at I aim weed pop-up shop if anybody doesn't know or if anybody lives in New York hit me up cuz homegirl got connections they're always

dirty I had this rolling train from one of the events that I did go to so yeah so I have to here I got this from the entry as you can see it's a little loose they were kind of being whatever and then I got this with the purchase of the bud that I've got from a table so I've already smoked the bud that it's already enrolled in this one and this is a mystery weed so hopefully all those will lighten refocus let's party let's party let's party my god I'm so yellow okay there we go a spark joy oh this is cute they even did a little a perfect em can we get that and focus I can't I can't get it in

like a car you chicken I'm not going to pass up free food so I thank you very much so that [ __ ] was my hit spot I'm gonna just say that it is by tasting wise it didn't taste that great but it sure enough got me smacked I give him that so moving on to the fuzz they don't die I got three different bugs as you can see I got two from the same table present both wicked green and then one from a different table boom so I got sugar cookie purple pie and apple fritters I'm gonna insert a video clip of it Oh sugar cookie was definitely a fan favorite of the ladies last night so that's why the vendor recommended it to me and that's what's in the second panel oh yeah it's really sweet smelling like it smells legit like sugar like candy and then we have purple piper if I definitely cooked my I personally pissed I like her I don't know why it's just so pretty so you got the purple part yeah then we got the apple fritter the apple fritter smells the best the best so sugar cookie was definitely a fan favorite profile looks the best and Apple Twitter smells all of them so also the positive thing that happened to me last night at this event was when I went to get the sugar cookie and purple I was only gonna get one I was only gonna get the purple pie but then the guy told me about shooting you something since you mentioned before I deal at your table was like two for something why they bother he's like I can't do two 460 I'm like okay cool so I got an eighth for $10 less just to get another one with a free I feel like a good deal because rather than spend 80 for two days I got anymore and a free pre-roll whoa sounds have you with that kind of made up for the fact that I went by myself but I did the most novice mood ever I didn't have any problem when I waited I don't know what happened like I swear to fall I had papers in my bag or whatever but I had nothing I didn't have papers I had fun so I didn't have a rep I didn't have nothing so as soon as your girl got there you already know I went scavenger mole I would like so where is the photo they pointed me to a table phantom blow me some paan so I kept it push it I found somebody I was rolling up I'm like I gotta look for somebody smoking not finishing like just starting to smoke or like rolling up at this moment so I was just looking around scavenger room and I found somebody I was like [Music] - oh so I got some papers I like I bet got my phone so got my papers I started to check my pocket no lighter mind you I went to this event right after work so I was so eager to smoke you didn't even know how to smoke I was I was like I've got this I'm on it I'm about to smoke about to have some good weed in my system I ain't never had before oh boo boo nah nothing so I'm so glad I'm part of the stoner

I had to ask them for you know a lighter they sure know tells me and homegirl huh huh and then we'll make up [Music] yes I did all in all I could have a good time and I wasn't upset about going by myself after the fact that I walked in the door I was mad walking there I was like oh yeah I'd make a stun pull my friends suck I went on with friends yeah it's like um I always want to blow me off of whatever [ __ ] them well no not [ __ ] them but bump them forget about them they want to have fun let them have fun and let me have my fun too but yeah yeah hope you guys didn't write this whole

and um you know my reviews our reviews for now i'm going to start going over like i think three things um the smell the taste and how it affects us and along with that of course we're going to talk about the dispensary it comes from and all that stuff but i think i should really start talking about those three main points so i can get give a good review to the viewers out there of how these strains actually are so we're opening this right now as you can see true leave here in florida dispensary medical dispensary need a medical marijuana card they keep their products sealed all right pretty good because you know no one's been in there no one's tampered with it or anything oh look at that looks like there's um two big buds in there look at that pull that down two big buds you see that pretty frosty right there this little piece just like fell off of it it's just like pulled apart it's like i like how it's fluffy not like a hard nug sometimes they use all these fertilizers and stuff and the way it makes the buds come out so she said she could smell it from over there oh yeah it actually does smell very fruity like berry yeah almost like strawberry so it looks beautiful there we go look at that i'm going to get a little more of a close-up on that and then we're going to actually pack a bowl so i'm going in deep sometimes the camera doesn't look too great but i think if everybody can see that with this lighting that's a beautiful shot of this bud frosty totally frosty check that out you know you want to see right there there oh yeah it's covered all right so we're going to pack a bowl see the bowls right there we got a close-up on that let's try this out so hope everybody's having a super blessed and positive day out there it's actually the evening now where

stepped off camera for a second the freshie to the queen hmm i'm bad i didn't get much of a taste off that a little harsh well i don't think they name it after steve winwood because he smokes he stops smoking do you hear this folks so indica wynwood citrus og bybinsky type that in winwood citrus og i bet you something will come up [Music] tastes pretty strong didn't get much of a sweet sweet taste out of it but got a strong taste out of it which i would be hoping for that because look at these buds i mean some dang stuff so if it don't do the job i'd be pretty upset i'd be like what a phone

we out here in my pad man i think it's my first time maybe not my first time whoa [ __ ] maybe not my first time but like one of my only videos out here in the backyard um in the day um i'm always making my videos at night because uh [ __ ] just because um i don't film it for my parents you feel me or not just like my parents with my fam i don't like filming it from i don't like filming in front of them it just feels weird [ __ ] there's too much light over here so yeah man like i said we're going to be smoking on the blue skittles by jeter i've had these periods before if you guys have not seen my 2 gram jeter video make sure to go check it out posted it maybe three months ago if you're watching this video where i wanted to upload it but this is the one grammar this is gonna be my first time facing uh the one gram jeter i've never smoked one to the face every time i smoked the jeter i split it with somebody the two gram i split it with my homie lorenzo and then i remember my homie bliss me out with one of these the one gram they actually had me lit two and today sunday friday uh we bought a two grand pre-roll and we split it between three of us still got high as [ __ ] so i'm curious to see how high i'm going to get with this one gram facing it to the dome so blue skittles if i remember correctly is going to be a cross of blue diamond and skittles this is going to be an indica strain this particular one is going to be testing at 30.65 thc zero percent cbd this was manufactured september 22nd 2020 today is i think august i'm in august [ __ ] um october 16th the burn time for this is i think five minutes about 10 minutes yeah you can see right there burning time 10 minutes um yeah man these [ __ ] pre-rolls highly [ __ ] recommend them let me know how much you guys get them i'm not sure if i said it but i got this for 15 out the door i think it was like 10 12 bucks before tax i get the one gram for 16 to 2 grand for 25 and the five pack for 32 or like 31. you just got to peel the plastic right here on the sides and have the um cut out if you want to peel that off pull plastic comes off push down and by the way this is not going to be glass this is um this is all plastic everything on here is plastic it's going to come sealed up just want to lift it up oh that smells weird all right y'all this is what the pre-roll is looking like like i'm guessing they brush it down with some oil and then rolled it in keith i think this is maybe like a point point eight of some flour point one of some wax point one or some keith maybe i don't know but let's go ahead and spark this up see how it's tasting see how it's smoking all right y'all came to the front yard because there was too much noise in the back the [ __ ] uh pump was going on just kidding i didn't want to be screaming and [ __ ] oscar what's up dog i don't know if this is a good angle or not but i'll go ahead and spark this up and uh get my first thoughts on this blue skittles never tried this strand before taste how it smells one thing i really [ __ ] like about these pre-rolls too is they never ever at least i've never smoked one that burns uneven always burning even as [ __ ] dude that's like better than my [ __ ] joints also you're gonna be crying sniffly and coughing like every [ __ ] hit i don't know if you guys can tell on camera but in person bro this [ __ ] chucks [ __ ] clouds dude throws hell of [ __ ] smoke she looks like you're [ __ ] vaping one sip of milk tastes all right all right i'm about to finish this piro i had recorded the video but it came out backwards like it was upside down so i'm just do this again um i'm hot as [ __ ] dude this is a one grand pro my first time facing this [ __ ] i'm pretty [ __ ] lit um i'll give this [ __ ] like a nine out of ten the only reason i'm gonna give it like a nine out of ten because i don't really focus this flavor i recommend a lot of the gelato 33 and i recommend the strawberry shortcake those two are gas um the thurber poison is also really [ __ ] good but yeah man i don't know i thought this flavor was going to be cool but it was cool it's not bad for me this is not what i thought it was going to be um but yeah bro i'm going to give this [ __ ] like a 9 out of 10 bro it's just perfect high swell i paid 25 bucks for this if i had to but you know yeah uh definitely recommend it if you guys haven't tried it for sure try this [ __ ] uh you guys are thinking about it man get this and if you guys have had it let me know what you guys think about them and uh that's a beautiful video y'all hope y'all enjoyed the video hope that time soon hope y'all listen and catch on there for me peace okay bye", "VUAdzl3RIJU": "oh [ __ ] ah [Music] guys you know what time it is when I play this song send another one from the mad cannabis scientists this is the end of the Gorilla Glue guys so this is the last plan I've been trimming trim interim in this is a pretty bland I've already picked off a couple branches off for this one and a lot of believes off of this one [Music] I'm gonna get in trouble for using this song sorry Damon I'm just busting out some medication I'm not getting paid for this but here you guys go oh [ __ ] the joint so this is the box right now [Music] [Applause] sorry guys okay Google pause so this is the gorilla goonz and the blue gelato blue gelato came down at flushed out it's not my favorite to grow I need the blue gelato down there down there down there this is the gorilla glue clones guys got fat mugs on their fat Nog's purple leaves purple buds got about four rows going back there if you can see this one's two rows plus down there is gonna be filled up and I still got this one to finish up today but this is another journey remember guys I grew these ones with advanced nutrients so I did advance nutrients all the way up into the flush because when I ordered the flush I didn't receive it so I needed to find something else to take place of that plus I gave it a little something else too for a booster that I took out a regiment from their feeding line from their complete line and I had it two different things so the first thing I added was this I ran out of the mad scientist this is the Turpin eater sorry my flash is shining on top of that very bad but this is the Turpin eater I got this bottle for about 20 bucks off of ebay so I did change that part of it I did use the but candy all the way to the end almost and then I used some of this pineapple rush just a change around the flavors because I think pineapple goes good with gorilla glue but doesn't change the flavor very much I don't think so anyway so I used those two and then I went to this for the flush I really like this [ __ ] guys I had a lot of people had bad reviews on it good reviews but I used only this and flush pH to my water down to 5.5 so that it you know when you feed the water gets less the pH goes up that's just how it is so that's what I changed in this so the flush was with that when I did use the terpene I believe that's how you spell it I say yeah I did smell the difference I mean I know I smell the difference with the turpan ater already I've seen the difference in the trichrome production and how sticky the plant says I can barely get through one branch without having to wipe my scissors with the alcohol wipes to keep using them how about maybe I don't know 10 pairs of scissors maybe more 12 I don't know and I wash them all and I go through them and I wipe them a couple times and then I change the scissors change the scissors change the scissors I use the dull scissors my old dull scissors to cut the bigger branches and fan leaves off and then when I got to get into the but I use the sharper ones but anyway guys this is another journey this is another finished product into flower going into its drying tent and my relative humidity right now where I live and I live in the desert so it's very dry is still running about 78% in my garage so when the tent goes up it goes up to about 81% I seen last night when I shut everything down the fan runs 24/7 on that it's not a big fan it's just using to move the air around so I get in a mold but yeah we're gonna go ahead I'm gonna make this video and then I'm gonna come back with the dry supply and guys I did finish one video finish one video I did finish one plant earlier than the others I do staged plants and small pots that so I can chop that one down and dry it and cure it before the other ones finish so I can see at least where it's gonna be what the flavor is gonna be like and what it tastes like and you know what the [ __ ] kicked my ass roll the joint the other day and you're talking about maybe a week and a couple days into cure and I should kick my ass dude are you talking about 70 to 80% trichomes on top of these but I rolled up a blunt does my first blend I have a rolls I should have took a video of it it's pretty big blunt smoked half of it and I went up to the room put on my show just chilling out waiting for the baby to come home from school before I know it the baby's not getting on me saying hey Dad I'm home I said oh [ __ ] I fell asleep but so it's pretty potent stuff I was really stoned off of that joint really nice colors in there guys yeah really nice hard hard hard but I mean this was our dance [Music] alright guys this is another one for the mad cannabis like this although please like and subscribe don't forget the mountain and don't get it out peace hey", "OniLXjGvGmw": "welcome back everybody to another video today we're going to be reviewing a platinum dart um yeah merry christmas by the way it's like this month it's december 6th it is also 8 36 a.m i woke up about three minutes ago so i apologize so let's get right into it today we got the sage and sour darts it has a good 78.19 and i haven't got it in another flavor i've only got sage and sweet no sage and sour no other flavor so if you got like a dark that's a different [ __ ] flavor let me know all right so it comes in this little packaging if you open the show and you get this little thing it's solid you have to push it down twist it like that and shoot apparently i'm a child oh my god oh my god there we go all right so it comes in this little thing which is pretty sick so you pop this out this is the hardest part by the way besides the child lock i'm getting a pencil for this all right so now we got the pod it is a half gram which i don't like also i paid way too much for this video so you better like that like button it should be down right there also hit the subscribe subscribe thank you guys so uh you attach it to your little battery so let's take a rip and let's explain the flavor and everything hmm all right one thing i do got to say it tastes more like a vape like a nicotine vape more than a cart which is weird to say since it's a cart it doesn't feel like a normal uh like you hold down a button that feels more powerful this feels like it feels light it feels like just sensitive and it just feels feels convenient that's that's what i like about it the only thing i don't like about it is the price because you got to buy the battery for like 25 the cart is like 35 and like bro it's you might just want to get a plat for 40. it's five dollars extra and you get a full gram and uh yeah it's it's sour it's it's a weird [ __ ] sour flavor but i kind of like it i kind of like it i don't know what else to say i kind of like it uh it's expensive if you have battery you only get pods once in a while it's nice to enjoy but that that that's that's about it for the platinum dart thank you guys so much for watching hope you enjoy your day like this vibe have a good one", "XbUr98Z7MII": "[ __ ] video on hello rso

what's up everyone we've got another cannabis katrik and another one from arise i was uh stoked to find some more bud from them uh after the last batch it was very very good and their stuff sells out super quick in my dispensary but i got up early and i went to the dispensary at 7am just for you guys to get our hands on some jenny kush as i said this one is from arize it comes in at 30 thc and as we mentioned in the last video arise from anna illinois and the story on jenny kush is it's named after jenny monson who was a cannabis activist uh in the early 2000s in the colorado area she founded the group moms for marijuana and was big on myspace back when uh everyone was on myspace actually i can remember those days but let's get into the cannabis critique on the jenny kush the look of this one was outstanding this is the best stuff that i've gotten from a dispensary in the terms of looks especially here in illinois i was just amazing frosty nugs nice and dense they weren't too hard nice and soft had tons of hairs all over them looked like a christmas tree whenever you spun it around in the light i mean these spuds just glimmered they were beautiful i give it a 9.8 out of 10 for the looks like i said i don't know how you get much better than this but i i gave him a 9.8 i'm not going to give everyone anyone a 10 i don't think but we'll see 9.8 out of 10 for the looks uh the smell the vanilla icing is what i got from this one overwhelmingly i popped to the top and it was just like whoo sweetness like i was in a bakery smelled like vanilla icing to me very very sweet smelling bud i gave it a nine point or a 9 9.0 9 out of 10 for the smell the break up of this stuff was again very very good very very frosty frosty uh this that you can see uh when you broke up the nugs so it was it was good impressive looking stuff in your grinder i gave it a 9.2 out of 10 for the breakup uh the high of this one was dominated by its de-stressing properties it was a very relaxing relaxing high great for de-stressing put you in like a zen type of mood to where just stuff doesn't bother you it's a very positive high in that aspect i gave it an 8.8 out of 10 uh for the high the taste of this one uh it's it tasted just like it smelled uh very sweet you get kind of a tropical note from it maybe remind you a little bit of coconut i'd say a 9 out of 10 for the taste it is very very good stuff so overall i'd say this is a an absolutely top shelf bud uh in terms of cure and trim uh in this batch it's great stuff it's in a it's an amazing uh de-stressor this strain the jenny kush great for de-stressing great for relaxing after a hard day at work and it won't overwhelm new users because the high isn't like super super in your face it'd be great for a beginner or a veteran uh smoker so i gave this one a 9.1 out of 10 overall that is a new high here on the channel so congrats to arise on getting the latest high score here on cannabis critique and if you enjoyed this critique be

the ash is not white and that matters when you're raising a joint but i'm being picky okay guys shit's fired if i'll give you something a nine that's almost perfect you gotta realize that like a seven is something that's like like you know that's something like you know you just smoke most of the time but once and then you'll find that unicorn and then just get you high different red so um yeah definitely [ __ ] recommend to shave you guys thinking about copying this copy it almost out of pay i'm gonna say that this is better than the [ __ ] uh cookie spiro [ __ ] that [ __ ] was 20 bucks so definitely recommend this over cookies pre-roll everything is about that everything you know about corova i recommend this over corrobor p rule i recommend this over basically a lot of heroes so i would definitely say these are my top three not number one uh pre-roll so far the alien labs period um i would recommend the scherbassio just because it's a whole different taste but if you like gelato definitely get the air before every 41. great taste um it's gonna be it man i'm live as [ __ ] put the ashtray i'll catch you on next video bruh and", "EBtQcECL4ug": "hey what's up youtube alex

2019 alright so this is a different video we're going to go ahead and shoot a video after we have trimmed up three Gorilla Glue the number fours and it's harvest time over here these ladies veils for about twenty-five days they flower for 51 days so they are at 51 days and flower now and we're just going to get back to the day that we usually you know the times that we usually harvest this is pretty frosty but yeah this video is gonna be really quick I'm not feeling the best today I mean but I'm still going to shoot it show you guys another harvest under 80 days they as in flower and um [Music] they're looking good as you can see now I will admit we are now you know one thing about growing the New Testament way that's the high heat high humidity anybody who's doing it kind of watch your plants in the winter stages if you're running that humidifier on high they will try to form some powdery mildew in some of the areas that the fans or the airflow is not getting to in flower and that's mainly in flower because the plants have balked up and they're taking up a lot more space so thank goodness we noticed it forming we're trying to form on some of these implants over here last week and now we got on them with the NorCal and lo got in here and made some adjustments where the fan was getting to him he actually hit one down on the bottom it's out of here now but trying to find a spot to see this plant is already so frosty it's kind of hard to tell but it you'll see it on the fan leaves I probably should have kept a family fit shows you it was some it was trying to form on this implant right over here which is crazy because the fan is right here but [Applause] you know we caught it we got on it in that NorCal it goes through there and it blasts is it right away and that is an all-natural prevention you can actually use that they say up until two days a flower but we wouldn't dare do that as you all know we use it last week so but other than that the plants look with they look they look good they look pretty good I mean talk about that Gorilla Glue shocking up like that really cool usually for those big golf ball nuggets you super cropping like low that's what your guerrillas will do he surprises me he make these strains all look like the same darn strength it's cold right here but uh yeah that's your video for today I'm not gonna spend too much time today I just wanted to show you guys another harvest under 80 days you know three plants as you all see this is definitely going to be over a pound three plants as you can see [Applause] nice colas that's usually how the gorilla but when I growing wheezy like a big golf ball [Music] another one right here they're heavy and they're sticky is all out but I yeah that's a nice color did a nice job super cropping is definitely this thing they're all I mean it's filled all the weights at the bottom as you can see stuff down here is also frosty as you all know yeah see this is as you can see on this and also I mean I like to show everything in the video I mean you know these that's the purpose of it all this is educational and I'm just to show you what can happen you know if you're not in here adjust in that humidity and the later stage of flower but thank goodness we caught it last week when I was here shooting the other video and yeah so stay on that and the very late stage of flower if you're still running that humidity really high like maybe in the 70s you got to make sure all those plants are getting airflow make sure every spot is pretty much getting some careful but you still can't take away apps natural Frost and ability with this gorilla we put South but that's your video for the day all right so that's your video for the day share the video subscribe to the channel if you

do we're going to do this one first today and then tomorrow we'll do alera's banana all right all right let's get a little a little ros and dab real quick [Applause] all right cheers i love raza by

the bag up which i just want to get the uh just get the majority of this up this is what 90 micron looks like all right you know a lot of people say a lot of crazy [ __ ] but i'm telling you right now if you use a 90 micron bag do you really want to get crazy do i have any more damn i'm almost at a 90 micron these are 160 let's go up here what the [ __ ] are my 90 micron bags oh there they are i really like these 90s sorry really like 90 micron bags the rosin you get back is is crazy it's insane all right so what we're gonna do is we're gonna take this okay this is an eighth if you guys want you check out the um check out the review i did on this when i first opened it but take it take a look at these nugs one last time they are frosty all right this is banana kush um ghost og cross with skunk haze and phenomenal absolutely phenomenal flavors on this um what i'm doing is i'm i'm definitely i'm still tucking i do tuck the corners on this all right just gonna show everybody what this tuck the corners okay and then what i do is try to evenly because it's 90 microns so like you can get it let me show you so i just want to kind of get it even but not right i'll show you just give me a second let me just all right that's all i do make sure you get all this stuff out of here though we want all well all medicine right so really make sure you take something and get in there um all that is rosin it will turn into rosin so make sure shout out to pharmaceutical rx for having some pretty dope um jars you know the price point on these i'm not going to lie i see companies have them at 60 and i see companies having a 75. um this was 60 you know i dig it we're about to have some of the cleanest rosin right here ever made right because the way they grow their stuff so if you get if you get crazy you know i just like to do this um if you can if you can make it an even cut on top right and then get a good press so we got a little excess i'll cut the excess off right i'm just gonna i just give it a quick smash any excess i have i just cut it all right let's go over to the press let's take a shot of coffee first right i need a shot of coffee oh yeah yeah all right i don't think i'm making it through this nope put too much [ __ ] down here now [ __ ] the cat food [ __ ] all right here's the press right here [ __ ] we're not getting food for you buddy you eat all your sister's food already already out of control all right what is it we're pressing at right at 200 degrees and 12 sorry 212 degrees fahrenheit one eighth well let's go well now further i do i'm just gonna push this back oh hey stay right there that's the perfect spot right there so what i'm doing is i'm just getting this warmed up all right all right [Music] oh yeah like i said we're just heating it up hey all right all right there you go now start pressing started pressing like this at 12 and a half right now so i've got 17 and a half i usually just go until i can't crank anymore and that's good let's sit there all right oh we're getting huh you getting any in the side action there no now this is a i press we might have a blowout right here might be a blah right there it looks a little dark but right here we're looking we'll see what happens sometimes again sometimes you don't but i don't think we will um so yeah so this is a um this press right here let me just show you guys this press i built this myself it's a 20-ton from harbor freight and then it's controller i got off amazon and it reads out in celsius and i had to actually put the controller together but check us out we're getting right pretty good stuff [Music] just check it yeah we're pretty much maxed out on the pressure sorry for moving the camera around so much trying to get this thing stable here for you so basic guys go for right around five minutes i like to get a good minute or two warm up and then give it give it the um give it the press so like i said this is twenty thousand 20 ton 40 000 psi you don't need that much but it makes for a great first press really does you guys are about second and third [Music] so like i said we started we're at we're at two minutes right now and it's starting starting to slow down all right up on three minutes like i said it's only an eighth it's not the crazy runs like you've seen some of the ones where i've done you know quarter half ounce three quarters of an ounce an ounce but yeah it's um it's looking pretty good [Music] so yeah uh see the plates like i said you can get the plates on amazon and they were right around 300. um there's there's some it's not perfect um you know having to stick all this stuff in here and set all this stuff together and build all this stuff so there was that all right we're right at four minutes and we're just we're just the movement's starting to slow up so we could probably yeah we're getting close yep close to that five minute mark five minutes is a good indicator you know you don't have to keep it there but it's just one of those things where if you look at it like all right pretty much it's not moving anymore you know you're maxed out on your pressure so you just move these these are hematite just magnetic rocks so yeah like i said right at five minutes to penny give or take [Music] give or take you know it's nothing turn this dude off all right let's check this out let's see what this looks like all right i can see there's many blowouts [Applause] [Applause] now the front obviously because i leave it open but this stuff right here wow yeah it's got the nose of a funky banana all right so it comes up in one piece but you see the blowout right there and then there's some minor in the bottom um we didn't have too much retention though and that's good so this is gonna go right inside here now this whole thing in here there's almost a pound of already pressed stuff um and i promise you we're to rehydrate that dude and we're going to press it all again all right so check this out good looking stuff here oh yeah hear the poppers upstairs really good looking stuff i mean that's you see if i can't right all right we'll be out here see if i can get through the gun gauntlet i gotta clean this [ __ ] up cat hair everywhere dude i i [ __ ] sweep this place once a week and it's just not enough and you start down twice and then there's this this is all packing looks like the straight [ __ ] hoarder down over this [ __ ] geez now let's see i need to get a good i have all these little pendies i have laying around just and then score all right let's see now there's my rosin collector these make the best little slow scoops all right little turned up so first what i'm going to do is this i'm gonna get any of these leftover flakes there's not too many you just don't want it in your rosin it dirties up your banger [ __ ] your [ __ ] up [ __ ] your [ __ ] up so yeah you hear my voice right here the uh my eddies man i made some eddies out of some um some of that gti the [ __ ] was that island skunk or lime haze whatever the [ __ ] it was some good [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah good [ __ ] all right start just [ __ ] collecting the [ __ ] i can't believe it i must have 10 years man there's like when i first got booked and i was sitting there and i was like like legit thought about killing myself because it's just like if anybody knows you know you just get that point or you're just like i'm done you're done but you know i [ __ ] pick myself up like all right [ __ ] let's figure this out look at that stuff dude get up in there come on come on meow i don't know why [Music] dude i hate i hate hate hate not having somebody that can just film me and i can't i can afford to pay them and i do everything on my own i guess [ __ ] it all right we need to get a piece of parchment paper right here i got one see what we ended up getting here was my microwave so yeah i love making rising somebody remember 0.26 12.3 just for shits and games all right so yeah uh some some of these are reaching out uh you know with the uh the scuttle scuttlebutt of of getting the 1200 from trump about getting a press or building a press listen i will absolutely if you're in pennsylvania i will drive in my [ __ ] to your house and i will set that [ __ ] up i will build it for you um save yourself the money save it and i was talking to a buddy the other day and talking about spending you know 1200 on a press it's like dude i literally built mine for i don't know five six hundred bucks so half the price and i have a bigger press with bigger plates so it's like and i do understand i don't need that much all right well then why buy one to begin with yeah look at this you know what i mean like why even buy one then i don't need one that big yeah you do might not today might not today but you will if you're gonna if you're gonna continue like if you're just doing this because i just want this i'm just gonna do this or like literally you're gonna buy this and do this every single i don't know at least once a week twice a week depending on your you know your needs for me there was i was pressing yeah i was present every single day that's all i was doing press just pressing rising you got to learn you got to get into it especially if you're gonna try to you know put those hours in put that time in get in that press get in that glass get in whatever it is you gotta put that time in man i mean they say 10 000 hours whatever i don't whoever they are you just figure it out when you figure it out some stuff's taking me longer than whatever some stuff i figure out right away right like i don't know preston rosin i picked it up pretty quick people hated on me right away blowing glass that's another one told me that i can never get color to stay on um anything and be able to drop it and it not break that's me baby just my point is this you can do a lot more than you think you can or you can just reach out and ask for help and i get it that's our society is literally based off the fact that most people can't are not self-sufficient most people cannot do things for themselves need help from other humans that's fine needing help cool manipulating somebody not cool so like i get it i get it everybody's yeah i don't know stuff since i started talking i started thinking about like what are you saying dude you're saying crazy [ __ ] yeah well [ __ ] it because people get people get their feelings here really easy it's just like i don't know if i want to see you succeed wouldn't you rather have if you're gonna get let's see here if i'm gonna get 1200 free bucks in my head which i think it's free we know it's not free but if i think it's just free money [ __ ] yeah wouldn't you want to yeah sure build a press because yeah that makes sense but then spent half the money to build a press or whatever and then you know what's your fee bro i don't know like 50 000 bucks i'm not not expensive right couple grams so i need a couple grams of oil you know but that's why i say 100 bucks because for me 100 bucks i get a couple grams of oil i literally work for oil that's like literally what i did work for cannabis doesn't anybody else am i just the only one all right so let's see what we get now there's still probably a good amount on here um i'm gonna go back over it one more time uh the 90 micron i i really suggest everybody you know at least get 120. you're gonna get better quality rosin now listen everybody's gonna tell you you might get more with the 160. you might i don't i don't like them um but you know i don't like the taste of the rosin at 160 is what i'm saying myself personally i do not enjoy the taste of the rosin at 160. not to say that 160 won't work it will absolutely 160 is good for like if you're trying to make like eddies for like rso or some type of all right so here we go we're all cleaned up okay i feel like it's pretty it has like a like a like a rotten banana like a dank banana smell to it almost um and we can just clean this off one last time you give use the uh final view we have point three right here let me just give this a good solid fold over all right and this is point three right so not bad it was actually um what was that like two point when i say 2.23 we got back eight tenths ooh ooh eight tenths so i honestly i get an average of uh of right around seven tenths it's like my average some of the flour um like um alera i get more back agri i get more back g leaf makes really good rosin they make really good rosin so let's do a dab of this let me show you what it looks like after cure it up actually i might not i'm like yeah i'm like i'll probably cold cure this just makes for a better so that's pharmaceutical rx's version of banana kush tomorrow tomorrow we'll do alera's banana cushion we'll see what we get back um i'm actually pretty intrigued to see what we end up getting back let's do let's get this we just had 1.5 right let's see what this weight 1.5 what's up buddy over there famished poor guy huh huh bud mm-hmm you like dude feed me [ __ ] i never get to eat ah yeah right dude you ate your sister's food upstairs you [ __ ] nut eating everybody's [ __ ] running around i don't eat all right so that dab right there weighs one half of a tenth weighs a 20th of a gram cheers [Applause] cheers oh yeah oh yeah straight up banana yo that's crazy that's [ __ ] crazy that's how life should be right there yes yes taste it i always get to read i read absolutely outstanding good stuff [Music] [ __ ] yeah all right so i paid that was 60 bucks shot okay terp wipes if you don't know that was 60 bucks i'm not gonna cry about that 60 bucks for a point eight now if you're looking at it you're looking at like i saw a g leaf g leaf had rosin um there's like orange tropicana or some [ __ ] like that they had that um i want to see straw nana because i know straw nana i have a buddy that presses roz and he was like dude it made the best rosin i've ever made in my life so i was like okay i'm pretty intrigued by that it's all about the terp profile if you want my personal opinion it's like the terp profile how it's grown and you know uh the purity of the flower obviously um and and like i said the process in which it's grown so the um pharmaceutical rx they grow in a living live soil it's all organic you should check it out check out how they do it it's pretty pretty dope grow um you know at the end of the day we want the best medicine we do who doesn't i mean who's like i don't see anybody here like man i want the shittiest i want stuff that's going to make me feel like ass caleb there's no food in there bro you go upstairs poor guy you'll figure it out huh upstairs go eat your sister's food because that's what you've been doing and you don't need to eat down here [ __ ] guy eats all the [ __ ] food all right so yeah turp wipes clean everything out even rosin right we know rosin can [ __ ] your banger up if you're going too hot but i just want to stop and do that because i haven't made any videos i haven't done any rosin in a while um for a video um and like i said that really ends up being nice looking stuff let's get a great shine to it it's clean it's [ __ ] the taste on this listen the taste both of these look at this you want to see something crazy looking if i can get it to catch the light there it goes my face was in the way look at that look at that shine on that ran ran around right so oh um i did check i've been checking the website looks like 67 days to the festival and i'm getting ramped up man i'm making as much glass products as it possibly can hopefully by then i'll have the kiln and hopefully by then i'll be able to at least have some rigs for use um so i really hope that's you know a thing but um yeah thanks for everybody's love and support really i can't i can't [ __ ] about it you guys really kick ass man everybody so let me see her farm i can't help but not say it see look here's what we got so far for this giveaway uh we're getting it's getting bigger it's growing it's growing damn looking vapor cloud over here all right so let's think about this it's probably goofy i'm not gonna do this the ten dollars like is cool the money but like at the end of the day i i'm paying for the ship and so like man whatever [ __ ] that's what we get so far then we can't dude ounce one whole ounce from kilowatts part two in that drawer just like that all right everybody have a blessed day man stand by glass for that ass", "661CXHe_zd0": "hey everyone jay ping here checking in respect my region dot com here today with a quick west

what i'm saying yeah mercene lima limonene mm-hmm and that carryover so spicy earthy hops fruity sweet citrus pepper spicy so it should have this citrusy fruity gassy earthy spicy all of the above is what i like to say it's like all of the it's like the ultimate crescendo of all the weeds that must be what they're going for very nice what are your thoughts on the packaging i love the colors because i'm just really sick of seeing black i feel like you would wear that color i would definitely this is definitely my next color all right well let's give it a crack and let's check out the smell of the nugs and then we'll dive into this joint that we have here in this nice vibes paper hand rolled by jazzasaurus yourself so on the smell i get this light earthy it's like like earthy plants peppery earthy sweet everything that it said let me get another so on the nug we've got some good nug size here this is about the size of a you know nice quarter is pretty dense and then the nug the smell oh it's gassy it's super gassy oh my gosh oh yeah wow once you cracked it over the nose on this is insane very excited to check this out oh yeah super gas this is going to be wonderful i'm excited oh i don't know why i'm putting that in there oh part of that ponytail all right here we go so we've got this joint you know how we light it right yeah i always fail at it no no no you're pretty good it's just important to twist you want to twist get it nice all the way around and then we think of s'mores lighting a joint is like roasting a s'more and the first hit was kind of papery so let me get a second real hair all right y'all so first hit lots of flavor lots of flavor don't really get much of the citrus or the or the berry you really just get that earthy spice it is gassy gasoline [Music] what do you taste it's so smooth oh man these buds are potent man i'm so excited to smoke more of this so when it comes to the actual bud structure we've got nice dense buds the if you look through it these parts here are pretty dense the leaves are super sugary and crystally it could be a little bit better trim job i mean there's some crow's feet inside here but for the most part this is something that i know if i were to get this if i were to get any strain that looked like this i'd be pumped i was coughing a couple times and i'm already pretty stoned from that i really like it and i i love sativa so this is surprising this is on that indica side i feel like i feel like this is something i wouldn't like and i i think it's great harvest date september 15th package date october 27th is still pretty fresh cbd point zero six percent total active cannabinoids again thirty eight point three six percent this is some of the most potent weed in all of california just purely based on this total active cannabinoids yeah that's actually the highest i've seen during my is this the most potent weed flower that you've ever smoked according to a number that you can remember yes and i mean i'm a new bedtender and i haven't seen anything closely i haven't seen since i've known you i don't think we've smoked anything that was just flour above 32. and even then the stuff that we have smoked that was usually higher thc always had distillator terps or something it was like an infused joint some hash some keef i wish it was more citrusy but that's just because i love sativa can't hold it against the strain exactly i'm going to give it a 9.5 ooh you think it's good this is one this is your highest rated indica the high the puts i mean i only took a couple pups and i would just stop right there my my only so i love the purple and pink the crescendo i love that there's terpenes listed i love that there's the total cannabinoids the thc i love the jar the custom jar purple lid the custom style of purple they went with this pink the little logo there in the jar i really enjoy what i'm seeing my only issue is i don't know what genetics crescendo is so although these terps give me an idea of what kind of high it is i want to know more info more info about the crescendo genetics i think that's pretty standard and then i know that if this weed were to sit on the shelf for a period of time it would get light degradation because it's a clear clear glass and there's a lot there's a lot of window right yeah they could even make it that light like or not light but purple is the dark black or even this color of purple or the color of pink just something to give a little bit of light filtration to filter some of the damage away the flavor of it is pretty decent in my opinion i think the ash is a little bit darker unfortunately creating a slightly harsher smoke which is why we coughed um i'd recommend in a pipe better because i mean that's the thing is like i don't smoke pipes so i'm not going to recommend anything in a pipe i smoke joints and i smoke blunts and i rip bonds it just feels like it's hard towards just the middle it could be getting it could be getting resonated the more we smoke yeah i mean it also is a high thc this is 32.28 this is not supposed to be it's too harsh for my throat and you're still out of 9.5 no i think i want to change it is that allowed i mean maybe what are you thinking i think i am allowed because i should be able to base it off smoking the entire pre-roll it's your review all-star what do you want just halfway and it's just so harsh what do you thinking nine a point five deduction nine flat from jazzy i'll be honest when you smoke a lot of the most potent weed they're not easy to smoke they might be smooth but the flavor the gas how potent and terpene is definitely typically make it not an easy thing to smoke with that said i'm gonna give this no you know i was sitting up there around a 9.25 9.5 and like i said i really want to see the genetics i really want to see the genetics sorry about that and um as much as i like the glass jar i just feel like you know as a former bartender myself i just know that it's gonna dry out because of the light degradation and so for me you know as close to perfect as this is this is a 9.5 for me uh out of 10 i think the potency the color the taste the smell what i recommend there's a lot of information on here the presentation the appeal it's all right there i make a small pivot to a colored jar to save the uh to save the light damage on these beautiful nugs i think you're both really stoned yeah i mean that's the thing though the potency if i were raiding all the we just in the potency then a lot of weed would get 10 because they [ __ ] us all up but that's not what contributes to the holy spirit sure so 9.5 is where i'm falling great work thc design the crescendo strain jazzy said it here first i think we're [ __ ] up yeah let

sticky and it is oh it's sticky let me stick it the smell though it's just it's not even like that stinky funk smell i mean you can definitely tell this cannabis as soon as you open it but it's one of those good it's i mean it's just this is fruity it's sweet the citrusy hawaiian hazel it's a it smells good it's it's one of my favorite strengths per se of all time just it's just one of my all-time

name is motivational education outstanding cannabis review channel based solely around the pennsylvania medical program now it has been brought to my attention uh marsh creek is um he's [ __ ] up the uh drilling they've been doing around it fracking it's screwed up all right went to the dispensary [Music] so yeah you know the pennsylvania cannabis programs up to uh two billion dollars they've made this is an empty [Music] two thousand dollars or two billion dollars [Music] how does that make you feel [Music] how does that make you feel how does it make me feel [Music] all right here we go got some liberty this stuff's great really like their their flower they make great rosin um and here's one i haven't seen before yet uh i might have but i'm not really up up to it um this one's sour papaya really looking for that gorilla glue and star dog we'll put these on the two review lists back here [Music] we gotta get these pop and we'll get those popping today um also grab some flour [Music] i grabbed ice cream cake shatter or short sugar why is this so loud sorry we're constantly growing here so we're always moving [ __ ] around um i have i just got like 500 shirts in the mail yesterday seriously man can you [ __ ] guy brought seven boxes in my house big ass boxes each weighing 40 pounds each i'm like dude this is insane this is like [ __ ] 140 150 pounds he's like yeah i know bro i delivered a [ __ ] i was like yeah true sure sour tangy all right mids okay these are mids nowadays like terrapins mids um and it's okay a lot of companies sell mids but they sell them at booth prices terrapin sells mids at mid prices you know your entry level stuff should be right around [ __ ] 20 to 30 dollars eighth they're at 35. we could drop that down 25 would be badass but they won't do that um so that means you can get ounce for 200 and like wait why would you why would we let you get an ounce for 200. i don't know because it's cool but uh yeah so i got that i had sar tangy i grabbed two eights of sour tangy they didn't have any uh i went to liberty norristown it's only place i'll shop um it's the staff it's a lot of reasons it's a lot of reasons and i have so many people tell me um that worked at that work at liberty that used to work at other places tell me why they left the other places so it's like if you are leaving the other places because of this and what i thought in my head then you just confirmed it when they leave because of something i'm thinking like let's say i don't know hypothetical they're really all about money i don't care about anybody so that happens and then let's say that you know i'm like whatever it's just that's just my assumption right well absolutely your assumption can can turn to truth and reality um you know every once in a while you get lucky but uh so yeah i don't go to teravita anymore i really want to um especially when they have their eights for 35 and these are 42 at liberty uh liberty gave me eight dollars and forty cents off right it's 42 times two is 840. so they gave me you know eight dollars and forty cents off so what's that [ __ ] 34 or whatever so i mean it's like i i lose a dollar or two when i buy it from liberty but i gain a point so it's like teravita there's no points there's no none of that you just buy and that's it [ __ ] off basically pretty much i mean why else would you say that so i did i was able oh man [Music] i grabbed some ice cream cake flour also so we'll get into all that stuff [Music] and then we got ice cream cake sugar devil's lemon shatter which we'll review and ice cream cake sugar now i want to say something about this the terps on this listen to me are almost three percent the top three on this ice cream cake almost three percent dude this is 55 bucks that here's what everybody tells me we don't get teravita where we're at we don't get terrapin where we're at i'll tell you exactly what it is you get it you just don't you just don't know how to pay attention to when you're going to get it and the reason is maybe you don't stalk your menu um and i know that there's a lot of us that don't want to do that i don't want to stop the menu every day i don't not anymore that's why i just buy it honestly i'm a dispensary's dream especially liberties because if i live closer to liberty i would every day i would go and buy so i would buy you know something probably like a gram or something and i would get a point so i get seven points a week so that means every week i get two basically free eights two eights for two bucks so in one month i get a free ounce think about that well no i get an ounce for eight bucks think about that if i go every day which i'm going to anyway and i buy a gram for 55 bucks and let's say i'm like nah that's cool uh let's say i buy a gram and something else whatever but i don't know just do the math on it if you do if you buy something that um if i buy something 65 bucks 20 65 bucks it's 52 bucks so 52 bucks so i get my point so i just got to buy something at 65 bucks and my discount so i get like i'm gonna review this today so let's say a live gram of cresco every day which that's impossible i understand that that's not the issue all right don't don't need to scream it's that's impossible no this is a hypothetical if i do this everything works out then i absolutely will get my medicine every day and then let my points acquire and after every three points right so if i'm getting two eights right seven points a week six of them okay i use so you do the math seven right times four is 28 so 28 points divided by three right what is that again eight right nine eight nine eight twenty eight when i say 28 leaf work so that's huge like if you actually look at it like that like i do if you go every day and you buy one thing every day right if you're gonna do anyway if you're gonna do it anyway this is what i'm saying if if you're gonna go and spend 350 3 250 a week and you know then again i get it covered we don't want to [ __ ] be around people blah blah blah blah so that's like pick your battles i guess but uh all right so i'm gonna get into this i don't i i don't remember the lineage on this it's i don't even know if it's up here um i guess i could look over there not anything looking for it you guys know what it is rocket fuel by cresco i reviewed it a couple times so i'm just pulling this out do it quick dab and i'm going to show you something so i'm going to make a live sauce cart with this i think it's time that i teach everybody how to make live sauce cards i think i think there's yeah you can make it out of this you can make a lot of sauce cards out of this i'm gonna teach you how to do it um it takes a very long time and it's when you the first couple times you do it it'll suck because you're probably [ __ ] up or you know it's just it's messy but after you get it figured out you can absolutely save money so graham you know whatever you don't ha it can be live but if you don't go live that's fine i um i've done it with live i've done it with rosin i've done it with cbd uh i haven't actually done it with any pa stuff so man i [ __ ] allergies really just dude they suck right yeah all right so cresco i bought this man i bought this like three weeks ago let's see the production date on this dude is package date is um the package date now is different than the production date but we just go off the package date for close enough to production date you can figure it's within that week right all right so the week of the sixth uh the first week in july that's when this was made all right let's pop it open let's get this top out of here okay i haven't i haven't bought cresco in a minute they got new jars and i i've been seen on the internet like they have their wreck jars look insane they're all frosty and nice and big money right big money big money is yours you know they're looking at like 50 cents to a dollar for each jar [Music] eyeball all right thca on this is uh 76 i'm a 77. the thc is 2 so that's super awesome the cbda is 0.1 that's not a lot cbg is 0.3 it's not a lot um so you know a little bit cbd a little bit cbc it's awesome uh or a cbg rather the terps in this beta car 0.8 beta mercene 1.4 uh let's see what else pops out limonene that's literally it top three terps beta car point eight beta verse 1.4 limonene point seven the rest are point one point zero seven point one point one point zero two so if i just go off my top three terps right it's two point two three all right top three percent let's do side by side side by side beta car beta car 0.8 on this beta car on this .125 um limonene on this 1.9 right top top terp the next top terp on this is um well actually i'm using top terp top tur all right 1.4 1.2 um 0.8.9 0.7 0.5 so very similar in turret profile um as far as the price goes i just want to point that out that your um thca79 thca77 you're paying 10 more for live but the end result's the same wrong or right am i wrong or right i mean numbers don't lie if you can tell me that the numbers are wrong i'll i'll i'll entertain that cresco's making another push to be again the great but they're they're lacking they keep falling back this looks great this looks phenomenal i mean it's got the craziest look to it the nose it's got that gassy floral it's like gas like diesel uh floor like flowers all right to make a sauce cart basically what you have to do a couple things clean this clean this dude up i gotta take this thing to the cleaners today man so you do a sauce cart a couple things you want to do just keep it in that jar and you need something that's going to stay at 100 degrees or a little bit more a little bit less actually no a little bit maybe a little bit more nevertheless like right around 100 degrees is good a little bit more is okay you don't want too much more but you just got to remember that what you're doing is you're going to slowly heat this up and it's going to slowly heat it up now over time i'll talk about like a week it's going to be at a constant temperature um there's a lot of science that goes into it and i don't feel like sitting here explaining to you but basically you're changing the molecular structure of the oil when you do that now what's being changed oh yeah look at the bottom of that bag you see it see how it's jazzed up that's it's because these white bottoms are not polished quartz polished quartz not polished polished not polished polished not polished you dig it so i'm gonna shave back just gonna show you a little bit of heat will do on these because they're opaque so they're not finished which means they're very um coarse so when you heat them up course you heat them up they open show you nothing crazy just give it a little bit of heat clean it right up so what happens is when they when it gets hot right when stuff's cold it goes like this when it gets hot it goes like this and when it gets hot and it opens up like that wait a second bro did you just clean your bag without iso did you clean it without hand disinfectant just clean without some did you just blanket me no did you just wink at me turn that wink all the way up all right so yeah right that's why i love these bangers all right now let's check out a little tiny baby dab [Music] let's get a little bit of that rocket fuel cheers um all right nice that has a great taste it's gassy and flour like florals legit man i'm not gonna lie bangers are gonna be hard for me to make that might be tough i mean i get it it's just this size tube this size this this side zach and then they're cut um and then polished but i definitely need to get a band saw so i can [ __ ] cut glass flame cutting's cool but don't know so all in all you know cresco's got new jars i got new things i'd like to see a lot of these companies expand it's going to be it's going to be hard to see that um coming soon so if you guys let me know let me know what you guys think about this i'm thinking about making a video on how to make a sauce cart i'm thinking about it yeah i think that's what i do i think those times come i mean my dab straws are great don't get me [ __ ] up these things are great but i get it there's nothing nothing quicker than just going that's you can't absolutely i haven't found anything that's quicker than that nothing so i think it's time to teach you how to make some live sauce cards need a lot of things first you got to get cards you can order them online i don't know who to trust i don't know you want to get crazy listen to them horns [Music] just holding that [ __ ] right cresco's good i like cresco um you know they're the way they do it i mean it's butter right like getting sugar you know butter is easy i think this is probably like butter batter shatter basically you just take shatter you run it and then you just whip it heat it and then you get butter you get like a batter that's all you do and then you take it one step further you can take it all the way i'm just saying because i've taken street booth and um i just wanted to see what happened if i just cook it off and [Music] accidentally i put this crap on low or on warm instead of low it only gets up to like 100 and something so it [ __ ] [Music] turned into like this like soup like a straight liquid almost i was like like runny what the [ __ ] so i did a little research [Music] yeah man science is great dude heating time heat and time it's funny how heat and time make things like diamonds for one example um thca diamonds rosin i look like my neck hurts but it doesn't it's tight oh yeah rocket fuel's great i feel like there's some og something in here there's something in here some kind of kush or something here um it's great and cresco is great you know when cresco drops it makes me happy um i just you know it's such a huge money grab in pa now that like it's like the any of us seeing companies that are going to drop prices anytime soon is bad it's like it's not going to happen so you know you don't want to be that dude who's like being not optimistic about [ __ ] but also in being a realist right oh [ __ ] shipping i was just thinking about shipping oh so anyway let me show you guys something if you didn't get on the giveaway that sucks for you just straight up nightingale [ __ ] but i'll be doing this game that's on the agenda the workload if we can make more glass we're gonna get out there it's supposed to storm again um i gotta tear out bushes and [ __ ] i gotta do a bunch of [ __ ] like it's non-stop non-stop doing but uh yeah all kinds of stuff be giving away here all kinds that's the grand grand prize also look at all the colors look at all the colors all the colors all the colors yeah it's got crazy amounts of tie-dye all the colors so hit me up on ig x-con john llc is officially in operation i basically uh you know took a concept and said let's go and see what happens so here we are um if you guys want to learn how to make sauce carts i i would suggest you follow me on instagram because i think i'm going to do something i'm basically going to do something on instagram where it's like there's like um i don't know it'll be i'm trying to generate a little bit of revenue here so i'm thinking about holding class and like having people pay like five or ten bucks whatever you know something goofy we'll figure it out but and i was actually thinking about doing like a patreon i already have one um and um setting up like a um like the patreon thing but doing the um doing like videos or and then also you know you get this if you watch this you know you'll get this or if you do this you'll get you know something different i don't know i'm not saying i'm trying to jump on the bandwagon everybody else is doing but i'm just trying to do my own thing you know and there's there's definitely like media social media platforms i could jump on you know like i was going to jump on the tic toc thing but i researched it and found that it was earned by china i didn't do it i know there's a lot of people like i got one buddy he's got this dude he's he's got a half a billion followers say it again half a billion he's got 500 million followers i mean it's it's somebody told me very in a roundabout way bro if you if you did tick-tock you become very successful very quickly i like to dance i'm a goofball i i [ __ ] you know i'm always doing something i feel like is entertaining and short videos it's crazy yo just so everybody knows yeah like the whole tic tac thing just let you know like how short how short your attention spams are i'm not knocking it i'm just saying like yo it's crazy everybody's moving so quick today everybody's gotta hurry hurry hurry go go go

it i'm not saying that um you know that i'm like i have i have gifts that like maybe most people don't or maybe i do i don't know but i definitely don't i don't feel like it like that like i see the reason why i brought the tick tock thing is because trying to i'm trying to like do this be self-sufficient and also provide for other people um it's very hard from platforms like this when it comes to the cannabis thing like i said i i see i see a lot of successful people doing other things and i could i could just switch up my whole [ __ ] restart but that's not it like cannabis is my life this plant is my life this oil is everything to me this every like this just a plant this is the plant in general and really focusing on the the dabbing part of it but it's my life man i don't know maybe

kind of banana a little bit [Music] check it out and like always if you want to see an up-close picture of the bud check it out [Music] [Applause] [Music] looks pretty good looks pretty cushy nice and it's not super dense they are kind of like a cushiony nug um and it says right here how they how they got the banana kush is they crossed ghost og with i don't know how to pronounce this sag martha sag sag like sag martha 60 slash 40. look it says it right where does it say it it says it right there on the top if it'll focus in sag martha 60 40 times ghost og i don't know i've not i've heard of ghost og but i haven't heard of the other before so let's try out the banana kush and this is gonna run you i think it was like 35 for the eighth so cheers and this is a hybrid too i do got the bong load already packed [Music] [Music] oh [Music] that tastes pretty good i ain't gonna lie i like it and i bought this weed in santa cruz and it's actually grown in santa cruz premium indoor flower from santa cruz california so i actually got some like some some local stuff okay off the first hit it does pack a little bit of a punch it doesn't hit me like a like a 30 on like say alien labs and stuff but it does pack a pretty good punch it is smooth it does it didn't [ __ ] up my throat at all and the flavor is really good i ain't gonna lie i do like the flavor i haven't smoked a lot of banana weeds but this one isn't bad at all i actually really like it but you know how we do two for the review i also want to taste these real quick i'm not going to eat them all like do a big review i'm going to do a review on them later but just right now i want to taste them these are the cocoa nugs with thc in them i have tried the the peanut butter ones and they were really good this is the og kush i just want to taste them i wanted to do a taste a flavor test for you guys and this is how the these ones look and i'm curious what og kush flavor is because the last one said peanut butter and it tasted like peanut butter this one says og kush so what's it gonna taste like [ __ ] weed so let's see cheers everybody it's just like original flavor it just tastes like chocolate with uh like rice krispies it's like rice krispie treats with chocolate on it it's not bad it's just not no flavor at all it's just original nothing but it's not bad i did get those at uh i got those at burners in merced california at the license cookies dispensary that they got okay let's get the other hit in so we can get the review cheers everybody hope you guys are having a great day smoking on something good out there all right all right i'm just gonna sit up for the [ __ ] okay gotta sit on it for a second let it get the full effects of it quick movie recommendation set it off we've seen set it up used to watch your [ __ ] all the time as a kid well not all the time but it's like the female it's like a female gangster movie not gangsters a bunch of chicks that run around robbing banks and shakes they having a hard time in life you know like every american right now but uh it's a good movie it's just instead of guys doing gangster [ __ ] or robin [ __ ] it's some girls and that's all a bunch of good actors jada pickett queen latifah vivek a fox so they were like the top of the actresses of their time african-american of course okay let's start calculating it up price not bad at all under forty dollars for the eight uh that's really good the the look and the smell i like it a lot it looks really good it smells good you could tell it's not no outdoor it uh the flavor is amazing the it's smooth it doesn't it's not harsh at all and the high is there for 30 it's not like oh it doesn't blow my doors off but it is a hybrid so it's not an indica it's not meant to be you know one of those couch locks so considering everything and the first time me ever trying banana kush or farmer max i'm gonna have to give it truthfully the 7.9 the 7.9 it is mighty fine there's nothing wrong with it at all i like it i am more into a little more of a indica heavier hybrid though i feel like this one's more on the sativa side the way that it makes it make my body feel in my head so it's not bad at all i'm giving it the 7.9 it's mighty fine that was my review [ __ ] it up right there but oh well that was my review for the banana kush by farmer max hope you guys enjoyed it until next time smoking with small town you", "F4_sIMY9x48": "all right good evening guys and gals this will be video number four on reviewing medical marijuana streams this is lime sorbet from Cresco this is their reserve line and this is by far probably the best weed I smoked ever up until I try some of their other reserve stuff or somebody else put something in front of me that's better this is going to be getting about a four four point eight this bud it's got a thirty four percent THC a rate it's name is you know tastes just like what it sounds like is super limey a super fresh it's not harsh at all smooth as [ __ ] I mean I don't know if you can grow weed any better than this it just look at that [ __ ] right there I mean this well if you get a chance to try this I highly recommend it you'll be missing out if you don't so yeah I give this a 4 point 8 I would give it a perfect 5 stars but you know I believe there's still some other strains out there it's from maybe even from the same grower

humidity control packs any growers they happen to watch this highly recommend you spend the extra few bucks on that was some overhead but the end product is going to be a much happier customer and a much better for dry flower you're getting to your customers this rocket fuel has a it just has like a real piney taste to me it just feels like some really just dank fire but I guess that's why I call it rocket fuel you know you know you tell somebody you guys on fire asked by there's just some straight fire well this shit's be on fire [ __ ] rocket fuel it's dankest book so I picked this up from a tree on Center in Pittsburgh I'm gonna give rocky fuel a solid 9 even a 9.0 so I would highly recommend you pick this up anywhere as you've seen in my previous video I did a breakdown of all the tarping so there's a turfy analysis so you can see what this product has to offer with the terpenes I said in the previous video I explained which eat each terpene does and how it affects you and what else they can be found throughout nature and different foods and stuff that these terpenes around it's really interesting stuff I hope everybody stays safe during this quarantine time with this crazy coronavirus it's this just it's scary times but we're all gonna get through this you know what I mean protect positive squat I've stocked up on bugs I got a bunch of different strains so I'm gonna try

is press and Pete the press and puffin I am here with a new one for you I have done one of these in a while G leaf concentrates I'm not gonna lie I'm freaking nervous as hell about this review because I've been hearing bad [ __ ] all week about this latest drop a G leaf and how their concentrates have tasted like ass or chemicals or what-have-you so and that's diamonds that's butters that sugars I've heard them all this week so I'm not gonna lie I'm not gonna lie I'm nervous so anyway triangle cush cured butter did some homework on this one it is kosher cush blue power pusher cush crossed blue power so sounds interesting it is a hybrid you know G Lee's labels are basic so we'll just get into it it is pretty fresh broken at the 16th this is packaged April 6th so it's pretty fresh I mean it is cured but still THC 1.79 THC a 65.4 6c BD 0 CBD a 0.17 Carr 2.0 5 v humulin point 701 a little all point one five nine and limonene 0.09 nine so not too shabby for a cure drug you could see I haven't cracked into it yet we are going to bust it open together is my wake and bake is is my dad for the day get me going this is new so I've had issues before with their jars they flop around in here get tipped upside down I've commented on it before in the video and it looks like they've come up with an idea to combat that now granted it is creating more waste but it stops your concentrates from flipping upside down inside this jar a little bit of paper packed on top now normally I'd [ __ ] about the waste however I would rather deal with that a little bit of paper then have my expensive ass concentrates upside down all over my [ __ ] lids so that is awesome kudos to G Lee for that I will give you guys that good job you keep that kind of [ __ ] up that's good that's thinking that's using your head I mean I'm sure there's other ways to get around that but hey you came up with a solution good job I know as you can see this is dark it's a nice chunk in there nice big fat chunk let me turn this light on maybe get a better color is brown it is dark it is cured great it is G leaf so I'm not surprised the real test is going to be how it smells and how it tastes so let's give it a shot cracker open doesn't smell bad it smells like typical butter doesn't have much of a nose to it my lights are flickering a little bit must be they're warming up LEDs got to love it so let's break out the G pen connect in my luka glass rig from luka glass at world's finest vape shop in Bridgeport oh yeah all right we're gonna take a nice fat dabby here because i need to medicate and curious how this is gonna taste it does smell really decent for you know what it is nice little glob idubbbz [Music] not too shabby okay we'll stick her in a busted-out for the tank cap that back up sorry I get a little OCD about stuff sometimes alright let's warm her up Cheers mmm it's going for the reheat you always get a better flavor with the second one it's not bad little grassy little earthy but it's good I mean I can taste the cushion it's definitely got a cushy taste but I lucked out guys I got a good batch I'm just gonna say I don't know how the effects are yet we're not getting into it yet we're just starting I mean I am get a little bit of sweat going but it's a little more I'm wearing a hoodie and I'm dabbing so oh yeah so um no throat burn a little bit of a tickle but I already had that to begin with doing my dabbing yeah a little bit of a tickle no burn nice taste oh yeah I like this I'm gonna have to go in for another one mmm I'm glad I got this I do have another one to review that I bought that one has me even more nervous and that's a live sauce but that if it's as good as this I'll be happy great let's get another fatty on here the other fatty for daddy haha oh yeah look at that big [ __ ] we're going in hard son it's one of them days my dispensary has modified their hours because of this pandemic so I used to be able to go before work now I can't go until after work

I got some things to do this weekend it's gonna be a long week long weekend but awesomesauce I'm happy so I must say $60 for the gram that's a better price I'm tired of these $80 grams 50 and $58 half grams [ __ ] that [ __ ] but I'd like to see this closer to 40 yes but instead of 80 I'll take it for 60 for a whole gram it sucks but it is what it is it's better than nothing and it's better than

myself I'm not affiliated with any cannabis producers or extraction companies in any way so today I've got some high-voltage extracts double lemon cookies lime crumble so a quick overview on the packaging here it's crumble so it's coming in a little glass pot is uh how they're attacking this so double lemon cookies live crumble hybrid sativa dominant and high-voltage extracts for their little social-media tags there's nothing else on the packaging but let's have a look at the actual product alright so just a little make-up jar here as well I've noted in the past some of their jars have a bit of a lip it sees these are a bit of an improvement you can get everything out of the edges there but consistency goes that's real stiff it's not falling apart like sugar or anything it's uh some nice hard powdery chunks so I don't need to dab about a point at a time it's the best way to get the flavor and low temp out of a dish thermal insert in my opinion this is tricky to get out of the pot this well gotta say hmm really nice light flavor off the bat a little bit a little bit what do you want a hotter end definitely sweeter and more berry like huh whoa hmm nice and light Oh doesn't feel like it's uh choking me up do it first impressions are pretty positive all right so it's been about 15 minutes since I did that gab and I'm gonna say I'm feeling pretty good I'm definitely like real uplifted and energetic feeling not couch locked or anything at all I've been having a laughing good time but I don't feel like sluggish or like slowed down stone yeah the flavor on that was super powerful after after a while like it was light when I took that took the toe conditionally or took the data initially and then like it just the like lingered I had that nice like waxy live resin taste in my mouth for a good 10 minutes and I like that that was nice that's uh improvement on the packaging from last time as well so yeah no no they're good offering from high voltage I definitely dab it again", "Rg28lg-XB7Y": "alright I'm here to do know that canvas extract review as usual I'm just a consumer going over products that I've purchased for myself I'm not affiliated with any canvas producers or extraction companies in any way and today I've got some West Coast extracts Hanna lope that's one of my favorite strains I've done a lot of cantaloupes in the past but quick overview on the packaging here so West Coast extracts on the front refine hydrocarbon extract one gram it says it's a sativa and nineteen plus keep out of reach of children west coast extracts 4.0 on Instagram and I don't know if you can see that a little bit of gold on my fingers on the label which I'm not oh let's have a look inside so alright I'm real careful with touching this because I'm getting gold all over my fingers alright just a little slip of parchment Oh [ __ ] gorgeous color on that though that a nice little bendy slab looks like I might have a little bit of a smell Oh No look that just bends and pulse that's [ __ ] gorgeous looking first impressions on the extract super posits check a point in the dish here without touching it with my gold dust fingers all right see how it goes ah super mellow flavor nice kick to the back of the throat got that Oh signature cantaloupe Cana sweet Mel any flavor to it oh no nasty colors in the bottom of the bucket all right so it's been about 15 minutes since I did that damn and and I mentioned right off the bat that color in the bottom of the buckets super nice really nice mellow sweet Melanie flavor I really like cantaloupe that's one of my I mentioned before it's one of my favorite strains I'm feeling pretty couch locked for a sativa though you know pretty good I could you know socialize and and do stuff I guess folks things kind of hard ya know great great product I don't normally talk about my dispensary experience in these things here but I did purchase this locally here and I went in with a friend of mine and we both purchased the exact same product the single gram cantaloupe and I paid $10 more which was kind of unsettling and off-putting and so there was that and the other thing I wanted to mention was the gold print on the packaging all of my fingers did not like that I don't really feel like dabbing gold ink print so if you do purchase that careful or like you know wash your hands after you open the Myakka doing kind of thing if you care about that kind of thing so overall great product and I would I would dab it again but I would be wary of purchasing it and its packaging", "erjEHvnEl8c": "if you are

bringing you 17 special I've always looked at like concentrates and stuff like that I was like really am I getting the best value for my money because usually I spend money on distillates and stuff because they're easier to do and control and dos but I always like the rolling effect you know of a traditional dab where it's like oh you think you're done with one hit but no you got like a couple more and you know what I said if I can get the purists leg forms of DAB you know why not you know plus its 7:10 and I said you know what it's time to really look at these more and say are they worth it and the short answer is at $40 no unless you stretch it out versus traditional dabbing um I will say this though I was personally surprised um I got this for 36 bucks today or 34 because it was on sale for 710 and it's the Cresco lime sorbet definitely smells like it let me tell you I'm definitely a lot more hints along but I would say for me this is about 5 - worth versus the 20 they say but really all I can say is an indica and let's hit it now I've done dad's of war and stuff um I usually press my own from the flower I get to stretch out my flower a little more and this is liquid live resin oh man there might be more than just sleeping okay you know what I'm decently surprised on this if I was gonna be on a lot worse but but yeah this is usually about what I dab right about there from my press and usually when I press I I finally figured out that the amount I had to press which is 0.7 but it's point eight before I press it into a pot and press and that gets me about like were presses that are at least viable but anyway cheers guys gonna hit this out of um my titanium vaporizer right here move you guys back a little but Cheers you know it's really hard to there we go I mean it's Deb what more can you say [Music] I will say this liquid librarian is not really meant for those high temp tabs that I'm used to these are more for low and you keep going then the one-hit dabs I'm usually used to I like it you know do I say 0.5 is $40 in this in this form no at best 35 or lower but definitely not hot bad I mean definitely try it lime sorbet by Cresco look at why present point 5 like I said though I will give you an update on once I finished this and Oh almost forgot on I'm not finished with it yet literally got like a couple like like literally be smooch left in it but I can give you a salt we're eating for 50 bucks no anything under 50 bucks any honestly if you get the golden valley punch get it on sale it's nice and all but not worth 50 bucks and you know how and it's more in you know that's just how I feel but if you can get this for under 50 bucks the golden valley punch definitely give it a try I liked it it's not a ten out of ten but on more of like 9.5 so definitely try it out if you can I like it you should too anyway this in Apex peace", "30WHQdDch5I": "hey what's going on guys it should boy pee here with urban growth just want to welcome you back to the day 35 episode of this lovely gorilla glue now if you have been following around or following along from week to week you'll notice that the view of the canopy has kind of changed all I did was I just turned the table and basically gave it a different angle so I hit the light and catch reflection off the wall as well but I wanted to go ahead and jump into things and you know just kind of let you guys know what's going on there's not too much to update on obviously the budget putting on weight as you can see extremely frosty I'll get you some close-ups here at the end of the video but a couple of things I wanted to touch base on first and foremost you know from this point forward the basic formation of the bud is complete all you're looking at really is you know density coming on more trichome production and just really swelling up all those calyxes as well from this point forward it's a real important time to watch out for things like mold and bugs as well just because at this point you're too far into flower to really be able to do anything about it so you want to make sure that you just maintain the optimum growing situation so your plant can really thrive right now right now it's really just about limiting any type of stress just catering tour it's kind of like a mother right before she gives birth you want to make sure that she's not stressing out so those babies in this case the buds are nice and healthy other than that you know from this point forward what I'll probably do over the next week is slowly but surely find bugs that look like they may have a problem holding up their weight and I'll go ahead and just find a way to support those just with some strings up to the ceiling example floods like this one here as you can see it's leaning pretty hard so you know chances are as it puts on weight over the next three and a half four weeks it will definitely need a little bit of support by giving it that support you allow that but to put on more weight and more weight once the the branch starts to weaken and be unable to hold the bud the plan isn't going to supply that much more energy to that actual bud site just because it's its way of its self-preservation it doesn't want to kill itself other than that like I said just make sure you maintain the proper conditions for your plan me personally I like to kind of switch my watering up a little bit right now stay consistent as far as the amount of times you water and when you water but trying to change up what you feed me personally I go from watering on a nutrient water schedule so I'll give it a neutral on Monday water on Tuesday newts on Wednesday water on Thursday so on and so forth and it kind of just gives it a little bit of a kickstart into the flesh cycle helps you slowly try to reduce some of those salts and some of that build-up so you don't you know totally shock your plant when you do flush it the first time and I've noticed by doing that it kind of I still flush at the end but it just kind of gives me a head start and it gives me a nice sweeter riper taste but I usually start that probably about week six and so I'll start that next week let me think yeah other than that man not really much talked about I do appreciate you guys tuning in as always this right here is the little girl she's on day 28 and she's coming along quite nice as well she's not gonna be no hyhy Guilder the main goal for this plant is I'm gonna let it go an extra week maybe an extra ten days really let those amber trikes come on and then I'm gonna compare it to the smoke from this girl saying that they're the same strand this is the mother this is the clone and it'll give me an idea of how I like this gorilla glue going forward just so I know if I prefer it to you know have the 63 day harvest over a 72 or what-have-you but I know 72 is a bit long for glue but I'm a real big indica guy I like some good nighttime smoke so even if this one turns out you know nice and ripe at day 63 I'm still gonna let this girl down here go an extra week or so just so I can have some good you know strong kick your ass indica bud plate that's it for this week's update go ahead and stay tuned for some blood shot and I will see you guys next week [Music]", "lBsIJ1Ecge8": "[Music] [Music] foreign what's up guys it's wojie and today we're gonna be reviewing cresco's gorilla glue number four but first let's go get stoned [Music] [Applause] [Music] here we go [Music] you that's okay man that's pretty good so let's talk about it gorilla glue number four also known as gg4 because of the whole lawsuit thing uh it is pretty high in thc 84.64 cbd content is 0.14 percent and let me tell you man it is tasty this is a virgin rosin butter um it's very very smooth consistency of as you can tell from the pictures has a nice light creamy color to it the taste is very very strong in the limonene the beta mercin and also the beta kerry falling if any of you guys can pronounce them better i'm sure anyways you go ahead and correct me in the comments down below i know you know better but anyways let's get down to it so it's got this real lemony citrusy taste but it's also sweet on the exhale which is kind of unique [Music] the lineage is believed to be ken sister crossed with sour dub crossed with chocolate diesel gorilla glue has won multiple high times awards it is a very very well known strain that gets crossed with just about everything on you know it's it's everywhere i mean it's kind of surprising if you haven't tried gorilla glue put down in 2020 and you're a soldier it's very piney citrusy sweet it comes from like pure sifted trichomes they make the verger rosin butter by taking all the trichomes off the bug sifting it down and then pressing it into the actual uh extract using a solvent-less press you know like a heat press this particular strain i got for 50 bucks at very life in illinois and i think it's a pretty good deal bang for your buck the only negatives is you know when when strains started getting cross and crossed and crossed they started losing their thc content and started gaining a lot more higher thca content and this is one of those strains where it doesn't really knock you out if anything it makes you a little bit more energetic gets you talking gets you a little bit creative and ready to go and that's good and bad for some people you know depending on what you want out of the strain at high doses it is pretty sedative but you gotta smoke man you gotta take down a lot to be actually feeling sedated honestly this is the strain i use when i wanna draw or go design something or if i got an idea for a cool you know design that's when i'll be smoking this personally i love gorilla glue i like gorilla glue the original number four just like this over all the crosses of gorilla glue i think it'll i feel like it's just starts losing its flavor and it's distinct taste once you start mixing it into like wedding cake and lava cake with all that other stuff so my personal rating one through ten for guerilla blue number four is going to be a 7.8 out of 10. i'm pretty happy with it for 50 dollars it's a good bang for your buck it won't get you the highest there's definitely stronger strains and more thc specifically heavy strains that will get you feeling like gone but for a like creative daytime kind of smoke this is your strain all right man this has been wojie thanks for watching thanks for smoking along with me and i hope you're smoking with me on the next video", "VDFaP2f4_3I": "hey guys it's huger I grow up coming at you with a new report from purple city genetics this is the gorilla group number four this is a cut that they have I'm not sure if they're still releasing it but they did last year in the year before and she won a festival in 2015 I believe or 2014 in San Francisco and here she is I mean she was just gorgeous a treat to grow very very easy I reacted very well to nutrients I used heavy 16 and this round about the last four weeks I went very heavy on the teeth to try to see if that would bring out some good flavor and good aromas and what I got was just a very super earthy very sour fruit and a bit of coffee just a gorgeous gorgeous smell anytime you get close to her look at those buds just giant giant buds very happy with her um I talked her about eight times and like I said it took her sixty-three days the last 14 days or so about 13 days I started the flush I wanted to make sure I got all the sugars and carbs out of the leaves to make sure that when I did begin the drying process I would get the cleanest and smoothest smoke and it worked out perfect I got a nice ripening on the branches you see the yellowing throughout the whole canopy I think that if I run her again I'm going to maybe start the flush about a day or two before to see if I can get more of that yellowing throughout but all in all I'm very happy with her and I should have a smoke report once all the flowers are dried here in the next I'd say four weeks or five weeks so stay tuned but I just wanted to come with you and show you this if you are really a fan like me you're excited so like I said stay tuned here for the next three or four weeks and I'll have that smoke report on the grill igloo stay high and happy growing you guys see you guys soon", "SsC4jaIY8sQ": "[Music] welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I've got my trusty pour one out 510 vape battery that is finely [ __ ] the bet on me after 15 cartridge reviews or something it finally [ __ ] the bed and my trusty 510 battery has died so I'm pulling out the backup the cheaper chintzy er one here that's okay we'll get a new one we'll get a better one but I'm gonna miss my old friend there has died but outside of the funeral for our trusty 510 vape pen we are here for a joyous celebration and we are here to review the product that I have had to me suggested the most of anything I have ever reviewed or intended to review and that is brass knuckles we are finally reviewing brass knuckles I have had you guys a lot of you recommending me check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles and I've used brass knuckles in the past and but we won't talk about that but today we are going to be reviewing brass knuckles finally found some here in Long Beach and I'm very very excited to give it a review so this is the one gram Gorilla Glue cartridge and it comes in some a primo packaging that I have no doubt I'm gonna have difficulty opening here really nice packaging as you can see plastic on the outside it's got all the information you want on the inside lab tested contaminant and pesticide free that brings me up to the controversy I I know that there was a big controversy with brass knuckles for a while about pesticide usage but apparently that is no longer the case I hope that is no longer the case I I would a vet suggest you do your due diligence and research if you're really worried about those kind of things what you might probably should be maybe so do your own due diligence make sure you know this is something for you but from what I've heard they have all of their problems in terms of having pesticides or whatever fungicides or whatever I was that was in there it's no longer the case so Gorilla Glue is my favorite strain as I have said many a times I have seen it listed as both hybrid and indica this is a hybrid gorilla glue I like it both as hybrid and indica this cost me as you can see $52 at my dispensary which is a bit of a miss which is a bit misleading because really with the 35% taxes it can cost considerably more than that but $52 is the base price so you know pretty expensive but not outrageously more expensive than other cartridges this one just has the reputation sort of throughout Southern California as being the best of the best and I think I actually got it open without too much trouble there maybe here we go here's our cartridge in its little packaging there for medicinal use only not for redistribution and we can see their weed maps all that logos blah blah blah blah blah they have a snapchat how fun alright we have got our standard 510 pen here not our former best friend bottoms cap just like all the others with these little rubber stoppers whoever makes these little rubber stoppers must be doing pretty bonk owes business right now I would imagine let's screw this in ooh I like the color of this oil nice dark golden oil beautiful looking oil there a nice brass tip I guess that's where the name brass knuckles come from and a nice wide intake hole there so very excited to give this a drop let's give it a go oh wow that is a premium experience that is a smooth with smooth draw Wow ignore the cough that's my fault not theirs I'm a coffer this does not burn hot at all you can barely feel it entering along it's wonderful the taste is exquisite and Wow I'm already feeling pretty nicely medicated actually oh wow they use a bad word on their packaging here I'm gonna have to read that for you guys I don't see what their THC potency is listed at on here but I do know that they are among the highest in the state I think I've seen before that it's over 90% it certainly feels that way I'm already feeling quite high after just 3 3 little puffs there one negative thing and it might actually be this pen is I'm not getting this huge a draw as I would want for pulling I like the bigger clouds but it's sort of ameliorated by the fact that even the small draws are getting me quite high and it might actually just be this pen doesn't have the voltage to get the huge clouds I'll double check I'm gonna be getting a new pen before I finish this so I'll I'll be sure to let you guys know in the follow up if that still the case Wow but up into this point brass knuckles definitely definitely earns their reputation tastes great hits like a dream oh man really really really enjoying the brass on my brass knuckles experience here guys if only it were a little easier to draw from it would be perfect but again that maybe the pen and I'll be sure to let you know guys because I'm gonna review this entire cartridge I'm not just gonna take a couple of puffs and say it's good I'm gonna come back to you guys after I finish this whole Graham here to let you know exactly my thoughts let you know if anything's changed if the starting to leak if the oil got tacky whatever the case may be I'll be sure to let you know in the follow up so I'll come back to you guys probably in four or five days after I finished this bad boy off and let you know exactly what I'm thinking thank you so much for watching weeks to this point guys and I will see you in just a bit it has been actually I believe eight days since I last checked in with you talking the one gram brass knuckles Gorilla Glue cartridge so right off the bat I wasn't doing this really any less than any other cartridge I don't feel like but it lasted a long long time I really got your values worth with this one certainly a gram in there the other thing is it is still very potent this is a potent a blend that they've got in here this is certainly as strong as its sort of reputation lends it to believe but all that being said my initial I'm not as emphatically as in love as I was with my initial impressions or as I was when I gave my initial impressions there have been a couple of things that have walnut spoiled me on the experience have certainly damper the experience one is it became significantly more difficult to draw as time went on I did get a new battery to test it with and even with a new battery it was still kind of tough to draw from and it got harder and harder as time went on and which is something I really have a problem with with the VBA I much prefer the ones that have nice easy drawers that you can make nice big you know take nice big inhalations with as the kids call them make nice big clouds this wasn't really that and I'm not sure if it was this cartridge in particular as you can see there's actually some oil left there at the bottom I just had such a tough time drawing from it that I think I'm just gonna have to leave it there the other thing is it did start to get a bit of a burnt taste as I got closer to the bottom the closer I got the more burnt the taste was it for the most part tasted great I really enjoyed the taste but as we started to get near the end or trim it's the end of its life that burnt taste started to amplify so tough to draw from and increasingly tough to draw from and an increasingly unpleasant taste those aren't good things for sure those those weren't those theirs don't keep it and there's hold it back and getting in my highest remarks for sure but I feel like I'm definitely gonna get brass knuckles the second chance I've heard enough about them that I'm wondering if maybe I just got a bad card what the case may be so I'm gonna give him a second chance we're gonna review something else from them in the future but for now between the two because they're so often compared and they're so look alike I actually think I might prefer the heavy hitters to brass knuckles maybe yeah I think in my initial impressions I would go with the heavy hitter of the brass knuckle but let's get let's go ahead and do another brass knuckle review before we give it any the definitive conclusion and overall my impressions are still pretty positive this is a potent a long lasting cartridge that you're gonna get your money's worth from so you know I it's still really positive review it's just not as good as I initially had hoped but we will be examining them and given the future so fingers crossed and that guys is gonna do it for this review but before I bounce I want to share with you a little cherry on top just something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related but could be enjoyed with weed or with or without weed and so on this cherry on top what I wanted to share with you guys was something nice and simple something nice and easy an 11 minute web clip from the fine folks at where I guess fine folks the mostly male folks over at Adult Swim make Krueger's of creators of chosen Rick and Morty or at least the hosts of such shows as Rick and Morty but that's not we're here to talk about is Rick and Morty we are here to talk about their 11 minutes short too many cooks too many cooks too many cooks it is an 11 minute video and if you haven't seen it a lot of you I'm sure have that sort of tries to replicate many 90s opening credit songs but things go awry and that's about all I want to say because you should know as little about it as possible before going in because it is who it's gonna be one of the most surreal 11 minutes of your life Definitely Maybe recommend if you do have some cannabis on hand doing some before hand if you're not prone to paranoia if you are definitely pass on it but it's gonna be enjoyable I think for you guys again that is called too many cooks on Adult Swim I'm sure you can find it on YouTube just search too many cooks so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat sand that's gonna do it for this cherry on top as well thank you so much for sticking around to the very end here guys I appreciate it as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "fzVXnUcRUS4": "good morning New Testament growers all over the world while we are not that the Kratt garden but I visited my brother's home today and I just wanted to share with you guys his outdoor bro it is September 21st 2019 and he put two plants outside this is actually the gorilla glue number four as well the same one that we love to grow indoors and this is just two plants I mean these things come he got him straight from clones as well I mean he put these things down I believe July 1st July 1st I believe he said he put these things down and this gorilla glue is just quite the strand I mean my goodness look at look at this thing I mean he's definitely making me want to grow outdoors next year I hate I gotta wait a whole nother year but just check these things out talk about my gosh look at this this is amazing he didn't do nothing neither I mean he just put him in the ground and ordered him this is quite a job I mean these things were only in the ground from July first till now and he definitely picked a good Sun spot cuz my goodness these things are huge all righty just a quick video I wanted to show you guys is to guerrilla gloves all right it's just a little bonus video of his outdoor grow piece", "Ge0ORhYJmoc": "what's up guys welcome back to Kush Coast and today we're gonna talk about using your 120 sight cones machine and how the order forum a lot of people get confused on what cones to order and basically they come in different styles you can get cones Raw's these are the raw versions they're brown they're opposed to be organically made or whatever these are the basic white cones this is a company that you can buy it's called J wear and they make cones as well they're pretty cheap but when you buy from J we're compared to buying from the cones company the cones companies gonna ask you what sides you want them in small that it added a large when you're buying half grams you're gonna want the point six otherwise known as the smalls and these ones will do the half grams and then if you're ordering for the one grams you're gonna want the one point three I don't know if you can see that there gives you a size one point three that's for your actual gram if you use the gram ones it's really hard to get a gram in them so they call them one point threes or they're a hundred and nine millimeters the hundred and nine millimeter is the way you need to know if you're ordering from other companies like this J wear because they don't come in sizes point six point that it it comes in reefer King size and party size but the hundred and nine millimeter is the actual size that gets you that one gram but if not the ninety eight millimeter will do half grams pretty good but you get a lot of extra paper just so you know so basically some of the things you guys are gonna need beside your cones in the machine you're gonna need a grinder to grind the product I prefer these coffee grinders like this these suckers right here get the cannabis to the exact consistency you want for it to be able to burn smoothly you can over grind with these real easy and just make piles of Keith but if you just tag it a couple of times which we'll show you in a minute it keeps the product real consist and it helps surface stims which you can pull out later of course cones when you buy the machine it comes with one of these scrubbers and before you reload this every time you need to make sure you clean it otherwise you get Jam ups so this is a real important tool to make sure you don't lose you're gonna want a pair of tweezers in case some of them get stuck down in there and you can tweezer them out if you have problems this is a good emergency tool to go to you're gonna want a couple of different size rods or pins or whatever to be able to poke down inside of the cones and help pack them in case they got air spots in them these work really good we just got a piece of bamboo nap in we've been using them for a long time if you guys want and you guys don't have that much product you guys could cut off little pieces of card like I did here and this card will actually fit on this combs machine let's see it goes like right here well maybe over here there it is so it goes like that and then we got another one with an angle and we put it like that and you can block off holes this way and only fill in so many without losing product through the rest of the holes a couple crappy old business cards work really good for that but they also work good for stirring and making sure that you can fill all the cones so these work really good we got an old film container here and the reason why we have this film container is because you're gonna need a skel if you're doing it for shops to get them the exact weight so this helps hold the cone up and not spill all the stuff out of it as you're weighing them so you could go through and weigh them real fast like that but these are a couple of the essentials that you guys are gonna need besides some product for us we've got some gorilla glue these are some buds that work quite pretty enough to go into the sacks for people there's a bunch of smalls in here but so we're gonna make these into joints so go to waste we also got some green queen and we have a bag of pitbull and even though it's really good smoke it just it got real lar fee it didn't get real dense like we wanted it to so this all get rolled into joints it didn't make it into the bag so a couple of things you guys want to know to start you want to really clean the table really good otherwise it'll go from a one-man job to a two-man job on the bottom of this cones machine right here it have suction pads these suction pads are crucial for you to get through this once you stick this sucker down and the spot you want it at and make sure it sucked down real good to where it's not gonna come off leave it there don't keep picking it up if you keep picking it up you're gonna cover the table and keep and when you cover the table and keep it won't stick no more and if it doesn't stick you'll never be able to pick this spring up on the inside and be able to turn it like this it'll keep picking up with it and then you can't two-hand it and pick it up this spring is real strong in here so you want to make sure that it's tucked down real good so you can actually turn it okay so now I'm gonna go ahead and get out some cones and then I'll show you guys how we load it all right so to load your cones machine I'm going with these point sixes the this order calls for a lot of handout pre-rolls so most of the handout pre-rolls you get in the shop are gonna be 0.6 s or half grams those are the ones they usually hand out the gram size joints we'll do in a minute but basically you grab this stack of cones like this and then you can real easily just walk along and drop them down inside of these holes like this and it makes it really fast to go through it and dump them you're gonna pull out the little paper stints that they give you and you're just gonna go through and load this whole machine down like this until you get done so I'm gonna go through and load this and then I'll show you guys how we do deal with the grind all right real quick just you guys know we filled this in the down position if you can see here it's touching that's the down position and then when you go to lift it up that's the up position it sinks them all down to where they're down inside of there lower than the grade of the actual top so that way when you put the Cannabis on there or your material it'll go down inside there so now I'm gonna show you guys what it we do to grind it and the consistency you're looking for a couple of things that forgot to mention you're gonna want a couple of Tupperware containers we're gonna want one for grinding your product into then you're gonna want one to put the finished cones in and this one we'll use later but for now we're gonna roll with this one so basically we're gonna get our coffee grinder out and start grinding product let me get that set up so I could show you what it looks like so for me I like to go through it and try to remove as much stem as possible and get rid of all your chunks of stem those will end up plaguing you later when you go to try to tighten joint down and twist the tops those little pieces of stem will start poking through it so I'm gonna just keep breaking this up like this getting it inside of this grinder trying to pull all the big chunks that I can find anything hard real pokey you want it gone but make sure you got gloves on so you're not you know making everybody's smoke all dirty dead skinned and you don't get your hands super sticky or black this products real sticky and it'll ruin your hands real fast it'll make it tore you can't touch the papers without ruining them so you want to make sure that you get your hands covered with some kind of gloves for this process it's just better all the way around and sanitary for the product as well you don't need to fill this very full of course you don't want to be sitting here all day long doing tiny bits at a time but I mean you want to make sure that it's got a good chunk in it just not super packed to where gonna make it hard and you have to fight the lid on it so once I get it about like that I'm gonna throw my cap on and this only takes like a couple of seconds you'll listen and I'll let you hear it there's one and then I'll do one with a shake then I'm gonna open it up and you can already see that it's pretty ground down pretty fine so a consistency like this is really nice but you have to still be sure that there ain't no bigger chunks like this these little chunks like this will get stuck in there and mess you up real bad so you're just gonna go through it and break them up make sure and I move the product from one side of this box to the other just to make sure there ain't no big chunks that did get broke up like that one or any big stem that you see you're gonna want to make sure it's broke up as well any big stems but that's basically the grind right there then I take this and I slide it down and then I go on to the next one you can see all the kief in it there's a lot of Keef in that if you go too long all you will make is piles of Keef there won't you won't have any mass to it so when you go to smoke the joy what happens is this one and either gets so compacted that it doesn't want a bird or two it'll start running oil all the way down your face when you smoke on it it gets so tight that the oil just starts pouring out the end of the cone and you don't want that so I'm gonna go through this bag right here and knock out as much as I can and I'll show you guys what it looks like when I get it all browned up okay here you can see our consistency it's fine grain powder like tobacco we removed all the stems like we talked about you need about 65 to 70 grams to do 120 1/2 grammars you always want to go about 5-6 grams over so they're not light but plus you're gonna lose some even with your scale on the point system which we'll show you later so I got my consistency ground up set that off to the side say this is the area I'm working in I already threw my pile of stems away you're gonna want to take a moist paper towel and wipe this down real good and make sure it's clean you're also going to want to touch the bottom of your suction cups and make sure they're clean and moist and there's nothing stuck to them then you're gonna set it down and you're gonna make sure it's planted on the table solid so that way when you go to pick it up later and turn it it doesn't come up off of the table but now that we know it's on there and it's already in the up position not the down position where the white papers showing but up position am i picking it up and locking it into place it keeps the papers from getting destroyed now taking the old card I like to use these business cards and I like to sprinkle it on here and try to go pretty evenly and you're not gonna fill them all right the second you're just gonna spread some out across the tops and make sure some little pieces fall down in there so that way when we do the first beating you can make sure that you get it all the way down to the cones filter at the bottom the little crutch so I'm just gonna get some down inside of these like this and once I'm confident that I spilt a little bit in each one and that each one's got a little tiny bit in it I'm gonna go ahead and go through like this and if you do it light-handed don't go Bam Bam Bam just like it actually gives you a better pack than if you're slamming on it real hard then I'm gonna go through and I'm gonna add some more and this time I'm gonna get a little fuller and a little fuller until they're all filled up you're just gonna keep repeating this process and if you do it if you take the time to do it right the first time you won't have to bunch you have to fix nobody likes having to go through and fix a whole bunch of these combs it sucks so to keep the process fast it just do it right the first time and you won't have no problem so I had it a little bit and add some more product and I'm gonna do this until I know that all the paper are covered that each one of them have some to the top of that white paper in there I don't know if you can see that with the camera but you got to make sure that it gets all the way up to there it looks like I need to grind some more let me have a second and I'll be right back guys so I got more ground we're gonna get them all filled up a little fast make sure we get all of our holes filled and you can look down in them and see which ones didn't get it which ones did and of course I didn't weigh this product which I probably should have then I would have known I had enough but I don't got time I got orders to fill so I'm just flying through it as fast as I can we still have thwack sirs to do which I'll make a video on that that's where we take whacks and then keep rolling which I'm sure everybody's already knows how to do but we get so many questions why not make a video about it right and of course we don't get paid for by combs or anybody else for any of these videos we post you guys know nowadays YouTube confiscates all the money and it doesn't allow anybody to do any type of merchant handling or any type of third party marketing or anything like that for anything with cannabis on it they uh ixnay your videos monetization so we don't get paid for this we just do this out of you know share and share alike and this culture was based on that so all these secret keepers nowadays you can keep your secrets and Joe money alright that's looking pretty good we got just about all of them full some of them are a little short but they'll make up for it later as we're pulling weight out of them cuz they're always gonna be over so you're gonna be taking quite a bit out as you go [Music] alright now when you go to the turn it it's stuck to the table really good and they're gonna all stand up for you just like that right there now you're gonna go and pick through them and you're gonna throw them on a scale to see what they weigh and that's why we have this little cup here and we set that on the scale before we turn our scale on to tear it I also like to keep another cup on the graphic pass this one over here because as I pull them these way approximately for the half gram joints about 0.2 so at point two you need to make sure that this says point 7 or 0.8 and in California and Oregon to be able to say that you're selling it to a shop and it's medicine you need to make them weigh exactly so that way they're not getting a messed up dosage scale so point 7 is what they really want them to be at so you're just gonna take over here and make yourself a little pile because as you can see when we shook this thing it kicked out all kinds of product around it so as soon as we're done we're gonna clean it all to the front of us get it back into our bag or our Tupperware and clean the table again and start over again but this one still says point eight so I got to get it down now it jumped two points there it is right there that's close enough okay so you're gonna take your poker you got two different pokers you're gonna take your poker and just to get you a nice flat top to be able to grab it with three fingers and you're gonna do a shake like this and that shake is gonna tighten it up you can hold it up to the light and look through it and you can see that the product made it all the way down to the bottom and there's no big air gap here and if there is an air gap you just keep shaking it until it comes out when you crease it with your three fingers it's gonna make a little try thing like that kind of like a triangle right once you got it like that you're gonna give it a gentle twist like this and then you're gonna shake it again to help tighten that twist into place and when you're done it should look just like that right there to keep your scale from being on for long periods of time though the trick is to go through pull them out one at a time weigh them make sure that they get their weight right and set them right here in this jar fill up a jar like this first and then go through and tighten them all up after you're done it'll make it a lot faster for you in the long run and you could have multiple jars and go through the whole thing real fast but unless you have somebody else here helping you and you're doing this by yourself this is the best way to do it right here all right guys I'm gonna go on to finish it in this out I'll show you guys how many we get and what they look like when we're all done all right made it through all 120 it took me about 28 minutes 29 minutes or so and just from going from here skelling I'm dumping the excess inside of the cup dropping them in here boom boom boom until I had my cup full shut my scale off take them twist all the tops throw them inside of my Tupperware that's what a hundred and twenty look like it would normally go straight from here twist them put them in a two sticker label um and then put them in off to the side but this company doesn't need them to so there is going in Tupperware and they're gonna be delivered like that and the tough work so they stay dry and they don't dry out any further before you guys even get to this process though you guys should practically roll one see how it smokes and make sure that it burns properly before you get to this stage where you're making hundreds of them if you get some cannabis that people grow or if you didn't grow it yourself and you're purchasing it they didn't flush it properly the joints won't burn right and you don't want to make hundreds of them and hand them out and get a lot of complaints about the way they burn I mean the number one reason for them not burning right is because of the way people dry and cure it but if they don't flush properly that's another reason why to moist a weed won't grind white right or it won't burn right so you want to make sure that it's at the right dried consistency to be able to grind up nicely not so dry that it's you know turn straight to dust but about four to six percent is the average moisture level that you're going to be looking for my next stage will be after this is to clean this to repeat the process and I'll show you guys how I do that alright so real quick for you guys to clean this the simple way is to make sure everything's down in the holes first using a card to scrape all any big chunks that's leftover then you take your brush and you go through and you brush off the top make sure everything goes down on the inside like this here make sure it's good and clean then you're gonna make sure that it's in the upright position not in the bottom closed position that way this can go all the way through and clean really good I like to choose a section this is in section so find a section start at a section and roll with it and just fly through it like this right here and this is pushing everything down to the bottom and this will make sure that when you put the next set of cones and they don't stick to the walls that could be a real big problem if you get them all caked in there you can't get them out you end up breaking a bunch of papers this is the best way to do it just like this right here all right so we got it all cleaned out I don't know if you could pan the camera down here and see inside here all that that's in there so we got our tough water dish over here I'm gonna just dump my extras in there I'm gonna take this bad boy lean it over on its side like this so I could see down it I don't know if you guys can see in there and then I'll take my brush and I'm gonna go through and I'm gonna scrub this bottom plate off with the brush and get it really good and clean and try to get all that stuff out of there and onto the table it's weird holding it like this for your guys's angle but uh you got to make sure you get the thing super clean you don't want this thing getting gummed up it'll gum up real fast on you if you have to you have to clean it with alcohol or something that's fine clean it with alcohol but then make sure you let it dry out for a long time before you use it again because the key itself will stick to everything like glue if it sits there the longer it sits there it'll stick so hard it'll be real hard to get off so the trick is is to go through this as fast as you can and try to get you know all of the product back off of the off of this 120 sight combs machine so it's not stuck to it like glue then you could give it a couple of days it's clean set it off to the side out of the way try not to get the two or the three little suction cups dirty you got your tongue over here and you look at this right here see how it automatically keeps up and starts to clump up that's because it's got a lot of oils in it get your card out scrape it all right back into your tough wire and you're gonna repeat the process again and again and again so you're done with your tada but you want to make sure that you clean this table off really good I got me a paper towel right here and I'm gonna get it wet and I'll use that to read moisten the table again and make sure that it's tucked down real good because any of these little particles right here they're gonna mess up your guys's suction with the suction cup so grab a paper towel and then go through and just give it a good wipe picking up all those little green particles flip this bad boy over make sure my suction cups are clean stick it to the table make sure it's stuck now you can turn it BAM back in business time to reload and go again and basically that's all there is to how you do this 120 sight cones machine it's real simple it's made out of real hard plastic and if you can afford it I know they're expensive but if you guys can afford it this is the way to go for mass producing joints the cones works good they got crutches in them so you don't get cannabis or tobacco or whatever you're using in your mouth and these are the subway we prefer to do it if we're gonna be doing them by the you know buttload but thanks for watching be sure

it's time to trim it chart let it start caring and I'll be able to let everybody know the total dried weight that I got from this so stay tuned so it's time to trim and jar this gorilla glue number four my fist crews ready it's ten days ago that the plant was put into the dark tent and eight days ago that I chopped it hung it since then I removed the center branches hung them separately hoping that would help it to dry more efficiently reduce the chance of any mold or anything like that and my ink Burt humidity controller was originally set at 58% and I after a couple days I reduced it to fifty five percent so the drying process is done now it's time to trim and jar and let those buds start caring so my plan is to just take this off one branch at the time I've got my trim bin in the other room and some gloves it all wear well let's get started so got my trim bin by harvest more it's pretty handy little product keeps all the mess contained screen so the trichome heads can fall through there into the bottom handy little brush to collect them all mostly it's just nice because it keeps the mess contained well I'm no expert trimmer I think different people have different techniques this product is not for sale this is just for personal use any of these little people referred to that it's larf I'm just going to throw it down there it'll go into a bag in the freezer and I'll use that to make some hash later on as for the buds themselves I tried to get in there close so they kind of the base of the leaf trim it off I just kind of rush through it because like I said just for personal use or for myself and a few other loved ones bag quality or the appearance isn't actually that important that's uh so I've had a lot of work ahead of me you don't need to watch it off I'd be quite boring I'm sure so I'll keep trimming away turn the camera back on accomplished a bit pretty sure watching some guy trim bud it's not entertaining they call it trim jail for a reason my sentence doesn't last too long anyways I'll shut the camera off I'll bring you back in a little bit when there's actually something to show all right I've been at it for a couple hours about half done a lot of nice buds trimmed up I'll get alert it's uh all the calyxes that grow along the stem and keeping them separate just for the heck of it and the scissors have been getting really gunked-up so been scraping them clean every now and then get little pile of scissor hash on to go yeah just keep at it thud it give an update of where I'm at about halfway done things aren't too bad it's open done all this trim and the purim in the beauty of it of course is the screen all those trichome heads can fall through the screen that over here hopefully you can see that trimmed in also comes with this little brush works real well for gathering up so I've got quite quite the collection here I'll get that cleaned up and yeah I would say that cleaned up I'll get to weighing the results but good a nice big bowl of buds and trimmed high fast you can see the Fox tailing there on some of them though again it's not like these were for sale or anything therefore personally use appearance isn't that important but yeah I've got a nice big bowl of buds this other container of the smaller popcorn larf stuff and then the calyx is that I don't know what I'll do with those and yeah the scissor hash as well ended up to be quite a bit there really we'll save that for another day so anyway so yeah I'll get this cleaned up and then we'll get the scale and see what the results are good are all weighed up I ended up with exactly five ounces of trimmed dried buds each of these jars holds exactly an ounce again not the best trim job ever it'll do and then I had about twelve point five grams of this popcorn bud though lar fees stuff I don't know what's gonna come of it and then from the trim bin when I cleaned up the bottom of it I got one point four grams of well I guess essentially trichome heads so there might be some contaminants in there but it's awfully sparkly yeah all in all I guess I'm satisfied over five ounces is pretty good certainly room for improvement but uh yeah I'm happy so I guess that concludes the gorilla glue part of it the jack hair just got put into the dark tent so it'll be a video about that coming soon and now I can focus on exclusively Otto flowers and in the tent alright well end that there yeah so five ounces and about a half ounce of scrap stuff other than that I'm satisfied so gorilla glue number four from Canucks seeds I would call it a success alright that's that this is Grammy signing off we'll see you in the next one", "8xi6JrT6pH0": "okay cool today in the name of what's in my pre-roll we have this eight gram grenade xxl infused pre-roll from napalm with originals flower so uh this is definitely by far the biggest joint i've ever gutted i'm not sure how i'm going to deal with that i have some ideas hopefully this all pans out but yeah let's go ahead and just jump into it if you're watching this on my patreon page thanks a lot i appreciate you being a patron it means a lot because this thing was [ __ ] expensive sorry to use some foul language there but uh yeah it was 150 on the menu pre-tax uh so thank you to tropicana for making this happen giving me that 15 discount got me out the door under two bills but still very expensive nonetheless uh but yeah let's take a look at this tag cause i'm interested in what we're gonna find here um so we've got eight g's it says seven g's of originals indoor flower and 1g of live resin and it says lift tickets infused rolling paper so i guess there is a g of live resin mixed in with the flower we'll find out together um and then also lift tickets are infused so that's like more live resin in those papers so in any case that's what's going on here with this label let's see if there's what's on the back okay this is the actual testing panel here just came right off that pin and this is what we got in here so 28 to total thc and it does say 7g a flower 1g of extract southwest caregivers here and when was it made back on 8 26 so not too long ago were just coming up towards the end of september now it's about the 20th um so yeah not too old just under a month about so interesting let's see originals og rolling paper by lift tickets so that i don't know we're going to find out together but that makes me wonder is the live resin just what's in the paper because lift tickets is you know it says rolling paper and then flower by but doesn't say concentrates by so oh but wait oh oh ingredients never mind hold on cannabis flour cannabis extract live resin diamonds cannabis extract live resin infused rolling paper alright so that answers my question of course there's the government uh warning they're always watching um so yeah we should find some diamonds in here as well as the flower and then of course the rolling paper is infused so maybe i'll be able to save some of that maybe not looks like quite a bit of cb oh never mind i was reading that wrong i thought it was 11 cbd i was like wow that's a lot but uh point one four five percent cbd so not too much compared to the thc in any case let's get into it and see what's good i'll take this tag i'll put it over here i'll move my sticker because i imagine there's going to be a lot of flour coming out and so this is it let me zoom out you don't need to be that close this is the pin here is the seal so you see you have the official napalm seal um and yeah i mean i think that's it i don't think i actually pull the pin that would be pretty cool but but i think i just twist this off so let's go ahead and watch the seal break together or if it yep there it goes and you can see that it's got that kind of amp anti-tamper seal stuff there stuck on the jar and here we go it's ready to come out let me zoom back out drum roll in your heads boom there it is damn this thing is huge uh definitely again the biggest pre-roll that i've ever gutted the surface looks a little strange just before i pull it apart i thought i'd zoom in on that and i do want to get a dry pool and not neglect that because there's no going back on this one and how the heck oh maybe you do have to pull the pin no i don't know maybe not do i just we're finding this out together i should have did it say pull pin on the instructions to use no no okay uh i don't want to break it but it doesn't it's like stuck in there what the [ __ ] hold on hold on here you get to see me mess with this thing and be a total idiot let me try to pull the pin no okay it doesn't work all right well it's in there it's stuck in there and it's like if you spend this much money on a j and you can't get it out of the cap like what the [ __ ] maybe i gotta unscrew it all right okay i'm just there we go okay i don't know what i did there i think that was my fault so pardon my retardation um pardon that my use of that because i can't erase it and we're live in this video so i'm sorry for saying that but yeah that was my fault i think i i feel like is this screwed in or what what what's going on here this looks like porcelain i should have probably read to see what this is made of but looks like a nice tip it smells great i gotta give that to the originals the uh i can smell the ogenus from back here so let me go ahead and get a dry pull on this real quick and it pulls just fine like i feel like if i lit this up it would smoke perfectly it's got that like really nice it's almost lemony it's like yeah definitely a lemony um maybe minorly gassy but i get more of a freshness off of it so it's like yeah but there's definitely a fuel in the taste too on it so i'm gonna enjoy smoking this flour for sure it's got a great taste classic og so maybe the originals you know i don't know it's it's it's definitely uh on point with a lot of very popular ogs i'm not gonna comment more than that but it tastes very good um all right so let's go ahead and get the right angle on this thing because there's no going back here we go with this here looks like this is where it was actually sealed together so here we go snip snip snip now this is a barrel and i really am curious about how they put these together because it's just like this big tube and i'm like is this you know i mean are these all made by hand hand packed most likely at least like do they cone these out at first how do they do it so let me see i'm going to try to actually cut down the middle here i'm going to try to preserve the paper as much as possible maybe i'll be able to roll it back into a j let me see oh there we go here we go i'm just going to open that up there it is there we go all right awesome well there it is it's coming out in a big old barrel because that's what it is in here all stuffed in oh man i don't want to lose any of this material so i'm going to be really careful as i pat it out of here come on now come on now come on now here it comes all right here we go is that no no i'll be honest i am on the lookout for seeds only because that is what i saw in another video where somebody had opened this up oh special k i just i'm glad the paper caught all that only one tiny tiny little piece managed to make its way off all right cool so the paper is pretty much intact i don't know if we'll see if we find any of those diamonds in here i don't know what they're supposed to look like this stuff smells so good though it's really awesome i definitely love the the smell i'm getting so let me go ahead and get more of a centered view here as i go through this it's a lot of material as i was saying i don't even want to breathe too hard because it'll just go everywhere um so let's see what we got in here already just a little passenger there so far now this is going to take a bit it's going to take a bit but i i don't uh don't see how where the diamonds are exactly and uh you know eventually um if napalm sees this video let me know what i'm looking for exactly because i'm not seeing it i'm seeing a lot of this though which i'm just suspect now because i've seen that other video special k i believe is the user that put that out and there are a lot of these little tiny looking pieces that like are not seeds because i keep smashing them and they go away they're just very suspect you know so but uh the material itself i mean i kind of like the grind it's not grounded down to nothing um so that's good it's got a good consistency it probably would have smoked pretty well but it does have the occasional passenger man it is just so hard to go through this much material though to be honest i probably should have put it in a rolling tray i think i think maybe these chunks i keep coming across might be something to do with the live resin i mean it doesn't feel sticky it doesn't feel like a concentrate by any means uh when i'm breaking them up but i'm just you know finding these little clusters in here and uh and yeah so i just want to be thorough this is probably gonna feel one of the longest joint videos also i hope my phone holds up uh heat wise because it tends to overheat but yeah i just keep seeing a lot of these little bits of things so i i think those might be the diamonds i don't know i can't say because it just feels like herb when i'm when i'm busting them down but they have a c like shape so it's very uh suspect in that way but not yeah not a lot of passengers really you know i mean i've come across a couple here so far there's just so much freaking material in here and so let's break it down you know we're talking about what 150 bucks pre-tax um so that's a quarter so and i mean you've got a g of live resin so i'm not sure what that goes for concentrate wise um but yeah breaking it down by its components what is what are a couple weights maybe like uh 80 bucks you know let's say 48 yet each right and then you get a g of live risen whatever that runs so this really isn't too bad considering that they constructed it also and i mean i am kind of going by more store prices pre-tax etc but uh but yeah i i wouldn't say it's necessarily super overpriced because there is something to do with this construction but as you can see it's not free of defect you know i mean there are a couple and i mean it's just so much too i'm used to just going through one gram so this is seven times the amount of material that i'm used to going through and it's like i can see as i'm doing it there isn't too many but there are just little tiny pieces that are suspect it's got a good consistency though i've really got to give it to that because yeah i'm sure this would have smoked awesomely um just the way that it's got a mix of like really finely ground stuff and uh and really big chunks in here and it just smells so good yeah it really does have that classic og scent sweetness to it um like the lemony citrusy sweetness with that fuel in there yeah i can't wait to smoke this stuff but uh and i just brushed those stems back in there so i mean i'm not seeing anything crazy i'm not seeing any seeds you know i mean that was the question after seeing the video that was released not too long ago would we find any seeds there's nothing sticking out at me you know and i'm checking as you can see i'm checking all these little bits as i'm coming across them but i really don't think we're going to find anything but i just want to be sure because yeah you can only make this video once and i mean you know yeah i have to say this looks pretty decent i came across a couple stems but you know stuff like this here there's gonna be there we go there's another one over here so i can pick these out you know and there's probably going to be a bunch more of them you know not not a supreme amount because i you know otherwise i would just be doing it right now but as i go through it i'm sure i could find more of that we found that bigger stem so there are some stems in here just a little bit nothing crazy again especially when you consider the price point you know and the and the work that goes into making something like this now i don't know what kind of material they started with maybe they get a good deal on lowers or whatever you know but uh yeah can't really see anything to complain about in here um but i'm not finding those uh we're gonna weigh this out right now so it comes out to eight g's they must be in here i guess like but i'm not seeing what i would suspect are the live resin diamonds or whatever so anyway i'm getting a notice that my phone is getting hot so i better move along and get this weight off uh because this is again a really long video um so let's go ahead and get the scale going i'll move you guys over there here we go all righty and there it is and you can see that pretty good from right there so let me tear this out yeah i'm gonna try to corral all of this material in here it is again more than i've weighed out before so i'm hoping this all stays in here be cooperative here we go oh all right so there's some left on the paper coming up to 7.7 and i did there's a couple crumbs out here but not a whole lot so that is what the weight is coming up to you now if it's supposed to be not including the paper then so be it uh it's going to be kind of a pain to pull this paper off i think oh let me try it hold on i want to give it away just to see if it comes up to at least here we go here we go all right i'm throwing the paper into two so you"}
