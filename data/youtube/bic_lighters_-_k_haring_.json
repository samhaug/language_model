{"azau8pW2u5U": "what's up guys I'm the high-tech redneck back with another review for you guys right now we are going to go over some lighter technology now I believe I have found a Bic lighter killer that is right now we all know the old classic Bick this guy is rugged it is tough it has plenty of butane and it lights very reliably over and over and over until it runs out of fluid and then you throw it in a landfill and you leave it there for 10,000 years and you buy a dozen more because capitalism yay so for uh for the first you know 25 28 years of my life I stuck to big lighters as the gold standard in average everyday lighters but I uh I recently found some that are better but first let's go over some that are not better first of all we all know the average el cheapo lighter I happen to have these laying around for those of you who have no experience with these they are crap these metal tops fly off the wheels fly out the springs and the Flint's fly out of there pretty often they are not all that reliable they do function they run out of fluid much quicker than a Bic lighter will they don't have as much pressure in them as a big does and they uh yeah they're just altogether pretty crappy if I were to go on say a camping trip and it's gonna be like five below zero and I might have to rely on that to start a fire to save my life I'm not gonna carry one of these I'm gonna carry a bit but I am I decided then I wanted to try to find something better years and years ago because I'm always looking for something better so I thought I started seeing all of these disposable lighters that have refillable valves on them and they were electric so the Flint would never burn out and I thought man that's a great idea a lighter that lasts forever I wonder if that's actually any good so I bought a couple here's one that I have from back in my older excursions looking for good lighters and I still have this because it's such a piece of crap I won't carry it it functions it has fluid it does light but if you look in here you see that it sparks every time and it lights once out of every maybe five or ten we can sit here and strike on this all day long it's making the spark it has fluid there's nothing wrong with this lighter it should function but it's a piece of crap I mean the valve on it's great it refills great but it's just not reliable so frustrating hey I hate that thing I really hate using it so uh so yeah once I got past that I bought a few others and some of them had trouble with the valve where they did not take fuel properly some of them had trouble with the clicker where they did not like properly and some of them had trouble with both of those and I ended up throwing them all away except that guy which laid around in a drawer in my room for the last however many years and then and then I found this these are made by clipper these lighters are a or they are in electric lighter that is refillable they are very small and they are very very high quality they are cheaper than a Bic lighter this lighter and my local store is approximately two dollars and twenty five cents or something after tax which yes they do overcharge for their lighters there and this lighter is the dollar fifty nine which is significantly cheaper it is very much thinner than a Bic which is a good thing it fits in your pocket much better it does not look like a banana in your pocket there's one drawback to these small size and being very slim it is also shorter if you notice by a good degree and it just feels really good when you stick it in pockets and stuff but it does hold less fluid it holds a significantly lower amount of fluid but like if this bit say this big last you a month this guy may last you a week or a week and a half but it is refillable so you don't need it to hold that much I mean if you are gonna be away from your can of butane longer than a week bring two lighters or buy another can of butane it's not that expensive it's just a little more than a lighter for a can of butane that can last you a year so uh yeah these lighters are amazing and as you can see I have stocked up on them they come in these camo wraps and they also come in a solid color like the now there's a small very small difference the bottom caps are a little bit different the valve seems to be inset on the camo and not inset so much on the solid colors the subtler color one seems a bit thicker and just I mean almost identical specs but slightly different parts that they're made from probably separate factories they're made in a separate countries or something but they are just as reliable the valves on these are equally as good equally as reliable I've refilled probably 20 of these lighters including my own and lots of them that I've done for friends around the neighborhood when they've bought theirs they are very easily refillable you do have to know how to purge a lighter anytime you use an electric lighter you need to know how to purge it properly in order to refill it because after 10 20 refills it will become a pain so this is my original clipper lighter I rip the camo wrap off of it and I've got a beautiful clear lighter where I can see all my fluid see when I refill it and all that I have ruined this lighter I uh I took it apart to tinker with it just because I'm an idiot and I can't leave well enough alone this lighter was perfect for over two months I carried it used it every day it was perfect and I decided one night that I wanted to raise the flame up just to tinker with it and I took it apart and I messed with the valve and I realized that this valve does not work in the way that it works on these cheap lighters when you adjust the valve on these cheap lighters you you can adjust the flame height make it very big on this one when you adjust the valve you just mess up the way everything is finely tuned and the flame gets smaller no matter which way you twist it it's a bad idea don't do it just leave it like it is the lighters great as you can see the lighter still it's still perfectly functional there's nothing really that wrong with it but if I try to light it quickly because inside of here at the top of the valve that's a very small spring that's very tightly wound and the gas flows through that spring as if it were a tube the spring in this ladder got bent when I took it apart and it left a gap in the side of that tube and now the gas flows out of the side of the tube as well as up out of the top and it just messes up things in general and now the lighter only lights the first time or if you wait a few seconds in between it's very reliably but if you try to rush it it does not like when you rush it so yeah that's that's what you get for being stupid and tinkering with something that does not need to be tinkered with these lighters on the other hand are extremely reliable they are more reliable or as reliable as a big lighter if you like 120 times it will like 19 out of the 20 almost guaranteed it is very likely that I could do this all day and it would not fail many times these are very well tuned lighters and even after months of use this other lighter was still that consistent until I screwed it up by tinkering with it so yeah these lighters right here are absolutely amazing they are very high value the plastic on these lighters they're made out of is a very thick solid plastic they can take a drop I've dropped these and banged it around they do not fall apart easily if they do fall apart like when I take it apart on purpose you can put it back together and it's still very solid very rugged I cannot complain about this this slider right here lasted me months before I broke it on purpose essentially and these lighters here may last me a year or five years or no telling how long before I lose them because I have not seen one break yet I've heard of only one of these that ever failed and it was someone who slammed it extremely hard with like full [ __ ] strength down against the concrete and broke the plastic but of course that happens with any lighter when you throw it hard enough one small drawback to this slider it is not quiet being an electric lighter there is a significant click when you strike it but I mean if you're a hunter and you're trying to stay extremely silent and maybe a problem but in any other situation I think that's gonna be perfectly fine for you unless noise is a major major issue and you have to be extra quiet so yeah it's a it's a great profile of the lighter it carries well it's extremely reliable refilling is great I personally refilled this slider right here about 20 times and I've had zero problems from the valve in fact it's actually fun to refill it and just play with it I would refill that almost daily for a while there just because it was fun to do and I would do it while I was thinking about it and as far as I'm concerned these lighters are now officially the best disposable lighter I've ever seen because they can theoretically last for years upon years and these big lighters as good as they are have been dethroned I'm the high-tech redneck later", "5HDepjPFwlY": "all right hey guys welcome into my video today I got a brand new video that has to do with some art history I like doing some art history at you guys this is one of my favorite favorite artists it is Keith Haring's kind of figures holding up a heart one of my favorite favorite pieces and favorite artists I'm gonna kind of just show you the project itself and then you can take it kind of where you want off I'll show you a couple different examples and ideas from him that I think preciate on there so I'm gonna start it off with going step by step there's gonna be a central heart that is probably about the size of my hand and then there's gonna be two figures down here kind of holding it up so that's just a general idea of where we're going with this so I'm gonna start almost like symmetrical how both sides are gonna be the same so I'm gonna go kind of from one side to the other and bounce back and forth so it kind of fits all evenly sometimes I like to do that with my works so I'm gonna start with a longer kind of curve and then a shorter one and then on this side a shorter one with a longer one and I try to get really like quick with some of my movements because with his work that he did he worked really real um sometimes he had to it I'll explain that little later in the video why he had to move so I put on this line it'll go out to the side this one out to this side so kind of both going towards each other this one you can bring up this one also maybe extend a little bit more over and this one also bring up so they kind of meet towards each other there you go you'll get the idea of how those are kind of holding up the center I'm gonna go to the outside I'm going a line going up this one a line going up also there you go so those are gonna be the arms holding it up see if we can go I'm gonna get his hands are really almost like I fist kind of like that outside fist kind of shape so all of his figures are very very similar to each other they look like they're all from the same kind of artist which is very recognizable for him so kind of like a round part of this side and you could do the same thing actually yeah let's go on to this one the same thing over here what kind of that fist shape and then a line going down line going down to here so that's kind of one set of the arm let's go over to here this one will go over this one will go over here okay I like it and then let's get that kind of fist shape again so it kind of curved this one also kind of curve in there and it definitely takes some getting used to doing some of these quick drawings in a darker I recommend doing it a little bit lighter first and then going over a little darker usually but that's okay that's a good practice or skill to kind of train yourself on working quickly and still having control over the tool that you're using which I'm just using a pencil and then from here I'm gonna do a line going down and this line going down also okay so you can kind of see the arms out here now we got the head that's gonna be in the middle shape line going over and then this line going over as well this one similar over and then this one over alright then we got his head it's almost like a kind of upside down you bring this over a little bit more what kind of matches up and then just like that yeah the same thing over here just like that awesome I like it so I got two figures down here those are kind of his trademark figures that he puts in a lot of his works and now we got the heart-shaped so I definitely want my middle of my heart so almost like my V to be in the middle here so you can put a little notch there that might help you a little bit and for my younger kids when they do a heart shape I always kind of tell them it's almost like that kind of V and one side will curl around to this way if you want to get close to this hand we can actually start with that hand and then you know that it'll go close on this side it'll bump right into his arm here so a big giant curve over here notice how I started that one off lightly and then this one over here gives a little bit of gap on this side a little bit of space in there and then it also meets up right there okay and then I'm gonna have it connected right down here [Music] down there okay so I got my shape on here one thing that he always had is some squirt of motion lines which gives the kind of the appearance of something moving and woman in his work which I really really like so he has kind of these dashed lines so I'm gonna do one on here one on this side and then two over here maybe I'll throw three on here doesn't matter they don't know I'll have to be even maybe four over there you can see I'm kind of spreading them out maybe a longer one and a shorter one shorter one and a longer one and then I'll finish the rest out real quick awesome I like that I'm gonna go over it with sharpie real quick and then do a little border or a frame around the whole thing okay so there it is in sharpie outline definitely looks like it has a little bit more pop to it I use the thicker sharpie to make it go through a little bit better and again to have that more kind of thickness and kind of Keith Haring inspired from this you can really take this project wherever you want certain kids in certain classes I'll do different things with I think for this one I'm gonna paint this kind of middle part with my temper cake paints I think that'll fill in this really nice and then I might do with the background in a different color but I've seen different Valentine's Day projects for stuff like this or different kind of themes where you can write different kind of mantras or words kind of in the middle because he stood for a lot of different kind of phrases kind of had love or peace or hope you could have different words or lettering and definitely some different options for this project but I think this picture itself along with many many other Keith Haring inspired artworks is a good thing for element kids to work with just because of the simple shapes in there it is they got it all finished up got it with the paint and then outlined a little bit more with sharpie just to kind of clean up some of those lines and through his signature in the middle cuz I'm a big fan of his I love a signature I love you know so definitely

since the 1970s and contrary to popular belief these days these are known as the premium lighters over the cheaper lighters but these were actually sold and as a cheap alternative in the 70s - what lighters were available and what is also interesting is the retail prices around the dollar 50 in the 1970s and that's about the same price as they are today never like these stickers you know try to slowly peel them off you can usually get them apart so these lighters are made in France they're manufactured in the United States and I'm not sure what other countries that they're made in they used to actually ship them back and forth to some of the French made ones will be in the United States and some of the US ones would be put you know elsewhere around the world apparently these are sold in 160 countries we can see that these are if I can get it in just the right light us-made so for a long time they were manually adjusting they just had a gear wheel and for at least a while they were collectible I don't know if they still are and then they invented the automatic adjusting valve which actually worked pretty well and they've been like that for ever since the big deal about the Bick was the 3,000 lights of course the number lights is variable but one deal is BIC does put in a really extra-long Flint the Flint is much longer than the amount of fuel that's put in them as far as the fuel they actually have a special nozzle that fills it up and then it has actually like a nozzle and a little probe inside the nozzle so it fills it up and then it jams a ball-bearing in there so that's why they're not really refillable you can refill them but it's it's kind of some weird hacks but nonetheless that's how they are so besides the sticker they have the child safety which is a spring steel spring that just makes it more difficult to operate the wheel many times I use the lighters for like shrink tubing is they for some reason have made it I mean it's a pretty effective child safety but it's really easy to just pop that little thing out and then it works like a normal lighter these are great to have in a first-aid kit an emergency kit they're a very effective and reliable way to start a fire that's the purpose but they can be used for shrink tubing and even a little tip is if you put the shrink tubing in the orange part of the flame you get this charring but if you put the shrink tube in the blue part of the flame like so you don't get any charring so that's one of these secrets of using a lighter force shrink tubing and it works pretty well so let me go and knock one down just for the heck of it here they're actually pretty easy to take apart I just use a pic here and you just want to get the little steel cover off actually let me zoom in here we are just get this a little cover off it's actually a pretty rigid these big gliders have they're a very strong design with a Center Ridge I believe they're made out of polycarbonate definitely a pretty tough design there's some really cheap lighters that just aren't very safe this one's definitely had quite a bit of use and we'll just go and pop the wheel out even if they seem empty there's always a little bit of gas in there so you have to be careful that will go and drop out the Flint and you can see how long the spring is it is a super duper long spring it's almost 2 inches almost 2 inches long it's pretty surprising and this lighter is nearly empty and there's still quite a big piece of Flint in there of course the thumbwheel is diecast zinc it's actually two-piece there's the solid piece then there's a little pressed on collar this is a wild piece of carbon steel with ridges it's basically like a little file that's wrapped around like a spring they slide that over that cast piece of zinc and then they press on the other side of the wheel so that's how they make the wheel and then what we have left is our valve and our thumb switch let me go ahead and pull those well I can see some of the things even versus the early auto automatically adjusting ones is now the valve is actually just press fit into the plastic so it makes it smaller and you and cheaper and the other thing is there's these two little notches here so when they put on the thumb the valve it actually is crimped around the edge so I suppose it's actually pretty good because it makes it nice and reliable but you can't really disassemble them but we do see that it is a plastic switch but then at least a metal cast zinc lever in there so one of the things that makes them reliable and be able to sustain being dropped anyway I figured I'd do a review of these um bic wouldest bit gliders they have their mini ones and you know some other variations that they have all these different colors and all these that are shrink wrapped it's actually kind of surprising apparently some of the numbers are pretty crazy around thirty-five billion sold obviously a lot less people smoke and do that kind of stuff so a lot less lighters are sold now than they used to be and there's like a Bic lighter app for people who go to concerts because not very many people actually have lighters i doing they may not even allow on the concerts anymore so i think that's a bit hilarious but nonetheless at one point at least they used to sell 5 million plus of these things every single day pretty wild anyway i really

very dangerous pocket lighters are dangerous products if not designed or manufactured properly a pocket lighter can be dangerous the majority of pocket lighter models do not conform with these standards all big pocket lighters meet or exceed all applicable laws and standards worldwide at BIC we manufacture the best lighters in terms of quality and safety how first thanks to our unique manufacturing process big pocket lighters are produced in big factories in France and Spain giving us the full control over the production every big lighter undergoes more than 50 individual automatic quality and security checks before leaving the factory we also use the best raw materials our lighters are filled with pure isobutane ensuring a stable flame height without any spitting and sputtering the bic lighter is made of Delrin this material ensures a high resistance to impact to elevated temperatures and pressure it is so resistant that it is used to manufacture security seat belts this material has a specific molecular structure which cannot be transparent on average a big maxi lighter contains up to 3000 lights that's up to two times more lights than other flint lighters of the same format this dedication to quality and safety makes us the number one pocket lighter brand in the world Vic our quality your safety", "FtCd_k9GNAs": "I'd like a lighter please take your pick you might think all lighters are the same but they're not many lighters don't undergo proper safety testing which can lead to unpredictable flame heights or worse that's why you should always choose a BEC each bic lighter undergoes more than 50 automatic quality and safety checks bic safety you can count on", "ztoo20Vr8p8": "I welcome back to burning river bushcraft today we're gonna be making a distraction error device from an ordinary bic lighter so I would categorize this as an urban survival skill this is going to use up a resource that's pretty precious this is going to be using a Bic lighter and this will be of no use to anyone when we're done with it setting a distraction and a device like this it's got a lot of different uses kind of use your imagination with it a lot of situations where you might want to draw attention to a certain area so you can egress to another point also be a pretty good signalling device but use caution and use a little bit of common sense and I'll show you how to get it done ok so to get this done today we're gonna be using a Bic lighter this one's brand new unmodified we're gonna be using tape any type of tape work for this I happen to have Gorilla Tape and some type of multi-tool you could use your knife but you're primarily just gonna be prying with it so you're best off conserving your blade and using a screwdriver or something so first thing we're gonna do is this is the child safety latch on the lighter we're gonna get rid of that okay so now we have a better lighter now this windshield we're gonna get rid of this also so I I did dislodge the wheel a little bit probably the best way to go about this with a can opener on a multi-tool or Swiss Army knife I seem to be able to lock it in pretty well and just bend it out of the way alright so here's the inner workings of the lair still 100% functional so harder to keep it lit in the wind but there we go all the good parts are still here and now we're gonna be utilizing the tape so behind me here I have a pallet with some upright boards in it or I keep firewood I'm gonna be taping this to the board's now why you want something flat like this is for a couple different reasons that's going to magnify the noise and magnify any of the blasts and put it in a specific direction so this could be a tree it could be a fence could be a door but remember the trees a perfect example if you've got it on you know this side of the tree the blast and the noise is gonna be amplified this direction so anybody that's looking for that noise is going to be going in that direction which means you're gonna get to escape in that direction okay so with a small piece of tape I'm gonna light the lighter and tape the button down so you can see with this button taped down this thing's gonna burn till it runs out of fuel so what I'm gonna do now is actually turn it upside down and I'm gonna tape it so what kind of obvious I wasn't real eager to stand next to it when I flipped it upside down now it's a time thing it's got to melt through the lighter itself you can see here the pieces that flew off of it and you know it left a little black mark where this was taped a little bit of residue from the lighter honestly I can't tell you if the residue on the board is from the burning duct tape or the exploding lighter but either way it's a it's a terrible waste of a resource but it's really cool you spend a dollar and you get to blow something up so this is not something to play with obviously somebody could get hurt with a situation like this so this would be for a dire circumstances only but in a pinch you know if you are looking for an escape from a urban survival situation you know a lighter and a little bit of duct tape will definitely attract someone's attention and let you go another direction until next time this has been Jamey Boggs with burning river bushcraft see you next time", "lK6FSj6Ve8U": "what's up guys how y'all doing for today's video we're going to put to the test big light of God G so we're searching through the internet and I come across quite a few just the big lighter gadgets you know they feel about lighter gadgets a little bit better than cheap stuff out here and I start doing a little bit of a research and I'm in quite a few new lighter gadgets that I haven't put to the test so I thought you're probably going to enjoy that video let's see what they got so you got here mini big lighter and it's pretty boring really small well guess what they actually sell a lot Ashman buy big as well so same company and this one is for the mini so you put your mini big lighter into here and it clicks in and it becomes so it's a little holder for your mini big lighter makes your boy and chip lighter into really cool lighter I like it also if you drop it it's going to protect it a little bit guess what I got something even cooler looks like a Zippo lighter right boom if you opened up if just empty and then you put in your mini lighter now and it becomes look like a Zippo lighter except boom it's just a mini big lighter but it masks it into this amazing super cool lighter and this gadget it also made by big you see the symbol said there that's so cool so once again makes your boy and lighter look like it's expensive lighter great idea this holder a little bit more useful let's put it - oh wait there's extra wire it comes with take that out first of all it looks really cool you can light it up start a fire a boom but at the same time you have this little code you can twine and actually hold it over like this and assume that slides up you can use this squad to start a fire so that way you're not wasting all your gas how cool of ideas there is and this is looks like a some kind of walks so it's billionaire a little slowly so that way you have a very long time to start the fire without wasting much gas look how well it's building too and if you want to up at bad just put it back it sticks together I will love this gadget first of all it looks amazing and there is a great purpose for survival situation as well and then another attachment side here I found it on Amazon it's all about make your cheap lighter look like a lot more expensive I guess ok let's see if it's going to fit put it all the way in and once again once you push it all the way in your boy and lighter turn into this cool lighter check this out I took of this metal part so that way it fits better and this is what it's going to look like and all you have to do is just feel it from here so they already established a hole inside there so that way you don't even have to take out your big lighter looks so much better don't you think for the next gadget I already put this one to the test before but I wanted to include into this list again for those people who haven't seen it this is another case folder but this is a survival kind a waterproof get yourself a girl a big lighter it works and then all you have to do is put it two into this plastic case and then you close it like this and boom it becomes waterproof lighter you can put a little cord on it so that way you can hook it up to a backpack or some so that way whenever you need the lighter to start a fire all you have to do is pop this open light it start a fire whatever you have to do and then you can close it so that way it's not going to get wet and get owned I will love this gadget a lot probably one of my favorite ones and my most favorite lighter gadget is one of this by far I have been using it so much for I don't know cutting stains or especially open up boxes or packages so what you do same thing stick your big lighter and to here boom slides into the wall still you can light it very easily who lights no problem but let me show you right here there's a little knife boom flip knife and it's such a high quality knife to open packages look how easy that is just be careful when you use a knife don't cut yourself obviously and if you need to cut the paper like this no big deal all the way to really really thick packaging and it cuts it so well I always use it as a box cutter to close it all you have to do is push it this way and close it all the way and if you need to pull it out once again boom 'lord simple but really it was high quality and it's amazing because at the same time it's a lighter - this is also perfect and survival station you got fire and you got a lab knife who knows what you can use it for knife is a very very good tool and there is couple more mini lighter attachments all we have to do it just put it - it locks in oh this lighter burnt out same thing right here boom so make sure tiny leo lighter much bigger but at the same time a little cooler I guess and for the next big lighter gadget we got here lighter Bowl let's open God see what's all about you got your big lighter and check this out it is perfect fit boom I like this blood big lighter so that way it's matches together is it delighted it's not on the way but then if you need a knife boom you got yourself a knife and then you can open packages like this you know super annoying to open packages like that all the time and what else they got here on this side let's pop this open nice you got yourself a little scissors definitely looks cool and makes you lighter a lot better and if you light up bags all you have to do is just take off the lighter and put a new one that's it and for the next gadget I really love this one as well this one is for the mini big lighter what you're going to do is get your big lighter and stick it to all the way in boom and what it is is a little clip so now that way you can clip it onto your backpack any way you would like on your belt jims so that way it's over Hindi you can just unclip it take it off and it's sits in a really really tight it's not going to come out really easily if I need to take it off look how much force I have to use to take it off there you go that's an amazing clip for sure love this one a lot well guys that's pretty much it let me know in comments below which Gajic was your favorite don't forget to thumbs up this video subscribe and I'll see you next time", "9ZaFnSNXO1E": "[Music] big gliders last longer i should have got one of the mini ones for this oh geez still got a ton it's up past where i was i thought it should have been should have been empty got a drill or something [Music] out there there we go oh yes i got her that time so i've taken it upon uh myself as a personal challenge to see if i can get a fire going today um with a dead lighter i always carry a big light in my pocket but what happens if all of the fuel is gone is it still possible to get a fire with that tiny little ferrocerium rod basically that we've got going on there i don't know i've never done it before and i thought today is just about the worst possible conditions to try to get this done so so if i can do it today with a dead lighter i can make it happen pretty much anywhere so that's what we're that's the mission for today dead lighter fire the problem is going to be finding dry tender of any kind and when i'm using this tiny tiny striker that tiny ferro rod that's on the bic lighter i'm gonna need to find the finest driest tender imaginable otherwise it's just not gonna work and what i'm looking at is these little seed heads here and if i'm very delicate with them i might be able to gather them up and see how fine and fuzzy and fluffy that is hopefully we can focus in on that right there and my hands are a little bit cold but it feels dry to me this would be probably ideal for what i'm trying to do but it is wet really wet try the uh the blonde watch out here yeah even if it's wet you might be able to yeah maybe this stuff here maybe is pretty damp but maybe if i pluck it walk around with it for a bit while i'm searching for everything else i can get it to dry out a smidge these are reasonably dry dead pine needles that are still attached to the branches and up off of the ground anything on the ground right now is not going to work at least not now it'd take a while to dry it out this stuff is de it's damp but may be doable now i'm just going to be looking for some tulip poplar strip off the inner bark of the tulip popper make myself a bird's nest and hopefully i can find something that's reasonably dry so this is the jackpot right here feels really dry well driest that we found so far because it's been way up high off of the ground and it's already processed out for me by the wind it looks like a little bit so that's a good that's a good thing and that's going to be yeah that feels pretty dry and this right here is probably enough to make my tinder bundle which is great so you can see the difference in color between these two um this blondish color is much much better it's drier it's still got some fibrous fibrosity that's that's another word that i'm gonna go with it's got some fibrosity to it this stuff here is wet it's darker in color it's a little bit more decayed but it could probably still still work it would just need more processing and more time to dry out it wouldn't be a deal breaker but that like chocolatey kind of dark color just means it's been on that it's been there a lot longer dead a lot longer not that we couldn't get to work but for right now fire it's not going to work so in this area the white pine in my opinion is the go-to fire tree for a couple different reasons one the dead branches on the bottom like this especially the ones where they've kind of turned that whitish color and they the bark has fallen off are really really dry and they will light up really quick with any kind of open flame as long as we can get the open flame the other reason i really like the white pine well besides being perfect stuff for um a primitive fire friction fire bow drill is this sap that collects at the base of the branches any place where a tree's been damaged or sometimes not even doesn't have to be damaged just has to have a a place for the sap to leak out this is kind of ideal stuff right here and i would call this a flame extender because it's got see that squishiness i can stick my finger in it it's got it's solid but yet it's not runny like sap but it's got that squishiness to it and if i add that to a tinder bundle add that to my kindling and i get this lit on fire that will burn for a long long long time and it will dry out anything that i put on my fire so if i could collect this stuff hopefully not get my hands crazy sticky another benefit of that is adding it to the shaft of your uh spindle when you're doing a hand drill fire it gives you traction that's right you know your hands get slippy sometimes i will use that uh myrrh and crittenden taught me that [Applause] so this tender is pretty damp i can feel it it's dampness but as i do this and i rub it against itself and against my hands it it's warming up that friction is creating some heat and it's drying it out just by working it and it's making it finer and with this kind of fire that we're talking about here the finer the better i mean it's light and as fuzzy as i can make that the more gooder and all of this right here i'm collecting on my vest and that see how light and fuzzy that is that might be enough i might be able to light that um with the bic but we're gonna find out here real soon that stuff's perfect that's really really good stuff and it's pretty dry as dry as anything out here look at that really fibrous this would make the good cordage too if i wanted to make cordage out here well i'll show you real quick i just twist it twist the fibers up turn it over itself like so and then just continue that process twist away from me and towards me away from me and towards me away from me and towards me and pretty soon you get strang and here and these parts i can't think of cordage that's i can't think of anything that would make stronger quarters than tulip poplar bark that grows naturally here alan do you know what anything better well animal hides obviously but well there is yucca but it's not it doesn't grow native here right rarely usually it's in cemeteries no home sites and stuff like that poplar bark is definitely plentiful anywhere in the mountains yeah but this is pretty strong cordage and it's in the blondes condition if it was too far gone and started to turn that brownish chocolatey color it wouldn't be as strong but this stuff as is is pretty pretty stout string right there just on feel alone this one's the best right here that one's a little bit damper than this one so maybe first second third and i put this one on top and this stuff when i create my bird's nest this is what i'm gonna do i guess i could go ahead and make some of that happen but i'm gonna create a bird's nest literally something that looks like a bird's nest something a bird would want to live in and then this really good dry dust that was a result of processing the tinder down that is gonna go in the middle and see how light fluffy that is so we've got our dead lighter nothing this puppy's not going to light i drilled a hole through the bottom so all the fuel is gone all right so i've got some really fuzzy stuff sticking out right here really fine little tender if i can get that to light don't know yep all right so that's not working that's all right seed heads down see if i can get them to light up those are pretty fuzzy and all i need is a tiny little flame if i could get this to give me a little bit of flame it'll light the rest all right so it's not it's not happening i'm not getting flame like i was hoping for off of this tiny tiny little ferro rod here inside the lighter so i wonder if i could without breaking it remove this metal piece off the front of the lighter oh yeah like that looks more promising to me it's tough getting it close enough getting it close enough without screwing it all up that's as fine as we can get it what else could i do let me take a break so this cat tail the seeds in it are in the bajillions and as you spin it you can see them opening up and look at that pretty incredible how many seeds there are in one cattail head and that is as light and as dry and as fluffy of a tender that is imaginable if this doesn't work i don't know what we'll do we'll go to plan c let's give it a shot at that hopefully that's on camera we got fire we had fire but we're not out of the woods yet here we go here we go look at that well son of a gun buddy winners find a way winners find a way you know most people would have quit with the really fine tinder yeah because i thought for sure i i thought that was going to work i thought our um are really processed down um poplar tinder was going to work but it did not what moisture i think was the issue yeah in that and what was going to be our next course of action if the cattail didn't work was i was going to dissect a what's gonna sector cartridge here see if i can get some powder out and see if that works that's gonna be a separate video i think just to see if we can make that happen but but with a dead lighter with zero fuel in it i've got a good one in my pocket because i'm not stupid but i've got a with a dead lighter removing the the shroud off the front i think was was a really helpful tip something that we should definitely keep in mind is removing the metal shroud but that tiny little spark with the right tender it's got to be the finest driest fluffiest tinder and the cattail was it this stuff right here that is as fine of a tender as you can possibly get that just drives home you know the mindset thing never quit yeah never give up figure out a way like you know this i knew that there was spark here and i knew that if i just figured it out and i have that concept of of tender if i have that the finer the better if that concept of dry two ideas that really were pivotal is one we said hey let's take that shroud off and see if they give us a better spark and then we kept trying different tenders yeah exactly yep and that we got fire with a dead lighter yep and i might add a very wet you know we've had snow laying on the ground here for what four days yeah pretty pretty high humidity it's cold out snow is everywhere ground is wet everything's pretty much wet you can see the our tender bundle isn't really even burning up that well because of how wet it is all that moisture in it see it's smoking a ton it's not like it's just poof and it's gone because yeah normally like with a friction fire and an optimal bundle that would have already been gone pretty much yeah but our kindling's on fire yep tinder's still here so that is a successful fire yeah well done another plan well executed well i think that that's the that's the biggest thing to take away from this i i was not going to give up on this no matter what that's just kind of my personalities i don't i don't uh winners find a way and i'm not gonna give up trying until it's just you know it's you you've exhausted all efforts and even then you can usually come up with something else we had ammunition we could have lit yeah i was going to tear apart a tear apart of a nine millimeter round and get to the powder and see if i could get that to light up that didn't work we could have defaulted to a bow drill yep because we had good tinder we just didn't have the thing that would transfer to that initial flame absolutely yeah if that fails we go to the nearest trailer park you steal some gas there you go that's right that's where you fart on it but the but that uh but with that along those same lines that's the the importance of if you're going into a woodland environment something that's a little bit more off the beaten path you should take definitely more than one way to start a fire because that one lighter that you have could easily not work uh the difference between having a lighter with a flame yeah and one that's just a spark source yep how long would you say you worked on that uh i'd say a total two to two to three hours maybe and if you had a flame yeah ten minutes yeah yeah less than 10 with with a lighter that worked i could have had a fire i would say under five i would have had that success right there um i could have skipped a lot of the steps i wouldn't have to process the tinder as finely and as carefully but without that tiny little ferro rod that's in the lighter you've got to be re every little detail matters but that's why i carry i'll show you what i carry i carry a bic lighter a functional bic lighter this is not the functional one functional bic lighter in my pocket and every morning when i put this in my pocket i shake it just to confirm it's got fluid still left in it and then attached to my belt right here on a lanyard so i cannot lose it it's on my belt i've got a nice long five or six inch ferro rod right here and this with this and that tender model that i had without question i would have had a fire so even if my lighter my primary source of flame was to you know take a crap on me this will work but anyway i really appreciate you watching guys thanks for stopping in hit the thumbs up subscribe if you haven't already and we'll see you next time you", "dL2XNR-NNfg": "okay so have you ever wanted to know which lighter will last longer a disposable bic lighter or a refillable Zippo well then stay tuned okay guys so I just got done filming bic lighter vs. Zippo now the big lighter a lot of people don't like it the main disadvantages are this is not an airtight seal nothing about this is airtight which means the butane or the lighter fluid I believe is it's this stuff here on a full tank this runs for 21 minutes now in the video I just left the wick as is I know there's ways to get in there and clip it down or push it down there's ways to pull it up you know I left it as is um so you're talking about a big flame some people might complain that the test wasn't fair and all that stuff um it's - out of the box reviews okay so it's a brand new bic lighter and it's um this a lighter unit here is actually brand new it's phone bone-dry I believe at least it died um 21 minutes though so before I released the runtime of the pic lighter just think about that 21 minutes yeah you can see oh wait a minute crap I'm gonna have to go back going after you do that test no I'm just kidding um it died that was just some that was just luck of the draw just happened light but 21 minutes let me light that light this start the timer and then get a better hold on this so we are at the 10-minute mark and the BIC did not run out but I'm kind of concerned about this Zippo here yeah let me start that let me start that and we will resume okay you can see that we are at exactly 20 minutes and it's funny at the 10 minute mark this happened with the Zippo it the fuel third coming up around here and it made a ring a fire plus in the center so I blew it out let them both cool off and again almost exactly at the 10-minute mark or actually a little bit before from when I started again because we're at 20 now so at about the nine and a half minute mark that same exact thing happen again like right the very exact second okay so we are back let's see how did I do this last time I believe I started that one started that one and start started the timer so as you can see on camera are the the Zippo is the Zippo is still going still going still going it does it doesn't look lit but there's a small blue flame and let's get to 21 come on 21 10 more seconds 10 more 5 more and 21 whoo it's still going should I blow it out or should I let it die out it's very low okay it just died right at 20 21 33 it died you so after 50 minutes of runtime the big lighter beat my a TD my a TD start is set in I'm like ma'am how much longer is this going to last so I quit yes I quit after 50 minutes um 15 minutes and 33 seconds it still lights when you shake it there's a very small amount of fuel but it's still like 50 minutes guys 50 minutes of constant use now put that into context say use this for 6 seconds to start a fire 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 seconds in 1 minute that's 10 lights right 10 fires if you're this expert guy that can start a fire with fairy rod or bulge or whatever so in one minute so in one minute use you can start 10 fires I believe this will run for 60 minutes I ran it for 50 minutes and it still has some fuel I think it could run for another 10 minutes um okay 50 50 60 minutes if you use this for 6 seconds in one minute you can start 10 fires in 60 minutes you can start 600 fires maybe for some of you guys that watch that video and I'm colorblind but this pick lighter out on a degree in hunter green I I'm not sure it looks a hunter green it's dark and it has this label right here so in the beginning of this video I said this was a brand new lighter and it was but before I ran my runtime test this is the same lighter that I had soaking for 10 minutes in a cup of water yesterday I let it dry out overnight and then I and I did you know in that video I did flick it a couple times but so it was Road it wasn't like 99% new before I started this test and it ran for 50 minutes and there's still fuel in it now some people will say well every time you flick it it wears down the Flint and that's a valid point but I mean it's kind of like how many licks to get to the center of a sucker type thing a lollipop if I'm not going to sit here where are my thumbs and do this for five hundred times six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen ships okay I was trying to count I I just flicked this like 150 times backed back and probably count up another 50 times I have within the past couple days doing both the tests okay it's running on fumes literally the the roller bar is not worn out and it even has that very safe safety thing so all in all I want to dispel the whole myth about feral rods being the most reliable fire they're one way of starting fires matches are one way Vic lighters and Zippo lighters are one way they all have pros and cons but whenever I hear anybody say well always pack a Ferro rod in your survival kit or any time I don't ever go into the woods without a Ferro rod and all that stuff they think they're packing a useful survival tool what they're really packing is false confidence so all these internet bushcraft II people out there they're like well um you can start a fire in any condition with fur habla because oh have you done that before no it's because I saw Dave Canterbury do it this want to piss a lot of people out I would feel more confident carrying this into the woods and then if error on um they're both like carrying both carry two lighters carry two whatever but all these people are under this false illusion because a YouTube the internet Knollys like fanboy type forums stuff like that that these fair odds are just this magic gift from God that you can start a million fires they never run out no it's a disposable tool just like a lighter here I might roll in some pictures but I've broken fair odds before they were smaller diameter but they're not they break and can you still use it yeah you're working with like a one-inch nub so you can use it it's not that effective I don't even know how I'm going to edit this video out but you like this video make sure to leave a big thumbs up you know if you have comments you know please try and be respectful of all that stuff if you know you're just speaking up your ass and all that stuff I'll probably remove your comments and you'll get a laugh you know but I'll have the last laugh um feel free to give this video a thumbs down if you think what I did stupid and if you did learn anything from this video if you haven't already subscribed to my channel for more gear testing and videos like such", "QZSrwaIjQcY": "hey what's going on guys well onto a video on this bic lighter here I have a lot of people send messages and asking about it and talking about a little bit when I did my EDC update just because they're interested in the cigar band that was on there so there's a really cool way to kind of decorate or enhance the looks of your BIC anyone who buys big lighters know that there is probably hundreds if not thousands of different designs so they have on Bix which is pretty cool everything from like a thumbs up to a preface to words slogans I had one a had a pickle on it on the front and it's just to represent people's different styles you know I mean you so you get something that fits your style or of course the classic big letters which are just solid colors but there's a cool way especially I mean most obviously for cigar smokers is to be a cool little addition especially if you're using the BIC to light your cigars it's a little pizazz definitely something to talk about but the big question people had was hey what ring size fits a bit lighter which I should have mentioned in the first time first video when I was talking a little bit but essentially it is a 50 ring gauge that fits perfectly snug onto a big lighter but there's a caveat they're not all 50 ring gauge cigar will work ok so first off I started with this Rocky Patel which was absolutely perfect ok slipped on it was nice and snug it's very hard to move so it's not going to it's not going to go anywhere then after that one I put on this San Miguel because I had a cool little design which I probably take off just because it leaves a gap because it's not you know even all the way around it's not a huge deal or anything but I like the way this looks on the front here but you could see that the San Miguel although also a 50 ring gauge is looser on this lighter than the Rocky Patel and then most recently actually this morning I had smoked a Arturo for one day it was a short story Hemingway and Maduro which I believe is technically a four by forty nine so it's a forty nine ring gauge but the problem with that cigar is that it tapers quite a bit it's very unique shape so like you know the bottom here towards you know where you would be smoking it or the end you're putting in your mouth basically is a little bit smaller so this is perfect but the bottom you know it flares out a little bit not because the paper flares out but because because the cigar is tapered and the label or the band is totally straight when they wrap together it's just you know it's a little bit slanted so you can see that slant right there and you can see that I just kind of pinch this over and fold it down so if you love a tighter alright so when using the slider these aren't gonna fall off or anything you know I mean but they do slide a little bit so I'm gonna take this off alright to give you another example though this is a cigar band from a Gurkha ninja okay a knife size which I believe is a regular reboost oh it's five by fifty and even though this is a fifty ring gauge this is a little bit too big for this this later so you can see actually it's easier for a star from the top here alright as I slide this over you can see it's big enough has enough slack in it to go completely over the lighter doesn't get caught up on this other one mmm actually starting to lift up a little bit here yeah anyway you guys get the idea it's too big to be tight on the the lighter here okay so that's not going to work now even though it's a fifty ring gauge that fits the lighter not all cigar bands are going to be exactly the same in that when they you know fold this over and it gets glued maybe one's a little bit tighter than the other you know there's very minut differences so you know I'm using fifty ring gauge as a reference to about what's going to fit but doesn't mean all fifty ring ages ago fit like this one's a little bit too loose now when I smoke a cigar what I generally try to do it does it's not always possible because sometimes the glue that they use if it's not self-adhesive the glue might stick a little bit to the actual cigar leaf or the wrapper and of course in that point you don't want to be tugging on any things and you'll just ruin the cigar but uh often times I'm able to slip the cigar band off the cigar before I'm done smoking it okay especially once it starts getting closer to that area generally speaking that the cigar will heat up a little bit would be a little bit warm and a little bit squishier so you can maneuver that ring off without damaging the wrapper so most of my cigar bands they have in this case you could see a tiny bit of wrapper actually stuck to it but I'm still able to you know finish the cigar just fine so these rappers are still glued together totally unnecessary it's just something I happen to do but obviously if it's unglued you can use a larger size ring gauge so if you have anything from a 50 ring gauge up you can just you know wrap it around and drop a new piece of glue on there or you can actually glue it to the lighter I see my cigar band so when I'm done with this later instead of fluid I'll just slip these off and put it back in my little collection I saved every single cigar band from every cigar I've ever smoked in my entire life okay why I don't know because I'm weird like that I have you know you know my hobbies into my collector that's in me you know I mean it's deeply rooted in my personality to collecting things and it's cool to be able to back and see literally every cigar I've ever smoked in my life so um yeah it's interesting well I say cigar I should say premium cigar because as a kid there were plenty of like white owls and you know tiparillo that I've smoked occasionally but anyway and you say any cigars actually had a band on it I've saved so yeah just a cool little idea but like I said it doesn't have to be a fifty that just happens if it perfectly any cigar band that's a size 50 or above will work fine just wrap it around obviously glue it so it's nice and tight and if you want to have it permanently on the lighter then just put a little bit of glue obviously around the actual band itself so when you slip it on or wrapped it around it would glue itself to the lighter and be more of a permanent fixture but uh definitely add something as a little character to your big lighters okay okay let's say you don't smoke cigars but you like this idea because a lot of different cigar bands are very decorative all you have to do is know a smoker okay unfortunately I don't think you can go into a smoke shop and ask for bands because no one really saves them in that respect however who knows you know you never know right so let's say you don't smoke cigars but you do like this and you don't know anyone who does smoke cigars that will save the bans again to you it's a shot the dark but you can of course you know go into any smoke shop and ask say hey you know if you guys are thrown out bands can you save it for me I'll you know I'll pick them up and maybe they will do that because a lot of times more times are not a smoke shop will also have a smoking lounge whether it's one table or a whole back room they usually have a smoking lounge and people are smoking cigars there they're done they just leave their nubs in the ashtray so anyway if you get a really nice guy at the cigar shop maybe when he goes to throw out those nubs and empty the ashtrays he'll slip off the band's for it you know you just never know so it's worth asking I guess but anyway there you go so see you guys later thanks again for watching hope you guys have a great day and I'll talk to you soon take care", "5CtnlEMnsjM": "okay so this is going to be a video on the pros and cons of Zippo lighters so in this video were just purely looking at suppose and we're classifying this kind of video as both the type of lighter that zippers are which is a liquid fuel lighter also known as a gasoline or petrol lighter and then we're going to compare those a bit to other lighters of the class of a Zippo and other types of lighters I mean the Zippos are great they're classic lighters but there are things they can and can't do which is obviously good to bear in mind if you're thinking of buying one though you want you know know how useful it would be in certain scenarios compared to other lighters so I've done videos before comparing lots of different lighters and things like that but this one is purely kind of on what's good and bad about Zippos and some of this stuff is kind of unfixable by design choices especially if you're in liquid fuel categories or lighters and there are things that could definitely be improved on the Zippo there's quite a major one I'll go into but let's start that they also this is kind of your classic Zippo here it's obviously a Zippo wind proof as it's known very simple design so you've got your main light to section in here which you fill up with light to flu with that liquid fuel then once it's in there it soaks into the wick and soaks into the interior part of it you put it in its case you flick this makes a spark and obviously it lights and you close the lighter to put it out obviously closing the lighter cuts off the oxygen supply and that puts the flame out you can also put this up to brace the lid from closing so inferior lighter can't go out in theory anyway so it's called a Zippo wind proof if you look there you can see a wind guard now the whole point of that is obviously it's a wind guard so if there's it's a windy day and you wanna light a cigarette or something that's not gonna go out because of them you know wind go cinamon out feel both these it goes up to show you and what we have here is a brass Zippo so regular suppose a brass that's then like electroplated with whatever kind of metal they meant to look like the brass suppose the solid brass that you might be just about able to see there it says solid brass so these are higher-quality Zippos basically they're a bit more solid I think they weigh a little bit more but they have tighter tolerances so I mean by that is that when you put this lighter together it's a tighter fit and that is good for what there's not a very good reason for this it means that basically it takes longer for the fuel to evaporate inside because one of the big problems of a Zippo you notice and that need remind light because I've been refilled them in a while as opposed evaporate their fuel now this is a problem with all light fluid lighters liquid fuel lighters because by design also the fuel is flammable and evaporates so even if you're not using it there's evaporation over time of the fuel which means eventually the lighter dries out even if you aren't using it now this is like one of the pros and cons we're going to speak of depending on how much you smoke or whatever else you use the lighter for if you very regularly use the lighter this isn't going to be a problem because you'll be lighting it and using the fuel anyway for that reason however if you know you very rarely smoke and you use a lighter now and again for utility kind of uses this is where you've kind of got problems as opposed because the fuel evaporates faster now there's a kind there's a couple of things you can do that a really easy to like you know increases the time it takes a Zippo fuel to evaporate and one of those is that people have told me about the really easy one I've done is you can start lighter in a sealable plastic bag and that reduces the amount of evaporation also if you're in a hot climate the Zippo is going to evaporate its fuel faster than if you're in a cold climate what some people do which is a bit of effort but worth doing is they put a rubber seal around here where the lid seals which cuts out a lot of evaporation supposedly you can get you know maybe two months out of a regular zipper now hopefully use opposed when I've sort of timed it if you fill up these lighters I think I get a couple of weeks to a month from that a Zippo depending on conditions the brass Zippo is about twice as long so in any given condition it would be about four weeks to two months so if I had to pick one Zippo to you so I definitely is the brass tip oh because I can fill them both and I know this one's gonna last longer so that's purely down to having tighter tolerances I found like starlighter's and other Zippo clones are very close to original Zippos there's not much advantage of the Zippo of other than you're you know buying a proper Americans there's no lighter so those are some factors so what I'm going to do now is just show you filling up lighters which is very straightforward and easy and then we're going to talk a bit more about them now you might be able to see on there it says left to fill I'm not actually going to do that because you don't need to if you pull like too fluid in it we'll still soaked through and then when it's dumped enough obviously you have a working lighter now this particular Zippo fuel might actually be quite low by look at this I might have to get another bottle of this open another problem of lighter fluid is it does last longer banham obviously when it's in lighter but again it will still evaporate out of one of these so bear in mind once you break the seal on one of these like this one which is a good thing it ran out in this video to kind of prove a point they do begin to evaporate so I'm just gonna bin this one and get another one to start filling them up but I'll cut to when they're refilled now because this is a fairly straightforward thing obviously you're just pouring enough about two fluid in there that the cotton inside becomes soaked and when that's soaked obviously the light is gonna light because the wick soaks soaks up the like two fluid inside so I'm I'll cut back to them being filled now while I'm here I'm gonna talk about one of the advantages as if Oh has and that's that when you're refilling it it's very easy to do you don't need any sort of pressurized butane canisters or anything like that obviously if you had a rip in your Zippo fuel can or whatever brand of lighter fluid you are using yes is gonna spill out however unlike butane if you have a hole like a very minor hole in your Zippo because obviously it soaks up inside the Zippo although it would evaporate a bit faster it's not gonna run out super fast whereas if you have a butane lighter obviously if that develops a crack or a hole in it the entire light is useless because it won't pressurize so if you had it out in the field that's not a good thing so what I'm just doing now is letting the stuff soak in properly so when I like the Zippo it should actually you know just like what it's meant to light and not like the entire light trauma fire that's one the other disadvantages with a Zippo is that obviously once you've refilled it you need to give it a moment so it's not going to light messily whereas a butane lighter once you've filled it you can use it about saying that sometimes I don't you feel the butane lighter at them becomes too cold and you have to give it a moment okay I'll go to sort of room temperature again but with Zippos that's not a problem how I was saying that one of the good things with a Zippo it will light pretty much in any terror air temperature whereas with butane lighters if it's very cold although I've never been in the condition it's been too cold for a butane lighter as opposed you know in ferry work in a broader temperature range so that's one thing to consider now Zippos don't cost too much either they're about in the UK 10 to 20 pounds depending on which model you get one like this would be 10 pounds or like the brass tip but would be closer to 20 now lots of people buy disposable lighters that are like a couple for a pound or whatever which a very uh Nikken annika way of using light as if you smoke a lot you'd be much better going for a proper lighter even if it's a butane refillable one refilling it I think I've covered that before sort of economics and lighters especially things like clippers they're very cheap but good lighters however if you wanted something a bit fancier 10 to 20 pounds Rose if how isn't bad at all and obviously it works well so anyway let's now flick this I'm speaking of cold weather another great thing about the Zippo is that it's got a very big striking wheel so it works you know if you've got a gloved hand you can still light it so as you can see that's why it's wind proof because it's not going out I easily when I'm trying to blow it now a big enough blow will put it out same with any lighter but it's only electric and jet lighters that I've seen can withstand pretty much any wind conditions so that's one of the advantages as a Zippo wind proof it does live up to its name pretty well you don't have to shield it with your hand like that if you're trying to light it so you know that is one big advantage said the fuel does evaporate which is the miss disadvantage so Zippos look cool as well obviously because you I'm not an expert of flicking a Zippo open especially on Triberr on camera but you know they've got a nice sort of Zippo flick open mechanism I said once it's lit you can put it out just by doing that now eventually you will need to replace the wick in a Zippo the wicks have been pretty good condition this one you can pull it through for a while and then you eventually need to sort of put a new wick in you put them in from underneath when you open up the lighter you don't pull it through as you can see the flame size is a little bit different on both for these Zippos I don't particularly know why it might just be wet condition I know if you move the wick around you can alter the flame size on a Zippo as well another good thing of the zip hose you can use them in the dark which I'll just demonstrate now there's a little bit of natural light in the room but not load so you can just about see this however if I then like this you should be able to see that once the flame starts going yellow that's giving off quite a fair bit of light so if I do the other lighter as well I've set the lid on fire there's obviously a bit of fuel in it you can see that both these lighters are obviously giving out quite a glow now if you do that with a butane lighter and also other similar ones you'll get nowhere near as much glow as you do from these so you know Zippos are good especially if you flicked the things that keeps the lid open you could use it to illuminate an area if you really wanted to see something obviously that's not a good idea if there's leaking gas or anything like that but it is kind of good if you just wanted to obviously like something up and you're in the dark and didn't have a flashlight or anything else you can use your Zippo so there's always that as well now there is an alternative to a Zippo and many of you know I'm very happy with this lighter it's probably one of my favorite lighters this is an old M coat now sadly these aren't made anymore because in M Co went bust but they were kind of a competitor as a Zippo for a very long time they came in different shapes and sizes but most of them have this general design so this is a lighter lighter and lighter basically you flick it and flicking of the as an opening also like set like the zip how it's partially windproof obviously that did go out there but you can see there it's got the wind guard I have tested outside and works well the bigger model of Inc o--'s have a thing that adjusts so you can adjust how much how big the holes are basically obviously the bigger the holes it easier it is to blow out however that also lets more air in which makes the flame bigger so what advantages does this M Co have over Zippo just a comparison with like - like lighters but one of the really cool things of the in cope is you can pull this out and I've just managed to put out doing this let's try again it might need a bit more of a wick water it's that's pointless so one of the big advantages of this is obviously as you can see you can pull this pit out and use it like a candle or something similar because the fuel is in there you could also like this of course without it being on the lighter itself just by anything that makes a spark but obviously that's a big advantage because you can use it to light things in more awkward angles obviously it's got my wind proof properties once it's pulled out of that but overall the EMCO obviously is easy to light when you open it on its own mechanism you can also inside the mechanisms store several sort of spare bits in there like spare Flint's and things like that but you can't really do proper overt Zippo you can kind of but not properly so that's that you can probably see is a bit lighter fluid on there now because that's when the annoying things until a while after refilling it they tend to leak a little bit of lighter fluid as you can see flames on the lid as well which is great another thing of the Zippo as you probably noticed that if it's been closed for a bit the evaporating fuel hits the lid on them when you liked it it sets the lid on fire so be careful how we hold is it when you light it and but overall I think that pretty much sums up those two points in the video these if hose are very nice lighters form they are but they're not perfect I said fuel evaporates over time which is annoying whereas if I get a jet liner I could filled up here ago whatever still fuel in it still liked so you know butane lighters are much better in that terms if using film again however there's a certain charm to things like the Zippos and the M cows you know these are kind of classic retro lighters and it's nice that Zippos are still made because you know another advantage of a zip hose it built like a tank I think you'd have a really hard time actually damaging a Zippo to the point it wouldn't work you don't probably have to run it over with a car or something you certainly wouldn't break a Zippo by dropping it because it's you know so simple inside its literally that's all there is to a Zippo I said you will have to now and again a new sort of flint on it you know striker and you'd have to pull the thing through a nut place that but for the most part you know not much we can complain about what was it though so you know hopefully this has been informative like I said I wanted to do this video mostly just to talk about the pros and cons of Zippos because you seem to get a Zippo fanboys who think they're amazing and they can do anything better than a of a kind of lighter which is false and then you get the people who think suppose a complete waste of money and crap lighters and leave or those things are true suppose are very good at what they do obviously light technologies now surpassed as if I'm especially with like electric lighters and butane torch type lighters but they are kind of a classic and they are nice lighters so you know hopefully this has helped you make up your mind whether or not a Zippo is the right lighter for you but you know they don't cost a lot of money I said about 10 pounds for a basic model zipper like that if you did want to take the plunge go to a pound shop and buy a bottle of lighter fluid for them and you're all set to go you", "kQb1NTi0Xg8": "hey guys today I'm going to show you how to refill an empty big lighter so what you're going to need for this is a completely empty bic lighter a pushpin preferably white some butane and three rubber grommets I'll tell you where to get these in a minute so optional items are some clippers and a file the first step is going to be to open up the valve at the bottom of the lighter now this isn't really a valve the way that big fills are lighters is they fill it through this hole it's tiny hole and then when they're done they Jam a tiny little BB in there so the best way for us to get in there is to just jam the BB into the cartridge and leave it there way to do that is to use a pushpin you put it in the hole put it on a hard surface and you push that's it you can hear that the BB is in there so your job is done when you pull this out you're going to get a little spray that's why you want to completely empty a bit lighter because you're going to get a little more spray if there's any liquid left the next step is to get your butane ready this is where you need the three rubber grommets I got these from Home Depot and a little variety pack in the hardware aisle they were extremely cheap and out of the variety pack you want the ones that fit over the nozzle perfectly you put three of them on there so that the rubber comes just a little bit past the tip of the nozzle when you're ready to go alright now we're ready to fill the pick this part is a little difficult but once you get the hang of it it's not that tough you take the nozzle that you prepared and you put it in the hole or over the hole the rubber is going to keep it sealed really well actually so put it on there and then you're going to push down well the rubber is such a good seal you're going to you're not even going to hear anything so you're going to think it's not going but let it go for a while okay it should be filled by now what you're going to do is you're going to take this off and put your thumb over it immediately so then you take your pushpin and you got to immediately put it in the hole as fast as you can obviously the faster you do it the better but you can hear it's filled with liquid there you go Vic is ready to go and working the next step is just cosmetic it takes this and turns into this so that your big lighter doesn't look that weird and it's not awkwardly shaped all you do is take some snippers and cut off the top and you file it down so I'm not going to file out here but that's what you do you don't have file use some concrete outside and that's it that's how you refill a Bic lighter", "2cNlFy5Frn4": "all right everybody I want to do a video on why don't think big lighters are actually that good simply because of the price of them and they're not refillable so go into that and why you know I'm not a big fan of them so with Bic lighter z' you've got two kind of types you they vary in size but you've got a standard sort of disposable bit lighter you know very simple design you know that it lights but it's not massive you can't feel all that you know keep all that much fuel in there and the main reason I don't like big lighters they're not refillable you can refill them by piercing that bit filling it with gas and then resealing it but that's quite a fiddly process and they're not designed to be reefs you know used and then you've got these pity electric dicks which I think better than those but they cost a bit more and again here's the issue not refillable easily not designed to be refilled so you've got those two kind of bits and the reason I think most people who've actually have thought about it like Clippers more is for the price of a few bits you can buy a few Clippers they're very similar in price but Clippers I also I prefer the mechanism on them and they hold a bit more fuel among these bits at least the smaller bits but the Clipper lighters are actually a refillable as you can see on the bottom there there's your refilling port they've got you know it's completely possible to refill a bit later sorry clipper but BICS you have to sort of mess about with it to be able to do it which I don't thinks is good you know that you've got that option so if you were just buying them as disposable lighters you could go for one of these which is like a much cheaper disposable lighter we get them over here in pound land or corner shops or ever and these are they don't like quite as well as Bix that's the only real difference but these lighters are about a pound four six of them whereas a Bic for a pound you'd only get one or two at most so even if the pick is a slightly better lighter of the two obviously this cheapo one here is better than the BIC in my opinion simply because you get more for the money and what I also find funny is for a similar price of buying a few bits you can actually buy more of these towards yet lighters which little jet lighters which are refillable apparently you can only refill them a few times before they stop working but that's at least you know more uses out of something that's roughly the same price for a better lighter because it's a jet lighter so if you're using it on a windy day you know you don't need to use as much fuel so let's for example show you if I had these two lighters see it doesn't easily go out but is the same thing of a pick um so the tour jets are much better in you know that for that reason they don't go out easily and you get that cool-looking red flame I guess they've treated it with some sort of you know chemical compound on there to give it that cooler complain but there we go so the other thing is I was with refillable lighters you can buy a big can of butane gas like this this isn't let you know refined butane it's not good for expensive lighters but for ones you don't really care about when they gums up and just chuck them away refillable butane this is a pound or two for a bottle of this size and this is quite a big capacity when it's 300 milliliters so this has 50ml free but we'll just assume that 300 milliliters is what you'd normally get for a pound you 2 pounds so for that you could obviously refill at one of these clipper lighters lots of times over if you can trace the size of the lighter to them if you can't know this camera here you can truck contrast a clipper to it you'd see you could fill that clipper up loads of times from one of these for not much money but for roughly the price of getting on these you could get a couple more picks and then you've only got a couple more refit you've got no refills essentially before these run out and that's the end of your lighter so although yes it is possible to refill a bit although you're not meant to if I was going to have to buy a disposable like I just go for these just simply because I'd get a lot more few for my money my wood verbs back even if the light isn't not quite as good you can at least do the flame crow a trick of these easier so you get that's obviously like the two types of things but yeah I say Clippers are much better than Bix for the simple reason of that the Clipper holds a bit more fuel on the bit and it's refillable there we go but as said physio electrics are the better fix but the problem is again they cost a bit more and you can refill them and for the price of these you could get tore Jets cheaper which are actually much cooler better lighters there we go what's better out of a clipper and a bit the Clipper easily", "aFxJ8CUavsM": "well I can see it as being a very controversial video and everybody slamming the dislikes but I personally think that clipper lighters are much better than bit lighters and I'm going to explain the reasons why now everybody seems to like even one or two of these lighters you can't seem to like IVA and don't get me wrong I do like the bit lighters that the Clippers are simply a better lighter so I'm going to go into the reasons why and then you can feel free to disagree but if you do disagree please leave me a good reason in the comments don't just say I hit you in your opinion you're wrong right so what we have here is the standard cheap clipper lighter and then the standard cheaper so a little bit lighter these come in two sizes you can get the slightly bigger ones but let's go into the reasons why I like the clipper more so firstly the retail price of these although the bits are slightly cheaper a pack of five disposable bits or instant isn't much cheaper than pack of refillable Clippers so if you're their disposable lighters I'd like them to be a lot cheaper because obviously once you've used a gas that comes with the clipper lighters you can very cheaply refill them and you can keep them lasting longer and longer and longer so let's look at some of the features of lighters I said bits are not refillable there's a cap there but it's sealed in the factory there is ways of refilling them but you're basically modifying the lighter to do it they're not meant to be refillable limit to be disposable Clippers on the other hand as you can see at the bottom that red bit up so you refill it with standard butane gas it's very cheap to buy a can of butane gas probably one or two dollars or pounds or a big can of butane and you can refill the light as hundreds of times with a bottle that size so click the wins on being refillable for a very similar price to the bits the striking the clicker one is absolutely fine a lot of people complain about these hexagonal wheels and while I do prefer the round wheels that are on the more expensive clipper lighters the hexagonal wheel is absolutely fine to actually catch and light easily the Bix have this round we order this weird little cover on it I'm actually sure the point of that cover is because it gets in the way the wheel again they light very efficiently but however I'm not a massive fan of it the other thing I don't really like about the Bix is there's no fuel adjustment on it I think some models a bit cabinet but not there are two types of ick I've got at home now with the Clipper while there's no fuel adjustment lever on one of the cheap Clippers what you can do is once the lighters lit when you turn it that way the size of the flame increases and that's designed so when you're lighting a pipe with a downwards action you get a bigger flame the other interesting thing is the size of them obviously as I said you can get bigger bit so that's not a complaint about this smaller bit that the Clipper is designed so that you can pack a pipe with the bottom of it like that like using a pipe tool and that's something you can't do a bit because it's just a normal lighter shape so the Clipper wins on versatility the other interesting thing with the Clipper is if you pull out the Flint it's awkward there's a light as hot there we go you can use this as a packing tool for cigarettes with the end of this and you can use the sort of Flint for sparks separate from the actual lighter itself probably not that visible on the video but there we go if you needed it for a survival reason you can take that out and you can swap these or remove the Flint either way if you wanted to use it again to refill it something can't leave the BIC again I do understand that the BIC is meant to be a disposable lighter but because the prices are so similar it seems you get a lot more for your money with a clipper I've said as well as packing a pipe for the bottom bit supposedly you can shove it in the top of a bottle and it keeps insects out of the bottle if you're drinking outside in the summer which I don't know if it's an intended feature but it's quite a useful thing people have told me about so that's my main reasons for liking the Clipper more than the BIC what I'd like BIC to do because clipper have done it is to release a slightly more expensive refillable model I said the normal cheap Clippers are refillable but you've got these nice metal Clippers that are also refillable these are only about 4 or 5 pounds each metal casing at the bottom there you can adjust the flame height and this one has nice round wheel easier to strike and lighter on the phone and I've got it set for a nice big flame on that to go so if you disagree that the bic is a better lighter than the clipper or so you think the bic is a better lighting the clipper unlike me that i'm saying it the other way around leave a comment explaining why don't get angry actually explain your reasons if you've got good reasons i'll consider them but most people just try to insult me saying the BIC is better than the Clipper now one of the great things about Bix is because they're designed to be disposable lighters and they're not that expensive you can buy a few packs of them store them in different places as sort of not really an EDC lighter but you know in different places so if you need a lighter you've always got one time somewhere like one in the car glovebox winning a cupboard in your house one there some candles or something like that so that is a good feature out the BIC because Bix I will agree a much better than cheaper lighters because for example in dollar stores and in Poland in the UK even buy packs about five to ten very cheap disposable lighters however they don't hold much fuel compared to a BIC and often they don't strike they've got very very bad Flint and the flames are often very good and it's some really cute kind of butane or fuel because it always smells absolutely horrible when you like them so there we go Vic's are definitely better than the other brands of disposable lighters but for the price they cost I personally think the Clippers are a lot better value for money especially because they're refillable you", "xsiG1Cs5uRo": "[Music] so [Music] [Music] hey everybody welcome back to another awesome adobe live my name is jesus ramirez i'll be your host for the day and today we have my good pal sean back for another um photoshop compositing stream how's it going sean good to see you i'm good how are you man like how's it going it's only been like i think like a month since we've seen you see you know what it's been it's probably been more than that but it feels like like a month yeah like time's going by so fast right now just so fast yeah yeah yeah um last time you were on you worked on some compositing stuff using uh pixel squid if i'm not mistaken yep and uh what do you have for us today well we'll still like obviously we'll still be using pixel squid it's uh super easy but i also have a really cool brush pack that i'll be um showing off today um i've had it for like a while now and it's just become like super easy for me to um edit with a lot of things like blending into like just rough landscapes it's been working out really well for me so i want to really show that off and some of my favorite brushes that i've been using and and yeah so we'll just be combining pixel squid um images from adobe stock and brushes today nice a lot of fun stuff so let me just take care of a quick uh housekeeping items uh first of all the design feedback i just completed the photoshop daily creative challenge for today we worked on some hairdo replacements which you might have seen i saw you in the chat and um in about an hour and a half we're going to review those together so make sure that you submit your work into behance.net uh into i'm sorry into discord um if you don't know what i'm talking about you can go into behance.net slash challenge photoshop and there is the link right now in the screen that you can go to and submit your work under creative challenge and yeah you and i should be looking at some pretty interesting work this has been a fantastic week with the daily creative challenges a lot of good work i'm looking at some of the work there and i'm like man that's better than what i did so a lot a lot of good work a lot of good work um so yeah and also the schedule for the day i'm sure that will pop right up if there we go we started um the day with spencer then me then uh now the non-bias the best stream of the day with you sean doing photo compositing and right after us we have the amazing paul doing the illustrator daily creative challenge so make sure that you stick around for that it's a lot of good streams uh today but again non-bias i think this one might be the best one might might have to be the best one might just have to be the best one all right man um are you ready to get started or of course always awesome all right so here's you know my favorite quote gotta show that off live simply so others may simply live nicely why is that your why is that your favorite quote um i don't know i just feel like it is just it's so true right like um if the more complex that you like make things like in life the more complex it's going to come back to you okay right so like i feel like living simply is just if you want like a simple solution to come back to you just lift simply so that it always is just going to come back to you like simply so i i really like this it really just keeps my anxiety you know going i'm not freaking out about a lot of things all the time if i read that then i'm just like oh yeah living simply yeah okay nice and is that on your and obviously that's your desktop right like you can read it whenever you like yeah yeah exactly it's on my desktop i think i have it on a picture like i have a on a quote somewhere like around my bedroom there too uh somewhere but uh i definitely have it all over the place yeah yeah and also um i just wanted a quick uh just mentioned the chat um thank you guys so much for joining us i see a lot of familiar faces we have potty anika a lot of people from the stream that i just did uh sean sean is saying that um my cans this is what we call them in the business cans that my cans are smashing my hair no yeah let us know in the chat where you're watching from i see uh and i'm sorry if i mispronounced her name torns uh tornstein from germany um we have somebody from bangladesh i'm currently streaming from the manchester from manchester uk what about you sean are you still in canada oh yeah it's still in canada it hasn't snowed yet it's uh basically on the edge of snowing right now like where it's dropped from like like 25 degrees all the way down to like 10 now it's we don't get anything higher than that basically so nice judith is saying xiao for xiao from nyc leah from virginia nice good to see you anika from india thank you so much for for watching yeah we got um christy from maryland people from all over the world denver colorado heather hey heather how's it going good to see you awesome hey toronto there we go oh we have toronto in the house nice deep in the heart of texas norway all right so there you go the magic is here and i'm guessing that's you sean yeah i'm the wizard right so uh but so i'm we're gonna be creating this today um yeah so that's why i put like a little bit of a blanket over it you know like so i can just reveal it and be like you know when they get a fancy new car and they just pull off that sheet and it's just like smooth so i tried to do the same thing but you know not as epic but this is what we're gonna make today um so we're gonna start like clean canvas and we're going to i'm probably gonna add some more elements in here but we're going to see how far we get with it i'm hoping to do the whole thing because i do want to do another composite tomorrow but but yeah so we're going to start off fresh here let's start off on our this is where the magic happens and let me just grab my files here got them quickly sorted on the side nice and and while you do that i'll try to answer a question maximiliano's asking a question um i'm assuming you're referring miximiliano the question the way you wrote it is who knows if it's possible to use the old workspace of the raw module i try to the install this install photoshop but i get the new one uh so i'm assuming you're talking about the camera raw filter or camera raw plug-in um there's as far as i know there's no way of bringing back the old layout um so unfortunately you are stuck with the new um layout and i'm not exactly sure why you would want to go back maybe you're familiar with it and that's yeah i think the new one is it's uh it's much better it has more features and in my opinion it's better laid out but i understand that you might just be familiar with something and just don't want to relearn where something is but i i do think that the newer one is is an improvement but unfortunately if you're used to the old one you cannot bring it back as far as i know all right so i am going to yeah so let me just show you exactly like what i've been playing around with for the past few months so this is a brush pack that everybody can download by the way um uh it's on the adobe site i believe if there's a if anybody can pull up a link or something i might have a link somewhere actually it's on my instagram there you go if you want to go on my instagram at sean raiken it's right inside the um bio description right there but it's for the keith hearing um contest that's going on right now definitely recommend uh entering that but nice check it check out these brushes though so i'm gonna go with my favorite this is the vinyl scraper one here this is one of my favorites but it's just so oh let's go with a different color here but it's just so like like it's got that like paint really nice paint like look to it and it's jagged and rough and you can just looks super cool super cool when we went uh so when i did kind of like the the background here it worked really well yeah yeah the the paint splatters so right nice same effect with this basically um i am uh so i'm gonna kind of like cheat the design a little bit only because i don't want to spend hours cutting out um i'll show you what i was going to be cutting out today um but yeah so everybody i'm assuming knows how to kind of like you know use the quick selection all that select an object and cut it out that's probably been covered so many times in different videos but let me just grab the image that i was going to crop out um so okay so this is a the image here of a painter let me just bring it top so as you can see you know it would have probably taken me like hours to crop that like out it did take me um like two hours or so to get around the ladder and everything like that yesterday so to save time we're just gonna basically bring that ladder guy back up and i said sorry i'm lazy in the thing because i already knew that i was going to took me hours last night i said ah yeah we're gonna have to there we go perfect it's just like a cooking show you know we just pulled out the turkey out of the oven and it's exactly it's already there right so we're going to use this i'll draw the ladder back or we'll remove the um we'll disable that mask so you can kind of see what it looked like previously and then i went around doing a layer mask and revealed all around it was just really tough because as you can see like there's some like nice like glares on the ladders here yeah yeah that's basically what took my time so any particular oh sorry just quick uh one of a question out of curiosity for me um any particular reason why you prefer layer mask as opposed to vector mask no any particular might not be a reason no there's just no uh reason really i just uh have always um just went right with the uh the layer mask it just terminology that i get stuck in my head over time i just never really tried i feel like they both almost do kind of a similar thing right am i right or am i no you're correct there's just uh one is vector based the other one is pixel based but they theoretically both do the same thing um sean in the chat is saying naming layers very good sean yeah it's very uh it's very hard for to get me to name layers but yes i do actually like name layers like here and there all my shadow layers like this one i i probably won't name only because it makes it like i like to use the big image previews here so i really don't like when i'm quickly going through my files i just look at that image rather than yeah yeah so it just makes it like go by so much easier definitely i'm just gonna kind of trail down here because this is the direction that he's going in right so and then we're going to just add you know down here you can be as rough as possible with this because it's a roller right so it's not perfect and i really like that brush and i'm hearing clicking so you're not on a wacom right you're just using a mouse oh yeah just a uh just a medicine yeah and it looks really good i still haven't i still haven't upgraded to the tablet yet i'm uh i'm so old generation like i just i feel like just the mouse is just you know it's so good still so good to me you know what i i converted but man i'm still so good and so fast with the mouse that sometimes i just prefer like you've probably seen the streams that i do when i teach i definitely don't use a wacom i can i just use some house um yeah yeah i see i can see the cause you can just it's i do know that i definitely do need to upgrade over to time and get used to like that the good old tablet life but um but for now yeah like i do have a bamboo tablet somewhere around my office but uh it's not one with like a screen or anything so it's not really giving me the best perspective of all i just can't work flat down and up at the same time it just it throws my eyes off because only one of my eyes actually work i think keith was a little late into the stream he wrote what are you guys doing saw keith hearing brush set and was curious oh yeah so this is what we're doing actually right here this is why i uh perfect this is exactly what we're doing right now nice that's what we're doing keith exactly that we're going to try and wrote sean road i know i know what layer 52 is exactly i know what your 52 is [Laughter] that's funny i wouldn't sometimes it can go up like so like what would you see like a a low amount of layers for a file would be i would say like i normally at least like minimal probably around like 100 layers per file do well i mean depends on the project on a compositing job for sure um if it's you know maybe if you're like reworking a photo or something you know maybe like 10 or so but yeah definitely for compositing definitely in in the high high you know close to 100 if not more at least oh yeah so it's all those shadow layers the shadows lighting all that kind of stuff so basically what i did down here is um i straight like i just went right across with the selection tool just the selection box and i just erased it because you're not going to see really that much paint on the floor and if you do then you're a bad painter and clearly this guy's a professional yeah clearly right like look at it he's got he's got the gloves and the and everything yeah this is like this is not diy anymore this is a this is a profession right here he knows what's up oh sean is saying don't talk about the banana are we talking about the banana secret society that we're all in and that we're not supposed to talk about but then we're talking about yeah oh you don't have a banana you gotta get a banana and there man come on a banana in here yeah no so you see you see on the toolbar a photoshop toolbar on the left hand side above the foreground color picker there's three dots you see that yeah yeah click on those three dots no no at the bottom oh at the bottom yeah yeah three above the the below the opening tool yeah oh wait click on it and then go into edit toolbar hold shift and click on done so click on done while holding shift oh wait you didn't get the banana what happened it doesn't like you oh what is it supposed to give me a banana yeah okay so so reset to default sorry for messing up your toolbar uh restore defaults here yeah and then hold shift and click look at undone wow all right so you've just been uh knighted into the banana secret society yes yeah yes i've always wanted to be in the banana that's so funny i didn't know who who just who randomly discovered that one day i i found that out through an adobe engineer at a conference um a photoshop engineer at a conference and this is i i don't remember what version of photoshop that was in it was like maybe 20 16-ish 15-ish something like that all right so here's a yeah here's a beautiful sky image so what i do now is i just right click this and then say create clipping mask and what it does is it just keeps that image within my last you know within my last like little area here so now it looks like clouds i'm going to just put it down here because uh we're going to add our own grass with uh pixel squid up front because just a lot easier to give you more flexibility so now let's open up our uh well it's already open perfect would you look at it oh and what is pixel squid so pixel squid is a um 3d uh library um basically and what it provides to you is um assets to use within your composites and they already have like no backgrounds and they apply shadows it's basically 3d objects um this is like if you don't really know how to use like uh any like 3d software yet or um like dimensions or anything which i will soon is adobe max i literally set my whole schedule to adobe dimensions this year oh you're gonna watch a lot of uh uh janet matthews's session yeah i'm gonna i think i got i think i filled my schedule so much that i'm literally going from like like one in the morning all the way up until like five at night wow yeah nice like it's like so different right and you know you gotta you gotta get in on this opportunity because yes three so yeah and yeah you definitely have to um check out adobe max it's free i don't know if it's for the first time ever but it's definitely free this year it hasn't been free before there's gonna be thousands of sessions from creatives from all over the world um i know adobe live is gonna be there and they're going to be doing a whole bunch of stuff so make sure that you check it out um i will tell you what my sessions are but i forgot already so i'm sure sean might be able to tell you um but yeah i'll be doing several sessions at adobe max if i'm not mistaken this is my fifth year maybe fourth fifth fifth or fourth year i don't remember um but yeah i like how you're just i'm sorry what were you gonna say i was like i'm just going to i think we were about to say the exact same thing actually how easy it was to just duplicate yeah and move over it looks super cool i was going to do that but i realized i want this one on a different angle and you can't that's the only thing about pixel squid is that if you duplicate this one they they become attached in a sense because they're smart objects so any alterations you would have made to this one it would have made it to the other ones so that's why i kind of like created a new one only so that they're completely separated now got a background there nice nice and is pixel squid paid or free or trials or how does that work so it's paid but but i actually got the the green light to give away uh yeah ten ma uh ten three month memberships during uh the lives today and tomorrow so all right well you already gave one of those to me and but it's gonna be yeah it's it's amazing right so we'll i think we'll probably use them more in tomorrow's stream and we'll get people to like interact and talk all right chat there and then we'll we'll give them away um for tomorrow because i'm just not as prepared to do like a contest unless you can think of something right off the top of your head like i have all the the stuff uh behind you but how many maybe we can do one today and one tomorrow how many have total i have five actually no i have ten oh wow all right so that'll hold me up for at least the year and then the one that you can give away um yeah we can um i don't know we we could definitely think of something um but let's not let's do it towards the end of the stream let's not do that now yeah no make sure you make sure you tune in to get uh three free months or for an opportunity to get three free months yeah we'll do like a nice at first to say this or something challenge yeah all right so pixel's good again look how easy it is just to bring in like just grass now outside of your element like i gotta make it i gotta match the grass in the background so you can't make it like dramatically big but you also have to think that it is closer to the camera frame so you do have to make it a little bit bigger than the grass and blades in the background only just to balance like you know both uh the whole field basically so i'm gonna grab a few of these i'm just gonna place them up front here um actually i'm just gonna duplicate this uh same one so first i'm going to this is how i name my layer so we're gonna i just name groups and then i throw all those layers within this group and then i'll colorize this green so that i know that it's the grass and then we'll just now duplicate and throw all these around at the bottom here massimiliano is saying maybe you should play with the blendiff to bring the texture of the wall on the sky yeah so we'll so we get to that eventually so see as you can see how the the wall gets through here you just have to sort of set up some elements prior what i like to do is i like to uh lay out all my elements first and then blend so i don't i don't blend in between because then your mind just goes like back and forth constantly and you're you're all over the place so um paco said check out issues on the uh on the max speaker page i was really ha i mean i'm still happy about being in the speaker page but for a long time i was right next to kiana reeves and then they start didn't start adding people whose last name starts with r as well so i was like yes right next to keanu reeves and then that's how you know that you're like a baller because he yeah he didn't he like vaguely mentioned the matrix in his bio you know like maybe kind of like it was like an afterthought oh yeah by the way i was in the matrix oh yeah fyi yeah it's just like casually so imagine just casually mentioning that just you're you're shopping at a store oh yeah yeah i was in the matrix no but that's how like deep your resume is that you have so much stuff that the matrix is just it's all right it was one achievement just one of my many many many many achievements you know who else has a um a um like a really cool resume in terms of achievements uh pop quiz for the chat let me know if you guys know who john knoll is john knoll in the chat let me know john no do you know sean do you know who john knowles i don't know who john knows oh come on you should know who john nolan is i feel like if i saw a piece and i would i would know let's see if anybody in the chat and don't google it because i know somebody's gonna be like yeah there's always a googler there's always a googler all right so now since it's kind of looking like grass is growing out of floorboards that really doesn't make like too much sense you know like you wouldn't really see that so what i do is i kind of just grab another pixel squid object and i put it underneath and they do like little grass patches too with dirt along the edges see it's nice and yep yep so i'll just do that i'll position it same angle as this and i'll just throw it underneath all of the all the grass and then it kind of creates that dirt edge around um around my bottom piece here and it kind of like blends it in with the background that looks super cool super cool um so people are starting to comment in the chat and yep uh terence got it uh he worked for ilm and he is one of the creators of photoshop one of the people that invented photoshop john noel um and his brother thomas knoll created photoshop i want to say in 1988 89 something like that and they sold it to adobe and um john noll also is one of the creators of star wars rogue one the movie so imagine having that in your resume and star wars oh by the way i uh you know invented photoshop and you know worked on a film you might have heard of yeah just a huge resume yeah i wouldn't even have a resume at that point i would just have a qr code on a piece of paper literally you wouldn't even you wouldn't need to put references or anything you just put a key going right to the dvd release or something you just pointed a photo of the photoshop icon and that's my resume yeah right there and actually when you start up photoshop if i'm not mistaken that's the first name that comes up in the splash screen one is either the first yeah it's either his name or his brother's name that comes up first i always notice the creator of the splash screen in whenever i launch uh photoshop that's the first name that i recognize shout out to vanessa rivera good friend yep good friend of ours i don't know where in the world she is vanessa travels the world with her husband and takes photos of amazing things creates beautiful composites crazy yeah you should definitely check out that stuff it's a really good composite artist i like how like see like that's what i'm missing it's just a kids right then i can start photoshopping them and stuff but i'm 27 so i'm going to relax on that one for a little bit i'm just going to slow down but uh but yeah i mean you could always push up cats you know that's true i do but i just can't capture a picture of my cat because he's just so like he's so energetic that he will just never sit in front of a screen ever ever and the contrast since he has like white fur and black bird the contrast of my camera could never pick up like his face it doesn't it never never picks up it's weird [Music] what you just have one cat yeah yeah so i just have one cat his name is uh socks and uh i base i put him through dog training when i when i first got him as you should put all your cats into dog training yeah no and it works and it works out actually really really well you you'd be surprised that um how well that uh a cat can become trained out of there i i thought that cats could never be trained i thought that it could have never happened or uh yeah it was just way too much but um yeah i know it one uh two two weeks i'm pretty sure i think it was yeah two weeks of dog school and uh he kind of barks now so nice so i saw you blame the blending the grass into the ladder how are you doing that so uh so i'm kind of like a again lazy um so i basically the one of the other brush packs that i have is a grass brush pack so okay i use a lot of grass in my pieces and i find that that you know it creates a soft kind of like loving vibe and you see grass everywhere anyways so someone can instantly connect to the piece um but so what i did was i basically just went to the layer mask that we did kind of at the start so if you disable it again all back and then enable it gone i basically just went to the eraser set my opacity up to 100 made sure they were both at 100 and then went to my grass and you see the uh it's like a layout already it's already set up in a grass kind of pattern and you can just kind of erase now you just click erase and it blends the bottom of that ladder in it creates like some short grass uh what i'm not sure what it's called grass blades i guess yeah there you go yeah yeah by the way i want to remind everybody about the design feedback make sure that you go into discord to submit your daily creative challenge which you guys worked with me about half an hour or so ago we did hair swaps in photoshop so make sure that you submit your work shaun and i will be reviewing that very soon oh yeah i'm super excited for that i uh you did a hairdo challenge today right hair dude challenge that's right yeah i see i wish it was that easy during like the times when it was hard to get a haircut i wish i could just use i've used photoshop you know yeah that would have been so great or like uh like a filter like on zoom you know everybody's vehicles now just like it just reduce your hair yeah somebody joins in and they're like shrek and you're like whoa all right so i'm just gonna see how it's kind of like dark down here at the bottom of the brush oh yeah that's another thing that i did so i'm gonna show you that quickly so the the um the top of this wasn't always blue i basically just clip masked up the blue brush into it i didn't add anything special it's just on normal and the opacities down a little bit so nothing too special i just put that this same blue whatever sky that you use you would grab this exact blue and put it underneath here and then a light the lighter tone you would put it on top only because the lighting in this room is uh is going down so nice and then and thanks so much codybear for posting the link in the chat for the daily creative challenges and for discord so make sure that you click on those links and the discord link is also up on screen now and that'll be in about an hour the design feedback so make sure that you submit your work beautiful so i'm just going to grab the soft brush again and i'm just going to kind of uh oh yeah so my strength is oh wait no this is my blur brush that's what i this this bar at the top keeps my uh sometimes whenever i click the the fast preset up here it'll go to a different different brush again and i always always bounce between like the eraser and the blur tool so sometimes i quickly hit that one it goes right to the blur tool again yeah yeah it will do opacity put that down and then just nice just a nice little swipe just a nice little swipe is all you need maybe you can put it at uh soft light there perfect and then that would kind of create like you know you're more it's more 3d now it's looking like it's actually like pressed up against the wall it's looking nice so now we got to put that uh the elk in there we had a huge discussion on our discord about if this was an elk or a um or a deer but uh it's an elk it's definitely okay let me just grab it here um it might be in my office here we go yeah there's so many elements on pixel squid so that's why i have them like different libraries and different like folders and stuff so but sometimes my elements go in like because you can put them in multiple folders too so it's kind of cool how you can have like the same element across all these different projects so you can basically just set up your uh pixel squid to what your what project you're currently working on nice so this is an elk correct yeah yeah all right i believe so this is a you i i'm i'm assuming that 100 is i think that like uh deers are are different i guess in some way i sure i yeah i'm not much of a deer now expert i don't know much i'm just gonna move up the the grass back here just to give it some more kind of land to work with nice perfect there you go and this is all clip mask still so we can just move it wherever we want it's not going to escape like the edges or anything like that so good old non-destructive editing and i'm just going to boost the quality here it always imports my pixel squid objects at the lowest quality so i can actually like put place them before uh you know boosting that quality and having photoshop like slow down a little tad bit it's only because you're using big elements so judith wrote i don't think that's an elk let us know what you think it is judith yeah what is it whoa where did the deer came from it came from pixel squid there it is pixel squid so how should we we should probably give one away soon yeah um do you want people to contact you or like how are you gonna you know like yeah yeah message me on behance here because i also do live streams on here as well it's the easiest way to contact me and then i'll and then we'll i'll just okay so whoever the winner is could contact you and you can verify the name since it'll be the same account yep excellent excellent so i'll let you want me to think of a question or do you want to think yeah go go right ahead if you if you can right now how difficult or how easy should we make this then is it photoshop related ooh uh you can make it uh let's can it can you make it so that like somebody can't just google the answer like do you know any questions or anything like that that wouldn't be a google thing or at least not easily google yeah at least not easily googled um let me think of one huh everything's on google it's really everything i know that's why yeah yeah it's like how fast can you google this sometimes i just get people to type out the full alphabet that's what we do in our discussion the first person to type out the full alphabet wins oh my god i can't do that one now everybody's already got it pre-typed yeah everybody um let's see eddie wrote i would have to google it i would have to google it the alphabet i have no idea what the alphabet is um let me see something good i'll i'll think about it about something in a minute yeah that question of uh the creator of photoshop was pretty good if you can yeah something like that something like that yeah all right cool cool okay so now i have a question i have a question are we ready for this are we ready are we ready because i don't know if this is oh man it might be google below all right so so whoever whoever types the answer first correct yeah nate give me the name of at least one of the co-writers of the very first book on photoshop oh there's two of them and actually i forgot the name of the second [Music] so the one that's in my head yeah guess exactly what's in my head right now yeah okay so now i'm going to oh we got it michelle michelle got it first answer perfect send me a message on discord i'll give you i think it's three months of pixel squid three months of pixel squid there you go send me a message after the stream though i can't do it here his name is bert monroy um yeah burtman roy is is is the one of the co-writers of the very first book on photoshop and he's the the most well known out of the two which is why i couldn't remember the other gentleman's name and if i remember correctly it came out like in 91 92 i i actually have that book and i mean if you read it today obviously the tools and stuff like that are going to be in different so different areas but in terms of like how channels work and things like that i mean it's all still relevant to this day so it's it's a very good book i'm just gonna yeah um nice cool cool yeah it was uh i i asked right away i was like let me give away a pixel squid please we talk about it so much i use it all the time right might as well oh michelle said she uh learned who bert was for me yeah i talk about bird a lot he is definitely my photoshop here actually a lot of stuff in photoshop was designed by him like the uh you're doing grass right now like the crust grass brush tool uh um the grass brush i should say um he he designed it and a lot of the stuff that's in it now was um oh like it's the old like the first one that was yeah yeah yeah okay yep that one and he is photoshop user number six oh user number six so you can imagine how long he's been using photoshop really really talented artists you can look them up at birtmanroy.com so what we're going to do here now is um this is like you got to kind of start adding your own blues on the background a little bit more just to make it look more painted rather than um just a picture pasted on the inside of a of a brush so what i do is i grab kind of like some lighter blues just using the eye dropper just go down you know make it nice as rough as possible just showing that like it's kind of like merging and mixing the paints here super cool and we'll do some green down here just the bob is asking how is your day jesus and sean it's been great um i woke up super early um i for some reason i always get like a little bit um anxious before i go live mm-hmm so that's i think that's why i woke up super early today like at seven o'clock so that's pretty early for me because i work for myself so i i normally sleep in a little bit um but yeah i was just uh it hasn't been too bad i've just been uh editing all this morning um and then editing now and i'll probably be editing after again yep uh now that you mentioned you know you being self-employed i'm wondering um people in the chat let us know what you why you're um into the adobe applications are you a professional photographer designer student um just a hobbyist what you know type of adobe user are you i'm curious to see what we have maybe we have a lot of designers maybe have a lot of photographers i don't know let us know yeah there's there's so many genres of art like even if you produce music yep there you go where do you get your ideas for your artwork sean oh my head is so full of randomness that that's basically where it comes from um i when i was like you know i'm always overthinking things i'm always under thinking things and like it's just from my anxiety really so it just kind of keeps my mind um constantly thinking of random ideas basically and um and yeah it just fills it up uh i also um am in on discord all time i'm in the photoshop discord talking to new artists they inspire me all the time too it's just who you talk with and and all that right once you start talking to other creatives and you get you start getting really involved with a lot of things and that's what starts inspiring your next piece is all those life memories those experiences yeah so this piece is about like you know um i'm a i'm a designer and i'm like painting the beauty like back into the world again right so like you're really drawing the nature back in nature is a huge thing for me i love nature so that's why i do a lot of nature pieces but super cool yeah you just got a little story so you're a designer uh juliana is a designer slash illustrator leah freelance graphic designer and creative we have danis who studied graphic design in high school wanting to start my their visual arts studies uh but dallas a student carl is a designer amy is a graphic designer fairy is a student clever is a painter wait uh oh wait no the wait you have that painter oh okay this must be obviously related to something else but clever wrote yeah that painter is done but i still hire him for his other skills brian um is into videos and um the bob is here for an art club to support his boy sean oh yeah the art club that's our discord server nice yeah that's our like so this is like the one that we kind of we're like the hype squad of adobe you know we're okay bro so we kind of like so around adobe max we're all going to gather there and then go and kind of uh you know we're going to gather everybody so that we all know what's going on and if anybody has any questions we're going to kind of like answer them help people out on that discord nice because you can't really we found that that you know you can't really gather on like instagram or anything like that it doesn't really it doesn't work out that well you know right right so um so yeah discord's just been a perfect place and that's uh that's what we're gonna be using this year for adobe max super cool we have brian is a designer christy graphic designer bedell animation and visual effects student michelle is a full-time photoshop student at home learning by myself that's how most of us learn um fun fact i got a c in my one and only photoshop class in college um hey you know what he's better than d definitely and twice is better than an f cody freelancer illustrator and adobe live mod heather's a graphic designer steve is a rocket scientist brain surgeon superhero just call me a bookaroo that kind of sounds like tony stark when he's describing it yeah you know you know what he says like when captain america tells him like take away the suit where are you he goes uh billionaire playboy philanthropist or something i just love a bunch of things yeah i discovered v-hands during the spring nice oh violet's a bar owner executive assistant and designer slash writer cool so we have a lot of people who are designers not i was expecting a few more photographers but not everybody hears the designers that's awesome or most people here are designers yeah i didn't see that many normally everybody's a photographer nowadays though yeah i mean not as professional with all the retouching and stuff but that's i did study photography i went to college for it oh cool and then i realized that uh that the editing part is definitely uh definitely good in the better in the long run because you can edit everybody's imagery then right so you didn't need to uh you didn't always need to specifically have a camera somebody else could be going out and doing the shoot for you and then all you need is just all the files after yeah so i went right into editing and it's uh just worked out a lot more for me we have uh paco in the chat saying he's a photographer and videographer and an excellent one at dad cody bear hopefully can uh share his instagram in the chat he's got some really cool photos he takes a lot of nature uh photos and time lapses are super super cool um i want to host paco on one of these adobe lives and i already spoke to uh taco you would know samantha about it so hopefully we can get paco on here doing some showing off his skills he is super super awesome at that we have um jan is an enthusiast photographer nice oh cool michelle uses mostly um her own photos to create her composites nice nice yeah it's definitely uh if you do that then uh what's that one eric is it eric johnson is that yeah yeah that doesn't matter eric johansson johansen yeah he this is basically like something that he would uh do is something along the lines of this but that's he's also uh he does his own photography travels the world everything does that yeah he's one of the uh i don't know if it's the first but one of the very first um compositing type of um like well-known compositing artists i would say i think he started becoming well-known like i want to say in the early 2000s is when i first discovered him at least and when he started gaining popularity he's the only person that i know at least that's done a ted talk on photoshop yeah like uh well even when i was like young and learning i i he would always be like the reference that everybody would reference their work to uh he just has a lot of a lot of really sharp pieces and i think yeah it's definitely because he literally goes out and and does all of his assets a hundred percent himself wow yeah in in not only a hundred percent himself but some of these take a lot of work to shoot you know what i mean it's not just like oh i took a photo of a road or something it's like they're really involved photography shoots that also tie into this idea or sketch or something that he's got in his mind and and you know he's he's very good at what he does i'm gonna throw a bush on either side just kind of whining on here might as well right so easy just to add an element like that right just would have taken me forever to cut around that bush and and this is the the reason why i think pixel squid is great um for especially for elements like this right because you might be thinking well when am i going to need an electric right like or whatever this is but like a bush i feel like it's something that you would need in a lot of situations or the grass like you had it here and it's it might not be your main element but it's definitely an element that you can add to your composite to enhance it and you don't have to spend hours masking it or you know doing any of that stuff yeah and a bush would take for like so long because it'll be longer yeah longer than it should oh yeah for sure perfect and then i'm just going to throw it over here just to merge it all all together nice just throw behind that ladder there quickly this one has to be flipped though because the lighting i'm going to make um i'm going to make coming from right here because i can notice that he's got a lot of light on his elbow here so i'm not going to play around with that i'm just going to leave it how it is and work with it otherwise it could take me a little while to reverse it [Music] jan is sharing a tip in the chat if you don't want to go down the subscription route for pixel squid you can also buy items a la carte it's cheaper in the long run if you only need a few assets yeah if you need like a tree or something and it's cool because you don't even need like like the plug-in right on your uh on here like i just use it because it instantly imports but you can get all the assets right directly off of websites right in png format so let's uh yeah so now i'm going to just blend this guy in here because he's not matching at all but i'm going to do my lighting over here first so that i can determine what he needs he or she or whatever the elk wants to classify themselves as let's go what does the banana actually do anything or does it just chill there uh when you click on it you'll get a drone drop off for lunch like you know just a drone from adobe san jose comes up and drops you off somewhere yeah and by the way if you want to get rid of it you have to hold um are you on you're on my mac right yeah you have to hold uh oh you're on windows yep yeah you have to hold alt on windows and click on done on that menu i'm just going to keep it there banana gang yeah banana king okay so this is the layer underneath so i basically just duplicate it bring it down again it doesn't have to be like anything too too fancy yep and i just want to remind everybody about the design feedback that's coming up in about 38 minutes so make sure that you submit your work into discord i know codybear has been posting the link in the chat so make sure that you click on that and submit your work i can actually see some submissions already so if you want sean and i to look over these submissions make sure that you submit yours because we wanna check out what you do and actually i see a lot of people submitting older daily creative challenges um so maybe we'll talk about some of the old ones as well cool and now i'm just going to do all the lighting for this little guy right here so you um apply the highlights by selecting a layer setting it to the overlay blending mode and painting with white is that correct yep yeah basically this is just a white layer overlay 100 and uh yeah for some reason i'm actually working with um a hundred percent today normally i'm working with around like 50 or even lower like i actually like to go to five percent normally i know it takes a while but i'm patient yep nice you definitely have to be patient when you're doing compositing because it it could some things just take forever you know it's just the nature of the business yep com compositing could like either it's either could take you two hours or it could take a 20. and and sometimes it's crazy how like you accidentally do something right fast and you know like you're the first thing that you try looks fantastic and you're like oh my god i can't believe it it was that easy and then you try to replicate it and it's never as good no matter how much time you spend on it never gonna turn out the same ever again yeah start it yeah i've had that a few times for i've tried to design the exact same composite over again even this one's not going to look exactly the same as the other one look a little bit off but right it's similar idea right like whoa yeah it looks like way different but yeah you just had my uh my good old lut here and that should change everything back to normal again you have a uh saved lut is that what it is or your own yeah yeah yeah i designed my own like way way way back in the day and i still use them like just to kind of add a little contrast or something to my imagery or uh nice balance up the colors a little bit more like there's kind of like experimental i just play around with them they don't always work but um they worked in this image nicely so yeah keep it like that nice so what's a lot a lot is basically just like uh all my uh so if i keep doing um all these adjustment layers up here on on a stock image it's basically just compiling all those together and then i can import it on every project that i use but um it's basically like a filter a color filter but the good part about it is that you can use it on um all of adobe's software yep so if i use it for video like if you like this color then you're like hey i want to do a video like this now you can because it has this color saved to it i'm not sure what else you can do but so i know that people in video use them a lot more intense than i do right jen is saying uh i'm a lut nut a lut nut yeah that's uh i can definitely say that uh i'm addicted to them as well i use them all the time they're uh they're really great um especially if uh if i'm not sure if anybody's ever seen like my instagram or anything like that but i use luts to keep the control of my coloring across all of my pictures so that's that's how they kind of look like the same all the time is that concept right there nice yep all right so now i'm gonna do all the shadowing underneath here and if you want to make your own lut so you have to do is just you know create a design with whatever adjustment layers you want and then go into file export and select lookup tables and you can export your lut file and that's right christy especially in after effects and premiere pro and we have sean's instagram in the chat so make sure that you click on that and give them a follow yeah i've been uh upping my game a little bit i've been kind of like working on a website for myself nice yeah i actually have it right here i had it ready but this is kind of what i'm working on right now it's got a link to my lives my discord everything it's all nice so somebody has 30 seconds which is the one link they need to click on now and check out sean reichen.live there you go as everything everything beautiful everything well not not everything but we don't have ubereats yet i don't have a kitchen um all right i'm just gonna make this a little bit bigger because the perspective is a little bit off on them talking about ubereats here's an idea for adobe while we're presenting and you know i'm hosting now you're working there should be like a button somewhere on behalf of they could just order us overeats so like hey you look a little thirsty sean here let me let me order you a coke or something yeah and then like some guy just knocks and then we can go and pick it up and you know say hey okay yeah thanks steve for the coke here's three free months of pixel squid yeah just start uh gathering an audience on the outside you know yeah that'd be funny just some random dude just showing up whoa i wouldn't know what to say jan wrote i'll put the link in the description every youtuber but they forget to do it that's happened to me so many times yeah i always say that i'm always just like check out the link after the stream and then i realized there's no i didn't put anything in the stream like it's looking pretty good oh go ahead sorry i was just gonna say i was just gonna edit some of the shadow work down here but what were you gonna say i was gonna say i really like the dirt on the panels are at the bottom i mean you didn't have to mask any of that and it just looks fantastic yeah i didn't have to i'm gonna do a little bit of light like leaks here and there on the top of the grass here just to bring in the lighting a little bit more but all the shadow like all the shadow work is completely guessed because in this sense like it's the lighting is so unrealistic that you almost can't match it because the sun would technically be behind this wall right but then there's obviously a light source in the room yeah there's a light source in the room and everything so i'm gonna try maybe we could put like a lamp or something here to show like a little bit more light coming from this direction to balance both scenes out but uh yeah we're just gonna i'm just gonna work on the shadowing under here a little bit the bob is asking it started raining over here in kent what about you over there in manchester jesus it was raining when i walked into the studio i haven't been outside for over an hour now maybe even two hours and i assume it's still raining and raining in england and we have 30 minutes everybody 30 minutes for the design feedback so make sure you submit your work into this the link is in the chat you can scroll up i'm sure cody bear will paste it again there shortly but make sure that you submit your work so that we can check out the hair swaps the new hairstyles that you're placing on your photos and i'm starting to see i'm starting to see more and more of them on here nice ted has submitted a couple so we'll definitely check them out ted now i'm just going to do the highlights in the grass here and there just give some light spots how do you decide how big your canvas is i always design eight and a half by eleven okay any particular reason uh yeah so um instagram actually s really supports the eight and a half by eleven nicely like it all kind of um it fills the entire screen so you you won't get somebody else's piece in there or somebody else's post if you post and they're scrolling down you're literally nice their whole screen nice so that's that's why i work in eight and a half by super cool and it's a default like printing size too right so i could put it on like i could print it at a print print shop or something if i wanted to put it on a shirt basically what i was doing back there was i just grabbed a white brush 14 opacity and i just set the layer to overlay and i just drew over the grass a little bit i'm gonna race right here because it went on the ladder but this is just a layer over top of everything else it's like my uh burn and dodge layer basically but just i didn't use the uh 12 fill with gray nice super cool i mean that simple layer is just basically white on it with overlay and it makes a huge huge difference huge difference yeah look at the grass looks so dead before and now it looks like magical super cool let's bring this all into camera raw now nice have you thought of a a question to ask the chat for another giveaway no i haven't even been thinking i already thinking at all but um we could probably give up some away to uh some of the creative challenges from earlier too oh that's right okay cool easily cool so make sure that you submit i don't know how we're gonna decide who who gets it from the daily creative challenge but we'll figure that out yeah that's true i guess this one is an eight and a half by eleven ratio oh there we go ah no that's still not eight and a half by eleven but whatever we'll we'll keep it like that we'll pretend that it is this one will go on behance and twitter [Laughter] i'll put it in uh i normally make like a uh a project kind of uh uh guide at the end so and i attach all my live streams all the information and everything into one behance project so follow me if you want to check that out i like how steve is just throwing out answers even though we haven't asked the question 42 blue let us know in the chat what's your default or your go-to design aspect ratio and or pixelation i usually do 1920 by 1080 because i do a lot of stuff on video so then i know i'm going to make a thumbnail out of it or it's going to be displayed on video somewhere so it's that's the my go-to default size remember to drink some water sean true i do need to drink some water yeah thank you thank the bob for that thank you yeah i appreciate that water alerts are are the greatest thing i literally have my watch telling me all the time to breathe and stuff like technology just tells me everything so you're gonna forget to breathe and just collapse i'm not wearing my watch how would i know steve wrote beer is 99 water we're gonna have to look at that i don't know if that's true but maybe it is i'd say coors would be like 100 water i like what sean is uh michelle is saying i like what shawn is doing i'm present uh presently creating different composites fragrant fragrant animals on a created landscape with bits of human traces example trails but no humans yeah oh that's pretty cool uh insight on looking at my uh my work it's kind of cool hearing what like other people like see from it you know because as an artist like you're never going to like fully understand what you're 100 like creating for others like you're never gonna like somebody else can make a story out of this and like it might not be my story um but yeah it's it's super cool hearing like um you know that people are inspired by that stuff so thank you i appreciate that yep and we have um evan uses square danis also uses the one to one ratio a square um jan also uses square for um let's see what cody bear also does square or eight by ten so a lot of squares ferry four by cool fairy wants to know if you add clarity to your work i i do i depends on the piece really so for this one i did add a little bit of clarity like it's like plus five actually plus six but let's go plus five i don't go like i wouldn't just go like a hundred like that because i think that that made it go from like a nice friendly vibe down to like something dark's about to happen right so that's why i just keep it light keep it nice and easy don't like i don't over over do that much because it's a step-by-step process so if you do like all these enhancements like once right at the start and boost it up like and every which way it's hard to go back but it's easier to step like slowly step your way into a uh an edit oh i just thought of a good question what's your what's what it is it's going to be a bit silly i'm going to write down a number and a piece of paper and see if we can guess it i never want to be like all right we got this number you get three free months of pixel squid yeah i don't know or i guess my most reached p like out of all the pieces that you see on my instagram what one is the one that went like the furthest the viral or the the most the most the biggest picture it's it's very obvious so yeah they have to go into your instagram and check is what you're saying yeah all right and then the person that writes it first is the person that that will get it yeah that will get okay so that's the question that's the question perfect all right first person i like how people already putting numbers down even though we didn't agree that yeah they're just they're just putting numbers just to be the first one we didn't even put a we didn't it's not even a number i don't even number my pizzas i don't think no but you know you know how i said guess you know write a number down on a piece of paper oh yeah everybody's just going great i'll listen to jesus right now look at my instagram your instagram see which is the most um liked or shared posts is that most yeah most uh biggest the biggest piece that uh had i don't know which one that is so you can have to look at the chat at some point [Music] no it's not the sonic one or the watermelon one or the latest one all right there we go don't tell them don't tell them it's down there you go all right it's not in the it's not on you know it's like above the fold it's not above the fold the outfit keeps growing i'll read them out to you octopus in the toilet nope all right that was a good one though so right now i'm just using a iris blur so uh basically you just go to filter uh blur gallery and then it's right there and i'm just setting kind of like the focal points like really small in here so that it still blurs around the edges a little bit but i'm gonna move this up so that you can still see the quality of that oh i think somebody got it is it the stan lee one yep stanley one so uh danis stanley you got it make sure that you message sean privately and he'll get you the three months i'll get you one three months yeah three months pixel yep pixel squid there you go and other people are now uh typing stan lee uh but the first person was yeah dennis is that who it was yeah danis was the first person who typed up stanley when i read i remember you talking about that last time you and i did a stream together yeah one of my biggest piece i didn't even i didn't use like hashtags or anything because i like i just wanted to dedicate a piece to stan lee um but i didn't use hashtags nothing and all sudden that that piece went like on reddit everywhere all over the place it's like crazy yeah that one is uh i was nuts all right so we're uh i'm just going to redo that um so what are the rule of thumb what are the where do they have to message ub hands is that where yeah just message me on behance um if if you personally know me then you can message me wherever like if you already they can come to your house you can knock on your phone yeah just walk on over yeah just you live in canada just yeah stop on by you you'll cook dinner for them that's a canadian thing probably right so we gotta you have to treat every guest with with 100 respect nice again a reminder for the design feedback that's in about 20 minutes make sure you submit your work into discord that's where we're going to review the photoshop daily creative challenge which i hosted today and we worked on hair replacements so should be a fun one little hair replacement yeah i think i've had to fix my hair a few times in photoshop i'm not gonna lie wait what i i've i've had to fix my hair a few times yeah where i take a selfie and i'm like ah just stop flowing right oh my god let us know in the chat if you ever had a photoshop yourself for like a selfie or something whatever like a resume picture or something for anything i'm trying to think i'm trying to think what i because i know i've done it but i'm trying to think of like something i think i photoshopped a mustache across my face one time that said like real man oh my god in typography but it was made out of like mustache hairs and it was for movember right so i was challenging all my friends to like movember to raise money and everything oh man and uh and yeah i think i think that was yeah one of my uh weird weirder edits of myself i'd say one of the one of the most random ones that i did was i was traveling through spain and i was in sevilla i think i was in and i was at a like coffee shop and i was working on a composite that i had to submit for um i don't know people in the chat know karen alsop who every year she has this really cool compositing um project where she takes photos of children in children's hospitals throughout the world and then different artists will work in a composite to place the child with santa or whatever their favorite character is that's really cool super cool um but uh yeah check out karen allsup at storyart.com i believe it's her website and i've helped her out for the last two years and anyway so i was i was in in spain and i'm working in this coffee shop on this composite and then she messages me and says hey i need a photo of you working on the composite like oh my god i haven't done my hair and god knows how long and i haven't shaved so i had to like liquefy my hair to make it look oh my god and then just like remove some facial hair so i'd look presentable but that was probably the last time that i did that um we have some questions um let me see will we be able to download the keith herring brushes after the session while re-watching it or is it for a limited time sean i believe it's for a like you'll be able to download the brushes right after this stream that's for sure i know that but i do believe that they are available for a limited time so i would totally hop on that like asap um but yeah all you have to do is just click add to your library as soon as you go to the link and then i think you keep those that brush pack just in your photoshop forever i'm pretty sure and also you can save brushes into your libraries as well so you can have um your favorite brushes in the library and use them from anywhere well that's what that's what it does anyways you can't uh you can't use the abr file oh so it's a library asset got it you got it okay cool um what does clarity basically do to the image any idea uh yeah i would say that it sharpens or or deepens the contrast and shadows i'd say like and it really boosts like the highlights so it would be boosting highlights and darkening shadows but touching nothing else i i would say that that's probably what it what it's doing the technical term what it's doing technically behind the scene is adding contrast to edge pixels which includes adding adding contrast adding highlights and shadows as you were saying yeah and the texture slider um adds contrast to mid frequency information if i remember correctly um and actually fun fact uh matt kloskowski who was on the stream here i want to say almost like six months ago maybe longer he was saying and that was news to me that the way that adobe came up with that tool is that they were looking for a skin smoothing slider but then they realized that it's actually great you know doing the opposite would add really good texture so that's how the texture slider came about wow i didn't know that but that's what i learned from matt kloskowski excellent photographer check him out at mackay.com yeah it's all it's got a bunch of uh you can almost do you can almost do clarity through the high pass sharpen it would almost work out like the exact same way but thinner well so the the high pass so filter other um high pass is what you're talking about yeah that's exactly the opposite of what the filter blur gaussian blur is doing so if you add like you know two pixels of high pass and two filled in two pixels of caution blur you can technically put those two layers on top of each other which uh with i forget what blending mode like hard light or something and then you'll get your original image back so with this filter you're removing low frequency information and with the blur you're removing high frequency information i know it's all technical doesn't mean anything but that's what it's that's what's going on behind the scenes um i love the high pass sharpen it's great yeah really really good way of adding uh sharpening to the to an image i'm gonna put the link there because michelle was talking about it for the children's thing that we did um yeah so when you when i share this link um you should be able to see i'm just gonna put it in the chat and in the chat now is that link to the storyart.com website for karen allsup and you can see some of the composites that a bunch of artists not just me completed for these kids during christmas i worked like i said i worked on one last year and then the year before wow but yeah you can check them all that all out there yeah i just bookmarked that definitely want to check that out that's a really cool project idea yeah really really cool yeah like getting involved like that with your art is uh it's really it's really inspiring you know yeah definitely it's uh i've done the same kid his name is corey two years in a row and um he is about maybe i want to say he's about 11 now um and yeah i've i've done a composite for him twice now cool that was actually um i haven't been to the to karen's website i guess since last um december december so i was trying to figure out where the one that i did was so i could show you guys in the chat but i'm having trouble finding it but it's all there you guys could just um navigate through the website and you could see um the work that was created by different artists people that you might know colin smith from photoshop cafe i'm trying to think if lisa carney did one maybe lisa carney did one as well i don't recall exactly but yeah check it out cool hmm i think i'm gonna add like a fire hydrant here super cool it's got like some nice i think that lighting actually almost matches the composite yeah the lighting's pretty close yeah i'm trying to figure out because i know they had a like a special page for it not just on karen's website but i mean i'm sure it's there you guys could check it out cool does anyone hear in the chat still listen to records like an actual record player haven't i haven't i used to have a record player really i bought it for a dollar at an auction nice and uh i ended up moving around so much and when i moved from one place to another i wasn't able to we couldn't fit it in the truck because it was so big so i ended up having to leave it back in my old place and so somebody else is enjoying it but uh yeah definitely definitely a steal for a dollar but i yeah i used to listen to them i find that they have better sound quality than than like a regular uh player does right but yeah it's just obviously hard to get uh newer music on on such a old piece of tech definitely i remember um my grandfather's still having eight tracks uh eight track tapes actually like the eight tracks like an account like before cassette player oh yeah like the the thick like thing the thick looking things yeah yeah they're like these cartridges yeah they look like the old any like ninja yeah yeah kind of like that yeah we used to have um when i was young uh we didn't have ipods or iphones or anything right so we had um these little mini clip things and they would literally play 20 seconds of a song wow it's like a it's like an animated gif for music yeah basically it was there was something else i don't know uh i don't know how successful that uh that product took off but i know after a while they stopped making them so i don't think it was so i'm gonna ask you this question but this is also for the chat um what do you listen to when you're working uh lo-fi lo-fi nice pretty sure that's a huge genre for artists it's only because there's like no lyrics in it oh man can we make one of the questions for the uh well i'll let people answer in the chat and i'll talk about the question later like what do you guys listen to as you work so sean listens to lo-fi tim says oh hey sean happy to have you back so soon that's right what's up tim how's it going steve wrote eight tracks always sounded horrible jan is saying that sound quality has done has gone downhill in many ways oh yeah compared to this old old beauty oh man keith is saying does anyone have i omega drives i you know what i have i had even thought about an i omega drive for over 10 years that's so great i remember i used to be like the coolest things to have back in the day okay so and listens to epic music beatles emotionals cinematic steve listens to all jazz or blues dutch uh dutch death metal that's death pedal that's a that sounds cool that sounds really good it sounds very specific like i've never i don't think i've heard that i don't think i've ever heard that before but it sounds pretty cool jan tiersen anika i put either reggae or a movie with music in the background this is what heather commented michelle wrote i listened to silence when working okay so this is like the one serial killer thing i used to do you still like put on headphones and like they wouldn't be connected to anything i would just have them on because i'm working and like the cable just be hanging down for hours and i'm just like working i haven't done that in a while but i used to do that like i don't know i just i just i guess i needed to concentrate and didn't want any external sounds to bother me oh yeah i did i did that too with my uh apple uh earphones like when i was in class i would just keep him in at all times you know i would never never take him out just no music was playing it's completely silent it just feels yeah it feels like something's tugging your ear and it's nice yep playing lists they created mix of all uh genres uh cody bear listens to nature ambiance well i well she works um brian jass oh uh dennis doesn't like music um while working usually you might watch a youtube video cool that's true yeah um very low-fi and classics sometimes arthur offer afro-brazilian songs cool um keith doesn't know what lo-fi music is do you mind explaining sean uh it's basically just like relaxing kind of like piano and uh you know orchestra kind of music but there's just no lyrics in the background so it's kind of nice because you can really focus and somebody's just not like yelling random words and stuff to set your your path on a different or set your mind on a different path but uh sometimes i'll listen to like there are lyrics sometimes in lo-fi songs but you won't hear like a full track or anything like that but it's basically just music without uh okay lyrics uh plus one on lo-fi for paco by the way we have the design feedback in about five minutes so make sure that you submit your work cody where i'm sure we'll post the link in the chat oh there it is oh my god cody bear beat me to it good job cody bear i wasn't even paying attention that you already had the link on there thank you jen wrote i think lo-fi gets old fast oh yeah it does for sure 100 but there you go keith oh sorry what was that sean when you're working you know it's it's i i just feel like when i i have so many things going on my mind goes like all over the place but yeah 100 agree it does get old very very fast yeah keith i like that answer i'm going to start listening to replays of jesus while i work as you should well done keith well done cool so now we're adding some i'm guessing some depth of field here by blurring the objects yeah just just bringing yeah bringing some things forward here just so that you can you know there's just more of a of an arrow kind of pointing towards the subject i'm not sure how i feel about these things yet i just kind of randomly place it this is kind of like my experimental phase at this point um like i know that uh this is a really good base composite to work with now it's just adding like extra elements like small things like i can add like uh before i believe i had a uh i'm not i'm probably not gonna put the vinyl player i'm gonna bring back that paint bucket that i had here just to theme it a little bit more but this would be like my base image um so this would take me like hours to get to this point and then from that point i just use pixel squid blend everything in together uh camera raw all that but this is just like the uh i mean it's fantastic thanks man i appreciate that some nice levels anybody in the chat want to guess what i like to listen to while i work um brownie points if you guess the actual artist you you listen to one specific artist when you no i'm saying yeah oh my goodness no well i there's an artist that i particularly like so uh almost every day i would listen to a song at least that makes sense yeah yeah i have a i thought that you're gonna be like me where you you like to replay the same song a few times over and over again i do that sometimes if there's a new song that i like you know i'm like all right let me let me remember the lyrics or whatever yeah sometimes you're just feeling it and you're like yeah this is actually pretty good oh my god jen got it right away eminem yeah eminem yeah his new song with uh is pretty good which one the the one with uh kid cudi oh okay yup yup it's a lot of i didn't think you guys were gonna get it that fast but maybe i mentioned it before jan i don't know but that was super quick yeah i grew up listening to a lot of a lot of hip-hop and rap as a kid yep same i'm i'm a 90s kid so you know that 90s rap the much music cds yeah much much music dance cds ramstein yeah you know what ramsay is actually kind of cool i like runs oh i mean i don't say a lot i've heard a couple of songs and i don't speak german but do they even have anything in english i remember when i was a kid that had a lot of in my high school there was a lot of kids playing rhyme stein in german for some reason i don't i don't even know what they were saying but i remember my like kids in my school playing it thank you heather i appreciate that my work is so inspiring definitely and we have about 30 seconds for the design feedback so make sure you submit your work we're about to get started pretty soon i know sean's going to put a few finishing touches on his composite i like how i like how you're using the tren uh the transform distort feature to match the perspective on the composite oh yeah gotta gotta match that perspective because you're not always gonna have like the 3d objects not always going to be at the same level or at the same perspective but using those tools you can definitely make it the same perspective yeah and i like how you're using the brush there to make it seem like the grass is covering that paint really cool and then here's here's a really really cool trick so see how sharp those those lines are so now i'm going to layer mask and i uh and i blur the layer mask i don't blur what's underneath of it so super cool and it basically creates that more realistic blurred up front kind of grass now because it was blurred there so and those are the realistic details you have to keep in mind like even even that i mean because you could have left it like it was right but then just spending an extra 10 seconds just takes it to a whole another level yeah and then even like even how they're not matching each other then you just kind of there you go oh my god jen you have excellent memories so i meant oh my god how do you even remember i had i hadn't thought about that until i just read it so jan wrote jesus you mentioned eminem and lose yourself and karaoke with matt klaus and he wrote klaus and capital letters because then he also remembered the joke in a previous stream i watched those oh he said he watched it yesterday oh okay all right oh okay because that was like you know six months ago or something and i was like oh my god i don't yeah i cannot remember six months back that's yeah we were uh we were making fun of me i was making fun of matt because uh somebody left him a comment on i don't know which social media matt kloskowski has his name and somebody essentially said um your last name is too difficult to spell or to pronounce why don't you just change it to klaus so i started calling him matt klaus uh but yes like we and then matt and i were in back in the days when used to be able to go out and hang out with people uh matt and i were in new york city and we went to a karaoke bar with a bunch of other photographers and i did do a beautiful rendition of eminem which matt has on video but i think i'm going to like steal his phone and delete it um cool so yeah that's yawn okay so i'm gonna have to start saying uh jan's name i definitely do not have do not have the norwegian pronunciation right um all right cool so it's time for the design feedback um sean any any um we might have time to come back and maybe add one or two little tiny things i'm not sure but um anything you want so i'll probably you know as a designer i get addicted to designing so i'm probably gonna play around with this uh more but and we'll open it up again tomorrow but we're not going to continue on with this one tomorrow we're going to start something else and do something else you know get a little mix and match but but yeah this is kind of what i wanted to create for you all today uh just using like the keith herring brushes in the background there showing you how easy it is to you know take an empty room and make something out of it so cool um yeah awesome well thanks so much and let me switch over to my screen now i think i'm it's safe for me to do that give me one second now i have to figure out this uh zoom situation [Laughter] here we go share screen and i hope that you can see my screen cool let me in the chat if you can see my screen it should be discord cool um sean can you see what i'm looking at uh no i can't oh you can't there it is okay cool you guys can see it all right awesome perfect cool so we're on my screen now and this is discord um if you want to get here um cody bear has been posting the link throughout the stream so you can click on that and make sure that you click on the current challenge tab right here and this is where we're gonna look at today's daily creative challenges we were doing hair replacements in photoshop so this is the first submission by jd so i'm gonna go ahead and click on this and see a larger version and i don't know why it's taking so long to load it should have loaded already so let me try that again so weird um i guess we can just look at this score yeah yeah we'll just look at this smaller preview and can i zoom in through my browser yeah i can zoom in with my browser so we'll do that and um yeah i'll let you start sean what do you think about this so we we're working on hair replacement so obviously that's not his real hair any tips i think it looks pretty good the only thing that you have to kind of like keep in mind when you're doing hair is that there will be like a glare across the front of the hairline only because it's full like curving at that point and going back so like everything else is actually like it's pretty good like uh maybe the back of the the hair a little bit warp it in like we uh with the perspective tool that we use today easy easy fix but it looks like pretty realistic like for my uh my point of view like what i see it looks like because i saw the original it almost looks like uh yeah like a completely different haircut mm-hmm yeah and so i didn't mention this during the stream but one if i would have had my time something that i would have talked about was to maybe draw in some of the stray hairs that are coming out of his his hair um it just looks too straight too smooth just that a little bit more of you know a couple straight hairs here and there just to make it feel more realistic perfect yeah and i think that's the biggest especially when you're doing um 3d but also in compositing nothing in the real world is really perfect so when you have really smooth sharp edges that's when things start looking a little fake so even though these edges may not be necessarily straight they're very sharp and that wouldn't certainly happen in the hairline you will see some variants so just just work on that and maybe work a little tiny bit more on the masking for these individual hairs sean you're just showing people how to blur on the mask another thing you can do is select the the um smudge tool and just smudge on the actual mask to create basically hairs coming out or pushing hair in so that's something that you you can do if you like let me scroll down and this is uh all right um again i'll let you start sean and i'll take over after you i think it looks really good um just maybe more uh lighting on like the actual actual subject itself but it this would look like really good on like a book cover or like a movie cover or something like that i get that huge like movie cover kind of vibe right now like dvd case because you haven't got room for information in the bottom corners and at the top there yeah i think it turned out really well from what i can see yeah i think i think maybe brighten it just a little bit more i think that the problem is that the shadows are just so um flat there's no contour so maybe if you know part of his face was a little darker you know follow the contours of the face the contours of the body the shirt and all that and then just work yeah that instead of just like a flat gradient it might look a little bit better yeah like on the up on the shoulder there too like see how uh down the arm it has like a highlight yeah up on the shoulder it would also have that at the top like especially because you see that bright light here yeah so that i you definitely will need to add that rim light all on this side yeah i mean you already created um this bright light here so you have to continue what that light would hit because you started here yeah um you just need to go here and on the hair as well but overall good job the hair i mean i couldn't tell that that's not his real hair you know i guess the yeah no i couldn't uh yeah i couldn't tell at all it looks pretty it looks really realistic that's pretty good pretty good let's scroll down and okay here we go this is oh no i'm sorry who was this this was from uh fairy thank you so much and this is from uh ted cool let me just click on this so it looks like ted also composited um i don't know if this is ted or somebody else but composited the person into the background that we were using for for the the the stock photo that i used which was not part of the challenge but no problem it's all good so what do you think here sean uh yeah so like since you are did take that extra step like to um take a subject out i would say like yeah the around the edges and stuff you know to make sure that your subject is fully within the frame like it looks like his shoulder might be missing there but from like the actual tutorial part where you're supposed to do like the hair and stuff like i really like how you went with a gray uh hair or after that because it's an older older subject so i like how you kept that in mind you know it's not going to be like pink hair right across right why not yeah but i would say like maybe um the left like work with your levels and stuff on on like the the gray because gray hair is kind of like more on the white side um rather than like on the the charcoal side yeah so maybe like add more whites in there more highlights get bringing that contrast back to match the contrast of the actual subject um but it looks pretty good it looks pretty good i agree um so i like how you added these strands of hair just coming out i would add maybe just a few more like i mentioned earlier it also looks like the shadows are not dark enough so i know he's supposed to have you know gray hair but if his hair was you know if like the mid-tone is this shade of gray the shadows would be way darker than this shade here so i probably would add just a little bit more of contrast to to match the rest of the image because you can see that the rest of the image the shadows are way deeper so it doesn't necessarily match but in terms of placing it on his head you got the right perspective you got the right um angle so that looks pretty good [Music] oh nice all right so what do you think here sean i definitely think that it might need a little bit more blending okay like you you kind of you have the template and everything like that blank head ready uh i just feel like the hairline might not be matching the actual hairline of the subject like unless he had a really bad haircut that one day and the barber went all the way to the back but uh but i don't know yeah maybe focus more on like the actual like blending of like the hair element on top rather than you know just placing it and saying okay that that looks you know good like add more shadows lightness levels right it also looks like the hair is going over his ear too yeah want to fix that and also if you're going to create um so what i would recommend if if this was a job that i had where i wanted to give somebody a mohawk and then like the side of their head is shave i would actually composite somebody's head into it like the you know like a shave head on top of the original head and then work with yet another layer on top of that you know what i mean in reality we have three layers the original layer the head with the bolt head and then the the hair that way it matches better that's assuming that the that this particular set of hair here didn't have the bald head um you know it's because here looks like you just painted it and if you just started cloning or doing something like that it would just look too patchy and not real so it might be better just to bring in another photo of like somebody's bald head and put it below that as a base layer yeah it's like your texture yeah your skin texture nice and this is the numbers was this a hair replacement um wow if it was i can't even is it i think i i mean it might be wow well that if it is and that's great because we can't tell so yeah so you yeah i can't tell at all like i i mean i've done all the challenges and i can't think which other challenge this would be i think i don't think that they they might have not though because if i look at like the the sweater it looks like the sweater is kind of merging with the hair uh-huh but as you know you never know with photoshop though right right you could it could be i don't know well if this is a composite excellent yeah excellent excellent job black becky yeah oh here we go did his um hair swap and yeah much much better i think way better yeah and it kind of like go ahead son definitely looks like the you know like the same contrast as the actual yeah yeah yeah it looks much much better yeah not much not much to say we basically um i i don't think he did this while we were talking but he basically fixed all the issues that we mentioned earlier great job ted yeah thank you ted for the submission oh wow whoa this is from uh a looks uh my god i'm not gonna be able to say that i look sign and i'm sorry if i'm mispronouncing whatever your handle name is but excellent job sean what do you think the insane job i think you did a really good job yeah holy that's like something that you would see on like on those facebook ads that are like you want to look like this yeah get a new hair growth formula or something yeah i mean the the slight slights like little tiny baby critique is maybe just make it us a bit tad darker if you look at his original hair and his facial hair is just much darker this is way brighter so i think that's taking away from like the excellent job you didn't yeah blending it and matching it but besides that excellent work yeah it's really good actually like really good really really good you know plot twist this is the photoshop plot twist is actually the other way around yeah that's what uh yeah i have to mention that too it's crazy though like either way like it would be unbelievable right i wouldn't know yeah great job this is gonna go right up on his uh linkedin and facebook and all that yeah i also like like how even like the contrast like around the the facial hair like i know is already there before but you did match like the blacks of your beard with the black in the hair again like so it does kind of yeah the only yeah definitely the highlights would be something just tone it down a little tad bit but other than that like like that's pretty good you can throw that up there on like any one of your profiles and it's going to be believable yeah yeah oh here we go this is wait is this the same one was there an updated okay so the rim light got added to the shoulder here yep so see that looks much much better way cleaner like the lighting from the subject shows them more as like a uh an actual like like they're actually standing there in front of the light now right rather than standing sort of behind but sort of in front at the same time it was kind of like a weird angle that the light would have been on yep alex way better yeah much much better thank you for that fairy um okay so this is uh wow wow uh which is yeah so this is one and this is the other okay so just because of the masking you see that line here right there yeah just notice that yeah that was and just the white around the sort of some of the on the left side there yeah i mean you did an excellent excellent job in the blending here on her on her forehead and and the shadows and everything like if you were to just clean up the mask like an extra 10 you have almost the perfect composite grab that keith herring brush set a little put it on that vinyl scraper and go around and it would blend it back in again and literally make it look natural that's what i've been using for my um the hair like fix i'm really using the yeah the keith herring brush set and i use the vinyl scraper and it works amazing like so good yep and this is uh challenge number six by the way adding a an ornament to your uh to uh a portrait using a pattern along a path but excellent excellent job i mean definitely if if you just kind of see it without really paying attention you can't tell yeah you have to like really look this is an excellent excellent job um anika thank you so much really good oh we have is this enough yeah ted yeah ted has an update facial wait he had it yeah he had a facial hair wow not bad he's slowly developing as we go down he's adding like he's growing his hair yeah another plot to us john this is the original photo no i think it looks really good i would have maybe added a little bit more because you you can see how his facial hair's hair is going over that crease like right here a little bit more yeah yeah but besides that i think it looks great the liquefied tool would definitely help you out at bottom corner definitely liquify yeah really really good job every time we look at um at your submission ted it keeps improving so i'm glad you can see that that you are improving okay here we go oh this is from uh abandoned designer he's 11 years old nice what do you think i think it's pretty good i almost think that it might uh have a lot of contrast around the face again like it's pretty dark around around her face because if you look at her face it's still bright like the light is shining right on it and everything like that from the original photo so i would just you know keep that in mind when you're doing edits like this still and and apply that same filter like that same effect to what you're putting in front of their face like because the lightness doesn't change dramatically um but it would it would obviously go darker lower around the neck but not much like up at the top of the hairline there it'd be really light shadows yeah and also the shadow feels like it's it's creating a lot of separation between the hair and the model so it looks like you have like an inch of a gap between her hair and her face so maybe if you just bring the shadow up a little more and bring down the opacity that will do wonders to the composite and make it feel more realistic yeah cool awesome job bam damn designer thank you so much so this is after and this is before cool so let's take a quick look at the before okay and after this is lee designer eight years old wow yeah see like this is uh again like what you were saying before like the loose hair strands like this would be a perfect picture to use like sort of like a sort of loose hair it's not don't go crazy with it but you you know it would really merge your your hair back with your actual subject itself yeah i also noticed that like the bottom of the right side uh there or maybe it's left side here you uh yeah right there is kind of no uh sorry other side yeah there you go perfect that's kind of like behind the the shoulder uh but if you brought that ahead then it would really create that like you know uh hair look to it again it won't because hair necessarily won't be behind your shoulder and a head while looking directly forward yeah and also for a hairstyle like hers and the type of hair that she has the hair is really straight and just coming down her head but it the way that it was photoshopped in it kind of looks like it's leaning towards the right of the screen so maybe either moving it or liquefying it over to the left a little more so it feels like it's actually her head and not you know just like some weird lump next to her head but yeah i mean eight years old man really really good wait actually when i was eight holy i was i was i don't even know what i was making when i was safe i wasn't making anything i was playing with what are those things called when we have a stick and a string yeah i didn't i didn't even touch photoshop till i was like 19. oh my goodness let's see um this is before oh wait where's the f oh okay we saw the the oh okay okay oh wow here we go look at this oh my goodness he just removed it completely or added it or yeah or at actually yeah maybe uh no no no it's removed it's removed um i'm trying to despise this by is this by venus yeah okay i know him yeah he he definitely removed his hair in this section okay cool really good though wow you can't even well some some of you you can see some of your clone work behind the hat yeah they're in the back yeah that's and that's what i was talking that's what i was talking about earlier if you don't have enough to clone from doing like an actual swap might be the way to go but the excellent job the only place where i can really tell there's some patching going on is right here and if you fix this area here i think you got it oh yeah for sure excellent excellent wow that looks like yeah you almost can't tell which one was which yeah super cool all right son what do you think nice i like this uh they got the loose hair strands yeah even uh with this one though yeah um what we said before definitely needs to do the blurring technique that we did today just around the mask or the smudge technique uh it's just a little too sharp for if you look at the depth of field in the image you see how blurred that is so the hair would almost be the exact same way right right the only part that would be like sharp still would be uh in front right in front basically yeah yeah and also uh one thing that i really like that they did is they if you notice the shadows have this bluish tint they added it to the hair so good job on that oh yeah really good job yeah it looks really natural definitely this is from mark thank you mark and wait what is this uh new hairdo with a wait so so i'm guessing they just added the uh the grass brush is that what's going on i think so yeah nice so if you really wanted to do this my biggest critique is the shadow is not contouring to the to the um clouds yeah i would and also the hair isn't uh touching the head yeah for some reason the shadow bothers me more but just here okay so here's a here's um uh how much time do we have we got like oh wait we don't have that much time do we we have like a minute we oh okay cool so so okay cool so uh let me i was gonna show something we'll show it tomorrow um updated oh wow they're already updating it according to the phone um oh wow they're all updating nice yeah nice yeah they look fantastic great and you see without that sharp line this looks much better i still think that this side needs a little bit of work you know what you can do here you can actually copy some of this hair oh copy it and then just paste it over on those areas you know just so you can kind of see the same curl just on the edges so it's not a hard sharp edge that's smart cool awesome well thank you so much for submitting all your work i'll be back again tomorrow at 9am doing another photoshop daily creative challenge 9am pacific that is that's 5 p.m for me here in the uk and um sean will also be back again tomorrow if i'm not wait a second of course any any uh preview of

manchester uk at the moment let us know in the chat where you're watching from um yeah so can you so yesterday we worked on uh cerrito composite which was super super cool let us know what we're working on today perfect so today we will be um we're gonna be working on a penguin piece i i absolutely um i've started this series like years and years ago just about penguins they're they're literally one of my favorite animals i don't know why i think it just has to do with like the connection to yellow yellow being like my favorite color and them just having like yellow just on the side like around their head in like the most simplistic way like i don't know i just think that they're really elegant creatures so like i always like to photoshop them into uh some pieces so today we're gonna make them uh pirates cool yeah so sounds sounds good before we get started let me just take care of a few housekeeping items but first let me say hi to the chat we have a lot of people in the chat saying hello we have steve janice wade um sean is back again hey sean fairy wade um christy a lot of familiar faces thank you so much for helping out in the chat sam and wade super super cool we have um people watching from the netherlands from minnesota from california we're in california are you ann marie let us know um central florida cool we got people from all over the world so thank you so much for watching and um so yesterday we uh i guess knighted you into the secret society of banana tool users so let us know in the chat if you're also part of the banana tool banana the banana gang that's right feel free to put a banana emoji in the chat and if you're not make sure you add a banana into your tool bar yeah um so before we get started i want to let everybody know that in about an hour and a half we're going to do the design feedback based on the photoshop daily creative challenge that i just completed less than five minutes ago we created a surreal portrait so i know that i'm excited to see what you guys have made sean i'm sure that you're gonna like this one it's a compositing surreal uh type of project which is right up your alley things that you um definitely enjoy i'm sure actually yeah i was actually tuned in and um yeah i quit i think i have quickly hear an image that i actually um did following that same style so just as like a little bit of um inspiration you know before you know you get started so in case you want to check it out but yeah i designed something something similar not really following like this same exact technique right but yeah but it will be um it's basically something similar yeah something similar cool we have um yeah we have megan from alberta canada oh we have nate from zimbabwe matt from washington dc there's a lot of bananas in the chat so that makes me happy a lot of bananas a lot of bananas bananas and pajamas says steve super cool michelle with her banana mia with her banana abdullah has i don't know how many bananas but he's part of the banana that is the banana gang right there and uh i guess we're looking at your um composite here sean on screen if i'm not mistaken this is from your instagram yeah instagram at sean reichen make sure you check him out follow him and like that photo yeah somewhat similar to what i worked on today obviously you spent a whole lot more time and super super cool are those birds from pixel squid or not no they actually are not they're um i believe they're from adobe stock um just i like the angles that they were all at and uh sometimes you know i don't always use pixel squid but uh cool yeah you know it depends on uh the element itself nice and kind and before we get started let me just quickly pull up the schedule i'm sure the schedule will come up in just a moment and yeah so we started uh with spencer than me doing the photoshop daily creative challenge now again i'm not going to be biased like i wasn't biased yesterday i'm not biased again today but i think that the best stream is happening now with you sean reichen at doing photoshop compositing and right after us is the talented ryan that's how i call him ryan ryan paul doing the illustrator daily creative challenge so make sure that you stick around for an awesome day of streams and uh yeah it's gonna be a great great day the reason that um i called paul ryan is because that's his middle name and paul calls me by my not necessarily my middle name my middle name is alfredo but my family calls me freddy so he calls me freddie i call him his family calls him ryan so there you go cool so i think we're ready to get started oh before i forget um sean you wanted to give out some some oh yes pixel squid i have six squid yes i have six and yeah i also created questions last night so actually i actually have some questions um so uh actually i would like to give away one right now at the start let's do it let's do it because it kind of like leads into my artwork and what we're doing so the question is everybody in chat this will get one or three months of pixel squid for the first person who answers all right first person get ready okay so get ready what cause do i always stand for with my artwork ooh what cause does sean always stand for with his artwork i think i know the answer i'm not gonna blur it out i'll tell you if i was right or wrong nice people are saying in the chat that they love pixel squid by the way uh it looks like um people may not know what we mean by banana so maybe you want to show them how to add the banana a little later on yeah yeah sure i can definitely now that i know now that i have all the this this is it uh environmental conservation environment global warming no no conservation i do stand for those things but it's not not that's not the main one that i i stand for the penguins green green peace environment no you talked about it a little bit yesterday if i'm not mistaken i did yeah so you talked about it yesterday come on guys some somebody yeah somebody's gonna go and watch a replay you know global warming nature taco tuesday whale taco tuesday i fight for taco tuesdays bring it back so what i did quickly just because i knew i might get a little carried away talking uh this morning so i uh just masked the penguins into the boat i also kind of cropped the top of his head off because i added a you know little pirate hat there uh well nice edit fully or blend or do anything with it yet i haven't done anything so i basically just placed the elements so i know where i'm going to be starting because i always just i like to place all my things first before i get right into it right oh wait wait did michelle get it right uh social anxiety so well i i guess like i would consider and yeah i would consider that because anxiety like social anxiety would be the type of anxiety that i sort of have but anxiety is definitely like something that i fight for so are we giving michelle michelle michelle grabs the uh three m the first three months we still have six so uh michelle feel free to send me a message through b hands correct your b hands yeah it'll be hands right so this account michelle lightstein i'm sorry if i mispronounced your last name but yes please uh message sean through behance and he'll get you the three months of pixel squid some of these other guesses are pretty good i'm sorry that i say sean did i miss okay cool um but some of these answers are pretty good like you stand for taco tuesday for yeah gluten-free artwork yeah definitely that would be a really good one standing for taco tuesday cool all right so what i'm going to do now is i'm just going to blend the penguins in here i'm just going to work on the hat first because this is my smaller element but i'm going to bring up my pixel squid plug-in here first and just enhance the quality of these penguins now when you do that you have to make sure that your masks are unlinked so that the object can actually like flow it doesn't have to keep the mask in mind and yeah so because whenever there's a mask on it for some reason if you make it high quality the object just goes super massive i don't know why but uh yeah so we um yeah so i'm just gonna boost the quality here this is both the penguins perfect and now i'm going to start just basically merging this hat on it's kind of looking a little flat here so i'm going to follow the curvature of his head a little bit and i'm just going to do that using the penguin layer because i actually have it above um if you notice there is a gap here so if i were to have this layer on top then you would have to erase basically all of this so i'm better off just bringing that behind and working with the penguin it's less less to work with um so i'm just gonna make sure that all my brushes are good all right perfect and i'm just gonna go through here and i'm just erasing now oh there we go now i'm erasing i kind of want to follow like a uh the same curve that he's had that he has at the top of the head here perfect all right that's looking good but now it's kind of looking like it's blending in with the with the penguin there so we're gonna add some shadows up front here but i'm gonna clip mask that into the the hat um so that i'm not messing around with the penguin oh hardness all the way down gonna turn my opacity down to around let's go to 20 percent nice and you're just um adding a nice little contact shadow or yeah yeah so as you can see now it's getting kind of like darker down here and then i'm going to go into the penguin now with the exact same kind of basically doing the exact same thing just a little bit a little bit lighter so i'm going to set my opacity to 10 now which is about half and i'm just gonna do that exact same thing just along the bottom now [Music] mia is saying penguins are so cool they're the seagulls of the southern hemisphere lol they used to steal my food at the beach in my goodness yeah we i don't really have like any just wild penguins just roaming around here you're in toronto right or toronto area yeah yeah i assume there was penguins everywhere in toronto yeah that picture that i that i made a long time ago with the penguins on the subway train was real oh yeah straight out of camera yeah straight up camera no post so i'm going to just open up some other elements i added in here i'm going to just um kind of start placing all my things around so i kind of want to put like a pirate flag like going in the wind the reason why they're both facing in the same direction the penguins on this boat is because i want to picture the boat going like that way right so if this person was looking the opposite direction it doesn't really show that they're moving forward so we're gonna do like a little water trail behind here and everything but first i'm going to create like a little pirate like a diy kind of pirate flag right there's a question in the chat michelle is asking can we convert a pixel mask into a vector mask can a pixel like a layer mask into a vector mask um so yeah so the way that you would do that uh michelle so you won't get the softness but if you were to like for example sean right now has a layer mask on that penguin if you hold command on a mac or control on windows and and make a selection out of it then you can go into the into the path panel um and from the path panel there's um a little icon there at the bottom that says make vector mask or something like that and then it'll convert it into a vector mask but it's not gonna remember a pixel mask may be very very soft so you're not going to get any of that softness you're just going to get a straight edge and extra tip if you hold alt on windows or option on the mac when you click on that button in the path panel it's going to give you a little window that you can control how many little points it adds on your vector mask amazing yeah we were talking about that yesterday i don't use that many vector maps right yeah i go from i just always i'm using just layer masks basically yeah yep i don't yeah i never really knew like the biggest difference between them but uh yeah there's a huge huge difference apparently yeah and and a fun fact if you really really want to like do something like maybe even when a bar bet is um so with a jpeg you cannot save a mask but you can theoretically save a vector path into a jpeg which is technically a mask so you can save a mask on a jpeg that way if you ever wanted to do something crazy like that i yeah right how many times do you bring uh photoshop knowledge with you to the bar though like well depends on which bar i walk into yeah if it's if it's at adobe max oh yeah that's true yeah that's all that's all that's all uh adobe right there i've been in uh situations when i'm talking to you know people like you and and other uh artists or instructors or whatever at max and everybody's always like you know you could do this oh that you know you could do that you actually learned a lot you can learn a lot from people just you know just trying to one-up each other oh yeah no for sure or even on on the discord uh server the photoshop discord server you always have people in there like if you just ask a question and it'll just random randomly somebody would just mention oh this is how you do it it's pretty good all right i'm just basically adjusting all the lighting right now on our on our subjects nice and i'm sorry you might have mentioned this already but is the water um a stock image or where did the water come from yeah so the water just basically came from uh unsplash it's just a basic water shot i'm going to end up replacing um the sky but what i liked about this um water was that it matched the same perspective of all my pixel squid elements so it really kind of benefited me in the long run so i really don't have to play around with perspective too much um because sometimes there was there was a lot of other water shots i was looking at where it was a little bit more flat so i was just not able to really work with them right right yeah i'm gonna i can i can play with the clouds and everything now it's got a beautiful just split right down the center canvas basically i've actually used this image like eight times in different composites oh wow the the water image yeah i've used it uh quite a few times actually yeah and uh well as long as you design something different on top you know nobody's gonna right it's like wait a minute i've seen that water before i've seen that before that water looks really similar to what i've seen um yeah so now i'm just gonna adjust my penguins uh brightness here i'm just kind of like matching it all together um let me just open up pixel squid here i'm gonna make my diy flag now so let me grab my stick nice it's super cool watching things just appear i i know right already cut beautiful i'm actually curious is anyone in the chat um using pixel squad as of now or is everybody just waiting to win a free three-month membership any any pixel squad users let us on the chat yeah i actually um i didn't know that it was that uh common of a plugin to use until i started the discord server and there's actually quite a few people um that who do use it oh we can do another uh pixel squid giveaway actually i have another question oh hey let's okay let's go everybody ready all right all right so here we go what squid owns pixel squid oh i i know that one i know that one yeah i think i do i'll i think i do what squid owns pixel squid what squid owns pixel squid [Laughter] is that one google can somebody go home i don't know if you can google that one bob the squid okay so i think i'm gonna place this one up front here just to kind of create that like going uh ahead of the fold right here bob squarespans square squidward that would be yeah that would have been a good one yeah good guess she would have been a good ceo that's turbosquid that was my there it is becca there it is becca's got it all right becca so just message sean through behance and he'll get you the three months of free pixel squid perfect there we go grab your name perfect becca nice happy first octopus mr inky von tentacon c e oh oh i like that elizabeth nice see [Laughter] nice all right so i'm going to just basically i selected the boat because these are basically uh these are really sharp edges so i have a really nice kind of like template to work with when i'm blending these subjects into the boat so i'm just gonna do layer mask and uh hide so or hide selection which automatically will just take what i just kind of cut out and and erase it on my mask over here perfect and then we're going to add our our pirate flag in here nice what's the randomest thing that you didn't think you were going to find in pixel squid but you found oh you're like there's no way they're going to have this and there it was um a lot of uh marvel characters i'm very um surprised really iron iron man and stuff like that yeah only because it's like those elements are actually like marvel characters and stuff are actually pretty hard to find like a an asset that you're actually allowed to work with it's it's always like i never play with those things that much because there's so much like copyright that could go around it right right right you're always taking your chances but um but yeah i found that like yeah the with pixel squid like having ha the fact that they had iron man was kind of i was really i was really shocked about that sorry iron man's also my favorite superhero so there are a lot of really really weird things on there though like nice but let's let us know in the chat who your favorite superhero is mine's spider-man spider-man oh you're you're like stan lee's best creation right definitely you know what to be friend with you i i i grew up reading comic books i still have a bunch of old comic books and you know trading cards and things like that but i was never an iron man fan until i got a little bit older and not necessarily because of the movie but then i i started um just reading about you know like his you know he's got an alcoholism problem in the comic books and and all these different social issues that that happened in the comic book so i started liking it more as i got older but as a kid i definitely wasn't a big fan but i do yeah when i was younger i didn't really understand the concept of of him that's for sure because he's supposed to have that like billionaire kind of vibe to him yeah yeah i never as a kid you know all i care about is uh plato probably right so right steve likes daredevil and nika likes hair devils or yeah john wick fairy um do you have a doctor strange fan in here i don't know uh janice likes lucifer which is a dc character okay he uh he was actually in the crossover with the uh oh my god with the wb what was that um uh the infinite earth's is that what it's called um somebody in the chat will now um but they all the dc characters did a bunch of crossovers and and throughout all the different shows crisis on infinite earths i think is what it's called um nice cool so now i'm just kind of going down and darkening up this uh behind the stick here to create more of a roundness to it michelle said black panther black panthers yeah that's definitely a another really good one i was super excited wrong when black panther first came out i didn't watch any of the trailers or anything i just went and saw the movie and i'm like oh my goodness oh wow well see the problem with me is that i really get into all this stuff so i watch all the youtube shows and all the theories behind what's gonna you know like i'm i'm very informed about what's gonna happen in the movies before i go watch it just because i'm so into that stuff you know the whole movie soon as you enter at least the theories like i don't like if it's out and people are reviewing up reviewing it and talking about it then i won't watch that but before it comes out when people have their theories and you know all these different ideas about the movie then i'll watch that smart it would be funny to paint put a penguin head on the flag with the crosshair bones to replace yes that's what hey smart wonder woman is pretty sick yes it is yes she is mia jonathan likes dr manhattan from oh my god i'm blanking out here um where's that dr manhattan is from uh oh my god somebody in the chat please let me oh my god it's got the the happy face the circle the yellow thing they did an hbo show on it oh my god anyway somebody in the chat will let me know watch man thank you paco jesus thank you also a good movie so now i'm just gonna have a little bit of light at the tips of this just to create like the roundness of it looking like it's kind of wrapping over the um stick a little bit nice i just hear all that clicking we were talking about yesterday how you're so precise with the with the mouse with the clips yeah that was exactly where to put the clicks bamika is really excited about the black widow movie so am i oh yeah what's that other one with um with the rock that's coming out dc i'm pretty sure something lightning bolt yeah oh black adam black guy oh my god lightning bolt he does have a lightning logo on his own okay all right there you go i give it to you that one yeah yeah that one looks pretty good nikolajev is asking why not why don't you use a tablet uh i'm not a traditional artist i started with photography so i never really um this is me kind of like learning how to draw almost a little bit i really like to use 3d and do collages and work with photography and vectors and all that so i just never have stepped into that area i know for a fact that i i want to eventually um i just haven't i've just had so many client jobs right now on the plate that i haven't uh i didn't want to switch over yet because i would be completely uh completely lost yeah i like like we talked about yesterday i got really good with the mouse and i started using the wacom tablet and um one of my my second ever in person presentation was a sponsored wacom event and i didn't know how to pronounce his name i used to pronounce it wacom and here i am wake up wake him wake him wake him wake him and some guy comes up to me and he's like okay uh it's pronounced wacom i'm gonna move it back here looks more natural yes uh graphic cup black widow is delayed till sev uh may 7th of 2021 unfortunately darn i didn't even know that what they were considering that movie yet um yeah the trailer came out um right before lockdown i think and it looked pretty good cause there's that uh there's also like that one division thing that's coming out too isn't it oh yeah that it's a tv show that one looks pretty cool as well yeah that one looks really good they the trailers are like not that much info which is nice i like i like that about it all right i'm gonna move this penguin a little bit more into the center uh this one there he goes up perfect and then he got our feet down here so we're just gonna go right to the layer mask get rid of it and just paint that look it's so easy so nice nice nice we'll be doing a reflection too but i have to um first get everything placed above before we can do the reflection the water underneath so let's grab some sharks now by the way i really like how you um added your handle on the canvas uh i'm guessing that's a different artboard right here this is a true fact sean is the coolest canadian uh you know what i think that might be true i like how you hey uh can you center that for a moment you wrote your um handle at sean reichen and then you wrote canadian digital composite artist nice just some some little social links i'm i'm at sean rankin on everything so yeah just uh just in my little corner here sometimes i do that when i'm on live stream you know just so i don't have to keep going back and forth they can they can go check out my my weirdness yeah michelle is saying that she has very old comic books of spider-man fantastic four iron man and used to watch them in cartoons on tv when she was a kid yeah um i i have the same except for iron man same here i used to watch all those comic uh read the comic books buy the trading cards and all that good stuff i remember walking into comic book stores and just like you have these boxes and you kind of sort through the comic books and you know pick out the ones you want to take home take all the good ones all right there we go now i'm just going to create a layer mask reveal all and then i'm going to go around with the uh just an eraser brush here i'm gonna set my opacity down when i'm getting closer to the top here because you still want to see it a little bit under the water not fully but you do want to see it to a certain yeah yeah and i just want to let people know that even though you're using the eraser brush you're not necessarily erasing pixels since you're using it on the layer mask so what's happening is that your foreign color is set to white and when you erase you reveal the background color which is black so you're not erasing pixels just just so that people know you're you're actually working non-destructively even though you're using the eraser tool yeah non-destructive is the way to be yep that's what we how we do it here in the banana club in the banana club yeah it's banana it's rule number one of banana club no no no that's number no no number one is do not talk about banana club yeah well number two is you do not talk about banana club rule number three is you must work non-destructively all right so his nose is a little bit sharp still so i'm going to just bring that down again super cool all right so let me show you what he was talking about earlier so this is the layer mask that i was painting on so if i disable it see boom it's all there again i didn't actually destroy it it's back and back in business but then if i enable it goes right back to uh our non-destructive technique there you go and you hold shift and click on a layer mask to disable it perfect i'm terrible with shortcuts as you can see that's all right just i'm just used to live streaming right it's easier to uh just do it the long way then go through and uh until i get a camera on my um your your keyboard yeah my keyboards and is saying that rule number four is learn rule one two and three yeah just kind of doing like a light kind of just a small little light uh glare i guess but yeah little little light yeah highlight it's a little baby highlight a little baby one and i'm gonna put a shark back here too just to kind of sandwich my my actual composite in there should we just do one jumping right out of the water just bamika's asking can we can also use the brush tool instead of the eraser right yeah you can use the eraser you can use the brush tool whatever you like whatever's easiest for you what is a good technique is to bounce between eraser and brush only because you can have settings for both of those brushes right so you basically just picture it as like a secondary brush so like if you don't if you want to use two at the same time then yeah erase have them both just set the same color you just have to remember to just swap between the colors yep yeah because on this is this is not on a regular pixel layer but on a layer mask you're basically switching between the foreground and background color whatever that is so sean for at the moment he has black as the background color so when he uses the eraser tool that's the color that will come up i think i'm not gonna add a jumping one in there might be too intense for these penguins super cool i still have not gotten used to the fact that shift is now like you don't have to build right i am still so used to because i've done it for so long that i'm just so used to the um holding down shift every time still right right you can change it back if you like but you can yeah it's under uh i said under interface oh my goodness workspace tools y'all that you know right um i forgot um somebody's gonna like remind me and you know what i it happens to me all the time that i do a video on something and then i forget and have to go back and watch my own video [Laughter] um you if you press ctrl k you're on the windows right ctrl k um it brings up the um preferences panel and then under general there should be a use legacy free transform at the bottom there bottom left use legacy free transform beautiful and that try it again and that should work go back to its original yeah again all right let me just blend this in here oh and and i thought i was the only one that did that just watches their own videos because you know they forget but i was at a conference once and i was at the speaker room and literally three people besides me were watching their own videos or their own like reading their own books because they just forget yeah it's because there's so much right like other other software and then remembering their shortcuts and oh that's beautiful wow i missed that it's nice all right yeah now now i'm not gonna mess that up so one one thing i like to tell people is that adobe never really takes away anything they just hide it so like um i always think is in some ways kind of funny when people say oh my god photoshop is so different now it's like they never really yeah i can only think of one thing they've changed that you cannot bring back and that's the new camera raw layout um i kind of like the new camera raw layout though i think it looks yeah yeah the accordion like speeds things up a lot yeah yeah i like that a lot even when they remove the um what's it called the selected no selected mask is a new one the refine edge people used to be i love the refine edge so much i love your finesse so much you can still use it but i mean the algorithm in my opinion is much better so i don't know what you would but you can still use it if you're still a fan of the old-school refine edge dialog box jaime from mexico saying thanks for sharing your knowledge no problem you got the best in the biz right here jesus and sean that's right again we're just uh stating facts and i'm biased yeah no don't want to be biased or anything yes yeah i'm sure it's on the internet somewhere yeah i'm sure and if not we'll add it after the stream [Laughter] all right so i added some sharks in there made it look a little bit more you know appealing um hmm i wonder if i have some like oh yeah there we go perfect that's also what i want to throw in there nice little parrot i was going to say is that nice flying with the with the crew nice and um i i i should remind people about the design feedback which is coming up in less than an hour so make sure that you submit your work into yes into a discord i don't know if the discord screen is going to come up or not but i'm sure that in the oh there we go the lead is there on the screen make sure you submit your work into discord today we in the for the photoshop daily creative challenge we worked on a surreal portrait so that should be fun to review in a little under an hour so make sure that you like go ahead and submit that work now pretty fun should we do a another pixel squid uh uh let's do it yeah all right let's see what i got my questions here all right oh so yeah okay this is a good one um [Applause] okay uh what year did i win the adobe achievement award for top talent oh people start typing years keyword keyword years what year oh year one year all right yeah one year what year all right all right so i'm just going to uh this bird is pretty uh it's got a lot of saturation 2006 2007. i'm just gonna read out years and you tell me when somebody hits it no top talent would be the key word top talent hmm i don't know the answer to this one really they only did top talent one year oh i don't know 2010. i don't know why there's guacamole talk in the chat but i miss some good mexican food i can't find any good mexican food in manchester in california i can think of like 10 places i could go to right about now so don't mention guacamole in the chat um steve said 2010 2014 2015 2013. elizabeth got it which was 2019 2019 2019 20 2019 was the only year that they uh that they did the top town well they they are gonna do it they just didn't do the achievement awards this year so okay so elizabeth was the first person in the chat to type 2019. so please message sean through behance and he'll get you um the i'm guessing the license is that way you're giving them the license for three free months yeah yeah yeah uh yeah we'll create an account or whatever and then uh then yeah then we'll we'll make sure that you have your your access there yeah all right so let's go back to this i'm going to now work on my reflection so i'm going to just grab all of all this and actually you know what i'm going to add some clouds in the background there nice i'm just going to use um the keith herring brush pack that i got draw them in there sergio's asking me am i in manchester england that's right sergio right now i am streaming live from manchester manchester england and i'll be here for give or take another week and a half or so [Music] the pirate flag is making me laugh oh no steve yes i agree with you every city in the world has a mexican food the key word was good because i've been to some places and uh i don't know so um one time i i got invited to speak at a conference in malaysia so i went to a mexican place in malaysia and i i was for some reason i was craving uh baja fish tacos and they had it on the menu so then just randomly i was gonna fly from malaysia to l.a and from l.a to to baja in mexico and because i was i was just gonna go on vacation after that and i told the the person serving me was like oh i'm actually going to like baja tomorrow he was like what if he like he had no idea that that was a place but you know he works at a place where they where they sell baja fish tacos and he thought it was just like a name you know what i mean that's funny so yeah maybe a side trip to spain you know what i i've never had mexican food in spain i was too busy eating spanish food that um well first of all i'm not allowed in spain i don't think they allow americans in in the european union right at the moment [Music] i'm allowed in the uk because clearly i'm here but uh with an american passport i don't think americans are allowed at the in in the european union at the moment yeah i wouldn't even know where to where to travel right now my anxiety wouldn't even let me travel right now tell me i i don't even know if we're allowed in canada are we allowed in canada i don't know maybe i think so i was just um reading um an article that said like the 14 or 13 places that americans can travel right now and i don't remember seeing canada no yeah we're probably on like strict strict lockdown right now so um i really like what you're doing there so you use one of the brushes and again that was the brush from from where just from uh the keith herring brush pack so um you can actually that's just on their contest right now let's see if i have it right here this uh this right here oh my dual screens being weird oh my goodness it keeps coming on there we go there we go perfect the key fairing design contest all right so you can get the brush pack right here keith hearing brushes absolutely amazing brush back has so many textured brushes and you know you have a chance to design um something that you stand for right so i stand for anxiety and and awareness of it can you post a link in the chat or yeah yeah of course yeah i'll just i'll just actually copy that and just throw it in there right now yep super cool thank you for uh for sharing that no problem oh it's a big link so basically yeah this is um the keith herring uh if you stand for something i 100 suggest that you do enter this right now uh you just have to design with the brushes you could design like anything i'm a composite artist but we have some like down at the bottom here some amazing examples of some things that people have done with these brushes um this is insane i don't know i would never know how to do something like that but that is like crazy right yeah so yeah just you know stay if you stand for something put it in your artwork submit to them and uh you have a chance to uh win five thousand dollars wow perfect right like he doesn't want five thousand dollars yep though you just have to design for what you believe in so yeah a lot of people a lot of people in the chat are saying no one wants us yeah you're not allowed in canada you're not allowed rob is saying you are allowed each quarantine 14 days i don't know yeah yeah you probably have to quarantine for yeah i'll quarantine in your basement sean for [Laughter] and just slide some food under some mexican food hopefully under the door and actually fit like a tortilla underneath the there you go and some guacamole please and before before you continue if you don't mind um can i can i show you how to show people how to get more free brushes yeah go right ahead go right in if you no you i'll let you do it if you click on the brush tool select the brush tool yep and then the options bar you'll see the down pointing arrow next to the brush tip on the left hand side yeah right yep and then click on the gear icon on the gear and then select get more brushes and get more brushes that will open up a page um for on your browser and that page is um brushes from kyle t webster and you can download all these brushes for free all of them they're steve the keith harrington brushes are there yeah right here yeah there they perfect right right on the front here i'll grab this link and throw that in the chat too for everybody yep and you have to be a creative cloud member to download these i don't know if the the one the one that you submitted sean we had that requirement but these have yeah this page you need to be submitted and signed in as the creative cloud yeah they do yeah that key tearing one but um this particular page kyle adds brushes uh you know like once every couple of months and as you can see there's a ton a ton so many and um my favorite one is called um constant um it they have a lot of good brushes for compositing and there you go concept and all you do is click on the download button it's an abr file to install it you just click on the avr file and it appears on on your installation of photoshop and actually the one that the one called concept actually has some cloud brushes very similar to the ones that you were using now but the point is is that look at all the free brushes that you get over a thousand free brushes so make sure that yeah so make sure that you take advantage of that submit uh log into this page and just download them all and play with the ones that you like that's insane yeah that's a huge library right there grab them all yes grab them all they're all free yeah anything for you just grab them all yeah so i'm going to do the reflection so what i did was i basically uh grouped everything uh into one folder here i'm gonna take that uh that shark out because he doesn't need the reflection yet but uh this is the the boat here and i'm basically just going to duplicate that group and um i'm going to merge the group together nice which now creates this uh all together it's basically one one giant boat you can put this anywhere now in any one of your pieces just plop that in there but we're not going to do that we're just going to flip it uh vertically this bad boy over nice and then we are going to hold shift and bring it up like this because a reflection is not always directly down you have to always match um the actual water level too that they're on right [Music] perfect i'm going to just hide this shark for a second so we can see what we're working with and then i believe i set this to yeah soft light it's offline nice which is beautiful and then we're going to just go to filter distort and wave super cool and i'm not going to i don't want my um yeah i just want to be like subtle because it's not that many waves right now and if i look here it looks really intense i wish that preview was a little bit bigger um but let me just scale down my um vertical because we don't want the um the waves going this way we just want it horizontally so and then we'll click ok and it should perfect just match somewhat of the waves there giving it a uh kind of a solid reflection and then we're going to add a layer mask to this group here this is what i love about groups you can also add layer masks to this we're going to reveal all super cool and then this is still non-destructive because these are all still within within this uh group here and i'm just going to go across and just slowly erase just to show that it's actually in the water a little bit and then bring it down somewhere so a little a piece of it is submerged right it's up here super cool i'm just going to nudge over my my reflection there just a line that the corners up you want to make sure that these corners are basically around the same and that's perfect right there and that's super cool kind of have a realistic reflection looks really good just want to remind everybody design feedback is in about 38 minutes so make sure that you submit your work into discord i know that the link is in the chat i'm not sure if wade posted it in the chat or um one of the other moderators but the link will be in the chat so that you can submit your work onto discord and sean and i will review that in a moment in about 40 minutes and 37 minutes to be more exact and yeah it should be a fun one it's gonna be a surreal portrait so i'm sure it'll be a lot of fun beautiful it's a real portraits are amazing um i'm going to just grab this blue now and just put it underneath the the paper here because it will reflect the blue up on the paper it's white so you'll see at least somewhat of a tinge there i have a tint nice oh now i'm going to bring my brush down way way way way down and just kind of go over this a little bit more it's you won't notice it too much but like for my eyes since i look really really close at things uh i'm just basically adding a very very very slight blue tint to everything right now up front at least not up top here and that is just the light that will be bouncing off the water coming up onto the boat so i'll show you what it looked like before and after so you can get a better idea about what i just actually did so this is with it on and with it off nice it's subtle but it makes a huge it die yes very very subtle very small but yeah it merges it a lot more together creates that like realistic approach to it so now i kind of want to make like a boat trail here so i'm going to see if i can find some water elements that i can actually just already work with that are existing here yep and i'm just going to use the patch tool nice and i'm just going to bring in more shadows at the back here just because you want to show that this is like being brought up a little tad bit does pixel squid have any any like water um like trails or anything like that uh they might not have water trail but they have a lot of water um let me show you what they have for water mia is saying those little details make all the difference i completely agree yeah steve is saying the reflections are so good i definitely agree with you on that steve thank you i appreciate that steve all right uh yeah so let's search water this is the pixel squid library it's massive oh they just throw everything water related in here this might work maybe if you play around with it and use maybe like some like you have like water elements like this in here 13 pages yeah we can't go through all that uh we'll try we'll try this water element see what we can do and mess around with it sometimes you just have to experiment until you you get the right idea so let's go to our pixel squid here [Music] add that water shell we just got sergio is saying uh jesus yeah good mexican food is hard to find when i was living in oxford i suffered terribly until i found that kebab stand just brought my salsas that little shack saved my life that little shack wade uh said maybe search for splash yeah we i i have yeah that's what i did yesterday was search for splash but then you get uh you actually physically get a splash like these yeah yeah it's like it's a little too it might be intense well maybe they're going super fast yeah like you'd have to like crank up the front a little bit yeah they do have some like nice nice stuff in here like if you're doing like you know like a a commercial where people are like cheersing like drinks together or something you know you have all this to work with so it helps a lot alessandro road hi i'm just joining now amazing composite are you guys using custom brushes we are using custom brushes uh and if you scroll up alexander alessandro you'll see the link to the pages where you can download some of the brushes that sean is using wade is suggesting put multiple together and scale down put multiple of these together and scale down i i think you mentioned that would be a good idea as well fairy's asking i don't understand how you make a water look on your last watermelon artwork can you explain the water uh yeah i actually just use an ice cube um with my watermelon uh let's see if i actually have it here uh i don't have it open but uh yeah i basically just on pixel squid there is an ice cube and i just took the the top kind of corner of it so if you look at this right here so i basically just put it on a side like like this and then i grab a piece of watermelon like the bottom of it and i just put it over top and i turn this blue do you have the is it on instagram the watermelon or yeah yeah uh that's actually one of my more recent ones so which is good right here ah so ice cube at the top and then just watermelon at the bottom and then you use super cool a regular super super cool enough is that your hand no i picked it pixel squid in a pixel squid this is an adobe stock hand actually oh okay yeah they i have like on adobe stock they do like a bunch of graphics where it's just a hand in all these different positions and i was like totally licensed licensing that because the amount of times that i actually use like hands here and there in my composites are it's incredible like i actually use them a lot so once i got that pack i was like yes and by the way i'm gonna put um a link in the chat because i think everybody should be submitting to adobe stock i uh i don't have too many things on there but um it's funny because the first time i ever came to the uk i visited a good friend of mine nigel french some of you may know him he is an adobe max speaker he's an expert in design user and he um took me around the little town that he lives in and it's called luis in the south of england and he pointed at like this random street and he said oh take a picture this street looks cool and i thought whatever it's just like a street so i took a picture of it and that became my most well sold photo in adobe stock and i don't know like i have no idea why and i'll even show you guys the photo um but i think that everybody should become an adobe stock contributor so let me put the link in the chat there for you guys you guys know where to go for that so i think there it is in the chat and um yeah just submit your images you never know what might sell what might not sell and you know um it's better to have obviously maybe not your artwork and things like that that you don't want a lot of people to use but if you have just random photos why not um why not just submit you know like i have a picture of a mailbox in there you know just like random things like that just mailboxes and stuff yeah yeah yeah it like i i think i have a few ass i might actually not have any assets up on adobe's stock yet but i do have i think some on unsplash a few of my photos whenever i go around yeah on a nature hike or something like that i just upload just all this randomness and uh yeah like what you said some people just like show up and they want that picture of yours right right i'm actually running into a screen error right now one sec there we go all right so i kind of just brought that um that shark that we were using before i brought it up front because i just wanted you know just to create more depth of my actual piece a little more um so i'm just going to now bring this all into uh camera raw but first i am going to blur the background here just gonna use the blur tool for that i'm gonna set my strength to uh 75 so 76 i guess and i'm just blurring the diff the the distance in the background here creating some nice depth in the image super cool yeah i figured because we already blurred the clouds a little bit up here so we might as well um you know bring it back down too because you're not gonna see the horizon line being like straight when the clouds are completely blurred right right and then we're just going to add a blur to this shark in the background now and if you don't like for example what you just said if you don't know that that's the case just search online for like an actual photo and then see how the photo looks in real life and then try to replicate that in your composite so the design feedback starts in about 25 minutes so make sure that you submit your work into discord i only see one portrait i know people are submitting older people are catching up so submitting older design um designs from previous daily creative challenges but i too i see two portraits right now surreal portraits so make sure that you finish them up and submit and submit them into discord and if not we'll look at some of the previous daily creative challenges because i see i see more people submitting i see a couple hair replacements in here that we looked at yesterday uh sean oh some more some more hair replacements that's always a fun like tutorial to do like just taking a self-portrait or yeah a picture of yourself and just learning photoshop that way like that's always a great technique too all right so now i'm just going to bring this merged composite we have the full image here i'm just going to bring that right into camera raw now and this is kind of like where the fun kind of begins right here it's camera raw because you could just adjust everything to make it look like it matches again i i basically bring all of my composites uh into adobe uh raw at the end of the day all right and what's cool about this too is you can go to the color mixer and then you can just if you don't want colors like so intense like this red might be a little intense you just take that down the colors of the penguins yellow might be a little too intense so we'll just take that down a little tad bit along with orange and then we'll just enhance the blues a little bit more looking great also um how many more licenses do you have to give away three more so yeah i was just yeah i was just about to uh actually just say should we give another one another one away yeah another one all right all right so everybody let everybody put their hands on the keyboard yeah and get ready to start typing how many adobe live streams including the ones that i just did including today how about being in yeah have i been in total so far oh man i don't know if i know the answer to that one i have i have a guess uh it's not it's not like a dramatic amount there you go keep that in mind but it's something i wouldn't even know how many i've been on i i have no idea susan said uh 24 ferry said four steve said eight above 142 140 holy 12 13 345.5 i guess you fell asleep in one of those 19 6 17 15 7 4 12 20 11 00 17 12. i mean people are just putting numbers what do you i think we are just putting in numbers now i don't think anybody has said that wait oh you see it yeah yeah yeah may may ain't may saying six yeah six it is i've been a six this is my sixth adobe live today wow i was off i was gonna say four i'm surprised that people didn't catch like my title of the folder at the start named six all right i'm gonna write that down perfect there we go all right so right now i'm just creating like a burn and dodge layer i just set it to overlay with a fill with neutral gray here and then uh and then yeah we'll do burn and dodge uh may uh mei aang is that is that how you say it i think i think so maybe uh message me on uh on behance whoa message me on behance uh and then i'll i'll send your uh code over after after the stream sounds good all right so now i'm just yeah i'm gonna go and fix kind of like just my smaller shadows here with the burn dodge this is just stuff that i didn't want to uh clip mask at the time and i just really didn't pick up on [Music] fairy say now we'll watch all the easter eggs in this video anything could be a clue anything it's like how many penguins have i shown in today that would have been a good one and we have what when's the creative challenge and we still have two more together we have 20 minutes yeah okay we should probably give do another question then um okay um hmm what's another one let me see i'm gonna think of one or you have more in them you go with you go for one you go for one this time let's see if you have give me a minute give me a minute yeah yeah yeah it's something good come on good um let's see something photoshop related something compositing related um it can't be too hard i'll think of a good one i'll let you know when i have it [Laughter] if i were to say like how many live streams i've been on i wouldn't be able to know the answers yeah you gotta do the research yeah yeah i really do your owner you gotta do research on you yeah i would have to go in there and tally how many times my name appears on that creative cloud youtube channel let's see maybe something that we talked about today let me see or yesterday maybe or yesterday yeah yeah what did we talk about yesterday um let's see we talked about how long we did uh how long we've done design for i'm pretty sure did we talk about that i i think so i i don't remember um let's see oh well this might be kind of easy because there's not that many answers i was gonna now like i want something kind of like you that that reads a lot of answers but the answers are still easy um how about oh you you mentioned your cat's name didn't you no i haven't mentioned that oh you haven't nothing no that would have been a really good one though what's your cat's name my cat's name is socks yeah i want to hear this story i want to hear it but you did mention it i don't remember yeah oh yeah maybe yeah all right actually people would have known that one because i literally have it on my instagram stories in highlight so people would have probably known about that one but yeah the story about that was when i moved away for uh school um my mom was always against cats at all times she was always never wanted anything to do with them she she just hated them uh and when i moved away to school i you know freedom yes right so the first thing i did was of course go against what my mom was always against and i got a cat but she told me before i went um away that i needed to um buy myself a pack of black socks because i had a new job and they wanted the dress code was black socks mainly for some reason i don't know why um so i got a black cat and i named it socks and i still wear white socks today i don't wear any black socks anymore well i do the opposite i wear nothing but black socks really i just wear white socks all the time well see what happened is i was doing laundry once and i was like and it took me forever to like sort and put socks together i'm like why am i wasting so much time i'm just going to buy black socks that i can use on every occasion it could be a formal location maybe if i'm playing sports or it could be like every day so i just bought a ton of black socks and threw everything else away so that's all i use now yeah that's what happened for christmas one year i asked like accidentally asked people for i put socks on my christmas list but i didn't put anything else and that was not a big mistake because that's all i got was like i got hundreds and hundreds of pairs of socks so i'm set for years now i don't need any more socks i'm good nice let's see it looks like yeah people were saying socks um so it looks like we did say it and because i remember you saying uh socks but maybe it was really something else hmm what should uh should we do did we ask another question we didn't do one no wait no we no we we got sidetracked now let me let me think of one uh i have one right on the top of my head let's do it let's do it let's do it okay how many years have i used photoshop for oh how many years has i told sean use photoshop i think we talked about this yesterday so if you go to yesterday's stream you will most likely uh most likely know the answer i think so i think i did 5 13 20 13 michelle wait again michelle i think my show won twice or is that a different mr tom no no i oh no that's a different michelle perfect there you go yeah perfect put that on michelle's got it send me a message you got it it's all you have your name written down cool why do you have the banana tool on your toolbar oh chat wait no no let the chat tell them [Laughter] somebody let him know yeah i don't know what what's up yeah so i just show him we'll show him in a moment yeah yeah we'll show you how to do it so i just applied a lot to my piece and i'm gonna call that a piece for today i'm happy with it um obviously i could go in tweak and do that whole like six hours of playing around adding things and taking away things and and getting it to that like final final point but like this is what i would like kind of consider um you know something to start my actual creativity with um but yeah but um anything else you want me to i can add anything else now to this should we uh um let's see what about like a pirate ship like in the back in the back all right let's go like this off in the distance perfect just gonna quickly add a pirate ship here yeah we'll do we'll just do like a a broken one or something way back way in the back all right way in the back way way in the back all right so let's give it to let's bring it to its perspective here and then we'll throw it like way way way way back there do we have you have any more giveaway i thought about a question yeah i i believe we have one more to give away today all right we'll wait i will leave it till the end then we'll leave it till the end yeah uh yeah we have one more to give away today yeah we'll leave it till the end cool so we're gonna put a pirate ship yeah just just floating in the back there gonna remove the shadows just make it really light because the light is where uh it's kind of shining on it so you wouldn't really see it this you know contrast contrasty i guess contrasted yep atmospheric perspective nice and it's gonna fall off the edge of the earth there because y'all know the earth is flat yeah the earth is uh yep we're gonna get people mad in the chat just gonna add a layer mask to that reveal all are you sponsored by uh corsair sean is the question corsair no i'm not sponsored by them i uh i'm not a gamer really so uh i'm not sure if they would sponsor a photoshop artist i don't know well depends i mean msi sponsors me so whoa gaming company yeah wow mr fancy no i don't have uh i definitely don't have uh corsair that's my sponsorship a use of puma ooh and phantom that's super cool and that's when you were a professional athlete i'm guessing you're yeah yeah that's a do i look like i can't be a professional athlete come on asus hey i don't know maybe i don't know you're canadian man maybe you do like curling or something i don't know yeah that's that was uh it didn't work out for me curling so i went into photoshop i went into photoshop i said yeah that's the route i need to do i need to go in that direction all right everybody we got about 10 minutes for the design feedback so make sure that you submit your work into discord so that sean and i can check out your cereal portraits there's a couple of good ones there in in the uh page here that i'm looking at i'm refreshing it now so people are submitting you still have 10 minutes to finish up and submit it there we go all right i'm gonna merge this rasterized nice we're gonna have to make down a little tad bit darker using levels but so we got about 10 minutes why don't we let the chat now decide to add one more thing would that be okay yeah yeah go right ahead all right chad let us know what sean should look for on pixel squid to add to this composite let us know one more yeah one more pirate related thing we can throw in there even if it's on the boat or yeah anything yeah anything yeah give them something i mean something that's on pixel square personally yeah if we're gonna be like be pretty like iron man iron man penguin there's already penguins there i can add more penguins a swimming moose a sunray a sunray would be cool let's see if there is a sunray on pixel square let's bring up a lightsaber there are lightsabers on pixels or compass anchor plank to walk on eyepatch eye patch perfect i already have oh see sir sir uh said he was messing with me he said taco would walk cannon a big cannon cannonball oh there's a lot of people asking for cannon octopus pistol we could try and do the eye patch here i think i have an eye patch right right there head scarf a head scarf on the penguin two guys sword fighting spongebob spongebob i don't think i can get spongebob i'm gonna try and see if i can put this this eye patch on this penguin all right so we have an eye patch it's gonna be like it's gonna be pretty challenging to do this one all right captain jack sparrow captain oh we could actually put like a regular like a legit pirate because if i search this pirate then we have so many pirate elements so we can oh my god i know right here it's like what could i throw in even boots but is there an actual pirate is there yeah oh yeah okay they do have actual pirates okay cool what about treasure okay like not let them go home empty-handed you know yeah yeah i'm kind of curious what happens if you search for photoshop is there like i don't know like the photoshop logo or something i don't know if you just search photoshop nope we didn't find nothing no but if you search social then you have um like all the likes and everything oh got it nice oh that's super cool i could help you out with your content this would be really helpful the thought bubble yes and i was actually just looking for something like this on adobe stock would this be much better because the problem was i was having is that i found the perfect image but it was in a weird angle so this would have been perfect yep just match and match it up i think i'm gonna put the little bit of treasure chest right right down right down there all right is it gonna be floating or uh on the actual boat or how are you gonna do it yeah yeah it'll be on the boat we'll put it on the boat again nice and as you're doing that again five minutes for the design feedback so submit your work into this court i know the link is in the chat make sure that you submit your surreal portraits did we get all all six uh one more pixels we'll give one more giveaway towards the end that way people stick around a bottle of rum floating yeah it's perfect because like this this composites basically uh the lines are already set up for you almost super cool oh i don't know why someone just typed lorem ipsum in the chat but okay this might be laura or lorem ipsum oh no that's not laura mibson like the placeholder uh yeah the placeholder text [Music] where remember hide selection i remember um one of the very first design gigs i took when i was just uh starting out as a designer i just put a bunch of lorem ipsum text like a number nine and the client was like i don't know what language that is i don't speak like is that spanish that's just placeholder text yeah some people uh think it's actually like a uh a language sometimes right i've had a few clients say can you change that copy i don't i don't think we should have that there yeah like well that's for you you don't want it we can take it out though um dennis is saying shout out to the art club oh yeah the art club my the discord server that i help manage um it's a little art like gathering we all design and talk art basically every single day every single day every day yep every day all day [Laughter] all right i'm just gonna quickly add the shadow behind here [Music] so all right people are submitting their work that's great super excited to check it all out beautiful yeah all right there we go our treasure nice this is something that you would have to like re-go in and do that whole camera raw filter again on it but maybe make it a little bit more saturated bring up the colors a little more showing that's a pirate treasure sweet and that would be penguin penguin pirates right there penguin pirates nice i think it looks fantastic in just in time we're about to start the design feedback in about three minutes so make sure that you submit your work i'm going to get discord ready and i'm gonna refresh just to make sure that we have the latest piece uh when we start should we do the giveaway now or after or like after we do the this is a giveaway now yeah because then focus you and i can get carried away then going over to the designs and all that let's let's do it so this is the last three month pixel squid license giveaway from sean do you have a question sean or yeah yeah sure um let me see all right uh since uh we're talking about uh the discord there how many artists are in our um art club discord oh how many artists i have no clue i think i mentioned it yesterday too oh you mentioned it yesterday all right are people gonna go and like click on it and just see the number and just sit there for two hours i know the answer [Laughter] all right so how many artists are on sean's discord is that the question 215 758 no way up keep going oh higher higher all right higher yeah 7347 325 271 348 137 1027 keep going up keep going up it's higher one thousand five hundred and thirty-five higher than a thousand it's higher than two thousand higher five thousand oh it's higher than five thousand all right yeah susan you gotta go way higher it's eight higher than 800 for sure anyone who just who doesn't use the link will know yeah the link is in the chat anyone who just use the link would literally get the answer right there michelle wrote ten thousand no that's under ten thousand right under ten thousand yeah the link is in the chat guys scroll up and by the way make sure that you're in the chat on behance because if you're on youtube if you're not even looking at this number oh dean's already said it what is it 7 347. all right there you go that's the number awesome i'm sure both venus and michelle both have won a subscription already though from me so i'm going to give it to um bemika who was like the the third because i already know i i know for a fact that dennis already has uh okay yesterday's stream e1 okay fair enough you are the judge for this competition and we already have michelle on there anyways she was already gonna get one perfect there we go six people will be going home with pixel squid make sure to send me a message on uh behance and uh we'll get you set up and yeah fantastic in just in time just just in time so let me know when i need to switch over into my screen let me oh oh oh i sorry perfect cool so let me refresh the page here and we'll get started in a second just to make sure that we have all the submissions and yep i see excellent so let me scroll up and you can see my screen correct sean yep yes i can cool so today in the photoshop daily creative challenge we worked on a surreal portrait and let me just show you guys my results so that's that was the result that i came up with this morning and this is anika uh anika's design so let's click on that and i'll let you start sean any thoughts yeah so i i like it and but it is like i read your comment underneath and you said very subtle and yeah it is kind of very subtle what you could really do to bring it back would be to kind of follow more of the curves of your face rather than the curves of how the image is actually going um so you can see on like the left side there you are the right side you kind of went down but you you uh the technique i believe you used you brought the anchor points a little bit further up to kind of create more of a roundness to it at the end of the day yeah but it looks pretty good yeah i think i think it looks great um i know you wanted to go for subtle but maybe i would have just made the top half of the head just a little a little bit bigger it just feels kind of kind of like in between it's not small enough to be small but it's not big enough to be big so i would i'll probably just make it a little bit bigger but i think it looks great also good job on using that pattern that i provided for one of the challenges as the background i think it looks great and you did a great job with that excellent work let's see um this is definitely not this challenge i'm not even sure what challenge this is but here we go we have uh black uh is that becky or betchy i'm not i'm not sure how they would pronounce it but um sean i'll let you start yeah so uh it's pretty good i'd say i i like what you did with like the shirt kind of you know taking that uh the idea and and playing with it in your own way it's really nice uh just yeah one maybe just like just the pictures of like the the kids the face uh like the mouth and it looks almost like it's two different characters maybe oh yeah it might be but that's totally cool i think no need to have the same it just yeah well just like the contrast difference between both the images so the mouth on the subject below now kind of is a little bit more like really dark like com different skin tones and all that stuff so it doesn't match up like completely but i think that you did like a pretty good job like just starting with uh doing like a different technique with the circle yeah and also i would work a little bit more on the masking you can see these white fringing edges here you see that just work on that and actually just super quick tip if you um let me see if i'll just open up um one of these files and just show you guys like a really quick way of doing it if you um are having issues with that fringing it's super easy to remove with a filter that not a lot of people um use i don't see a lot of people using so for example i mean i know this is not the same thing but let's just imagine that we had some fringing here what we could do is with the layer mask selected you can go into filter other minimum and this filter minimizes the masks see that's how it just brings it in and if you select roundness as the preserve feature there as the algorithm to use you can just bring it in slightly see that before and after and then you can really get away get rid of that those white outlines that you get on your composites fairly quickly so that's what i would have recommended that you did on on the arm there the advantage of using that filter is that it's not a global filter because you can just make a selection say around the sleeve and then just go back into filter other minimum and then you can just work on that particular sleeve you see that and then just minimize the fringing just on that area and you could easily easily fix these little imperfections with not too much work cool yeah let's see what's next um we oh this is a really cool one we have frank awesome frank i'll let you start sean oh is this going to be one of those that is not going to load there we go there we go i think you did a really good job um how the like the mouth matches and the the crazy face like that you chose like i think that it all works out really well the only thing that i would have watched out for would have been the ears that's the like the only thing because they just at the top there they just don't align with the um previously but other than that like it turned out really good you did a very good job yeah i i i'm with you man i have no comments but excellent excellent job the ears as you said is the only issue and then maybe i mean if i'm nitpicking here maybe i would consider um can i go down yep maybe i would consider just maybe cloning out some of the hair here because it looks kind of weird but besides that i mean like i said that's just nitpicking i think it's a fantastic composite the shading here on the edge looks great the shadows look great excellent excellent composite yeah very good job yeah let us know in the in the chat what you guys think about this one um cool let me scroll down and see if there's any more so this is kind of the same but not really this uh this person decided to go for a space oh my god i feel like i'm on like my age or something a dial up yeah all right here we go so they they just decided to add a hole like a see-through um hole um what do you think about that sean i think yeah maybe just like kind of try and follow the it fully because even in on the top left corner there you kind of have some like uh loose uh brush strokes uh yeah just chilling up there i think that's a brush stroke i can't really tell yeah but i would have liked to maybe yeah see like um you know more of a subject kind of maybe on the inside what you could have probably done is make put a skeleton on the other side of that right yeah so like you're actually hollowing out and putting something on the inside still yeah and i'm not sure what this blue is is doing the other shape of blue so i'm not sure what the intent was there but um the idea was good i would have just um as john said maybe i added more detail inside maybe some highlights on the creases i don't know something just to make it feel like there's an actual 3d element and not just like a cut out you know what i mean yeah like the eraser kind of brush yeah nice let's see what else we have okay we have uh ken ken submitted two photos so this is the first one oh what do you think shawn i think it's pretty good uh yeah just like the maybe working around um the bottom part too uh hollowing around like the hair on the left and right side there at the bottom that would be like yeah yeah you know how you kind of added like the circle to make it look like that's inside of the subject maybe yeah just do one here coming out from the back as well yeah i agree with you really brought it all together but i think that yeah you followed it pretty well just that would be the only aspect that you would you're missing would be just the bottom part because you did it to the top yes basically do that exact same thing right just flip it and put it at the bottom i agree completely and maybe on maybe just had a couple hair strands or yeah so it's not perfect it's not a perfect cut i think that's pretty but overall great great job it looks pretty yeah yeah really good and let's see the second submission what do you think with the hair or without the hair i think with without the hair and the loose strands like what you were kind of suggesting still yeah this doesn't really give that it almost gives me like an act like a goggles kind of feel yeah like a reflection almost right it's cool because he's like it yeah it really feels like they're wearing like a like some ski goggles or something right now it kind of gives me that that feel but it doesn't give me the feel of like that they're being split and open and there's a smaller subject on the inside yep yep but looks pretty good though yeah definitely without the hair so i would just work on this one a little more and i think you'll you'll have it ken yeah an excellent job so this one is from uh ibani ibanez22 uh what do you think sean uh more shadows across the eyes for sure just to give it that like look where it's actually being like on the inside of the subject right now kind of looking like it's over top of it still yeah yeah yeah go ahead sorry like playing around maybe with i think what is really causing that for you might be the flower image that you have behind it actually though yeah yeah i i would have added more shadows here also like if in in the one that i did if you remember i i made the inside a little bit darker just sort of to imply that there was less light in there so you might want to consider doing something like that just because it feels flat there's no separation so so that's the best way that i could describe it to just work on the separation a bit more by adding shadows highlights changing the hue and just bringing bringing the brightness down a little bit for sure cool thank you for submitting yeah uh this is a surreal portrait but i'm not really sure if how we i mean it's called it's a real portrait but yeah completely different than everything else but what's your thought on it sean it's pretty good um it makes sense to like it's a zoom call meeting right yeah look that's it looks like like that's assumed called yeah for a double exposure it's pretty good for double exposure but yeah for the the challenge yeah it definitely doesn't really fit the same like tutorial or technique or anything but it looks cool for sure yeah i think you did an excellent job mm-hmm i like the the shallow depth of field too on the on the hollow yeah blurring is really nice like that's uh definitely a plus yep excellent excellent work and that was very and this is for i guess another one let's move on and see if there's one that's going through the cracks i'm not sure if this is yeah i mean i guess we can review it now that it's open definitely not the challenge for today but um what are your thoughts on it sean uh i think it's pretty good um it it doesn't really maybe flip the subject though yes yes it doesn't match like the lighting and also like you can really use the direction that they're looking in to uh move this up like the viewer's eyes right so when somebody looks at your image and somebody's looking to the left your eyes instantly like follow that way i just noticed that there's just a lot of a lot of highlights on his face and the lighting is actually on the opposite side of the frame right yeah and i mean i know that sometimes when you're starting out it's difficult to think about lighting shadows and all of that but like the the easiest way to see uh where the light is coming from is just look at where the brightest highlight on the images and for her the person is right on his forehead you can see how bright his forehead is right and then if you look at the plant behind them you can see that the pot is super bright so then those should be on the same direct facing the same side in this case they're not so it looks a little weird it feels a little weird and if you're going to do something like this with the text i would separate it into two different layers and just work on each individually since um because this one actually doesn't look too bad the one on top but then when you add the second layer on the bottom here the second line of text it just completely doesn't work so you would need to work on that um separately like the spacing between the lines for sure yeah yeah let me refresh the page one more time and see if there's any more submissions for today's um effect if not we'll scroll up and check out some of yesterday's no this is the same one so let's go back up and i know that we had a couple submissions for um the hair replacement here we go we had a hair replacement [Laughter] i like how you use a different subject like that's complete the only thing i would say is just brighten up like the overall hair to match the cat's like fur a little bit but other than that like yeah perspective and stuff you you've got it like the same white edges around the top of the hair there again just bring it in minimum uh minimalized technique and yeah you're good yeah it's good yeah i mean again something with the light the left side of the face is bright the right is dark i would just i mean maybe you can get away with it by flipping the the layer i'm not sure but yeah besides that excellent excellent excellent job eric yeah oh this is this is a really cool one uh miami luna this is um we worked on an engravement effect a couple days ago and she decided to do this really really cool um i guess composite what we'll call it but yeah that's really nice it looks like money almost yeah the design that you would see across like a bill or something exactly so that was kind of what the challenge was was to create an engravement effect and if you add like a green tint to it it kind of looks like money but they took it to a whole another level and they did all this other stuff so excellent excellent job i really can't give you uh much more advice and my god it looks great yeah i'm here uh oh a new hairdo i guess the top one is the yeah it's got to be uh the top i mean excellent job and you can tell because of that edge right there which is what we were talking about yesterday with somebody else's um composite i think it looked yeah really good yeah there's the lighting at the top a little bit and then that eraser mark but other than that like i thought that we couldn't tell the difference so they yeah and the glasses maybe the glasses are looking a little the glasses are a giveaway i think because because there's a glare you can see the glare just on top of their head so maybe add that same glare to this photo just just like just paint with like white and bring down the opacity yeah i mean that might make it look a little bit better yeah overexpose it a bit exactly and then just like copy and paste some of these hair strands and then paste them like right up here so there's no sharp line yeah but i think it looks fantastic good job good job viola new hairdo all right okay so this is the original this is the image that they use and this is the final version yeah one thing i definitely would say is if you can flip the hair flip it uh horizontally only because you can see the highlights are on that side of his face and then the shadows if you look at the neck you could see just a shot a thick shadow going right down so you know the lighting is kind of over here creating that shadow down the other side of your hair is a little bit brighter so it would follow those highlights compared to the darkness on the other side yep yep but completely turn it pretty good yeah great job and also i like how on this particular photo the shadows are so dark yeah you kind of had to match that with the hair so you did a good job of matching those shadows it's just a really really low sun i'm pretty sure in that picture that's what creates those really really harsh shadows across like those sharp ones yeah definitely and another hairdo before and after oh wow oh wow this one looks pretty good what do you think sean i think that looks really really good yeah i can't even i like how you remove the the hair strands on on their shoulder and everything like that as well yeah i mean i would say a little bit crisper around the shoulders rather than using um maybe turn your hardness up a little tad bit but other than that like it looks really like really sharp really good yeah and see like these little details right here is what i like yeah she added these hair strands just going over her face and she even added a nice little shadow here see that yep wow yeah that's really good and i said she and i oh not just him he frank oh sorry frank sorry about that frank yep very good so much for that submission frank um so i don't know what the before one was from carrie let me see if i scroll up and there's a before but it looks like this is this has been edited because it says thank you for the um thank you sam is this better um well what do you think i i would i don't know what the original look like but um i would probably say that it's better i is there like a i thought i saw like a little bit of white maybe just around the edges just go around with a with a brush just to make it a little bit less like wide popping out at the back but other than that like you could actually just use the warp just to bring that right back again it's like yeah it would just let me scroll up and see if we see uh yeah let's see if you can see the before let me know if i go too fast then i oh wait did i pass it i think that you did now let me go back down oh my god look at the rock with that i'm fine yeah no i don't think i passed it no no no no no we we won't go up too far um all right let's go back down and just do a couple more because um i think i saw somebody entering um as soon as uh we went up so i would go all the way down to see if somebody oh here we go let me refresh the page yeah because i think i saw somebody typing or something cool is there any other for today nope oh no just another hairdo one yeah all right this this is the last one that we'll do it's almost time to go so this is the before and the after wow wow that's actually this is very good yeah it's very good so i'm actually like getting my face right in front of the screen the one thing that i would suggest on this one is if you notice the background image is a lot of green and it's got a lot of color green just add a little bit of color green of the hair you know what i mean a little bit of green yeah yeah just because that's what's in the original image and if it wasn't there then then obviously don't add it but good job yeah very good job yeah maybe a few stray hairs over his forehead maybe yeah besides that excellent excellent job yeah very good job yeah and um thank you and thank you paul for submitting this awesome awesome composite thank you everybody for submitting today's daily creative challenge make sure that you keep submitting your challenges even if you're late you can submit them ask us questions and then tomorrow we'll do the final daily creative challenge challenge number nine so we'll be we'll be back for that for the daily creative challenge but sean before we go um we got about maybe four minutes anything else you want to share or talk about in um uh let me just uh share my screen here for a second there perfect all right so uh yeah i can show you um some uh kind of things let's see if i have any anything that i was working on recently um oh yeah there we go perfect i was working on a walmart piece so nice it's not officially for walmart or anything like that um i just uh i just think that there's so many restrictions and stuff right now inside the stores so i wanted to kind of like recreate that with astronauts um i'm not sure the whole follow um one way um like that whole system right now but if i developed a pet peeve during this time it is literally people walking the opposite direction in a way so this is kind of like me like saying like i'm gonna post this online saying i hate when people walk the opposite way in a one-way aisle but i didn't think that i would develop such a pet peeve during like this time but it is super annoying when you're trying to shop now especially when like you're also trying to like stay away from other shoppers and stuff so i recreated this whole piece i'll show you what it um what it first looked like but uh it was empty completely empty wow so this is the shot and then i've slowly building it into something else just using the store but i'm on a red and blue theme right now on my instagram so that's why i'm balancing uh that's why i chose walmart their blue brand and uh yeah out of this world savings you know you gotta throw your your phones and stuff in there for the astronauts and uh you got all the astronaut instructions down here mass distance i love it yeah so just creating something a little fun you know during these times um and uh i just wanted to show a little bit of a preview i guess yeah and also let us know in the chat if you started now matching your mask to your outfit you know like oh i can't believe that yeah i can't wear this mask with this shirt you know i'm still on the look for a really cool mask i i go into stores here and then i always just see the default just black masks that a lot of people are using i was thinking about making my own actually uh printing like my composite on the on the front but yeah i wasn't sure what i was gonna do maybe like a face with like some barbecue sauce or something like that in the corner of his mouth so it looks like i have this random person's face that just ate like a messy sandwich or something nice so um let people know where they can find you sean uh you can find me on uh instagram behance google discord everywhere on adobe live what's your website if you uh let me go on my website here uh it's shawnryken.live and that's where basically all of my links are so if you go on that

I will put the link down in the description and probably on screens somewhere here so you can go check it out if you'd like yeah I decided that I wanted to stay up way too late and paint some lighters I'm not a smoker really so I wouldn't get much use out of lighters but my boyfriend would so I thought I would make these lighters imagine dragons seemed since that is his favorite band and I went with the kind of album artwork kind of look for them and they turned out pretty well and he actually really likes them so and if you're wondering that little black spot down there is the Norman but he hangs out with me in the office now down there he's not cute all right let's get to painting [Music] [Music] the [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

you do is remove one of the rubber shoes on the spring clamp take your bic lighter insert it over the top pull back gently and slightly to reach pressure on that gas valve and there you go your lighter is not waterproof alright guys I hope you found this quick ladder hack useful and until next time we'll see you on the trail [Music]", "mcg6mau4rGc": "it's a case for combustion spin the wheel and you have an instant flame flip the lid and the flame is extinguished a version of the lighter first appeared in the 19th century at the time it was more of a conversation piece than anything a curiosity that ignited plenty of interest lighters aren't a novelty anymore but there's still a hot commodity to make lighter cases a machine and coils brass from a spool pulling it to a press the press stamps the brass repeatedly to shape both the top and bottom parts of the case a worker collects them and places them on a revolving table another worker slides on a hinge to link the top and bottom pieces an electrode welds the hinge to the case then a mechanical arm knocks them down a chute to a worker who inspects the welding job as the cases move on a conveyor system they get a quick buff to prepare them for plating the lighter cases are now plunged into a series of washing solutions and rinses followed by a nickel solution then a chrome one it's the finishing touch for the lighter cases it's time to move on to the inner workings a dye shapes a piece of steel to make the inside cases mechanised arms then place a tube and plate in the case the tube will hold the Flint stone and the plate who will form the top of the inner case the epoxy seals them in place and the cases move through a curing oven to harden the epoxy a worker range is a pile of Flint wheels so that the teeth are in the proper direction grippers load the Flint wheels into an assembly jig these cams will eventually act as a catch for the lighter lid a grip replaces the cam in the jig beside the Flint wheel the assembly jig now receives little brass eyelets between the Flint wheel and the camp the machine slides the inner case over the Flint wheel cam and eyelet and an automated device rivets it all together a machine lowers awake to the eyelet and threads it through blades move in from the side and snip the wick this machine stuffs pieces of cotton into the inner case the cotton will soak up and retain fuel when the consumer adds it later steel plungers tamp down the wick and cotton here add I punch cuts a piece of felt to sighs automated arms pick up the felt and shove it into the top of the inner case here grippers place a flint spring in the case just over the Flintstone pneumatic screwdrivers drive the screw home a rubber wheel spins the flint and sparks fly as a light sensor checks their intensity after the Flint check technicians install the inner unit in the case they check the fit they test the function looks like it's an open-and-shut case", "GxQAgZOcqSI": "so what I want to talk about today is my journey for fire my EDC journey for fire I rarely use a lighter for anything but there is times where you know if it's fabric I need to singe or you know light something or in the rarest of cases if I had to start fire to stay warm if something something were to happen my vehicle stopped running or or whatever it may be it's just it's very much a preparedness type device that you can make pretty small so to carry something everyday that gives you fire the benefit outweighs the pocket space so the reason why I make in this particular video is I've always really liked Zippos I think they look really cool they're american-made which is great they have a fidget factor to them and you know they really do round out an EDC look whether you smoke or not just they look really cool right what I didn't realize is the type of fuel Zippo uses and not even the type of fuel just really the design of a Zippo lighter as you lose your fuel source through evaporation now I've heard different different metal types like brass on brass has a better seal I got to imagine though with the wick in the opening you're still gonna get gassing gas off evaporation probably just as quickly like I said I didn't know this so when I purchased my Zippo I purchased a smaller one so it'll fit my key pocket or my coin pocket whatever and whatever you call it and I really liked it but I started to notice that I would get two weeks maybe and it won't work anymore so I just kind of dealt with it I convinced myself you know at least at least if it is out of fuel you still have flint right the throws a spark pretty well you might be able to start something start some kindling on fire with that and then I decided you know maybe I should look into butane lighters and through that I discovered you know you could get a butane lighter for Zippo basically get a butane insert for Zippo so instead of having having the fuel this way you have an actual insert that's a torch butane lighter that's pretty cool I get to keep the cool look I get to you know keep the fuel retention there's one problem though they don't make it for the small Zippo I don't know if you can tell this is the smaller not the full-size Zippo the size of the lighter is important to me earlier I mentioned pocket space well my pocket real estate is precious to me I don't want to carry a full-size Zippo now that might change down the road there may be a time that a time that comes where I decide you know what just bite the bullet get the full-size Zippo and get the butane insert that could happen down the line what I started to realize though is a standard BIC I've got tons of them the small BIC standard sized BIC they're all relatively small and they don't take up a lot of pocket space and furthermore I've got Bix I've owned for years that's how rare it is that I use use lighters but the fact that they lasted for all those years they're so inexpensive especially the smaller one they take up almost no space at all I decided you know why don't we abandon this guy and why don't we just go back to carrying good old-fashioned Bick now this is fine but what I find is it's pretty easy to compress this and lose all your gas so I'm in the same boat here nice small size losing my fuel resource so I looked for awhile and what I found I found this and when I say I found this I bought this guy for two reasons so dolphin it's obviously Chinese or Japanese Chinese rather j5 is the model they make different sizes this is the mini bic I did this for two reasons one I wanted to dress up my boring lighter right so this gives it a better look it goes in further I'm not pushing it in all the way though cuz it is kind of hard to get out you have to push it from the bottom to get it out but you know it dresses up the lighter makes my EDC not look so cheap this is great the thickness of the metal is great but what I realized is this is a win-win for me and I don't know if you noticed earlier at the beginning of the video but I actually have this like this and this is actually how I carry it which is perfect I can't depress the button for fuel it's protected it's down on the bottom here it's pretty easy to get at so when I do go to use it I'll either just pop it out use my lighter see how it works amazing huh I've had this thing for like four years and guess what fire what a shock pose to this guy so for me this is a win-win looks unique I've never seen anyone do this I've never seen anyone flip it this way easy-to-access keeps the button protected and I think it looks great so yeah I just wanted to share that this was an Amazon pickup for me I think it ran me six seven bucks moving forward whenever I need whenever this guy runs out of fuel I'll just pick up one of these small guys for I don't even know how much they are I'm sure they're a buck or less and I can continue on with my life minimal pocket space taken up still has a good look to it I still have fire it's a win win win let me know what you guys all think in the comments please like if this is helpful if you've also had lighter experiences that are good or bad please share because I'm always evolving my pocket EDC and for me this was initially a big win I loved it I loved the size the smallness but the practicality of it for fuel retention was just not there so I'd be curious to know if you guys are using electric lighters butane lighters refillable butane lighters I'd love to hear your experiences what works what doesn't work you know for me if I did smoke and I use this thing every day and I just knew I had to refill it every couple weeks or every week just make that habit this would probably be fine but I want to put it in my pocket I want to forget about it and then the moment I need it I throw it out it's reliable I can use it so yeah thank you hope this is helpful", "jxro9ZnHNaY": "How safe is your lighter? Don't get burned by generic lighters Safety standards require a lighter to extinguish within 2 seconds. But BIC Lighters extinguish immediately Unlike some generic lighters that linger And that\u2019s not safe Don't risk bodily harm BIC lighters are safety and quality tested like no other Flick the safe one. Flick your BIC.", "XlnOY7umKLY": "what's going on guys today's video is going to be about a pretty interesting writer this is called a rope later because the obvious rope that is actually the fuel source for this lighter not only do you not put liquid fuel in here there's no layer fluid there's no butane fluid nothing like that at all the actual cotton rope is the fuel source but in addition to that there is no flame so it's really interesting obviously the most common term for this is a rope lighter because it uses this rope however there's a lot of other terms for it you'll see it's sold as a shepherd slider is a common name for it a sailor's lighter also a trench lighter a lot of times you'll see this to say like you know World War 2 trench later just because apparently it was used during that era but it's a very very old lighter design in the case of a sailor the idea is this is completely windproof because there's no actual flame you're lighting things off of an ember a burning ember which is on the actual rope now oftentimes you'll see it like this where it's tied up this has no significance there's no reason this needs to be tied other than it's not a really long piece of rope hanging so obviously as you use the rope you can keep feeding it through and untie this so you have more of that fuel so this is how this works it's a really simple concept this is the most common design but there are plenty of other designs that use caps as well as like sometimes will be a wheel on the side used to push the Rope up but in this case it's just a ball alright as you pull the ball up you'll see that this is attached to a little rod I guess let's call it and all that has is just a little loop or a hook kind of like a paperclip and that's hooked into the Rope here alright so the idea is it gives you something to pull up but also when you're done using this lighter you pull the rope down and it seals the top which cuts off the oxygen supply which snuffs out the Ember okay so you can reuse the leader now obviously as the rope burns you want to take this piece out you know and then put it a little bit further down and you keep repeating that process until you run out a rope so this is how it works there's a wheel here there's a little Flint underneath the wheel in this tube here there's a spring when the Flint gets low or you have to replace it you simply unscrew this piece and then the whole you know spring will come out just kind of like up like a Zippo lighter and then here you can replace that Flint so all this is gonna do is throw sparks on top of the rope that is already chart and an emperors get a start so it's a really simple concept I'll show you here so you twist this around so the balls away from here you just hold it close to it give it a spark you see how the spark landed on there I'm actually gonna do it another one towards the top here alright see I'll lay in a bunch of spots let's go blow on it and there you go and that will continue to burn give a nice hot ember to start fires you can use this I mean in the case of the sailors apparently they would you know dip this down into their pipe to light their pipe even if they're up on top with incredible winds from storms and stuff there's no actual flame to blow out of course you know naturally it's gonna burn pretty cool but if you blow on it it'll heat up quite a bit you know and that's pretty much it that's how you use this lighter you can use this to light fuses you can you know blow on it next to another wick or something to light a candle and so forth pretty simple concept right and then when you pull the Rope down it goes back in the tube and the bowl again seals off the tube from oxygen so it basically just puts out that ember so you stare for a few seconds for it to completely go out if you pull it down and then pull it back up it'll still be lit all right so as you can see now is Coolio really really simple concept like I said there are some other variants on this design instead of this whole ball with the hook thing some of them have an actual cap that goes on top and on the side there's like a little wheel so as you spin the wheel it'll push the rope up or down depending on whatever direction you're going and there's other designs as well but that's basically the concept is that you have a dry cotton rope all right and you're just throwing sparks at the charred end of it and it works exactly like char cloth would you know if you're into bushcrafting and stuff same thing don't catch a spark you'll create an ember and it'll hold that Ember for as long as you need it all right pretty cool though pretty interesting design since there's no fuel and no flame so if you ever see these things that's exactly how it works a big tip it though which a lot of people don't know is when you get these brand new it's not chart or anything the end of the Rope is just a fresh you know cut piece of rope you have to take a separate flame lighter matches whatever and you have to do an initial char on there so that the sparks will catch all right so here's a closer look of it and give you another demo up-close cuz I'm not sure what else talking what was actually being shown so you can see it's just the charred end of that cotton throw some sparks some light into my hand there and there you go you don't even have to blow on it it's just you know gets a lot hotter and spreads it faster but there you go you have a burning ember thinking is that too light whatever you want you know don't just pull it down that's it pretty simple design these range anywhere from four or five dollars on average for these like cheap modern ones all the way up to who knows what you know if it is a world war ii i don't know how they verify that kind of stuff but some of the older ones they will fetch a higher price tag if they're a little bit beefier heavier a little bit you know better made but this one works just fine you know so you can pick these up all day for you know five bucks or so it's a kind of a cool novelty lighter awesome for bushcraft as well if you are used to making char cloth and you know getting your Ferro rod out throwing sparks at it I mean this is the same concept but it's just all in one little package portable we throw in a pack or pocket or whatever and just use it continuously obviously you could see this will burn for quite a long time you have quite a you know a long rope that comes with these so plenty of fuel source for that but anyway that's all just I have some questions on a rope layer a long time ago and I never made a video about it and I think I trade it off and I just got this one recently so I want to do another video just to kind of talk about a little bit I think it's a really interesting lighter if you happen to collect lighters or again if you're just into you know outdoorsy type stuff making fires a little time maybe something a little bit different to try so let me know down below if you have a rope lighter at home and if so what do you use it for hope you guys have a wonderful day and I will see you tomorrow with another video take care", "Zw4a8oi66NE": "hi guys grad here in this video I want to talk about the BIC metal series so these are just your basic big mini lighters and they make a housing for them that has a spring L lid sort of in a Zippo style the big mini the slides right in and it gives it a more elegant case you know heavier in your pocket and just makes it a little bit nicer that's something that you're interested in one thing to note is that the lid does kind of get in the way of the flame of health at a certain angle this is the larger of the two versions that they make they actually make several different designs I've had this version with a smooth design one this sort of has a border and then little old grooves like perfectly spaced or whatever running up and down and then this one here sort of has grooves without a border and there I don't know haphazardly spaced I don't know how to describe that it has a little hole on the bottom I assume that so when you go to remove or replace the big mini there there isn't a vacuum that's created in here I don't really think it's exactly that airtight anyway that it would create a vacuum but it's a neat design feature it has a little piece of metal on here that sort of been out to help hold the dick mini in place so they put some thought and time into these this is the other version they come in this sort of dark gray and then a silver color about like that and it's just sort of a more slim form-fitting version of the same thing it has a neuro-link and this is clearly some sort of coating that's applied to the metal what's interesting about these is that they're not available in America they're made available in Europe the near and Middle East Africa and Oceania however the internet being the great thing that it is makes it available to anyone who wants to pay for it and this is like thank you for like twelve to fourteen dollars actually I think this one's about twelve dollars for some reason and this one's about seven dollars so you get them in like a set of two on Amazon or Ebay I just thought these were pretty neat I said I had a bunch of these I've given them a lot of them away so this is the only design that I have left right now you know they're really neat really nifty and they're they're cheap enough you know 14 bucks for two and get a few of these and hand them to your buddies or if you're out somewhere and somebody's like oh wow that's really cool I haven't seen anything like that gonna be like here have it and suddenly you're the cool dude so thanks for watching", "_bC0eVM3mYc": "today we're gonna be what I think is the arguably most known lighter and most used lighter in North America the BIC maxi classic lighter that's right this is a serious review happy April Fool's Day the BIC maxi classic lighter let's start with the price right out of the way this lighter will set you back a whole one dollar as far as the unboxing experience is concerned it comes in no packaging you just grab it off the shelf of your local gas station or convenience store and there you go so as far as specs are concerned it is a flint action soft flame lighter it is two and a half centimeters long by 1.5 centimeters wide and eight centimeters tall for our friends in the States that's one inch by 0.6 by 3.15 inches it also weighs 20 grams filled up as far as a construction of the BIC maxi classic the entire body is made of plastic with everything you need placed conveniently on the top on the front you have air vents on the sides you have a Bic logo on one and a warning sticker on the other and the top contains the burner the flint and an actuation button so how do you use this later it's quite simple you just want to grab it like I am from behind where you have your thumb pressed up facing the forward direction you want to place your finger firmly on the strike wheel and strike it back well at the same time pushing down the actuator button causing the butane to ignite it looks something like this and you have a flame as you can see the flame it's around a 1.25 one and a quarter inches and there is no way to adjust it what you see is what you get so let us talk the good and the bad starting of course with the good the good is that the bic lighters have solid construction you'd be thinking whoa it's made of plastic does anyone you know ever complained about breaking a Bic lighter you lose these things before they break on you also as a nice flame it's soft which means it's absolutely perfect for toasting your cigars however it is small side so you might not be able to get the big sixties I'd say maybe a Churchill size at the most with this also it has a fuel window and now you may be thinking whoa hold on there Pat's why would you say there's a fuel window I've seen these things they have no such thing actually hold these up to the light and you can clearly see where the fuel is it might take a little bit of a bright light like the Sun or a bright LED we are definitely able to tell also it has a huge fuel reservoir like I said you'll lose these things before they break on you and you'll lose these things before you run out of fuel so all that being said if a Bic can somehow manage to tell me what fuel level I'm at why is it that these 50 and $100 lighters even $200 lighters don't have a fuel window no excuse its 2017 we need to see this fix the greatest innovator of all time oh I can't say that with a straight face probably probably good for lighters they're popular regardless also it stays cool after long toasting periods of time it will not get hot it'll get a little warm but nothing to a point where your recoiling your hand cuz you burned yourself and of course they're inexpensive they're a buck it makes fire what more do you want and onto the bad it's a small flame as you saw as I mentioned earlier you can't really toast your big ring sizes with it I'd say a churchill max ideally probably a corona like something maybe 42 issuing gauge would be the most you'd want to use it for but it still does what you need and you'll still toast them albeit it will take slightly longer than you would want also zero end resistance which of course is a property of every single soft flame lighter you can take it you just see a little whip around and it gets blown out fairly easily but again it's normal for a soft flame so that's just to be expected so the overall conclusion is this lighter totally recommended why not it's a dollar it lights up it's got a absolute ton of fuel in there and it does what you need unless you're smoking outside you don't need anything else you might want to get a torch but if you're smoking inside if you're doing something else I got started lighting my cigars with I've moved on now obviously but you know what it does the job and for the price you really can't beat it well that's all for today I hope you enjoyed this review leave a like if you liked it leave a dislike if you hate it if you want me to go away then let me know in the comments below if you want to follow me on Facebook Twitter or on Instagram then just let me all the links to those are in the description pardon me and have yourself a very happy April Fool's Day", "rCZX1xqPIg4": "about a year ago i did a video on how to set up a brand new zippo lighter and we went over some tips and tricks uh one of the things that we do is show you how to uh reroute the wick other than when it comes from factory just to help your zippo get better performance and in that video i had a lot of people that asked me if i would do a video on how to fill up a zippo lighter it seems pretty mundane and pretty simple but it's actually there's a couple things you want to avoid and i'm going to explain to you why you want to avoid them so let's just start off by saying this the object of filling up a zippo is to get the lighter fluid into the insert where the rayon balls is but what you definitely want to avoid doing is overfilling it for a couple of different reasons so we're going to start off by just filling this one properly so what you want to do is you want to just pull your insert out and one tip that you can do is if you're afraid that you might overfill it just pop your cam up and then set your insert into your case upside down that way if you overfill it anything you overfill will actually go back down into the case now you notice that on the felt pad down below it definitely says lift to fill i've seen a lot of people that say the little hole in the center you can just fill it off of that and while you can do that it's pretty tedious that is actually meant for an extra flint to go you set an extra flint right in that hole and that's that's what it's designed for however i set mine underneath the felt pad so it's because i like to keep a few extra on board so you definitely want to lift the felt up now the object here is to just get the rayon balls to get them saturated but not to the point of oversaturation and the best method that i can tell you to accomplish that is to just time it what i usually do is i'll lift this up and i'm gonna pour about five seconds worth of fuel in here and then i'm gonna give it a few seconds to settle in and then we'll give it another five seconds and that's it that's all there is to it and you don't wanna do over pressure you don't wanna when you're when you're filling the fluid you don't want to squeeze it super hard so you're getting more fluid in there you're it's just you just want to do it with moderate pressure give it about five seconds that'll do it right there and then just give it a few seconds to saturate in and then once you've done that then give it about five more seconds one two three four and five and you can really see it as the fluid starts to get just to the top of those rayon balls you can probably put a second or two more than that and be sufficient uh but it's really advisable not to try to overdo it so now we'll set the cam back we'll close it up we'll give it just a second and it fires right off so why you want to avoid over saturating or over filling your lighter now not only does overfilling the lighter it it you run the risk of if you try to if you overfill it and then you you immediately try to light your lighter and there happen to be fluid on your table on your fingers or on your case you run the risk of starting fire but that's not the only reason you can also get a chemical burn off of lighter fluid and it's something that you definitely want to avoid and those are this is talking directly to people that would carry their lighter in their front pocket so i have experience with this and what will happen is once you get it to the point where you've got a chemical burn and you feel it it's already too late because it's already burnt you so bad that it is going to burn for literally literally for hours and hours now depends on how sensitive a person's skin is to lighter fluid to the to because lighter fluid is an irritant depending on how sensitive your skin is depends on how much it's going to bother you so i'm going to show you what happens when you overfill a lighter so we've already filled this one and maxed it out so now everything is saturated in there and what we're going to do is we're going to fill it up a little bit more and you'll the way that you'll know that it is overfilled is if i can see liquid and now you can see it's dripping out the bottom because it's so full it's dripping onto my hand so now we know for sure that our lighter is overfilled so i'm going to let this extra evaporate off for just a minute before i try to light this lighter so i've given this a few minutes and i've let all the excess lighter fluid evaporate off and off my hands as well because the last thing i want to do is catch myself on fire so the thing about a zippo is that the two halves of the cases of the case are not sealed and so what will happen is if you're over saturated the rayon balls cannot absorb the excess fluid and so you'll get fluid buildup that will remain in the bottom of the case now if we set this lighter down what will happen is that fluid will eventually drop down and it is going to just flow along the case and it's going to reach the seal and then it's going to come out or between the two halves so if we leave that set there for a minute then what will happen is we'll we'll be able to see when we lift the lighter up you can already tell there's a little line i don't know if it shows up well on camera i'll leave it for a little bit longer but i can already tell that there is fluid that has created a line there where it is seeping out of that seal or out of the two halves and this is what will happen in your pocket if you have an oversaturated lighter then it is eventually going to come out of that between the two halves there and it is going to transfer through your pocket onto your skin and can cause a chemical burn so it's something that you definitely want to avoid now i don't know if it can show up very well on camera but we have a couple lines here where i move the lighter around and it is over saturated another thing it'll do you see how sometimes if you have it like this in fact i'll just turn it upside down for just a second and uh you should be able to really see it now what will happen is sometimes that extra fluid will get into the top of the lid too so when you open it even though you open it and fire it off you can see my lid is burning now so and the flame is super high that's something you just definitely want to avoid and there's times a lot of times what you can hear when you have an overfilled lighter is when you do light it up you'll get like this popping it's because the fluid is getting to the point where it's still liquid form too far up and it's trying to turn to its gaseous form just in an instant so you get this kind of a popping sound out of it where that flame will jump and you'll notice it had a little bit of trouble lighting there also when you have an oversaturated lighter there are times when it actually will not light because it's oversaturated and you can see just how high that flame is because we're burning off that excess fluid so if you ever want to know the dangers of of how dangerous lighter fluid is all you have to do is just look up a lighter fluid burns on it on a google search and you will see just how terrible lighter fluid burns can be over an accident from just burns and you can also see on chemical burns now a lot of those are going to include like grill fluid but zippo fluid is going to be the same thing or in my case i just put ronsonol which is now manufactured by zippo but the point of this is to show you that the last thing that you want to do is to overfill your lighter so just make sure the best method that i know is to time it and you can see that with just a it's about 10 seconds worth just like we did earlier just uh five seconds let it load soak in for about five seconds and then put about five more seconds of fuel in there and you're pretty well topped off much beyond that and you're gonna start over saturating the zippo so i hope this helps and i appreciate you guys watching thank you and we'll see in the next one", "yVWFjnNFheM": "what's good youtube and welcome to the pedal life's 53rd how-to video i'm nick and today i'm going to be showing you how to customize your bic lighter now what you're going to need for this is a bic lighter of course either a white one or one that has the wrapping on it so you can take that off and be left with a nice clean bare lighter for demonstration purposes i already wrapped this one with this uh kind of older decal i had but you could throw on stickers or decals just kind of cut them to shape and then wrap them around it this one i just kind of stuck on there was old and kind of mangled already so i was like why not but for the main kind of customization nail polish or some paint is going to work really well of course you're going to be able to do your own designs i got red and blue here at some point in the future we might go a little bit more in depth with uh the designs of course you can just go at her you know just give her some lines obviously don't get it on the metal part of the of the actual lighter but if you do you can just wipe her off like i just got a bit on there but don't be don't be getting it at the top can throw a clear coat on this as well like i said it doesn't have to be fancy you know what i mean just color in a little bit and then you know you could you can do up some patterns anything you want if you need to you might you might have to do multiple coats or depending on the color of the lighter if it's like a solid one already it's going to work as as well too so you know we'll we'll go back and forth i'm going to try not to mix up the colors because i'm not going to lie these are my fiances so this is what i used to do back in the day could get some sweet looking lighter some artsy stuff you know what i mean some minimalist looking minimalist looking stuff and of course if you want you can start to write things out you know maybe maybe draw some faces we'll get a nice little smiley face going on this side oh this is looking this is looking beautiful pablo picasso would be would be jealous let's get a little let's get a little nose going oh yeah look at that beautiful you know what i mean nice little face let's go ahead let's go ahead put a little bit of let's go put like i you know heart oh it's not coming out well obviously if you get a nice paintbrush it's going to look a lot better but for just the the minimalist designs well i was trying to do i heart then i was going to write like of marijuana's or something there's no way it's gonna happen so you know let's turn that one into a bigger face you mess something up can always be turned into an a face it's a happy mistake you know what i mean happy accidents there is no mistakes sorry bam it's just a bigger smiley face now no problem you know what i mean of course you like colors dry you can start to do some some other layers you know you could rate it a little 420 or something if you want i'm just going at her for speed purposes but you know that's pretty mangled looking little little 420 at the bottom there oh it looks like nothing 420 basically of course set her up you know you can you can customize as much as you want add some different layers write whatever you want on it if you have a probably a finer brush that you could use to really get some some elegant stuff on there you can start to get some some fine detail if you have a lot of patience but i do not so you know what i mean throw a little throw some dots on there why not bam looking good take a little bit more blue like i said you can use stickers or or decals to to get similar effects you know let's just let's let's dab her in between get some funky patterns going on you know what i'm saying of course if i had more colors i could get a little bit more artsy with it but i think for what it is it's fine of course let it dry before you use it or it's gonna it's gonna get your hands nail polishy i already got a bit on my fingers can throw a clear coat on it if you want it to be a bit more protected uh different shades of clear coat you know what i mean if you wanted to be shiny or not you know we got the double smiley face blue and red uh abstract 420 at the bottom see if you can kind of see it see there's the zero there's the two kind of in the middle looks like a five almost and then that just does not look like a four but like i said you can get some sweet designs out of it obviously i half-assed it a little bit in the future might have some more elegant videos showing off some more cool designs if i can get a bit more colors or a bit more options but uh you know tell me how your designs went you know on instagram you could send me some pictures i might show them off if you have some cool designs make sure to tell me in the comments how it went or if you have any cool ideas you know like share and subscribe check out my other videos and thanks for watching peace", "WJoGUCaH4sQ": "hello everybody welcome back jiu-jitsu mm here today I'm coming at you with an interesting video for you today I want to talk about the two most common lighters that you can purchase just about anywhere the first one is the script oh and the second one is the BIC classic now these are both both very good lighters too both very easily accessible easy to find they're both non refillable they're both disposables but in this video what I want to do is I want to show you why I prefer the BIC over any other lighter and the scripto would be a close second but why I like the BIC so my objective of the video today is I'm gonna take them apart and must show you exactly why I like the BIC okay before I get started I want to make sure that you understand that I do not get any kind of kickback I don't get any money I don't get any sponsorship or anything like that from big or script or anybody this video everything that I'm talking about is strictly my opinion and I'm just here to share that with you so there's no shenanigans I'm not hooked up with any of these guys or nothing like that so let me start by taking this script oh and I'm gonna take these little needlenose and I'm gonna bend this little piece of metal here I'm gonna remove this this cap thing off okay I'm keeping my thumb pressed down because this will I don't want this will to fly away so I'm just kind of removing this piece of metal sorry if I got out of camera there for you so I'm removing the will excuse me I'm removing the metal housing setting that down these both are dead okay they don't have any fuel like left in them okay same with the BIC they're both dead now I'm gonna do the same thing with the BIC I'm gonna remove the little metal housing here can I set those two down now let's just take a look at the metal housing alone if you look at them you'll notice that the bic lighter the one on the left the metal housing is much thicker that's the first thing I noticed if I turn on my digital scale here and I take the metal housing from the script oh you can see that my scale is zeroed I put that on the scale it weighs 25 grains the one from the BIC 26.1 so there's a little bit more metal involved in the BIC it's a little bit heavier just slightly now what I'm going to do is I'm gonna slowly I'm gonna look at the lighter and you can see that the button that I push that controls the gas lifts this little thing here the this linkage I guess you could call it is plastic you see that then I'm scraping it right there that's plastic underneath on this script oh it's a plastic piece that could break okay it's not even connected over here it's like they snap it around this piece I think the piece underneath it's brass or something that's the piece that the actual fuel comes out of see that it's brass but this part is all plastic if you look at the BIC it's metal so you got a little a bigger beefier mechanism you see the metal underneath there it's all metal in it's metal that is got plastic around it so that's that's a big significant difference in my opinion you're dealing with metal parts yes you still have your piece of brass here you see where I scratched it that's all brass but to me that's a significant difference just in that one aspect alone again this is not near as beefy it's a lot easier for breakage this button on the BIC it seems a little easier to push to and I think that it does that is because the length of this button is longer and because of its length being a little bit longer see if I put the two buttons almost in line with each other you can see it's a little longer the fact that it's longer means that there's more leverage that's being applied to lift this up now does that matter probably not I just thought I'd point that out now I'm gonna hold my finger here and I'm just gonna pop this will off now be careful if you do this at home because there's a spring-loaded Flint underneath and I don't want to lose that Flint or that spring okay so you can see the Flint right here in my hand it fell out that's the actual Flint itself that's what's in the script oh and here's the will it's got these little outer wheels that go around it they come off let me set that down let's do the same thing with the BIC we're gonna remove this will again I'm being very careful because I don't want stuff to go flying everywhere there's the will of the picked it's a one-piece well and there's the Flint off the BIC now if you look at the Flint's just alone look at the difference here's the script oh right here on the right there's the BIC on the left not only is there more meat to the BIC Flint it's longer but it's also fatter in diameter let's weigh those and see what the difference is in weight on those so the first one on the scale is going to be the script oh 0.8 grains the BIC 1.9 more than double the weight so you get more than twice the amount of pharisee m-flint so again here's the bit cap here's the big Flint script Oh cap script will Flint now let's look at these wheels let's weigh the will of the script Oh thirty four point one the pick twenty six point five so the BIC is a little bit lighter the will now let's take a look further let's look at the actual spring that's involved with this lighter let's pull this baby out and see there's the spring that we're dealing with with the script Oh decent little spring I'll see nothing wrong with that nothing too significant let's look at the BIC there's the big spring there's the script Oh spring says it all right there folks quite a significance now the reason that I'm mentioning the spring and that there's more of it on the BIC because if we are in a survival situation and we have to pull resources out of this lighter say for example we need some wire maybe to make a compass or something like that or to tie us narrow or anything there's more wire on that BIC than there is on that script oh that's just the bottom line big difference let's weigh these starting with the script Oh whoops sorry about that folks 2.0 actually it bumped down to 1.9 3.5 so you got a significant difference in the weight of the springs now we're talking about the fuel vessel itself okay you know I mentioned earlier the the metal that's involved here versus the plastic now this scripto is an adjustable flame that's kind of cool the pic doesn't have that but let's take this another step further and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to tear into these fuel tanks and I'm gonna look inside okay we're gonna start with the scripto and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take this little grinder and it might get close to my fingers I don't want you guys to freak out look at this thing is very weak it's not that powerful it's a pretty easy grinder I know you guys kind of rag on me because I use this thing but it's not that big of a deal so I'm just gonna fire it up that's what we're dealing with there let's look at the bit okay let's look at the bottom half looks like the BIC has a little bit larger reservoir I will say that I liked the script Oh in the fact that the reservoirs are see-through you could see you know if you had a flashlight you could definitely look in there and see your fuel level on the BIC it's a little harder to do that see the difference there so on that aspect I liked the script Oh better you know the ability to see your fuel inside so I'm just kind of looking in here just playing around there's the width if you will of the script Oh some of the wick see it's a small chamber and that's plenty thick you can see that the plastic is plenty thick so it's not like they're giving you some weak skinny little fuel canister it's thick plastic there's the wick in there the pic does not have a wick the plastic is just as thick - divider in the middle is thicker on the script Oh which I don't think that really matters internally let's look at the upper half just kind of clean this up a little quick take a look and see what it looks like up here looking down inside can I see some metal parts inside on the right there I see like a piece of brass or metal let's check this one out so this one has a little wick that's kind of cool but apparently it's not necessary because Bick doesn't do it let's pull this wick thing off if we can on a wolf we can or not now let's look down inside and yeah we got a little bit of metal in there too but the major differences are these ones did I mentioned earlier look at the difference in the size of the spring and the in the the Flint Vic has such a much bigger Flint I mean if you yeah I I know this might sound funny but if you were in a survival situation and you had to rely on that Flint if all you had was you know you're out of fuel and all you had was the spark which this isn't a good example because this one has feel but if all you had was a spark look at the difference in the amount of sparks that you would get I mean it's pretty pretty simple to figure that out that she'd get a lot more sparks out of the Vic so that aspect alone makes me want to buy a Bick right there just in that because you know I don't know if you've seen my fire video where I took an old lighter that didn't work anymore and I showed you how to make a fire using that spark I had a cotton ball and it was an old beat-up bic lighter but that that wick or excuse me that Flint you know it gave me the ability to make that fire and there's other tricks that you can do with the Flint as well and I'll show you in another video in the future but anyway I want to say thank you guys for watching my video today on dissecting the Bick versus the scripto I hope you found some good useful information I hope that you guys share this video please like my video thumbs up on it if you don't mind feel free to comment feel free to subscribe and as always have a beautiful day we'll see you next time now get out there and get you a Bic lighter I think they're the best bye bye", "-xVVIdNMt-0": "okay this video is going to be a test on the BIC lighters to see how well they do in the cold they've been in the freezer for about over six hours so I'm gonna hit the start button and I'm gonna go run in and get the the BIC lighters and then we'll see if they light up and see how much time it takes for them to light up the room temperature in here is probably between 75 and 80 okay so I'm gonna run and get the BIC lighters trip over the lights okay that's the electronic one and it's it's almost empty this is the classic that's almost empty and that one's pretty full so right off the bat you can see some of the ice see there's some ice crystals okay so this one is the one that's almost full you know what I'm gonna shut the lights off well that's unexpected this is the one that's almost full Wow you know some of the stuff I've seen on the web is not matching up with some of my own testing okay this one is I would say about two thirds empty okay so obviously the ones that are more empty don't let me try this one again this is the classic again okay so what I'm seeing is is when you have a Bic lighter that's full it seems to do better in the cold weather okay so you're you can see the flames already gone up from the first strike the very first one we're only two minutes in two and a half minutes into the test I don't think it would warm up I mean you know it's just it just came out of the freezer okay this is the electronic one okay this one is almost empty Wow so okay that's the full one see if we can get this almost empty one two oh no this is the one that's about two thirds empty okay it did light if the the flip must be a little wet from the condensation okay so this one it's about 75 to 80 degrees in this room a-plus I'm handling it so all the ice is melted but look we're still under we're not even four minutes in this one definitely requires some more so the Flint on this one you know it is a little sluggish probably because of the condensation this one's brand new now look at that there's a little at the macro adjust here come on I have a macro setting on this camera but obviously it doesn't want to kick in there it goes so you see a little black on the right above the BIC Oh on the the valve opening here the valve tab I'm wondering if that's Flint part of the Flint because this one's very new I've only struck this one about maybe less than 20 times so the Flint looks like it's gotten onto the same with this one come on macro I liked my other camera better is quicker see there's some more black so when the Flint gets moisture on it it it looks like it breaks down a lot more or or just the Flint no because this one's new so there wouldn't be that much Flint on the on the wheel so that's that's something them you know when it gets waterlogged the flip might get might erode quicker but regardless of that it's under five minutes all these lid and unfortunately I can't give you the temperature of the freezer but it's well under you know the freezing point I think most freezers run about fifteen degrees under freezing so surprisingly this guy has survived the most most of the tests in the water test of course I didn't test these for for water but this one did good on that it lit up right away on the the this cold test the only thing I don't like about the idea of this one is it's got the electronic ignition if that fails you're you're pretty sunk the classic lighters you know they use a very simple way a very tested way of lighting the gas so I would say that this one's probably pretty good for your main one and then just have your your bit classics as your backup lighter because if if anything goes wrong with this electronic trigger system to ignite it you know you're pretty much sunk but at least with this it's it's still very simple way to light a flame it may not be as fancy and reliable as this one but it's still this is still a good way to do this so anyway that's the test I'm just a little shocked because I've heard I've heard bad things about how these light in the cold of course it's not cold now I mean they're they're pretty much warmed up but obviously it's good to have a full bic lighter a brand new bic lighter because this one lit up like right away and then the electronic one is definitely a good one to have but but I would save and just make sure you have a classic Vic with you as well that's full so anyway that's my test I've been having fun doing this and I'll probably do some more on these lighters because a lot of people put them down because they're just so simple and cheap and I'm just starting to learn about them I mean I've only been fiddling with them for less than a month and I'm pleased with them and they're definitely gonna go out my bug-out bag or go into my bug-out bag so okay thank you for watching", "qeNaKcLBB0U": "so i've got a little tip i wanted to share um this is inspired by blackout bushcraft's video where he used a bit of bank line and put it under the button so um so it couldn't press down and release gas if you know if it was in your pocket or your bag or whatever i didn't have any bank line so i tried it with a bit of bungee cord and it did stop the lighter from igniting but um but i could still hear a bit of gas escaping when i pressed it down quite hard and then i had the idea to use a bit of bungee cord attach it to a chain link it's for a titanium hanging pot set and it just fits on pretty well it it slots it's easy with two hands obviously but it just slots in place like that and that will not budge i used um black bungee cord initially and dropped it a couple of times and it was really hard to find so i've used orange bundy bungee cord and then actually realized well rather than taking it off the lighter just push it down it's it's still there you're not going to lose it start your fire put it back on and that's solid sits flush almost will not budge so a little tip for you though works with a clip light as well just as well will not budge for that thank you", "BR8vzXF7gAo": "hey guys Paul here from Brad bushcraft so I'm gonna be doing a quick video about which lighter I think is best the BIC versus the Clipper so don't go away alright so let me start with the thick it's pretty much been my go-to lighter in my whole life I've never been a fan of the Zippos and some of the other lighters that you can get around here like the super cheap disposable ones but the BIC I find it's a pretty reliable lighter it's easy to use and it's it's just been my go-to lighter the the only thing is with the BIC you can't refill it once once it's done you throw it away it's garbage and I've noticed in the last 20 years or so it made a few changes where I'm not I'm not fond of the they added the old childproof thing at the top I usually pop it off it's it's not doesn't make that much of a difference to use but I find it just a little easier to use without it so I usually pop it off and then the other thing too there used to be years ago a little wheel here where you could adjust the flame and they don't do that anymore so it's still a good lighter it's better it's what I've been using for years so but I find the older style like 20 years ago we're a little bit better than they are today you can also get them in a smaller size which some people like better for myself I like the bigger bit better I find the smaller ones are a little more awkward to handle so I this is usually the size I go with I usually picked a bright color that's easier to find if I drop it so that's the BIC the drawbacks you can't refill it once it's done you throw it away you can usually get them for usually a doll or something by themselves to around a doll or if you buy like a pack of four you can usually buy like a pack of or for around $4 give or take a bit so they are fairly cheap around $1 each so been using them my whole life good throw away later so recently I found out about the Clipper and I checked on Amazon I seen there I think I bought a pack of 4 for $10 so a little more expensive than the BIC but the nice thing with these is that you can refill them you can actually pop the Flint out and if the lighters garbage still use the flint without the lighter which is pretty neat in a survival situation and you can also replace the flint which is a pretty cool feature if you ask me the flint is a little more like hexagon style which I don't mind some people I heard don't like it as much I weigh I it doesn't bother me at all but the other really neat feature I like about the Clipper is if you light it and you turn it sideways the flame goes up a bit really nice for starting fires so a really good feature so for a bit more money I can fill this up I don't know how many times but it's a really good feature that I can't buy fluid and keep refilling this light or over and over again as in the back I'm throwing it away and the really nice thing about that is is if I'm going on a camping trip or hiking or something and I'm gonna be doing like two three nights overnight in the woods I can pop it up right before I leave so that I know it's gonna be good for my entire trip or if some happens I know I got a full lighter as in the bit if I'm going on a big camping trip and I got a big that's like half full or a quarter I'll usually leave it at home and buy a new one so it's kind of a little more of a hassle so real big plus about the clipper now for size comparison they're pretty much the same size the clipper is a tiny bit smaller and both comfortable to keep in your pocket so no real advantage there so after using the Clipper for a few months I have to say I do like it better than the BIC just the fact that you can refill it you can change the Flint take it out it's just such a nice lighter just the the flame thing when you tip it over it makes it easier to start fires in the woods so for me I'm uh I'm sold so for now from now on I'm carrying a clipper when I go camping and the BIC well sorry BIC you've served me well for years but I have to say that the Clipper is the superior lighter for me anyway maybe you have reasons that you like the bit better if you do let me know in a comment I'd love I'd love to hear why you think the BIC might be better than the Clipper but I am surprised that we don't see the Clipper in North America more than we do I had to go on Amazon to find it I heard you can get him in like specialty tobacco shops and stuff but I for me I just order it on Amazon I just wish I could have picked I'd better pick up a color what color where I could have took a color that's a little more bright so in case if I drop it it's easier to find and a color where I can see the fluid and lighter but no big deal it's still I got a four pack for ten dollars so very good little lighter I'm very impressed and I can see why all you Europeans really love the clipper it's it's a very good lighter and the fact that you don't have to throw it away you can keep refilling it it's very well done you can also get like premium Clippers that come in stainless steel and all that better better quality and everything so I'm gonna look into that also and see if I can find one of those although I don't want to spend twenty bucks on a lighter because if I do lose it and you kind of feel a little more crappy about it and you lose a lighter that's a couple bucks no big deal you can just replace it well there you go guys just a quick review on the new clipper compared to the BIC for me the Clipper wins that's just my go-to lighter from now on and thank you for mentioning this to me about the Clipper because I had no idea about them so it's really to find out about this little later very happy I tried it and I'm going to stick with it and keep using it so thank you very much for watching please like comment and subscribe and until next time guys I'll see you all out in the woods", "qHTEDwV8BeA": "all right good afternoon folks this is baby ones Miggy here to talk to you today about portable torches ok lighters and what they can do for you more importantly how to pick one that's right for what you smoke so I'm sure you know on this channel I'm mostly talking about cannabis mostly the kind you can smoke so today I'll be talking about my experience with it all this time my experiences with just kind of figuring out what lighters work for me what doesn't and where I've wanted to put my new favorite so everybody knows the BIC it is by far the cheapest one I'm gonna look at today with the average cost of you know less than a dollar to just over a dollar depending on where you buy it from they're cheap they're effective they are not especially wind proof at all we've got a light breeze going right now and you can see this guy does not want to stay lit at all and so that can be knowing sometimes if you're doing a trying to light a very tiny roach and you need a hand to cup hold the lighter as well as hold the roach so just something to think about there but yeah classic effective something your pocket easily don't have to worry about refilling it don't worry about somebody stealing it because it's cheap and you know anybody who's watching this video I'm sure you've used one so you know have these the next one that I got into when I start smoking seriously was was the Zippo and so this is going to be the most expensive one these are averaging around $20 apiece I believe if you just go for a plain one but these Zippos are obviously you know legendary american-made all of that fun stuff my only problem is you're dealing with the non actually sealed container with with real wet fuel to refill these things and so you know you can add too much you can add too little you can get lighter fluid all over your hands there's a big old drop down here on my tree now and then I have to flip this over and make sure I don't drop any more of it than I absolutely have to but uh there we go so that can be a little tedious at times and sometimes I can just at least in Vegas the if you leave the top open they can actually evaporate the fuel out of here and this stays or whichever lighter I'm using stays on my tray outside pretty much at all times so as much as I love the class of the Zippo and heft and just it being an American classic my favorite is gonna be these guys and so I know what you're thinking why these don't look that much different from the Zippo they're not but that much different the size what's the deal so why do I like these more is well you have the the tube lighter which is made in China and you can go anywhere from tiny flame to decent sized one if you're trying to roast a bull or whatever or if you're trying to light a roach you can just pull in on this little tiny flame you don't have to worry about burning the tip of your nose off or anything like that it does have a Paizo sorry piezoelectric lighting system so you don't get the neat flick that you do in the regular ones but you get that extra added benefit of not having your finger next to the flame so if you really are trying to light something and it doesn't go hell I use these to light incense cones and I've never burnt myself fun on either of these I have burnt myself on both a Zippo and a BIC several times even when I'm trying not to the only problem a big problem with the BIC is you know I'll light it and the nice thing is you can set it down and keep it burning and you know cut their hands around it and hold the roach whatever you need to do but the problem is this whole time this is this whole thing is the middle and it's already it's already getting warm so the entire time that that's burning you still have to worry about picking it up and closing it at some point and you might scorch it so well we have V the tube lighter we also have just the standard clipper which I've see has a very nice nice sized flame to it and the other nice thing is you can go at angles because it's just pressurized butane so if you're flipping it over trying to light a bowl or something you're not gonna you know you're the tube inside of here isn't gonna basically come out of the fuel so you're not gonna have to worry about that and this is probably too hot to grab but I'm doing it anyways and I was testy and the other nice thing is I use this a lot more than I thought I would and so sorry if I can get that to focus so this is the legendary clipper flint poker so what the nice thing is about this is when you're done you don't have to completely you know have to come down here and unscrew this and hold on to the spring and all that stuff to replace the flint replacing the Flint in these is literally if you can just get the pre-made refills is literally as easy as just pop in a new one in another reason I like these is refilling these is a lot more straightforward you don't have to open anything you don't have to do anything crazy you go get yourself a little can of butane which is let's see about nine ten bucks apiece for a can of this where is the Zippo fuels like and I juice what is that 8 to 10 bucks apiece so you know not too far off the Zippo Flint's are a little bit cheaper but I mean refilling is easy as boom and you're ready to roll again so I mean it's just in terms of cost the Clippers more expensive than the BIC but you also get all of these great features and adjustable flame and all that stuff it's cheaper than the Zippo these don't heat up so bad and they're a lot easier to maintain so I'm the big fan of these just for the size and lack of waste aspect of these because you're gonna there's no way to refill this you're throwing this out at some point and trash trash folks so there's that I try to use picks at all anymore one of the other big things for me is when you're using this said Ronson all has a lot of themes to it and you can taste that anybody has ever lit a cigarette or a joint or whatever with the Zippo can tell you you taste that fuel you don't get that with the with the refined butane it just you just get the heat so it is a big thing for me I don't get that initial bird and my lungs whenever I first light up anymore with these some big fan of that wind proof they okay they're not terrible we got a it ok little breeze going right now I'd say they're definitely better than the BIC not as good as the Zippo suppose got this whole cage around it so if you live in a particularly windy place maybe this is a way to go for you maybe you don't mind all of the I guess the upkeep and an extra maintenance required because you just love having that piece of American metal in your pocket but if you are looking for a new style light or want to try something new get tired of burning your fingers I'd say give the Clipper a shot should be able to be found in any decent local smoke shop wherever you are so yeah that's about it so cheap effective but extremely wasteful and not much visual feel expensive lots of visual appeal lots of tactical tactical wouldn't have lots of tactile and auditory niceness here but it's hot the Flint replacement I think is kind of a pain in the ass it requires a lot more upkeep these guys are about as simple as dick lighters but they have everything is replaceable and you don't taste gas when you first light up your smoke and that's big for me so that is about all I got for that so those are my thoughts on lighters and why I am probably going to be a clipper fan until they stopped making them hopefully they don't but let me don't let me know down in the comments what do you guys like to spark up with and or if there's any other lighters that you found that or you think you're superior to the Clipper or the Zippo yeah anyways thanks for watching if you made it this far please take a moment to LIKE and subscribe if you found this interesting I want to see more stuff like this it really helped me out and as always if you have any questions put them down in the comments let me know if I get enough questions I'll make another video to address the questions otherwise I'll just reply directly in messages so anyways thanks for stopping by and have a good one", "TKWpH4zRUQE": "hi this is jordan from custom tobacco and today I'll be showing you how to light a cigar with a standard flame lighter this is a little cheap bic lighter cost about 99 cents buy it at any gas station fits in your pocket very handy to always have on you and as with the torch lighters you're going to do the same thing you can see I'd have a little bit of wings so it might be a little hard but I'll kind of use my body to block the wind and as you can see I'm very gently priming it so I'm not burning it directly I'm just kind of slowly roasting the end of the cigar slowly charring it slowly preheating it like so and you can see that you know now I'm at about my desired length you know I've kind of got a nice char around the whole cigar it's not burnt but it's starting to smoke starting to heat up and at this point I'll start smoking it so I'll use the same technique of gently twisting the scar to get a nice even burn occasionally I'll give a nice light blow towards the end of the cigar to distribute the flame you can see here it's burning a little more on the bottom than on the top the top isn't as well lit so I can either give it a gentle blow up like so or apply a little more flame that is how you light a cigar with a standard flame lighter essentially the same with a cheap lighter you know same process thank you", "-3P7wDbZA74": "Hale done well on the show today is which I only got a little bit here is a bit lighter hack so your beat kids run out of fluid you've got some char cloth or charred Punk or you just frayed up some cotton or something like that most show you can take stuff out of your kit just like a needle or pliers or anything like that and without taking the beat apart you can take this child safety proof office is just something that yeah I wanted to show I don't know you know some people may know this some may not but you know you risk and taking this apart losing that spring so and the way to do this is make sure I'm up here close you take I'm trying to look through the screen and do this at the same time you'll take and depress that little deal can you see that okay you can see that get something underneath there and you'll Bend those tabs up now see that just popped free all right now you'll take and put your needle underneath there and take a little prying in a little wiggling just like that whoop there she went it'll pry right out a little problem I do this to all my big lighters and stuff - well then every letter is lucky I found this one and then all you have to do is depress those little tabs back down lighters good to go and then once you're done with that if you need to get into the lighter which most people knows how to do that to strike some stuff you're just going to pull this guard here off which other paint get it right now but there you go and then you can strike and get whatever you need going but she works perfect now but say she was out of fluid and just doing this number here well she's going to light up when you take this guard off you can get your char cloth or whatever closer to it but like say I would not just leave that on that way you don't risk this coming apart losing your spring inside and your piece of Pharisee them go flying out and then it just be totally inoperable but there you go guys just a little quick video to show you that for those that may not have known catch you next time", "Bbvuqp2isnI": "how about a movie bubbly lady this bar is dog so with a flick of my pick I can see you're right hey coffee tea or a flick of my big trick of the mix huh three to the big sir why just light up when you can flick your BIC it's smooth easy on the thumb and you get thousands of flex from a single deck lebec for your time stop licking your BIC", "XYngswO9Gp4": "okay as promised I told you that I'm going to show you how to turn this into something really cool and you will need a bit lighter and a clamp like this I bought this down at Home Depot for a dollar so first thing we're going to do is get rid of all the unnecessary parts here we've got to get rid of this windscreen so we'll pop it off throw it away we're going to need to take this roller out here be careful because underneath here is a spring where your Flint is and so you've got to be very careful in taking that out so that it doesn't fly all over the place okay I've got that loose from that side then that back just jab and just like that your Flint went flying then all this stuff down here comes out this is not needed just extra weight okay and that's what you're going to end up with fortunately it didn't fly too far there's my Flint you're going to need this bottom part you're going to need that spring put that spring back in in there we're going to put that Flint back on top and then a wheel on top of that I'll show you what that looks like when I get it put together okay there we go we've got that put together by the way you want this empty the next thing we want to do is get this bottom the easiest way to do that is just cut this off so let me grab a tool and get that cut off for you real quick okay that's what we've got so far what we're going to do so we're going to take some cotton balls and put a little Vaseline on them and then we're going to take and pack this end with cotton balls now we're going to take this clamp and take the ends off of this clamp need two ends right like that well take off of those clamps now those ends will fit one over this end will fit on there like that the other end you put over your Flint this will go over there like that and now what you have is water proof you have an ignition source and your tender very small package bic lighter will cost you less than $2 and the clamp was $1 there's a three dollar fire kit right there very easy very simple okay next time I'm going to show you how to make a stove using three cans", "ehoeCf7voaM": "hey guys mark here for Santino cigars cocktail Santino Sundance Garvey I've got mark SOI her back with me say hi hello Steve Hodges the man this is this week's just a tip I'm getting ready to take off the Vegas small for the IPC PR so maybe a cigar guys y'all know what it is you know the biggest trade show of the year or blah blah blah we're gonna talk about traveling with cigars lighters and cutters all right every one of us here's traveled every one of us here is flown to multiple countries and lots of places and all over the states multiple countries multiple countries know so I mean first thing you guys you big travelers know well any but I have traveled there's a lot of chat there's a lot of misconceptions when it comes to traveling now especially with TSA regulations so we all know that we can't take a torch through TSA but they all like to say that you can take a soft flame through TSA now a Bic can always fly matches can always fly when it comes to anything fueled with butane you got a check in your luggage all right so when you fly what do you do with your cut area life well I check it you could I love my cutter and I go everywhere with it I take it easy I take it to Dubai I take that this this cutter goes with me everywhere and I'm not willing to leave it because I don't want to have to to be in a place where I have to rely on somebody else's I know that people have actually everybody's very particular about their style of cut some people like the beat cut some I've met people who who sliced it with a knife this is what I want and I make sure that I always have it and unfortunately I can't take down the plant as far as I know right haja when you travel what do you do with your son go ahead I can take everything but a butane now this one I've already traveling with a couple times it's got one cutter in the back with this the only thing like the butane is what you're talking about they'll they'll call me out there they will not let me take the view tank I've even tried to go like zero butane you like your cut it's nothing like that are you tain out of it I've tried to do it with all buting's like yeah so is that a Czech baggage or a carry on carry on yeah so but the cutter and the cigars this cigars can't cool but the butane lighters was whatever reason even I try to do it with no butane because I thought well we've got no butane in it maybe they'll let me slide but no go right so my check-in with TSA my understanding everything we do so any lighter whether it's a soft flame butane filled a full butane single towards triple torch quad torch you find a decade war it's good for you it's a lot of lot of flames if you check it in your baggage if it is checked it can fly now like Mark said when it comes to particular particular cuts and lights I don't like flying somewhere and I have to get a a cheap cutter a D Jeep lighter or you know a lot of times like matches are awesome I use matches a lot when I'm in the basement or where someone's house we're hanging out and there's no wind around matches don't work and win these scenarios and you can't use them and that's just seem to be able to go anywhere so the tip this week is simple if you're flying take your cigars take your cut out of your choice your lighter of your choice as long as it's not a butane torch so you're trying to you know burn the world down with you can take that check it in your baggage ziploc bag is preferable they can see it in a contained case that helps put it in your baggage check it don't carry anything on if you're flying Southwest your first-rate baggage up to 50 pounds is free shopping Southwest love Southwest take it check it fly with it for mark Steve and myself that's this week's Justin tip", "84WtXVweO8w": "you know goes to I'll just break the ice with a flick of my big what I want to call my chick all I do is flick my BIC look at the big huh Oh quickly the big huh why just light up when you can flick your BIC it's smooth easy on the thumb and you get thousands of flex from the single BIC so that break butane stop putting your big", "lmRZILBsqE8": "this is the new lighter this is a cigarette lighter cover that houses a full-size big liar and it just simply snaps into the lighter pit cover these are in two different colors currently available we can get them in the white with blue and caps that you're looking at we can also get them in the blue with white in caps what makes this cover so cool is that it has a retractable stainless-steel pick that slides out of the case this picks about two inches in length and like I said it's made of stainless steel this is perfect for cleaning you know bowls on on tobacco pipes stirring tobacco all kinds of things that would be related to smoking and whenever you're not needing the pick you just simply pull the pick and retract it back up into the case it retracts all the way back up you know this beats carrying I've seen some devices where they made they took a Bic lighter and retro didn't had a piece of wire at the end of it and then they carry it in her pocket well then it tears your pocket and stuff like that this won't do that when it comes time to change the lighter you just simply snap the lighter out and discard it and snap the lighter back in it comes without a lighter so you'll need to get your own cigarette lighter to put in it but we do have other colors and designs coming soon but currently we just have the two colors in this design that you're looking at right now so it's a really cool product if you smoke or know somebody that does smoke", "KPUxlrxkFEE": "hey guys at Steve's I've got a quick product review for you guys tonight we're gonna be taking a look at the big flame disk this is basically a quick solution for those tailgate or camping or beach little cookouts where you just want a quick and easy no hassle solution to grilling up some good food so let's go ahead and take a look and take a look at this flame disk here so again all this is is a little portable grilling solution that you're gonna be tossing and one of your little kettles you know primarily a weber jumbo Joe or Weber Smokey Joe silver or gold so they kind of got a little picture here illustrating this these are a 1 burn product so you're not going to be reusing these so you're gonna use them once and then the flame burns out and then just trash them these are this is what it looks like on the back we'll take it out here the box in a second but these are made primarily out of a solidified corn based ethanol so it burns super clean and really the you know the way these work is you just light one of these holes and it just produces a constant flame it claims here for for 40 minutes it says right here lasts about 40 minutes actually cooking on used a couple these this weekend on a Beach condo trip we went on and the flame stayed lit for closer to an hour and we cook some really good food on it so let me go ahead and take it out of the box and show you what it looks like alright so this is it right here and all you got to do is you just pull this top off see that just peels back and you go ahead and rip that all the way off I'm gonna wait until them ready to toss this on the kettle before I pull it all the way off you can see the the solid down in there and you just light that hole and in about four to five minutes you're ready to cook so we'll pick back up on just a second at the kettle all right guys so I've got my weber jumbo joe the crate quart cast iron system installed here i'm just gonna go ahead and seal the rest of this top off so these Craig ports have a I'm sorry the jumbo Joe has the 18 a half-inch diameter so this kind of puts in the perspective on how big these flame discs are so all you got to do is slide this down underneath doesn't matter what which one of these holes you like slide it and that's it and you heard that quick little blasts and it's quickly spread all the way throughout one of the things I want to mention is you can hear this thing starting to take off here is that they claim both on the packaging and on their website that you should leave the lid off because the burn product in here the ethanol requires as much air as possible to put form to the standards of the way they designed it but I will tell you that several times this weekend when I was cooking on it the flame at times can get pretty hot especially when you have fats dripping down onto the aluminum what those do is you know cause some flare-ups when the fats do hit the aluminum they instantly kind of steam and vaporize and kick back up to provide more flavor into whatever meat your cooking so that's a huge advantage of these verses where charcoal it's just gonna you know hit down the strip down so this is kind of similar to the grill grate where once those juices hit down they vaporize and just go straight back up into the meat so that's cool but I did close the lid several times this weekend I'm gonna do that tonight on look in a couple tenderloins I'm going to do that tonight you can see the flames really starting to get going now they claim it takes just about four minutes and then you're ready to cook so you can already see how well that start meaning it's incredibly hot already and but you can put the lid down especially if you're trying to cook a little bit lower heat or maybe cook indirect a little bit like I'm gonna do with these pork tenderloins so I'm going to go ahead and just though the the rest of the crate quart sections on top of here let it heat up a little bit and then I'll walk you through this tenderloin cook all right guys so it's been about five minutes and our flame disk has been cranking here what I meant to do when I lit it I actually pulled off one of these grates and slid it over to this side of our little jumbo Joe here cuz I'm gonna throw these nice-looking tenderloins over some direct heat at first just to get them some some nice char on them I won't keep them here long probably just a couple minutes I got two of them here and so we'll get some nice char and then I'm gonna pull them and put them over here on this outside edge and let them cook indirect until we hit an internal about 135 140 so we'll pick back up in a few minutes all right so I've got a nice little char on these they've gone about two-and-a-half minutes per side that's all I want on these but I don't like cooking a pork tenderloin over direct heat so I'm just gonna pull these guys way off to the side like this and then I'm going to take some more of this citrus onion this is actually just one of the store-bought stubs marinades which is just phenomenal pork I'm just gonna give these a good little little bass you can see how much flame that flame disc is still cooking it cranking out nothing is just going to go for about close to an hour so really convenient those are good and basted and what I'm gonna do now is basically what they tell you not to do I'm gonna go ahead and shut this lid alright I've got my vent on this side so it's gonna be pulling some hot air up over that meat cooking that meat and I'll be monitoring it with my digital thermometer and I'll pick back up in a few minutes alright guys well these tenderloins are cooking I wanted to show you a couple little things that I've kind of figured out as I've used a few of these flame bits over the last few days obviously when you shut the littleness it does kind of have a negative effect on the overall performance of the flame dish so it does kind of start it doesn't put it out but it definitely starts kind of knocking some of the overall heat and flame down out of it and I'll show you when I open this so you can see the flame wasn't near as strong but as you keep this open for 25-30 seconds it starts kind of growing and starts you know moving over to other areas that may have kind of dwindled down a little bit and already almost the whole disk is you can see that flame just rising right now so you got to kind of like play with it especially if you're trying to do like a lower heat indirect cook you don't want to burn food like these tenderloins so the longer you keep the lid open the stronger that flames gonna get and obviously the hotter your cook environment is gonna be so one thing I actually was playing around this weekend as you take the lid and you kind of just offset it you don't close it all the way so over here on the back side I've actually got a gap so there's more air coming to it so it's allowing a little bit and we're oxygen to get in there to that flame and a lot of flame just to run a little bit hotter so just play around with it you know you can keep the lid completely off but I did find on cooking indirect that it did a lot better job with a lid down alright guys these tenderloins are looking gorgeous they just hit about 140 we're gonna go ahead and pull these look at that an awesome color smell great check that out so I'm gonna go ahead and pull these I mean let these rest for a few minutes and all you gotta do is just leave this lid open if you have some more grilling to do you know again these will go about 40 anywhere between like 40 minutes in an hour and keep that lid open so you got plenty of seating in that fire and don't keep the lid down too long because at some point it does have the potential to put it completely out so we'll pick back up in the kitchen all right guys here we go so I'll let these rest about 10 minutes piece of this look at that see how just amazingly do you see that came out some nice char of course we need to go ahead and taste this you can use whatever marinade you want on these pork tenderloins always come out great and look at that hmm gosh I was so good awesome end product there on the pork tenderloin so just so you guys know they've been following my channel for a long time I am a charcoal guy at heart I'm always gonna be a charcoal snob but this is a really cool little product that's super convenient light it let it burn cook your food and then throw it away so you can dis it if you want but I've been really pleased with it I think it works really well so check one out and I'll let me know what you think in the comments and we'll see you again soon you", "SzFL_1_dQbM": "what's going on everybody if the title says this is my homemade mini torch simply took a IV in a bit glider and hair band and Thur them all together let's demonstrate this possible here bear with me here while we get to set up right got back on Oh hold on just go ahead and light it up I mean there we go so normally you would be able to have a lighter burn for more than a few you know like 30 minutes or 30 seconds or so I mean my bad with this method you can keep it burning for several minutes and multiple uses for this do some soldering some braising or if you just want to burn some stuff you can go ahead and burn some stuff homemade mini little torch thanks for watching time to go get the next time", "fQVV6b3HORA": "this is called the lighter grill and as you can see it's a lighter hanging on the lanyard and at first you wouldn't think anything of it you're like oh that's just a lighter if somebody takes on a smoke break but they have hanging on their necks when they're camping go start a fire but it's actually a multi-tool that's what's kind of cool about it is everybody usually has a big ladder whether you smoke or not if you're a smoker obviously for obvious reasons you have a lighter but if you're if you're a camper or a survivalist prepper you're usually going to have a big ladder in your kit or on in your vehicle somewhere just in case you need to start a fire for whatever reason and it's kind of nice to have a multi-tool on your lighter it makes something that usually only has one purpose into something that it has app now it has multiple purposes so let's take a look at some of the tools that this thing has on it one of the cool things that I just used was the cap lifter a bottle opener right here on the back you see that a flat spot right there you just put that on your bottle they pop it just like that as you can see here you have a plain edge blade nothing hardcore I mean you're not going to be splitting wood with this shape from the factory it's just enough to cut paper I mean I don't expect this thing to be a razor blade but as you can see it'll cut and of course if you sharpen this yourself you can get this thing really sharp I'm sure I don't know what steel this blade is but it's just enough to do basic cutting stuff and then next to that is a microbe Phillips head screwdriver I don't you guys can actually see that alright so here's an example of a real world use of this micro Phillips head screwdriver these are my $400 prescription Ray Bans and I dropped these the just today I just dropped these off the coffee table and the lens popped out because the eye frame was a little a little loose so I took the Phillips head screwdriver on this lighter broke and used it to tighten it up work perfect and then over here you have your I can get it out there we go a very small pair of scissors alright so I have two pieces of paper fold it up once and then twice so that's fairly thick you see how well it does there you go cutting through two pieces of paper folded twice it's good enough to do most lightweight jobs you can even cut your nails if you had to I'm sure it has a little d-ring on here so you can attach this Danny ball in your backpack and it comes in different colors and different designs I believe the other color that you can get is like a platinum like a platinum gold finish and there's also different logos by the way this is the new van quest backpack called Detroit in 20 as you can see the traditional backpack and I'll be doing a full review on this here pretty soon also so stay tuned for that and this is just a little survival kit that I put together and a lot of you guys like to have bug out bags with little survival kits this is my urban slash outdoor survival kit that I kind of put together has a mix of both things that I would need for urban survival and if I was just out in the outdoors and I'll do a whole video on this sometime in the future too but as you can see one of the things I have in there is the other lighter bro and obviously I got to put a lighter in there and it's got a different logo on it and these are just two of the logos that are available if you look on their website you'll see they have a couple other designs that you can get I think this is kind of cool because how many people out there do you know have a multi-tool that is a big lighter it's kind of a cool conversation piece you can get it at WWE lighter broadcom for about ten bucks check it out lighter bro", "BAcP2jeDpEc": "this is our large light-up guitar it's a butane soft flame lighter as you can see looks like a real guitar even got a

"what's up Turtles Creek here with blackout outdoors today's video are going to be checking in on an exposure test we're performing on a bit later about a month ago Stoney and I came out here wrote the date on a lighter and sat down the force to be exposed to the elements just to see how you know how well basically this cheap lighter or inexpensive excuse me not cheap lighter will hold up to with the elements during that time it's been snowed on multiple times that snow has since melted it's been raining it's been below freezing above freezing freezing and thawing so all these different you know processes are going on out here so I think it's going to be a really good test to how well this under $2 lighter is gonna hold up and that's pretty much why I choose to carry it in my kits you know in my bags just in general why I specifically choose a Bick is because they're really really quality lighters for the price so we're gonna go find the lighter pick it up see if it still works my money is one it's still going to work and we're gonna you know flick it flick our bake a little bit start a little fire just to show it and you know just leave it back out here and see how you know wears throughout this throughout the winter so I'm gonna go pick it up now got a little log cabin built down here assuming this lighter is going to work actually log cabin I wouldn't hire me if this is how I'm gonna build a log cabin I got a little bit of setup breakdown here I got the lighter in my hand here's the date for those of you watching in Europe in the states it's month/day/year it's the reverse a little bit different probably how you do it in your country but so this is November 11th 2014 and what's the date today so near 13th or 14th of December yeah so it's a little over a month and that's a si first flick if it lights there was some moisture on here holding it wipe that off but we'll see if it lights right away and it does look at that now it's not too cold out today either these still do work in the cold they're very temperamental if it's very cold oh yeah I do is holding your hand and your armpit and like I said we'll be checking back in on this as the months progressed throughout the winter but it's used us to get this little half built teepee or excuse me log cabin inside the boughs the main part is just shredded tulip poplar bark and some mixed in river birch bark and I got a little ball cabin got that off the ground promote airflow really wet conditions today very damp snow just melted for the past two days straight you know this lighter is just really for less than two dollars just a great little piece of equipment to keep in your bag and so far it's done really well so enough talking let's just light something on fire it's down yeah oh she fell on me not to do that again he formed it I'm gonna stay upright for me and there we go really wet wood and that's all there is to it you know obviously if I was trying to make a full-fledge fire I would have kept building this law cabin up had materials on top of it you know continuing to let the fire climb as you can see it worked it worked well enough to work fine just for a little experiment just to show you show you some different techniques of getting fire started and just using the big lighter so I'm really impressed with this I know these work this well but I'm trying to do Stoney and I are just trying to do a little bit more control experiment to how well these will hold up to the elements that's why we're doing this your sort of exposure experiment so we're gonna be keep checking in with in with this specifically I'm gonna put it back to the same exact spot where I had it and we'll check back in with it as the winter progresses but let me know you thought about this video hope you liked it hope was fun shed some light on this little cheap not cheap inexpensive bic later this critic signing out with black outdoors later Turtles", "L3oVD-4ln44": "this is what I'm making today a silver cover for my big lighter so it's a disposable so you can replace it the material I'm using is fine silver I mistakenly told you at one time that fine silver doesn't oxidize it does it but a lot slower than sterling but it doesn't have fire scale it's what I meant to say so there's no copper in this it's just pure silver and the copper is what gives you fire scale so the tarnish that's on here will come off I need to heat this up to anneal it to be able to put my marks in it and we do that just by heating it until it's a dull red the dimensions are 0.5 thick and the length to go around the lighter is sixty five point five millimeters and the height is 68 millimeters well you can see it doesn't come all the way up but I don't want it to come all the way up I'm quite happy with it being slightly down less work now I got the dimensions by going around by just using a piece of wire I wrapped a piece of wire around twisted it got the exact fit cut it open it up for length and that was that was how I got my dimensions because it's not a perfect oval the perfect oval you would be able to just add the length plus the width divided by two and multiplied by 3.14 and that would give you it doesn't work on this lighter I'm just going to hold my material on a bench envel and got a little bit of a theme happening here on this one what I want our footsteps going around the bottom and I've got left and right and be sure that you get if you if you're making a specific pattern the width will be slightly less than the height so just make sure you get that right and the bottom is going to be slightly folded in so make sure that you leave enough room to pulled it in bit like dinosaur footprints now this is going to tell a little bit of the stories I've got the footprints across the bottom and in all primitive cave art petroglyphs there are always hand marks and usually at just one hand but I have a left and a right so I'm going to and then we've had stars so it starts for the outside and then a little bit of star shine so I'm just going to use this part of my jeweler's hammer to start at the middle for a little burst so there's my pattern so far now we need to halt market while it's flat because once it's curved around it's almost impossible to hallmark so we'll do that now then because I've worked hard and it with all of the marks will I need it again and then wrap it around so that the edges fit together in solder in now if you hit the edge of this when you were putting your pattern in you need to file it flat at this point I only have one spot that's good one spot on this side and well I need it then now this is an eel that's nice and soft and I'm just going to hold the metal on the lighter and I'm going to push it around it now I usually put the seam at the end so we'll do that [Music] and you can see just by rolling it back and forth it's really close and I'll switch ins and we'll do it again we want to get this so that it's touching perfectly we could wrap a piece of binding wire around it but I find that the binding wire oftentimes leaves a mark I don't want a mark so we'll just work with this until the edges are touching each other you can use an old lighter if you want you can use a new lighter it doesn't really make any difference close and I'll do the rest with my fingers so you can see where we're pretty close already it's it's the right shape so we just want to play with this until we get the ends so that they touch perfectly you can do it a bit like a jump ring you can push it past itself and oftentimes I'll use a burnisher just to smooth the edge to make sure it's nice and flat flat against the other piece and we can open it just a little and it should click into place like that so check make sure that the edges are touching perfectly and if if you have it so that the majority of it is touching and ready to solder in one slightly open don't worry about it I will solder what we can solder and then we'll come back once that sold it and we'll push this together and solder it I'm pretty happy with that so I have the joint down and except your flux if you haven't make sure it's nice and creamy and just run a line down the inside and not putting any on the outside and the very end isn't together so I'm not putting flux on that so we don't have to worry about that bit getting solder in it so we can't push it together later so I'm going to take three large pieces of solder which is four millimeters long and I'm just going to lay it in the seam lies is touching both sides of the middle we're fine now what I'm going to do is just give my neutral flame and I'm going to just heat the scene running it back and forth the Flex will dry out go clear and then the solder will flow and as it flows I'll work my flame down so we run all the way down along the seam so that flowed I've gone to the next one so that one flowed looking good and now the one on the other end and that one flow so I'm quite happy with that now will quench it push the part together that isn't together and I can see a nice meniscus all the way down to there and then I'll push this together in will solder it's we don't have to do anything to the rest of this scene", "9rXv5zaXGF0": "my guys out by the lake today testing two lighters we have their classic clipper and we have the BIC disposable mini both great lighters both really popular it's not a few tests on these and see which makes the best survival bushcraft lighter so the red lighter is the BIC the white light is the Clipper both currently working fine we're going to drop them in the lake down here come back after 10 minutes and see how they're getting on so the lighters have been submerged now for at least 10 minutes let's fish one out see if we can get that to light then we'll take the other one out and see if we can get that one too light so we got the Clipper first let's just shake it off give it a test now see even get it just get the Flint striking at the Flint sparking now starting to get flame not quite yet hi guys back at the car out you had a problem with the Clipper I managed to get the BIC back working so it's still a bit damp but it does it does now light the Clipper I had a problem with now was just going to abandon this test and not want to put it on YouTube but I thought just for the purposes of being honest and it's just to just see the results of this test basically what happened in the Clipper clip prophecy has to remove all Flint there's there's no Flint left I mean that you can just see the spring the spring that pushes onto the Flint that's gone so I mean the good thing about Clippers is they are refillable and you can remove the Flint so they kind of last longer than the BIC which you can't replace the Flint and it's non refillable I mean otherwise the Clipper does work you can light it from that one so as a lighter they both still work is unfortunate that the Flint went so we managed to get both working I was going to do more tests on these so if you like this video just give it a thumbs up and comment on it and we'll get the clip working and we'll put these two lighters through their paces but yes it's unfortunate that the Flint went on that I mean personally I probably prefer Clippers to Bix just by the fact they are more replaceable when you can keep them longer but in this test in this test today the BIC still a bit damp but it is working and the Clippers not be can like one from the other but there you go so that's the test day let me know in the comments and which which lighter do you prefer do you prefer the clipper or the BIC I know for American viewers the clips aren't so readily available in America Clippers are quite popular in the UK both cost about the same price you know one pound fifty odd in the UK bless today's video if you like this video just let me know and I'll get the clip of working and we'll rerun the test but for purposes of honesty I thought I'd just upload this to YouTube anyway so that's it for this one hope you liked it and I'll see you in a future video", "2__6fP4OM9o": "YouTube Tim sparks here and I wanna make a quick video for you guys and chase him really cool and I think is really cool as this thing called lighter leash no I found this while ago and that store was really awesome it's great concept idea though I just found it it had nothing on the bottom just a little ball thing I don't know I guess it was missing something so I had a little mini bic lighter holder and I duct-taped the lighter so it stays inside the casing doesn't slide out and I put a key ring holder at the end and on the ball ends of the leash part inserted part of a lighter spring know if it's gonna focus on there it's a different camera size xie LG and tuition that does not want to seen the focus but i have a little spring just a piece of a spring ring i cut off and shoved in there and i glued it in there so i can hook up the key ring holder to it springs out exactly do one hand but it's a spring mechanism with the wire in it so you can clip it to something on your belt loop or wherever and you can pull it and then it retracts really the whole concept idea i i'm really really useful no idea would you get them I just like I said I found this one a while ago and this camera doesn't seem to want to focus him very much whatever hope you guys enjoyed and find yourself one of these things are really cool", "cMqnI0DXCmw": "hey guys just wanted to throw in real quick about the lighter video that you're about to watch so the thing is I want to make sure to be really clear about this I wasn't sure if I was clear in the video in the first place as I've never used a lighter to try striking fire before so I wanted to experiment a little with see if i could get grass going and that's it I took that photo i took the lighter home and I did keep it because I want to work with it more and I put a foot pic couple pictures on facebook a couple groups and takes really good comments you should try this you could try that and all true and great comments except it wasn't what I was aiming for I just want to know if I could get grass going I want to know if the lighter I mean it throws a pretty good spark but I don't know if it has limitations that's it so high she got I'm going to shoot another video here trying it again because I'm curious to see what can do so enjoy the video okay give it a try there's a little bit of wind but not much yeah it's not working oh well that sucks never tried that before but I'm going to take it to the ground and try it with a Ferro rod all right so I always carry a small I always carry a Pharisee 'um the rod and a parcel com scraper my pocket I just want to see if moisture there we go it's even wet it's still lit up with the ferrocene rod so the lighter wasn't working you can see the moisture seal the smoke coming off yeah don't think it went out so much for that some water out of my Jeep there we go safety first I'm gonna hang onto this sow and give it another try somewhere else maybe I can do get something going with it thanks for Wow stream close-up thanks for watching guys catch the next one greetings one at all I'm still working with the lighter so I thought I'd do that babe I he's a woodsman and sack out I wasn't gathered myself a little cat tail oh I guess I'm liking to want to know if the lighter has any further limitations no this is like unfortunately I ripped it off green Noma would never do that but for the sake of sampling and experimentation I want to invent my own rule a little bit I don't know I'm just gonna it's the fact that it's green it's going to have any effect so I can zoom in real quick mum take rest the cattail home for sure and throw in my threw it in my fire kit all right let's give it a try and guess that well that's bummer can tell the doesn't seem affected and give the the like in a try it feels super dry it could be good as green too but I don't know but balding up the tripod hmm well that's interesting it just doesn't seem like it's very good spark let's try it with the first piercing rod vegan ya know I went out it had just recently rain all right then let's bust out the hidden woodsman tinder bag pick this up not long ago so far really digging it I know I had brightened your hair so I got some fat would I've got some birch bark there at the bottom yeah i still have any original bags to keep the the sack at that new bag feels I don't want to get it all messed up with a cedar bark so I'm going to process that down which I've shown on video before and I'll bring you right back and we'll take a look at it we'll see it's a strike go get it going alrighty so it seems like mr. or wind was feeling left out decided to come along and and his contribution so this is cedar bark which I've shown in many videos huh oh there we go it took some doing but it finally went further there it is yeah caught me by surprise do I some water too so alright so we'll work with cedar bark good to know well there you go it worked with cedar bark so I'm definitely going to keep this bag of cat tail and lichen I'll let it go I'll take it home all that dry out and you're in another crack so it won't go to waste I'm keeping a light or two for further testing is you know why not like the Flint's going bad well go guys thanks for watching appreciate it I'll see you next video", "97Ne6b5-qWo": "on this episode of Scott vs. box I open up the BIC multi-purpose lighter so many purposes revenge revenge revenge revenge

here oh boy I have so much work to do with unboxing things and dating women", "Fx0a3yDd-cY": "hey what's up guys wanna do a video review of the black ops kilo triple flame lighter but you get this whole little setup which is pretty cool and I'll go over everything in the review so first thing we have is this nice carry case okay hard plastic you know right over a car or all kinds of crap it's good to go through pretty much everything you want to unless you're purposely trying to break it it's not going to break does have a lanyard on it I personally would take it out because I don't use something like this but if you want to even carry it on your wrist or attach to another bag or something if you want to hang on the outside we have these two clasps okay in the front very sturdy you know lock on these and when they snap down they really snap down pretty good alright you do have a spot on the side here to throw a padlock if you want so if you wanted to lock this case up to keep everything inside from grubby hands you can certainly do so but anyway once we pop this case open we'll find a couple things alright first thing is this little instruction booklets which tells you how to fit lighter and all that kind of stuff warranty information things like that so there you go there's were two contact information if you want to contact them directly alright so in this this pouch here first thing you notice is this yellow piece this yellow piece is a removable rubber seal okay this keeps the container this whole box of waterproof okay which is very very cool alright also keeps it airtight as well now you'll find two things here obviously we have this contraption we'll go over in a second but most importantly we have the lighter all right because this review is basically on the lighter but just happens to come with all this other stuff so first let's talk about the lighter let's move this little stuff out away for a moment so here's a lighter see black ops now this one is kind of a pewter grayish silver with black now there were a couple different versions of this it was a black version there was a very nice like sage green there's a desert brown and there's a silver now the color would be where you see the black here so all the models have the same front design and look but I was just briefly looking at it and the only other color color that's available at the moment or in stock from buy lighters calm which is of course where I got this one I'll put a link in the description box to this but currently looks like they only have the black and the brown alright so here's the lighter it's it's very comfortable in the hand the whole back here is rounded you can see the overall shape if I give you a top view of that but very comfortable in the hand okay how to use this lighter is basically push this down and as you're pushing this down this lid will lift up and then the flame will come in here all right I'll get that it's a second but it is a butane lighter there's your filling nozzle right there okay and you can also adjust this see the two notches just take your flat-head screwdriver you adjust it turn it towards the plus sign for a higher flame and towards the minus to lower the flame there's your body screw if you want to take it apart and look at the inside or to fix it yourself but I wouldn't ever recommend fixing your own lighters unless it's a real cheap lighter I wouldn't bother can I send it to the factory and they'll fix it or replace it but anyway it's pretty cool about this lighter is it has a built-in punch cutter alright basically this little nib on the end you lift that up and it Springs out just like that and there's your punch cutter what is a punch cutter if you do not know it is for cigars so you take your cigar and the rim of this is sharpened okay so you take your cigar and you push it on to the edge here and give a little twist as you're pushing and it will cut out a little section like that okay to prep your cigar for smoking makes the perfect little hole in the end it's a very standard sized punch cutter it's very cool - very effective if you're a cigar smoker it's a very good thing to have if you're not a cigar smoker it's not going to be as useful to you but of course you can punch a hole that shape and size into whatever you want but it's meant for cigars but it packs away nice and neat here the sharp edge is obviously not exposed at all it's towards the inner handle alright so you're not going to cut yourself or anything on it and it does stay in there very secure no matter how hard you get to shake that you're not going to open it up accident all right and it is a sturdy hinge so even if you're pushing very hard with your cigars you're not going to snap that easily all right so it's pretty cool little feature on the lighter it is a triple flame lighter now I'm gonna open this just enough to show you the inside but not light it you can hear that that's all the gas coming out but if I open it's just a crack you'll see our three separate jets then they all work in unison to create one big flame but there are three individual flames now as you open this old away it will lift the lid release the fuel and then click which gives you a spark which lights the fuel and gives you fire so all in one motion all right there you go very cool very strong triple play awesome alright having all that surface area is really good for lighting your cigars or toasting them because they do happen to have at least most of them are larger okay yes you have smaller cigars like cigarillos which you would light as if you were lighting a cigarette brittle RC cars are thicker gauges different ring sizes you have a lot of surface area so to take a regular flame lighter and to go around it takes a little bit longer it's not a big deal but having something like this with those triple Jets like that it makes it very easy to toast the end of your cigar and get it going of course if you don't smoke a cigar and you want the lighter for something else it just provides more fire in one area so it makes many things very effective whether you're lighting fireworks or whatever doesn't make a difference it's very effective now the the ignition button here is pretty cool there's three little raised areas for grip okay but when I use this later I don't tend to do it like that although you can it's very comfortable you can use any finger it doesn't take much pressure to slide it and open it but I tend to use this little shelf here you can see how it sticks out protrudes quite a bit that gives you a very positive grip on it so I surpassed this and I just go right for the tip of my thumb and grab that and it works beautifully so it's really really cool alright now that's just a lighter in addition to the lighter you get the case of course like I showed you we could also get this thing this thing is a cigar guillotine cutter alright we flip it over and you'll see the two blades so we have the housing here and then each side moves independently but you hold it like this and then you put your cigar in here and I'm going to move my finger and then you snip off the end okay now what's unique about this one is most guillotine cutters are a flow-through design so you can you know pick exactly where you want to cut off your cigar this has an actual plate on the back okay so this is either a pro or a con depending on what your your stylist of cutting a cigar but I think this is great particularly for beginner cigar smokers because they may not be used to using something like this and this will give you a very consistent cut every single time because when you put a cigar in here's another scar I'll use the demo they can only go in so far whereas if you're new to using one it has a free-floating or you know flows through design you can cutting off too much and end up making you know the other end look like that as opposed to just taking off a little bit so I'll show you how much this actually cuts on this fresh cigar okay these blades are razor-sharp and the only purpose for this tool is to cut the cigar but again the house cigars come is just like that you can't just light the end and smoke it you need to you know remove the outer layer of tobacco or paper to be able to let the smoke flow through so this is how this is going to look and how you'd use it put to push this against the plate all right squeeze till those you'll feel a little resistance once it hits the cigar and just continue squeezing and it will snip off a little piece off the end okay which is right there you can see they are razor sharp like razor blades alright so there's your little end you remove that and now you have an exposed end of your cigar so you can smoke all right as opposed to the punch cutter which I prefer punch cutter it just makes a cleaner awesome hole I just like the way they work but some people do prefer this style of cutter either way it's going to be very effective and you'll get your cigars ready to go alright so you have that you have your lighter and you have this case now this piece is pretty cool because it can serve basically three purposes one is to house all your stuff if you want to just travel with your little kit here and you know on the go wherever you want to be maybe bring your cigars or whatever you're using your lighter for but I wouldn't do this okay I would use this case for two purposes first of all I take the lighter out and this out alright I would just store these wherever I want them but what's cool is that you can remove this insert this hole insert pulls right out alright and notice there's two there's an extra piece of foam here and they have ridges in it as well as the top has ridges in it you can see there's two pieces of tape here double-sided tape so you'd undo the little covering and you can actually just stick this to the bottom and ensure that it will not move and this turns into a travel cigar-case all right this is a little humidifier okay so you would moisten this and this would keep your cigars moist so they wouldn't dry out again remember we have that air airtight seal on this and waterproof seal okay so now you can fit your cigars in here of course you are limited on size you cannot do very long cigars although you can do different gages doesn't matter if it's skinnier like this or a fatter gauge it will accommodate some pretty fat cigars but not very very long ones all right and you can load up with four cigars as you could say and you close it up and you're ready to go now you have a travel cigar case which i think is awesome but because although I do enjoy an occasional cigar it is very rare that I smoke cigars I won't use this for this purpose okay but instead I'll leave the foam in here and I'll just have a protective case for whatever I want I could put anything here I could put some Zippo stuff in here I could put maybe two or three knives in here if I want to travel with knives you know close the case I could throw a lock on if I want I don't feel it's necessary because if someone were to steal the stuff inside it is still old case it's not that big I think it's very cool you have some different options here all right if you wanted to you could pull the top out here this is kind of glued in but if you definitely did not want to ever use this for a cigar case you could pull this foam out you can pull out the humidifier and the bottom piece now you just basically have a hard plastic shell that's waterproof and airtight for whatever kind of goodies you want to store in there but I think this is really cool it's just it's an awesome set the whole thing I think the lighter is cool itself but this whole thing the case the lighter the cutter the whole deal is on sale right now for $33.99 and there is free shipping on most of the stuff on the site again this was from buy lighters calm the link will be directly to this but of coursing a chop round they carry Zippos and stuff people are constantly asking me good sources for Zippos online and there's plenty of really good sites but this is just another trustworthy site that I've personally used many times in the past so if you're interested check it out but for 34 bucks I think the lighters are awesome for $34 I think it's a very good high quality lighter but the addition of the case and the cutter and everything it's just pretty cool it's a great little setup so I want to do a review on it I love it I will continue to love it and like I said I'm not going to store my lighter in here I'll take the lighter out I'll take the cutter out I'm not gonna use the cutter very often because again I'm not a huge cigar smoker and if I were to cut them I would use the punch cutter but I'll use this case for something else for all kinds of goodies so that's all just want to do a review on this a lot of people showed some interest so I figured I'd do a video on so thanks for watching guys I appreciate it I certainly hope you know if you get this you'll give me your opinions on it post your comments down below if you haven't already have this let me know what you think of it as far as the lighter longevity you know will it have issues in the future if it does I will certainly give you an update like anything else five problems in the future I'll let you know about it but anything that I've ever reviewed before not just lighters even knives if everything has been the same and my opinions have not changed you won't see update videos on it but if things do go wrong or something breaks and I don't like it or you know maybe doesn't hold fuel very good or something like that I'll certainly let you know so that's all thanks for watching appreciate your time as always hope you guys enjoy the rest you day take care of", "e43WXtdPK0E": "I'm Zachary Fowler and this is Sunday morning Sunday morning live we are live up here in my office trying to get the right camera angle here so we're gonna do a let's see if we got that I don't got the right angle so I get myself and do some fire-starting of how to start a fire with a lighter excuse the camera shakiness guys I'm getting it all set up here hmm trying to get the right of everything here so you guys could get as close of a look as possible well we could talk yeah all right so we're gonna do a start a fire guess I'll just get down on it so you can see so we're gonna start a fire with a lighter that uh got a broken lighter here and we're gonna do a how to start a fire with a broken lighter I've got a couple different things to try out got the magnesium the sear strip from go prepared survival that I sell on my website we've got some read heads that I had from when I made the read boat and I have some read heads that I have soaked in gonna get to focus I have soaked in pine pitch that I so I kind of made them into like fire starter read head man who gets the broken lighter and we can even I got a razor blade here too when you see if we can scrape off some cotton and get the spark as well to see how truly well it can make a broken lighter start a fire there will be there will be no 87 days video today sorry but it's gonna be next week I did a great filming and adventure spending a night out over at the shelter at the tail end of the snowstorm and so it would the snowstorm and everything else it was just too much to get it edited if you haven't seen it yet I did post a video yeah yesterday man people really put up a stink about holy cow I couldn't believe how many people were complaining about the about the about the bringing the stuff on the plane like the most lethal thing I had that I brought on the plane was probably the big pen and they're like that's illegal and and but then like a couple of I considered a guy who says he's a security consultant for airlines over in Europe was like he's like that's there's nothing wrong with any of that I mean it's ridiculous that they didn't bought more of it and if they had seen it all at once they'd be like yeah you gotta take this and this and this and put you and your carry on but I mean in your go under the plane but duh it was crazy how many people were like you know take down this video you're gonna take down this video you you smuggled all that stuff onto a plane that's endangering people and it was just the survival stuff it's ridiculous so if you haven't seen it yet check out yesterday's video where I did it EDC mile-high pocket dump on the plane I think it turned out pretty darn awesome and we're gonna do in a couple seconds here I wait for a couple more people to come in we're gonna I got this broken bic lighter here and we're gonna start a fire with it on a couple different ways I have the read heads I already mentioned all that but I also have let's see what do I got in here this is a cool little satchel from 5co survival and they sent me this the cool little fire blow where I used in the video that's gonna come up next Sunday on the 87 days I did it cooking out at the shelter and overnight and it's a little fire blow a saint Clive you scoping I saw it on their website and they're like is there anything that you want to play with in your videos I'm like yeah I want that I made a fire blower out on a loan they're right here there's all the bags all my stuff that I made out there on on the alone show you got the read Matt I don't know where the fire blower ended up this is funny when I go to shows I made this out there and I I set this out on the table when I'm talking about my time in Patagonia and I set this out and people are like women pick it up and they go what is this I go with my banana hammock like la I go yeah you know so you can hang it up and you put your it's a fruit basket you know you hang your bananas and your apples and stuff under the counter get some every time it's funny there's the paddle from the hurry boat the old propeller from the mark to read boat you haven't seen the reed boat video yet yeah just skip on over there and check it out the I made the mark one here in Maine and did a video on two videos on it didn't the backwoodsmen magazine right now but anyway enough plugging my stuff here must be on another shelf I don't know what happened to the the blower it's a bamboo basically though it was like that big in diameter and I split it and I hollowed it out and I got the idea from season two we had watched one or two episodes before they sent us out on a loan of season two and Jose I say I think that says no Jose but I don't know on season two he had in like the second episode had or third episode you'd made a blower for blowing ice fire and I was like that's silly you can just blow on your fire with your mouth and when I was bored one night I was like I'm gonna make a fire blur I got nothing else to make and I hesitated to make it for like three weeks from the time I first got there cuz I didn't want to copy somebody else from a previous season and I was like whatever I got enough stuff that I made original so they sent me that fire bar the 5co only come up at the bottom they're linked in some of the other stuff like the stuff on the plane and they sent me this which I used in what will be next week's video since I'd finish it for today and these are it's a little case with a one wheel sparker so you can light fire so I lit a fire one handed up at the out there and they come with these little tender bundles that's from 5co and they've got little strings around them so you gotta like sent me this little razor blade knife to you cut the little strings or you can just break them if you work it hard enough and you puff up these little tinder bundles and uh they work awesome i fluff it up and I take a spark man these things burn hot so spark one of those up so that gave me the idea of this little wheel sparker this is like a military thing they put in their military survival kits hey that's just basically a lighter so I wonder I've never tried it I haven't tried it before I'm starting this video with you guys I wonder if we can spark up some stuff with a lighter let's try it out right now so we got we'll try it on the most easy tinder stuff to start with and yeah already we got the lighter and the first thing I want to do is I'm gonna remove the front of it and I'm going to remove the safety that should help it work a lot better all right so I remove the safety I just did that with my Swiss Army knife by getting in there and pull off the little safety pin and then I'll use the awl on it to take off the top of it here I'm gonna be careful doing that so you don't break your wheel off so this will work on any lighter that has died so you find yourself out there and you're carrying the lighter and your lighters die you find the right tinder that will take an easy spark now you have boom I take all that stuff off it's broken but she's still a perfect perfect spark wheel so I think this will go up pretty darn easily see why not bring it closer for you to see so we got the here we go use the lighter as a spark wheel boom Wow lights up really easily now that was the tinder bundle stuffs that's got like accelerant on it it's like basically like a cotton ball with Vaseline so that's not hard to spark up let's see what about say we had some magnesium shavings let's see if those will spark up with the lighter sparks they sparked up has sparked up the magnesium before very easily with a with a wazoo necklace but does not like to spark up with the lighter all right now we've tried that say you don't have actual tinder bundles and stuff you do have your broken lighter we got some reeds I'll put that right there let's see if that sparks up some Reed heads and boom those sparked up pretty easily too what else we got here we got the read head with I have infused with the pine pitch isn't it's not really good and I know it's gonna work cause they clean read had already worked boom well that's smokier I'm like whipped like a candle and the only thing we haven't tried a good thing I don't have a fire alarm in my do I have one in my office let's make it up quite a stink hmm expected to go out a little quicker like the last one here we go yeah what else we got we also have the sear strip and if you saw my last eighty seven days video I used a knife to process down the sear strip so that I could you know a little piece of cardboard or something to do it on he used the knife to process down the sear strip so that I could use it all on its own without using a cotton ball to spark it up see if I can do the same here with just the wheel of a broken later this little knife from five coasts just like a little razor blade I think that should allow me to it's not the best way to process it up okay I can really fluff it up a lot better by uh taking some more time with it but I'll see if it'll take a spark just from the broken later it doesn't seem to I didn't really process it up very well so doesn't surprise me if it doesn't take a spark I think it was the last was it the last eighty seven days video or the one before I did take my knife and then just keep scraping the sear strip and manage to process it up into a very easily Sparkle with this one of these spark wheels here the 5co has it in their little tinder box here and go prepared has it with the with these the sear strips like I sell on my website they have it with a sear strip comes with the military spark will it works great can light a fire one-handed I did it in the video that will be out next Sunday next Sunday's gonna be overnight in the shelter during the snowstorm and I did a caching cook some thrive plate they have partnered with me to support the YouTube channel so there's a link down below and they make they make foods that's freeze dry and everything comes in here for a full meal and there's another way you can get it you can get it in boxes of just the individual ingredients and create your own stuff but this stuff is awesome it tastes like a fresh like delicious brand new brand new meal that you like just got from the grocery store really good stuff and so we've partnered up together it's not a prepper food it's not a camping food but it works as both of those and we've been eating them that the ones they sent me for just regular day that's what's meant for us here everyday groceries you have that in your cupboard so you don't have to go the grocery store it takes one or two other staples like butter or oil if you want to add to it and to finish the meal and each box makes a four person meal it's they're really good so I did one up at the shelter to show that you can use it out camping I spent the night out there I had a great time but with the snowstorm and everything else it's just and the other video the other day I just haven't have been able to put that one together yet I kind of turned him into such a production they take a little bit longer now I think I'm actually gonna move for now until spring times over at least I'm probably only gonna do 87 days videos every other Sunday and I'll start putting something else out on Sundays because I got some really great ones that we've been putting together with the slingshot versus uh versus the sling that I'm gonna put out this week and so maybe the next one will come out the Sunday after so it'll be like 87 days and then slingshot versus video and so on and so forth so that I can get some of the other fun projects I want to do besides the just 87 days video so those are fun but I got some great adventures and other things I want to share with you guys you know like taking the read boat down the river during the river race I can show you clip from the video coming up if you want so oops into it I haven't really looked is you guys got any questions for me start dropping I mean now cuz I upload upload was yesterday today there is no video 87 days will return next week and then from here on out it's gonna be I'm I'm thinking it's gonna be every other week unless there's a special reason you know I might might put out two in a row on Sundays I got just so much other things I want to to do fun awesome videos that if I just keep doing them so and I now have a list of support links in the descriptions below so if you support this channel there's ways you can shop through the gear that you see me using in the videos that will support this channel and patreon with rewards tiers and thrive life that stuff is it's like you can order a meal plan and so it'll come continually to you food and I'm gonna start getting it myself and and get twice what I need what I'm going to eat for the week like two meals a week that I'll be eating from the Thrive life food the freeze-dried meals all ready to go just make them they taste really good super fresh and then I'm gonna put two away so I'll get four I'm gonna get like for a week or two a week and put one away so I'm like actually prepping you know so that so at some point I'll have my goal is have like three months worth of food prep so if something ever happens and then I'll continually rotate that once I get up to that amount and eat what I have stored away so and that freeze-dried food is like it's it's completely GMO free it's I know it's just so good it's like if it says strawberries on it that's all that's in it strawberries so yeah I'll give you a shout-out right for the boys eyes I don't know what you got their eyes read who's me to Yin eyes eyes you know I wish we could talk sometimes like like if I could click on your pictures and just like and hear what you guys say you know like let's you bring you on to the video to you know let you give yourself a shout out and I could say hey you know I'm so bad with the whole being able to read things especially if I'm in front of people it's like my dyslexia gets like 10 times worse teaching from your children to other kids is the biggest legacy when you die your kids can carry on it's funny you say that teach is somebody was from the last video than the comments like you're teaching people all this bad stuff bringing that stuff on the plane you're teaching like terrorists doesn't like what are you talking about the most lethal thing I brought on the plane you know um I brought the knife which was in my hat does a little ceramic knife that's like I don't even think it's an inch long you know it's a little fire tinder and I could scrape down some fat wood and then he spark with a sparker you know and and like throwing a fit about it all like and I had somebody that was like I'm TSA or something like that and I'm a security person and you're you're good to go don't listen to them bunch of idiots so which is cool because I've been bringing all that stuff on the planes all along if it ever go down I have a full survival kit I don't want to end up like Tom Hanks there you know with nothing but a volleyball and relying on FedEx packages to survive you know the tiny slingshot was meant to be a keychain right uh-huh no I didn't know he's meant to be a peach and I'm why would it be I'm gonna shoot it I'm gonna put some little little bands on it tiny micro bands and head and shoot bb's with it maybe I'll make another one for Chris and so when we're in here doing her he's doing that you know editing thing and I'm doing the thing here we'll get some airsoft pellets big across the room at each other and we're supposed to be working what about the littles you should prep for them too on great children are crabby children yes that's why I like the Thrive life I mean we made a meal and there they loved it they loved I think we made this one here yeah we made the simple plate meal and it was pasta and vegetables and chicken South Pacific stir-fry and it's freeze-dried food but the kids loved it and so we've partnered and the link is below so you can support this channel by getting in on it I don't even have a little custom video there that goes up on my support channel linked to them do you order I do order from gzk yes I love their bands and stuff like I'm like simple shot for the slingshot cheesy cave for the band's warrior for the pouches you know best of all three worlds I even have a nice gzk slingshot that I like to UM for like mice playing around my speed shooting right now it's my best one because my speed shooter do you hold like this and that way you can like quick-draw and then shoot stuff and it's uh yeah gzk good stuff I've got got to get to church now keep up the great work fella what time is it nine twenty-eight oh I still got time I was like you got to get to church I got to get to church too at some point here I've got to get church so yeah we got me don't worry about your dyslexia it doesn't define you right well I mean if I I figured to I'm like that much better at working with my hands and my mind the way I calculate out and think of things differently than other people like if I wasn't dyslexic maybe I just think of things like everybody else and then I I don't know they said there was this somebody sent me an article like it you know do this in a camera of glasses that fix your dyslexia I was like I don't want those know why dyslexia to go away it's like that's who I am and like what if I wasn't able to you know what if it took away my ability to work you know make things the way I do or think of creative solutions I was like that's not just seems scary to me broken lighter is a warmer slingshot target no doubt yes it is the for sure yeah and I had the I'm with that spark wheel was like yeah and I bet that works just the same as a spark wheel sure enough it does I think the spark wheels the military spark wheels that come from 5co and from go prepared that are in there tinder kits are actually probably have a couple more Flint's in them than just one I ought to tear one apart and find out how many sparks are actually in a spark wheel I wish I all the time in the world just make youtube videos both but you know whenever I have an idea I'm just gonna make it that's the kind of thing I'll make a facebook video if you haven't hit me up on Facebook at the top of my channel there are links to my Facebook and you can hit me up there and make a lot more little videos during the week testing out things that I'm like testing the reaction of people I'm preparing to turn those into videos as future goes like you know I did it but did one on cooking a t-bone steak on a rock and it's like the reaction was really high so I'm gonna revisit that in a YouTube video with a greater quality and a slingshot video about shooting with slingshot bands without a frame a for a slingshot and that got really high reaction so I'm going to turn that into a youtube video so I do like test video on on Facebook and then I'm gonna be doing like the full things on here on that's you know on YouTube so hit me up over there and you can see all the short one in two minute videos that I put up there or on Instagram does thrive have a keto meal it doesn't I quit doing keto for a little bit which is funny because I did a Jimmy Moore interview month or so ago and I'm gonna post the link here and I'm all like talking about how much I love the keto life and now I've been I'm on hiatus from the key to a thing for a little while so I'm gonna get back into it and I'm still gonna use the thrive life for a meal once a week kind of thing with the family because it's like it's a good way to store the food you know it's a it's great food the kids love it I mean I don't know what else more I could say you know and the links below in the description so I will be doing keto and then take a you know once a week I'll just have a cheat day and that doesn't throw you out of ketosis that far you feel a little bit of a little bit different the next day because you like you're like you're starting to come out of your diet but you're not fully out of it and you know and then it goes away you know kind of like a like you've had two beers before bed or something like that like I almost like a little teeny bit of a hangover from when you cheat on your keto diet that's right I'm gonna talk to them about that because they're all freeze-dried foods there's not really a lot of fat everything that's fat is what you add into it so it'd be really hard to do a keto diet it would have to be a completely different thing they couldn't just modify recipes a little bit do keto how I should do a thing I'm like once I get it all figured out keto prepping how many ways do you know how to start a fire all of them that's why there's three matches in my hat that's that's it you know fire wizard level one fire wizard level two fire wizard level three and that's the third one is when you can start a fire with your mind and if you believe that I don't know what I can tell you which church do you go to I go to Rockport the anchor Church and who's that oh hello the littles are here so I am going to say where's my little Jamie's dropping them off for church hey good morning hello there's one there's one there's you where's my other one I'm here you got shoes come here give me one and say hi everybody okay Oh bomb to hit alright see you later thanks for watching powder out", "zm91yMTJ_T4": "hello YouTube so here I got some bit gliders I'm going to be refilling it it's gonna look like that when we're done alright I like to use a screwdriver you don't really need that just smooth this out but what you're gonna what I do is they kind of smooth it out with something pointy but I don't go too deep and I do that so that this tip kind of fits in there without spilling out too much but you'll see what I'm talking about if you don't have one of these screwdrivers you could just use a thumbtack to push the hole right through now let's do it smooth it out a little bit not too much because if you go too deep the thumbtack won't hold the Gaza okay put it in the center all right now you hear that it's a little ball that's the little pellet on the inside that holds the gasm once they fill it up I'm doing this next to a fan it's the window because I might spray some gas out so got that I don't never use that to just here that that was whatever was left over coming out I like I said that's not the part you want to have the window band and the fan on for because you're pretty much pouring it in but there's no rubber over there to seal it in so you're filling it up and you're quickly putting the thumb tack on so all right got my finger on that's just a present okay now we got a filled up pic and you might want to wear gloves for this next time that stinks", "Q2Vj90t0I6A": "[Music] hey guys it's jayjay with reality survival calm and today what I'm gonna talk to you about is a few ways to use a regular thick lighter if it happens to be out of fluid and it's not working for you to start a fire in the normal way the way that its intended and I want to show you a few ways you can use it out in the wilderness in a survival situation so okay so if you've got your big lighter and it happens to be out of fuel and you know old are not working or whatever as this one is see here is it it won't light but it does still put out a spark alright you can use that to your advantage in small situation to still start a fire a pretty easy way to use this is to go ahead and strip the metal top off very carefully and take off the little safety wire so that it looks like this and as you can see it'll spark pretty well okay so the way you want to prepare this to get it ready to go is just take a little bit of your cotton ball and Vaseline and kind of form it into a little circle there and you want to place it up behind it where it's going to catch that spark and then start a student spark into it and there you go set that down with the rest of your fire and you're good to go pretty cool but you can also use a bit lighter for several other things so let me go ahead and pull this apart and I'll show you what else you can do with it okay so the usable parts in this like I said are gonna be that little fire steel and then there are a couple of Springs inside of here as well and then you also have the body of the lighter itself which as I showed you the other day in the fire starters video anything that's plastic could be used by making shavings to start a fire so when you're pulling this thing apart here that steel is under pressure so you really got to be careful with it because it will go flying so if you start by just rolling that roller wheel over to the side keeping your finger right on top where it's sitting and you'll catch that steel when it tries to come out of there you really got to watch it because it is under a lot of pressure on that little little spring okay so that fire steel it's not very big obviously and trying to use it like a regular fire steel or metal match with just your fingers is very difficult it is possible this spring here it's about a two inch spring and that could also be used in a number of different situations perhaps to create a snare or fish hook or something along those lines and then you have also have another spring up underneath here be careful when you're pulling these things apart and there's that spring so again that could be used for a small fish hook or something like that as well so there you go those are mostly usable parts the safety strap here might be able to be used to strike this deal okay so this two-inch steel steel spring we also said is usable and the way that we're going to do that is we're going to stretch it out so leaving a couple of coils on the end I'm just going to grab that pull it stretch it out and as you can see it's pretty long [Music] what you can do then is you can take it and try to run over [Music] stick or anything else like that hopefully try to straighten it out a little bit now it'll take a few minutes to get it into the shape of the snare we've got to kind of work with it and toy with it but essentially you'll be able to see later how that's formed out and we said you get a good you know 10 inch piece of wire there that you can actually use to make a little squirrel snare so it's pretty useful could also use it to make a fishing hook or something along those lines but that spring is what makes it useful for making snares and I'll show you how here in just a little a little bit okay the other thing you can do with these little Springs is you can fashion them into a little fish hook I've just taken this spring pulled it stretched it out and I have fashioned it into a very small little fishhook and then I took the Leatherman and on the end I just repeatedly like that sharpened up a little bit and as you can see it's pretty sharp it's grabbing my skin you know of as a fish's mouth comes over it it's definitely going to be strong enough for a small fish and it's gonna hook onto him pretty well you wouldn't want to jerk it too hard but it could be effective and you could make you know probably four or five hooks out of that so all right now let's see what the squirrel snare looks like I don't know tree you can take the spring that was underneath that fire steal that one there that still coiled up about two inches long or so and you can actually fashion that into a little squirrel snare it took me a couple of minutes to get this all straightened out and everything but what you want to do with these is you want to find a pole okay and what I've done is I've just taken this old pole here and I've leaned it up against this big tree all right now ideally what you're looking for here is a tree that's got a couple squirrels nests in it or something along those lines and squirrels just like humans are by nature lazy so instead of running all the way to the ground they'll use these little squirrel poles because it's at a nice 45-degree angle keeps them above the brush they tend to travel on quite a bit so let me show you how to fix this thing so that you can catch something to eat okay so once you've got your pole in place the next thing you're gonna do is you're going to straighten that wire out and spring out and you want to take it and make it so that it'll just naturally relax into a position that's about the size of your finger and then when you stretch it out you want to stretch it out and kind of provide a little bump there so that it's under tension okay so now you can see that I got about two sides to finger size and when this world goes through there if he just twitches it it's going to tighten up on him just like that and I've caught a bunch of squirrels like this it seems kind of crazy and simple but it actually works so you get it under tension then just a little hair bump will tighten it up around its neck alright so then [Music] I think this world's gonna find you if you need to okay so that is now positioned on that log so that when a squirrel comes down there you're going to you there's some ants on it as well they're gonna very likely run right through the middle of that log so they're gonna run down from from a tree come down this pole and they're gonna go through right the center of that little snare and just like I was showing you earlier it's under tension so when they struggle through it it'll tighten up around their neck and they will flop around and hang there and choke themselves and then you've got dinner and you can actually do you know several of these along a pole if you have enough wire you would you would ideally you know want to try to run you know four or five six of them if you had the wire and the resources you get that out of the vehicle you know or a junk pile or just anywhere you can come by it and set several these poles around you know and then check them every 12 hours or so depending on the temperature you might want to check them more often if it's hot but especially in the wintertime in areas where the squirrels don't like to get in some deep snow this is gonna work out really well for you and and it's it's a good way to catch dinner it's pretty simple [Music] [Music]", "jbuOY6CQ5Kw": "hello YouTube I'm David with the David West Channel well today I want to show you how to recover an empty wet Bick you see a lot of videos online of how to recover an empty Bick how to recover a wet bag but you don't really see the two put together so I thought that I was gonna have to drain the gas out of this small one but lo and behold is there prone to do when I tried it out this morning it was empty let's go ahead and drill a hole in the side of it just for those skeptics out there to think there may still be gas in it and my bottle my beer bottle I've been making all the solar ignitions with will go ahead and douse this down really good and let me show you how easy it is to recover a wet empty bit can make a produce fire again that branch on the stump there is to a poplar this to a poplar bark is what we're going to process and ignite with the recovered Vic and you can see right through the lighter now no gas I've been needing to drain the water out of my solar igniter anyways because this will eventually turn green so let's see if we can get yeah let's see if we can get the lighter wet enough I think five cups of water ought to be enough to to get it wet now I'd like to take that guard off of there there's no big mystery to taking this guard off if I take that guard off then I can get my tender a lot closer to the source of the spark that mini Ferro rod in there when you stop getting wet places on the wood is one I'll take my shirt and start drying off that Stryker wheel and this might take a minute or two but who cares as long as you you're able to get fire out of a wet empty BEC this is the first time I've ever used one of these many's I'm expecting it's going to perform like the regular ones I'm gonna be careful now when you take that guard off sometimes you release this the peg that holds that wheel in it so you want to be careful you don't let that go flying so here's where we're at so far and I'm only guesstimating what you're seeing because it's all glare back here where I'm looking now I'll be done in just a few more times there's those pegs I was talking about on the Stryker wheel I sure what you can see there and there and sometimes when you pry this guard off of here it releases one side I've never caused one of these spring-loaded rotary strikers to go sailing yet but it is possibility I have accidentally detached the peg out of one side before still just a little bit of moisture coming out which is good I'm gonna have people comment and say oh you ain't got to go through all that all you got to do is blow on it a little bit and that'll recover it you sir are wrong not if you not if you've wet it down to the extent that I've wet this down if you've got a quicker and easier way to do it I'm happy for you this is the way that I know that works all right now we're just gonna take my shirt and dry that striker wheel off all right it's starting to spark let me see if I can show you I can't see you tonight now let's go ahead and process up the stool popular barley after we process this tulip poplar bark up let's get in the shade so we can sort of see what's going on look at all the bark that came off that little tiny branch you know I'll just pull some of the spine the tail out of here and that's what we're used to light with the BIC you seem to do this before now there's the other technique where you're taking your grind slowly and grind grind and grind build up enough shavings dump them out in front of the tender and then ignite those shavings I like this I think it's more fun and I actually think it's quicker so I'm gonna stick it down in there and hold it with this finger stick it down on there hold it with this finger and run it on the table I went back out you get some finer stuff in there that's all not that hard to recover a wet empty bic I hope you give it a try thanks for joining me on this one wheel catch you on the next one", "KAZ0-Muia6Y": "hey guys summer is finally here for me I'm sorry I've been gone about the last month but the last month of school was a super intense time for me work wise so I just had to take some time off well I'm here today to talk to you about a problem that I have and no not based on the title it's not smoking that I have a problem with the problem I have is with crummy lighters it's a guy who's been collecting gear for over a decade I have constantly run into the problem of cheap garbage lighters in fact I just went around and and tried to find all these examples of junky letters that that I have lying around and I just have tons of all broken lighters mostly butane lighters which are more difficult to keep running admittedly but I think that I've finally found some letters that I think will be permanent usable keepers in my collection and I'm going to show three that I really like today this is the accomplice trench lighter this is the Douglass filled out lighter and this is classic Zippo in brass and what you're gonna find in this video is that there's a clear winner even amongst these three as I show them all to you I get all three of these letters from urban everyday carry supply and when I first got them I've had them for about three months I had to admit that I thought okay so this is mostly just a matter of taste they're all quality lighters you know the these the Zippo lighters for the guy who just wants a classic hot rod the accomplished lighters for the guy who kind of wants something more whimsical and then the Douglass lighters they'll get one for the guy who likes quality but actually in real-world testing I have a clear winner and in this video I'm gonna be talking about that I'm gonna show you how all three of these letters work obviously they're you know simple but I'm going to talk about some of their quirks and some of the things that set them apart and and I think you'll also see why I clearly have a favorite when we get to the end of this so so please stay tuned and if you're interested in any three of these letters the links listed down below thanks a lot for watching and I hope you enjoyed this comparison let's start with my third choice in this group this is the accomplice trench lighter and the idea of this letter is that it's sort of a whimsical steampunk design that is actually a recreation of a letter that was used in World War one hence the trench letter name and the idea is is that there's this brass core which is really sturdy it's a nice heavy letter but around it is this stainless steel sheath that slides up and down on these little miniature rails that create a little windshield for it and also that's how you put it out yeah it's a very fun design if you're into kind of offbeat style in your EDC it would be a great choice for that you can't operate it one-handed as I'll show you here the truth is though is that most of the time when I gave this letter to people they had no idea how to use it and so I ended up just having to explain over and over again what it was how it worked that kind of thing not exactly the kind of conversation you want to have when you're trying to get cigars lit and so I found that I was not using this very much it also doesn't hold fluid any longer than a Zippo which is a big negative for me well the accomplice later has some interesting history being a throwback to a world war 1 letter no one can doubt the 80 years of provenance with the classic Zippo lighter of course these letters made famous in World War two but really are the standard mass-produced letter being made by Zippo since 1932 they are legendary you can get Zippos everywhere at gas stations and they're highly collectible which is why this almost took the first place spot because for most guys who are in the lighters you're going to be collecting Zippos at some point and this fire fighter is an interesting exclusive with urban EDC supply it's a beautiful brass lighter and it is high polished great engraving little curious that firefighter is spraying towards the truck but you know maybe he's afraid of his fire truck I don't know but the the uniqueness of this lighter with this specific engraving and then also obviously the fact that Zippo lighters are so legendary and you're able to do so much with Zippo say you don't like Zippo fluidy and don't like the traditional construction you can switch it over to a butane of course the experience of you know flipping a Zippo and keeping it up and running is just you know something that happens for generations well at any rate I did end up using this later a lot but but for the $55 price tag which is what it is from urban everyday carry supply it just didn't stand out to me enough which brings me to the Douglas field el l\u00edder which wow what a lighter I wish I had not been in denial about the greatness of this letter for so long the Douglas field L by comparison is a new design that is coming from Japan and what it is also bringing from Japan is that exceedingly high level of build quality and finishing that we've come to expect from quality Japanese EDC goods this easily is as nice as some of the high-end Japanese knives that you sometimes see coming through and it's got an incredible machining and detail throughout in fact they claim that it is constructed to triple lot tolerances it's a very carry bull weight and in with the L design there's a flip lock mechanism that is how you operate this lighter my experience with this handing it to every guy that I was having a cigar or a pipe with in the last three months is this was the showstopper in brass in particular it's got a great weight it's got a beautiful knurling beautiful construction it's a pleasure to use and as long as you keep it fueled up it keeps his fuel it doesn't run out which is so frustrating with zip what's in particular and this is really one of the reasons why it's in front of the Zippo for me you'll notice it's got great engravings it even has a serial number on the side I don't know if he caught that and then just the actual striker mechanism on it is just such a pleasure so tactile and the top flips up and that's also how you put it out by far it's favorite design and a lighter ever and it's built like a tank I can't recommend it enough okay there you have it the Douglas filled out lighter is the best not only just for retaining fluid which is so important with these old Zippo fluid lighters but also just for the the incredible craftsmanship the reliability of the design and just the touches that make it feel special so please let me know in the comments below what your letter of choice is if you're new to the

talked about things we like things we don't like there's one lighter here that I don't like at all and neither does she we we all use all these lighters or we use them for well mostly cigars my wife candles she's very much into candles and stuff but we both use them for miscellaneous projects burning paracord who knows what whatever you'd need a flame for so her lighters are over here she has these three these are my two most recently carried and most carried in general and these two we both kind of both use all right this is excluding table lighters I'm just talking about populate errs here so um yeah let's get into it first off we'll talk about my layers this is the one I most recently used in the cigar video this is a vector this one is pretty interesting it has a kind of a trap door that opens up to like this you're pushing down on this so as I push down you can see those open up they start to hinge open okay and then obviously all the way down we have a triple flame and what's interesting too is I did a video on the flat flame lighter now it's a single flat flame extremely unique very different this still has a flat plane but it's from three different burners so as you could probably see I put it against the black box you know it's still making kind of a a long flat plane by using again three different you know individual burners okay so three cylindrical flames together obviously in a row mix a flat flame works almost every time as you can see there a misfire I guess you could say basically when you're opening this up be a little spark and sometimes a spark will jumped and hit the frame or something that's why it doesn't light this is very common with a lot of different layers out there but I think it's a great value this one came from buy lighters actually this vector that xikar this hurricane lighter and as well as this other vector or enhance another vector all from by lighters so as far as these I'm gonna give you that that price that's where I got them from but this vector 65 bucks 65 bucks is not cheap it is definitely a better quality lighter it has you know extreme heft it's very heavy solid metal it's cool design its unique it does have kind of gimmicky cutters in here it's two different punch cutter is a small one and a large one all right although these are functional you know they do work you just I always suggest you have to keep some pressure so say here's your cigar hold it back here the user cigar make your cut you'll be fine but if you just let it sit like this and try cutting it you know it's just wobbly it's all it's got a tiny bit of play in it I've never really used a cutter from a lighter as a dedicated cutter you know I mean because they all eventually just get loose because there's just a little little pin in there holding it in so it's not you know super secure anything but again if you support the back of it and use appropriate pressure you should never really have a problem so it's good to have as a backup but maybe not a dedicated cutter but yes so you have a small punch cut and a large punch cut which is kind of cool obviously someone who might invest in a more expensive lawyer would be you know cigar guy anyway or cigar woman because there are a lot of females out there that smoke but uh yeah so pretty interesting I like it a lot 65 bucks I do think it's uh it's worth the money if you want to invest in a good lighter and of course having that nice wide flame it's very easy to light up your cigars so next up for me is of course my 1935 replica Zippo this has the outside hinge a little bit shorter of a top here much squared off design from the original I'm just a classic lighter you really can't go wrong it I love all zip boats all zippers all sizes all colors all you know designs it's a great way to express yourself because they're literally just thousands and thousands of different Zippo designs so whatever you're into whatever you like you can find a Zippo that appropriately pitch you you know if you like a certain band like a lot I'm sure they have that logo on a Zippo yeah I mean if you um I don't know if you're gothic you can get is about skulls on it you know if you're I don't know like a hippie dippie guy you can get you know a tie-dye suppo or you know the spectrum you know Zippo or whatever there's just a Zippo for everyone put it that way wherever you are wherever you represent as a person your hobbies your interests all that stuff there's a simple for you they're affordable to you know like Zippos range anywhere from 10 bucks to a super plain-jane one all the way up to let's just say fifty fifty dollars and I'm talking in the United States to I know there are people outside the US that like Zippos and they tell me oh man you know you go there for 25 bucks we got to pay $85 u.s. or whatever the equivalent would be you know they are so that's you know it's unfortunate obviously however I will say this you guys have all the great chocolate you know American chocolate stinks so it doesn't matter where you are if you're outside of America your chocolates probably better so can't win them all right so yeah you have expenses as if owes but cheap delicious chocolate and I know the food but anyway yeah so like as far as pricing I'm really talking about the u.s. because that's really my only experience but uh yeah hippos I mean there's just so many different designs and they're affordable let's just say on average 25 bucks you know if you find a Ram Zippo it's probably around 25 bucks so as if those are so awesome why isn't everyone carry one well I think there's two major reasons number one has to be it loses fuel you can fill it up today two weeks from now it's empty even if you didn't use it why it's just because there's not an airtight seal here so the fluid is just sitting in there and it's slowly evaporating you know through the cracks in between you know the the case and the lid here so yeah a lot of people don't like that including myself I don't like the fact that I'd fill it with today and use it a little bit kind of forget about it you know I got to fill it again so that kind of stinks but number two which a lot of people don't think about because not a lot of people are bothered by it but some people are the smell I happen to love the way a zipless smells I love lighter fluid you know it's one of those weird smells people like people why people like some really weird smells I mean some people get off on smelling gasoline nothing too high or anything but just they like the smell stalks some people like the small skunks and a lot of other you know unmentionable smells we're not gonna have a discussion about smells right now but there's a lot of your people that like some weird smells but some people are very turned off by the smell of Isobel specifically visible fluid okay so uh yeah Zippos they're on the road awesome that collect so many of them but based outside yet to constantly fill them and that cost you money you keep buying later for all time oh yeah I mean staying on a theme of Zippo zzzz are to suppose of my my wife own this one is an antique brass one okay and as you can see it doesn't have a standard insert is there a full-size of bo because she also has a pistol in here and this one has just the Z plus insert which needs some fuel but that is her for butane flame so when she wants a little torch flame but in a cool old Zippo style that's what she grabs and consistent this is the one she'll keep in her purse because you know it'll always work right or at least probably will work those E Plus inserts are kinda you know half and half I mean I want to try the I don't think I've ever had the vector vector makes a very similar insert and the vector seems to be a good quality company overall at least with the layers I pad I mean both of these are vectors and I like but anyway maybe in the future we'll do side-by-side or something if I ever get one but besides that this is the first lighter that I gave her when we were dating I gave this to her actually doesn't have the original insert the original insert was also brass but this is just a Zippo slim okay and you could say it's slimmer this is originally you know designed for women with smaller hands right little petite lighter so she loves these but when she wants to go traditional so grab that one and obviously that one for convenience as far as her although later the lighter that she loves the most right here is a is a car later they pronounce that comes a nice box nice paperwork and stuff and this is I car I think sells for 30 bucks or so and they have a bunch of different colors she likes to clear one but she likes everything about this later first off you can see how much fluid left no mistaking that with the clear body it has a cap so the burners aren't going to get dirty or get lint or dust or anything in them it's very easy to use and that was a big thing to her is how easy it is to push the button okay so it really takes very little pressure to use this lighter and you can see it has a nice beautiful big old flame and what's cool about this one too is that the entire base rotates to adjust your flame you don't have to get in there with a little screwdriver alright so keep this going and literally just turn it up all the way down to conserve fuel for summer in the milk alright so easy to use a light button and as you can see it works I think this one is ever misfired ever so for 30 bucks that's a very very cool lighter so if you're in the market for a single you know torch lighter butane I definitely recommend this one alright time to talk about the hurricane that's what this one's called the hurricane it's 12 bucks um my wife and I wanted to try this one out because it had a quad flame okay four different burners for different ways such as you could see creates one giant flame okay which is super cool here's the thing though we both hate this later um first of all it's very inconsistent I had a lot of problems with it when I first got it I filled it up and it was kind of clogged up and I use the same fuels everyone else I always used the Zippo blue simple blue excuse me butane but I don't have it I do resort to the Ronson but you know generally I do like using a Zippo blue but anyway yeah I had some problems with this lighter it wasn't working it took me a long time to purge it properly purging just you know pushing down on the valve on the bottom to let all the gas out if you don't know when you fill a butane lighter you're supposed to get all the gas out first so you don't pray any air bubbles on the line and so it doesn't get all clogged up so I purged it properly and it wasn't working for a while I finally got it back working but I still have some issues with it my wife's biggest issue is this button is extremely hard to push down it actually hurts their thumb okay and you can't see from the video and if I had a trigger pull measurement I could tell you how much weight this is if I had to guess if you know for the gun guys out there this is a trigger pull and say it's probably a seven or eight pound trigger pull which is ridiculous for later this would be your you know trigger job on your revolver or something it's just like a one petal trigger pull okay it's nothing this one is extremely hard to push down okay and then we're to the cap also equally difficult to shut now you can push the button out a little bit to shut it which makes it easier because you can see this metal piece is what it's grabbing on to so they puts that down first it helps a little but then you're losing gas if you listen I have to lose gas every time I go to shut it so obviously I don't want to do that so it's very hard to push okay already had some problems with it for me this is my big issue my wife's was obviously the button but for me this metal piece that keeps the cap closed you can see it comes down and it sits right there just see it see the metal guess what it works like a heat sink it gets extremely hot so let me show you from right now it's called barely been used in the liner right lighting it let's just suppose I'm laying a cigar which I was doing recently it's getting hot to tip my thumb very hot okay I have to literally let go because it's burning my thumb so this piece here like I said acts like a heat sink and on the inside is starting to warm up and now we just have this this metal you know piece probably a little piece of stainless or something that's that's getting red-hot in there and it literally burns my thumb I can't I can't hold this long enough to to light a cigar fully like a normal sized cigar so like you're like cigarette boom it is literally or whatever but if you're using this for cigar I would imagine if you're buying a quad flame you know butane lighter you're probably lighting a cigar it just burns your finger I just can't keep it on long enough I have to literally and especially once it gets that hot you have to wait for it to cool down so I just don't like it and by the way I mean this came with it said something on here like a sticker things fell off like the first day it literally just a like vinyl sticker or something like that fell off the sticker on the backside had so much glue on it that was a huge pain to get off I will say one thing though there'll be something positive right got to be optimistic I love that to adjust this flame there's a little lever here so you gives you a little knob to put your fingernail pop that up as you can see this rotates back and forth so that's how you adjust your flame which is pretty cool I do like that turn it down but that's too low I go okay so yeah off getting hot getting high now come on can't shut the lid so yeah I mean that's that's the positive is that little thing I think that if you don't have something like this we can rotate the whole knob you should definitely have something like that so that's cool I do like that and again it's 12 bucks you know it works it's just not all the time it gets too hot when it's lit for lighting a cigar anyway maybe you have a different purpose for this later but yeah I don't know it's just just cheap really cheap I mean it really fails compared to these other butane lighters so anyway I mean you know it is what it is so I mean it is 12 bucks and it's got to be one of the cheapest if not the cheapest quadruple burner lighters or quad flames okay having four burners and interferring that one huge giant claim most lighters that are set up like that the quad layers are expensive so there's that there's always that but yeah I mean between the problems I had and just being so difficult to use and literally causing you you know discomfort you know I mean I don't want to have a bird finger or it doesn't have a sore finger trying to you know click it open it's just one of those things so that leaves us with this guy this is the vector kgm okay so is for 20 bucks on violators calm and this one comes with a bunch of different colors I have to like the all you know kind of satin stainless look here but a pretty unique lighter if I both share this it unfortunately it's been a little inconsistent with the lighting on the lower flame setting you have to kind of set this high for to to light up each time what I noticed that when I set it a little bit lower to conserve some of the fuel it just wasn't lighting you know I just quickly click and the gases coming out fine but it wasn't that spark wasn't doing it so just something I've noticed but it's just an awesome design huge viewing window right in the front here so you can see how much fuel you have left the buttons on the top here when you push in slowly that pops out you're all the way down exhale it's a little inconsistent there but we have our nice jet flame and when you let go we have our soft flame so you have your butane flame right you're strong torch flame or you let go and again we have our soft wings like one of my cigarette or something or maybe you want to light a pipe because of the design here you can certainly use this as a pipe lighter which is awesome and then you can see there's a rubber pad on the end to grip that firmly to close this because obviously it's where the flame in scene I want to fool around or slip and you know burn yourself so pretty cool design I mean I really like this one you can hold this pretty much any way if you want to again light a pipe or something I kind of I kind of use this like this with my thumb maybe you can use it like this and if you wanted to I guess depends on your lighting but it's just awesome to have the dual flame you know option if you want a soft flame or if you want the butane torch flame but as you can see there again this is on a higher or setting because I played the saw flames too big I really want it down lower I want it like this but when I do that it just it's not consistent and it probably clicks you know 15 20 times before you hit the light and that's no bueno for me so yeah but that's again the vector kgm so my wife and I both kind of go back and forth you know claiming that neither it's not really either of ours we just both share but we do really share everything so she just has certain things that are hers certain things are mine but we all kind of mix and match and use it all but anyway I just wanted to do a video talking about you know some of these lighters I know I've had questions about this one already just from posting the video I think was yesterday on the order of posting these but yeah and just want to talk about Zippos in general twos if those are just awesome collectibles great lighters approvement is obviously it's been through every war you know since its creation in 1932 it's in like a thousand movies it's just an iconic piece of Americana the Zippo lighter you know and it just works it works it's definitely not wind proof I know they've been claiming that since back in the day but the flame definitely blows out with a good gust of wind but it's wind resistant good enough for me right yeah that's pretty much it so I want you guys to comment down below tell me if you Eve you see you later what lighter you EDC if it's a Zippo tell me what the design is just because and as long as it both you know let me know what brand and model if you happen to know you could just say butane later if you don't know and I will comment right now on Bix because a lot of people are going to say hey what's wrong with a $1 big lighter absolutely nothing there's nothing wrong with the big lighter they work they're very consistent they actually last a long time before they run out of fuel so you can't really say like oh well you know Rhino fuel II can't refill them they're usually a dollar sure I mean and again tons of designs these days and with our culture stuff there's all kinds of crazy designs on dick lighters so you can express yourself with them too but it's just kind of blah everyone has a bit lighter you know not everyone carries a Zippo and certainly most people don't have these butane lighters and they do it's not the same one you have so I always think it's cool being a little bit unique but I do want to say there is nothing wrong with a classic big layer they work and work well so anyway that's it looking forward to the comments again want to know what everyone else is carrying out there and what you use it for as well as tell me different different ways you use your layer besides obviously lighting cigarettes and cigars and whatever else you guys relating where you're smoking I should say but you know candles burning strings off of shirts you know who knows what just warming something up I'd love to hear your ideas for using lighters because maybe you'll give me a suggestion for another reason to use my lighter which maybe I'm using something else instead anyway that's all thanks for watching guys hope you have a wonderful day and I will see you soon take care", "uMxski2xdAI": "whoo that's getting hot all right so we are out here for the bic lighter exposure test this is the fourth installment today is a March 16th 2015 and uh what's temperature today Sony probably like it's right in the 40s right now a lot of snow melted and you saw me just gather some what's this hemlock yeah small little ends of hemlocks and get rid of that I was going to use a poplar bark but everything's so saturated it's been raining and melting for the past week so this went for the twig bundle but it's a really short video checking in on the later which I will be dropping put back down on the ground and literally was in my hands for five seconds and it lit right away you know there was no movie magic in that when I picked it up and went right to the bundle it was you know first time picked it up on the ground so again really no problem problem to later let me get it out real quick I think I put my pocket showing you a close-up just to do an expection for you to see I'll take my word for it see ya you know what the wears on it looking at the sort of casing up top here that keeps the you know fair singing rod and striker and all that encased really nowhere on the outside at least maybe a little bit right there and there's little vent might be a little bit of rust starting to form but besides that I don't see any visible where at least externally on the lighter and pop it back on the ground that's all I really wanted to do today come in and check on the lighter I'm really not surprised that it works so quick I'm really not surprised or most of you that are watching this sort of feel the same way I do this later is gonna last a while so we'll check back in in a month or so see how it's doing by that time you should be much warmer have the angiosperms coming up spring will be in full effect so just be really exciting next month we'll see see how the lighters doing if you like the video popper old thumbs up underneath it and we actually started the tip jar YouTube tips you can go to our homepage on YouTube find and support button and if you do that you might see Stoney in front of the camera you might anyways this is Crick signing out black out outdoors later Turtles you", "tgk4gBEThjw": "coffee tea or a flicker my big primus know to go to

pours water in there slowly we have it on a timer so it's not actually running right now but uh i think after about seven pm it comes on runs all night and they say it cats drink out of it freak more frequently drink more water and i believe that's true because every morning we come out and it's about half down it has to be refilled every day whereas the other bulls just sit there full of water so it seems to work good it's pretty cheap amazon anyway yes what fun got my uh my navy lighter butane lighter going close it up open it again flick it let's see hard to do that and we're at the same time okay oh i think it's out of butane i ran the darn thing out of butane how about that folks well i'll just have to refill we saw it at the beginning of the video all right enough of that", "mWW0DSM3ugs": "welcome to dependable flame where we explore vintage petrol lighters ash trays tobacchiana and other useful mechanisms make yourself at home today we have the 1976 zippo slim with the green painted cannabis leaf we took an initial look at this lighter once already and we'll pull out the insert here in a moment and get a little bit closer look i have been told in the past by at least one viewer that the gloves are disconcerting and i don't generally like wearing the gloves either i just don't want to get fingerprints on this lighter so for this video that's why i'm wearing the gloves i had cotton gloves on a while ago to try to wipe the fingerprints off of it and the the sweat or steam or condensation from my hand through those gloves was evident on the lighter so that's one reason why i didn't want to use the cotton gloves in the video if you like watching videos about old petrol lighters ash trays tobacciana and other useful mechanisms please subscribe to the channel please like the video that you are watching tell your friends about the channel hit that share button send the link off in a text email post it on social media however it is that you communicate with folks nowadays and let them get a look at it for themselves leave any comments or questions below the video i got this zoomed in close so you can see that there are a couple of very small scratches right there part of that is just residue from the paper towel or whatever it was the tissue that it was sitting on but you can see right there in the middle there is a scratch so i'm going to go ahead and zoom out here and we'll pull that insert and see what it looks like and it's such a mirrored finish in that lighter i'll have to beg your pardon if you catch a side of me in it so the hinge is good and tight the insert appears new doesn't have any soot it does appear as though the flint tube has been uh probably cleared most likely would be my guess since you can see where it looks like flint has degraded here at one point so let's go ahead and pull that insert out and take a look very minimal scratching and grooving from going in and out of the lighter appears to be in very good condition and with that flint spring not being quite tight that also leads me to believe that our flint tube is clear so there's a flint i don't know how long that flint has been in there um but as i said my guess would be that someone cleared that flint tube maybe the person that sold it to me even cleared it right before they sold it to me but it has definitely been there's definitely been appears to have been flint degraded there against that wheel at some point and it is certainly clear now so there's no need for me to strike that flint so i'm just going to go ahead and put this back in this lighter as i would urge you to if you do not intend if you just plan to store a lighter without using it don't keep the flint in it i sell lighters with flint in them but i'm not going to have them long enough to for them to sit idle and degrade and you know the few that i have had for i don't know ted ballard told me that five years was when flints would start degrading i see people online argue that there's no reason to worry about it at all and that's certainly not the case um so i would not store them if i plan to collect the lighter and just use it or just have it as a display something i was going to look at to where i wasn't going to strike it then i would not keep a flint in it i sell lighters that i intend people to use and if i do sell this one that's why it will be sold i would just urge you to pull the flint out before you store it so that answers a lot of questions as far as that is concerned the insert appears to be the original and is in good working condition i also see a lot of talk in the facebook lighter groups the zippo groups about stickers and the safety sticker on the back and the general wisdom says remove them and i would agree with that uh but this particular lighter i don't know i think if it did do any kind of damage to the finish i think i could polish it out i don't think it would do much to this other than maybe a little bit of adhesive left behind i don't think it would discolor it like it would a brass lighter or something but anyway around it i'm going to leave the sticker on there just because i think it's cool and i like the way it looks and i haven't decided what i'm going to do with the lighter yet anyway so i'm going to leave the price sticker on it and no need with there was no safety sticker on the back so not a concern with this ladder we would appreciate it if you would follow and like us across all the social media platforms facebook twitter pinterest and of course ebay until next time you",

going to show you this wrongs led digital lighter with high capacity which is high capacity electric lighter or in other words this is a candle lighter which works on electricity so you don't need to review it what you need to do is you just need to recharge it using this uh micro usb port over there that will get in the box warranty cards charging cable this little strap a little cleaning brush plastic bag and plastic wrapper and here is the thing how it works pretty simple remove the protective cap here do not touch this bit there especially when the latter is on you have this on and on button switch it on and then you can see the charge the current charge level and then just press this button here and that's all you need to do fantastic pretty simple arm is adjustable so you can use it with these candles that are hidden deep within their containers like so as simple as that don't forget to switch it off and that's it it works i don't know what's the battery life of this thing but uh if you really want me i'm going to test it for you overall i'm quite happy with it again the brand is r-o-n-x-s which should be something like wrongs and it makes this sound which is pretty cool

[Music] beautiful flavor profile nice and tasty I mean I mean hey I'm here yeah one more time I'm gonna stuff constantly so the honey badger itself is about 250 retell the sauce itself roughly between 50 to 60 dollars what makes it special is the high terpenes they've probably got four or five different terpenes like limonene beta-carotene Mersin they're testing around well 13 to 15 milligrams per as well as your cannabinoids so the cannabis of THC is testing prior romic between 75 and 85 percent so you're getting some really amazing pure stuff there cool so how much does something like this cost it's 250 retail should drive the buggy this device here is is our showpiece though our friends over at Ziggy have been kind to provide us this rig to be able to play with took 14 glass flow or

mug or a sticker link will be in the description all right in this video we're going to go over the top five rare zippers in the world the hardest to come by and the prices for them what they look like and a little bit about everyone so here's number five all right it's no surprise that number five is the black crackle world war two zippo iconic zippo put zippo on the map very well sought after uh this zippo's probably going to run you around anywhere between 50 to 200 it really depends on condition a brand new mint in box hunt struck yeah i've seen them go for a thousand dollars and people will gladly pay it to have one that good because chances are you're gonna buy one of these and the crackle is going to be worn off you're going to see it like this here it's worn off pretty good that's how most of them are they got heavy use didn't stay on well these are well sawed after two because they're steel case insert one of the very few zippo makes and uh they were very handy during the war uh they didn't give away sniper positions because they weren't reflective that was just a benefit from it that wasn't a main purpose the main reason was they needed brass chrome and nickel for the war effort so they had to use this porous metal steel that they had made up and this is what we got from it but very iconic zippo everybody does love this zippo and you can see here just how if it wears off what the pitting looks like from rust and things like that uh very nice zippo very well sought after uh one i hope to have one day in my collection when i find her for a reasonable price and one everybody should be looking for so this one fits in perfect at number five for this reason just because it's one that we could still all obtain it's not too expensive it's not too crazy if you're not uh worried about condition or what it's gonna look like when you get it number four is a very talked about zippo in the comments on this channel and it is the iconic red crackle now just like the black crackle this is also a world war ii zippo but this one's a little more rare and a little more harder to come by just because there was less made these were preferably used by the military that worked in the tanks because it was dark in there and it was easier for them to find it where the black crackle obviously you couldn't see it in there so uh they preferred to use this one it was pretty popular by them and it was made popular by them also uh and it'd be a cool commemorative zipple for zippo to come back and do one day uh we're still waiting on that and it's hard to even find pictures on these and uh they're pretty rare and i've never even seen one for sale for brand new to give you an idea of how much they're worth uh but i'm assuming that they're gonna run you up anywhere between you know a hundred to three four five hundred dollars all depending on condition obviously uh but i have seen one did uh first sale very bad condition for 120 american dollars i also seen a bunch of people online just get a 41 replica and give it their own coating of red crackle i thought this would be something fun to try let me know in the comments if you'd like to see that now number three we're coming to the rare of the rare this is what everybody's been waiting for these are the zippos we're not going to afford in our collection all right this zippo is the 33 to 35 this one particular actually is a late 33. zippos are extremely rare there's very few made zippo was in the growing process a new company at the time these are just hard to find you don't see them for sale often on ebay or anything like that they're all in very big private collections people who have some of the rare zippo's out there they just they barely ever come up for sale and are barely ever found it's even hard to find a lot of pictures on them they are out there though you can't search them and something like this in bad condition probably going to run you between 500 to 1500 dollars and in good condition these hippos can go for a thousand or three thousand dollars i know it's hard to believe but it is it is absolutely true that is how rare these are and uh how high regards they are held to collectors uh this one here you're gonna notice uh just like the 35 replicas and everything like that that's what these basically are uh they're gonna have the slashes you're gonna have the three barrel hinge the originals actually have a brass insert that is chromed horizontal lines on the flint wheel closed chimney you're going to see some insert coming up here soon in the video and the bottom stamp is uh patent pending on this one so that tells me that this one is uh probably a 33 or 34. this one is being advertised as a brass but i highly doubt that judging by the chrome still on around the hinge and the chrome still inside the slashes but this is definitely a 33 because you could tell right away on this cam it looks like a gun hammer they used that right at the very beginning of zippo on the early zippos and you can see right there it does say patent pending and it has the insert to match in early 33. so just when you're looking at these things just make sure you're looking for the details the zippo also has a four barrel hinge so the zipper had to have been sent in for repair sometime after 1936 and where i got this picture from it did say that this was a repaired zippo of an original 33 so i just wanted to make that clear in the video and now number two brings in an extremely rare zippo it is known as the 33 tall right away from the pitcher you're gonna see why it gets its name because it is exactly a quarter inch taller than a regular zippo put out the same year you can see the regular 33 sitting beside it now this zippo was conceived in late 32 and sold and made an early 33 very very limited very few sold mostly just a concept a proof concept prototype this and that you could see things were changed and this is also going to be one of those ones that have that gun hammer cam you can't see it right now because of the angle of this photo but i didn't have a side photo of the two inserts side by side and you will see here that the insert is taller than a regular zippo insert of that same year that came out in later 33 this zippo is going to cost you guys this is going to run you up this is considered extremely rare this zipple is going to cost you anywhere between 1 2 dollars i've even seen it go as high as three uh this simple just does not come up for sale very often and i can assure you this is a very expensive zippo to obtain we've worked our way down to number one and after number one is an honorable mention from my private collection so if you could stick around for that one please do and here's number one and number one is the gun metal zippo uh it is a 1933 tall three barrel hinge uh it is just beautiful i love the look of this zippo uh so glad it's number one this thing is a bronze alloy made out of copper tin and zinc that's why you're seeing the color you're seeing right now it is modeled just like the other 33 talls a square body tall quarter inch taller than every other zippo this thing is is beautiful it just it's aged well uh i love the look of it i would love to have one of these in my collection uh this is only a prototype you can see on the bottom stamp here that it says patent pending also so collectors consider this actually a 32 you'll hear this be called the 32 a lot and this thing is completely rare they weren't even sold to the public this is like a prototype and they made so many and it's not even sure how many were actually even made i've never seen one of these for sale i couldn't find any record of one of these even selling these have sold privately though but this is before computers and things like that so i there's no receipt or anything to show but this will also have the gun hammer cam i really love that that is a really cool feature i i just think that's cool i wish i'd bring back but i'm sure it doesn't work well that's probably why they got rid of it so early they got rid of it the same year in 1933 as soon as they started using it they got rid of it so i'm assuming it doesn't work that great all in all the rarity of this zippo it's probably gonna run you around three to five thousand dollars us and trust me when i say that that's a legitimate price that's probably what you're gonna have to pay for this uh this is the zippo is almost a one of a kind it completely rare i know everybody's going to go on ebay and try to find these zippers for sale and you're not and you might actually find some early 30s here and there but i've seen them go for thousands of dollars and they are selling for that but you are going to find a bunch of first edition replicas when they first redid the replicas for these zippos and they are going for like two to five hundred dollars it is true and people are paying it some are selling uh they're just hard to come by there's not that many uh you can imagine what the originals are worth and now the rare zippo in my collection it is the coveted 51 steel case nickel silver insert korean war era zippo i've seen this zippo sell for 400 american online in similar condition i don't think this is worth that i think buddy paid what he wanted to pay for it but this zippo is a very important rare zippo because the year after the 52 had a steel insert and this is also a historically important zippo because it's between world war ii and the vietnam war so it was considered the forgotten war and this might be considered the forgotten zippo uh very rare love this zippo please subscribe and check out more videos like this on my channel", "1izMX3PZgso": "hey guys Jojo here in blood to you anyway what he said yeah we're here today to do a review on helix pipes their helix bond and bubbler to collaboration I believe between rav labs and helix and then we got some West Coast Sour Diesel from

put that in the description below and then these guys are going to be packed up with the west coast our diesel from Colorado wellness Dan I like to see little snapper regarding down is Lewis an average juice check this out perfect little just one you balling man that in there nice and good check out this world and it just moves that fruit which I love cuz I like pulling the ball all the way fruits it up water because that makes it water get dirty really quick and we clean that out after this so that guy just an amazing little one Yvonne like oh it's damn it [ __ ] it yeah with a feeling system it's just like oh man that helix of smelly sticky okay now this is the grab left bubbler that percolation is just awesome and then you did she like attachment also had like a straight kind of attachment so you can use this as a debris and and a flower bowl that I have blended average so i prefer eased into flour bowls Johnny he'd get that nice a lot of percolation and that nice helix he'll explode you know I'm saying that whatever you want to call that squirrel yes we're all that take his word the way there and then for the big boy this guy actually has to heal shaver he's got one right after the bowl and one right before it now what'd he steal it's things actually do is when you're hitting it it's got three little scent little air holes in each Felix chamber and then what that does is it air cools your head before it hits you the water here and then it air cool is that after it hits the water on this guy earth so it's more cooling with less water and here we go I mean so and I love all of these bicycles are all three of them knockos all three of them hit amazingly like they get you get it they get you stone they medicate you the right way and if you were to introduce something beside you lighter like one of those I forget what they call them but yeah I like a soldering iron basically then yeah you would have the ultimate flower piece but hey guys I'm gonna finish this up with a rip out of this actually you know it I'm going to show you guys some special that you can do if you having to have these two pieces no longer population at all but if you hit it the right way it looks really [ __ ] cool we'll get some shots of it like close up of that hitting it I mean that pulls your hit down without any water percolation right there and it's [ __ ] cool and the way I got set up well it's not red white and blue but I had it before to work anyways guys skate story and you let's finish this off with finishing off this bowl [Music] hey guys so if you happen to do have fought the you know big huge guy here and the little will not show a little but also the bubbler that comes with both of these attachments that you have to get nicely little bonus gift I'm gonna call this and you've got a double air cool like helix [ __ ] monster pipe good yeah", "EumxsJe6CpY": "welcome cannabis community its J papers and Haley A's and we have another stone reviews for you today we are doing a comparison between horrible gone portable long so we have two that we've gotten doses so we're taking a look at the campers smoker versus our smoker so the campers smoker we got out of the 4/20 goodie box and is it made by 420 on top of it at shop exhale so www exhale calm and they sell them right now I checked to go see what the prices that they're sold out but they sell them twelve packs if you want to twelve pack and apparently he spent $500 they'll send you a 12 pack just do that without really buying stuff and then where did we get the role of overall got this lovely piece in our 420 hot box the limited care pack the limited care packs our hot boss everyone all available yeah so a 420 limited care pack from the hot box no kept etcetera okay so the camper smoker is a hard acrylic plastic right and the rollerball is 100% well the tube is on our side medical principle okay and we both have our actual bowl in here mine made of metal this is made of a metal alloy it is by graphics it yes it says graphics and I know patents pending on this what's the population on yours I am a little ball percolator this ball happens to also be glow-in-the-dark back I don't have any I just have this much it's a tube or just a straight tube so no perforation straight to you and then yours is already displayed right licensed not in your ball right is already displayed whereas mine though doesn't look like a ball yeah not quite yet so she can even just put yours in and you're right right right so I got this piece and right now I have to definitely do this so that everything comes out evenly and then kind of pull on it to make sure that everything comes home without twisting twisting just to make sure the while he's doing that I'm going to be packing turn my car around the back where it's supposed to be because this is a European style so there's a carb on it you have a car one here no no Carmen some more of that straight pull accent so we had a friend my friends come over and they actually refused to smoke out of this position they wouldn't smoke that plastic so they wouldn't smell bad values or that one person [Applause] we have our option so hard okay there we go I have mine having set up now I need some water you need water too though right nope I pack mine so now we have our dogs made so we were camping food and housing ready to smoke does that faster than rolling your joint I think hers is definitely faster than rolling that my um I'm much more tired than I would be you have to take a gal who are without their money is very easy to package the base small small ball oh we need water anyone you have one thank you alright so you man you have to put about how much water do I say like what do you know leaders maybe not even really yes it's not your typical graduates you know but I mean it's not like it's not like 20 ounces no so it's not a lot it's basically one thing where I am pouring out the rest of the water that we had I love mine yeah cuz it's got that live bass sound very little bit more water oh yeah you just have to do with my please don't we're fine we're good water can actually come out of this [Music] [Music] [Music] so the suction is not great but and you got to kind of watch it if you push down with you on you just going to collapse [Music] but I'm afraid like I'm going to drink this one dress it to the metal and then it went out which is oh and one more feature we haven't gotten G yet because we haven't had a caching thing that the camper doesn't have the roller ball does is to see this right here so you actually pull the bulb down when it's ready to cache and it actually pushes whatever the contents are up whoa now if you catch the ball which is awesome I haven't I don't want to do it just now because we haven't smoked it but you didn't you squished it and if you get water all over the place okay [Music] you're not going to get water everywhere unless you push it so far that like the Parkers so as you can tell by our demonstration which one is to go over - yeah it's all about its function no matter what yeah it's easy caching easy to put together you pretty much put in your pocket it's a little bit more discreet though because the cup sees this they're gonna see a UC campus smoker which let's write it on it and feel like oh hey maybe it's for cooking yeah you know if you have it with that you know kind of item oh those kinds of adders but if you see this and the cop pulls it out and it rolls it out [Music] that's that's I think one thing that knows better but hopefully everyone gets out there and petitions and fights for the legalization and the end of the cannabis prohibition so that we can all smoke and then I'll have to worry about this is my dog with my trade money so everyone I subscribe as always sorry I'm getting a little high in the mountains of big as I should be but we did a few other takes before that but what I'm getting to is I'm sorry
