guys a shot this whole back a bunch of mercene lurping terpene smurfing all that good stuff in it too but i always say everyone asks me what's my favorite strain i always say like hash haze that this this is my favorite string gelato i love it i always loved it i never had it from pa medical i never had anything they came out with rhythm came out the gelato wax it was the gelato flower is what it was make sure you hit that subscribe like and leave a comment you guys [ __ ] rock it was out in philly way or whatever we never got it we never seen it so yeah i'm truly excited to try this one uh i guess let's open her up and see if she's full so you just grab here i'm guessing sit straight out just so they when you get a handle at the bottom all right open her up just regular empty little box comes like uh the raw garden and the moxies it comes in the white tube you think it's gonna be full what do you think let's see a little head space i mean not crazy crazy amount but a little little head space i love a layer of cartridges because their air holes are at the bottom so you literally get every drop that's what's pretty cool about alera their cartridges are different than anybody's like grassroots but it's got the adjustable airflow the holes in it at least uh it is a blank blank there's no it's a good old no namer now if you have a pull battery throw this on there i don't think it works for some reason these only work with a click battery just so you know because that would suck to get home and that's all you have is a click battery and your script so i bought this just for florida just to take because i bought an alera ecto cooler i wasn't a big fan of it this one i don't know i mean it ain't bad but let's try it out taste that gelato instantly the battery definitely needs charged on this but oh i love gelato i love it i can't believe it actually tastes like i thought it was gonna taste oh man i love that flavor and i'm [ __ ] lit holy [ __ ] whoo it's caught me sweating my head off but i think you need to do away with the air holes alera i think you're sucking way too much air in way too much air i think you get a way better hit if you cover a couple of these holes because watch that's just a regular two second draw not much up two air holes two second draw this car makes you sweat wow another thing to draft some jordan 23 from uh pharmaceutical rx don't worry it was like 30 off almost 40 percent off is the only reason i bought it or i wouldn't buy i'm over the half grams but for what i paid for it and i love jordan's i grabbed it so this review is going to be coming up you guys [ __ ] rock we still got the one gram cartridge of actually this lost coast travel diesel uh we've got the one gram cartridge that is coming out uh terrapin cresco there's two primes i'm so behind for real i'm about to take a week a week off here like asap rocky you guys [ __ ] rock i love you subscribe like later", "37IFacV_D50": "what's going on youtube family triple baskets we're gonna be doing another video today for you guys i really appreciate all the supports you know all the comments and stuff you know i go through that all the time so really appreciate you guys man and if you guys haven't added the snapchat or the instagram go ahead and do so i will leave all the information down in the description box below but other than that guys i've been pretty good myself um just got back from my dispensaries so so today i ended up picking up a platinum vape guys this is like one of the one that stands it out um it's the first time i've seen them in my dispensaries so i really you know i definitely had to try it out so i've never seen these around before um so if you guys ever had one of these let me know what you guys think about it it's like i said the packaging really caught my attention how it has a little cali you know little logo cut out right there and uh it's pretty dope so i ended up getting the gelato this one's around this cartridge is around 90 so it's one of the reasons i got it and gelato strain is always good you know they're always good they taste good and um so this cartridge was made like about last month or two the good thing about the boxes um it shows you the flavor on it it says it's earthy it's citrusy and it's sweet and it's known for relaxed happy creative uplifted energetic that's pretty dope you know shows the details on the box and stuff like that not that many boxes show that so that's pretty dope so i haven't smoked all day so like i'm just like trying to get high man it's like it's like 12 in the afternoon so it's kind of my waking break you know for my first time so there's ways to open it in the box but you know some some people just like to show the [ __ ] box open i'm always shredding my boxes open man they're supposed to be child proof and sometimes i can't open them by themselves so here we have a tube guys if like i said if you guys ever had the platinum vapes before let me know if you guys enjoyed it you know the price is pretty good on these cartridges honestly i paid like 31 it was 30 dollars flat but with like a dollar tax i think so that's pretty that's pretty cheap for a cartridge no i i don't i don't mind whether it's live resin or distillate you know before all this live resin it was just this is like cartridges and you know i don't mind smoking distillate it gets you high as [ __ ] and it's just it tastes good some people are like ah this list not good but you know i'll smoke this a little i smoke like resin it doesn't matter as long as it's good it tastes good that's all that that shouldn't matter so so this one's a gelato cartridge um i'm gonna go ahead and dry it just see if there's like some flavors in there or some [ __ ] honestly you don't you just get like a little taste to it flip ultra honestly this battery is hella good right now i've been using this um flip ultra for like the past couple weeks and it's been really good you know i had gone this better like a couple months ago and it's a pretty good battery you know it's a flip battery you know you can put it in your pocket and it has a lock on it so it won't [ __ ] flip open in your pocket and break so that's pretty good you know so here we have like so here we have the cartridge guys give you guys a close-up on that as you guys can see the little sticker the california logo sticker it's legit i'm just gonna go ahead and flip it over just to show you guys the quality on it gotta be thick you know i can't be running you guys know that and uh so here we have the battery i'm just gonna screw it on here try and get baked right now man i'm gonna hit the [ __ ] out of this pen so here we have the pan guys and um that's pretty dope though like once you connect it it shows you like the little posts so far on this battery i have 575 puffs so far that's like five cartridges ran to that [ __ ] so other than that guys hopefully you guys are smoking along with me i'm about to get hot as [ __ ] right now so cheers guys i'm gonna let you know i'm gonna let you guys know what this tastes like these batteries hit oh [ __ ] honestly these cartridges are pretty good you know they taste really really clean you know i didn't think they were gonna be as good just the simple fact that they were like 30 bucks you know i thought they're gonna be like 40 so that's crazy it tastes really really clean you know like on the packaging it says it tastes so on the packaging it says it tastes earthy citrus and sweet it's what it says back there i don't know if you guys can see but honestly that's what it tastes like it does taste really sweet and it does taste earthy so to be honest you don't really get like a citrusy flavor it just tastes really clean like an earthy flavor to it so it's pretty good you know i'm gonna go ahead and rip it some more big clouds right i don't know i don't know about you guys but the tip on these cartridges i really love those tips you know those round tips it just makes the cartridge more appealing and they hit way better i don't know that's just my opinion let me know what you guys think about that but i'm trying not to cough right now this cartridge is like 90 you know i'm just trying to hold my coffin i want to start coughing and [ __ ] off my bed on the videos you know it's just my schedule's kind of [ __ ] up right now but i'm still trying my best to bring out some more videos for you guys and uh like i said if you guys have it out of the snapchat go ahead and do so i'm more active on instagram and snapchat but if you guys would like to add both go ahead and do so but just has me going you know she has me high as [ __ ] already and i just took two hits it's around 12 in the afternoon so you know it got me feeling pretty good so and the reason i really like [ __ ] with distiller is just that some distillery cartridges have more thc in them than what a live resin would have like i was looking at cartridges right now my dispensary and most discs to the cartridges they range from like 80 to the high 90s you know compared to a light resin which which ranges from like the low 70s to high 80s you know it's kind of hard to find the live resin with like 90 in it you know i'm still on the lookout for those but other than that yeah there's like a [ __ ] little dish of the cartridges at my shop there's a lot of live resin but i never knock off distally you know there's people that say uh distill is bad but you know it's pretty good you know it depends on the cartridge you guys get and you know there's some cartridge to be honest there's there is some distilled cartridges that are not good i just give you a headache and it tastes like [ __ ] like fake this or like cheap you know but there's just some distillates that you know some companies really do spend their time to make them a little better and they are pretty good so you just got to go ahead and you just got to go ahead and you know start trying new brands that's what i do so like this was my first time trying the platinum vapes and i'm really enjoying it you know it gots me going cheers guys and this battery also if you guys would like to if you guys would like to purchase this battery i'm gonna go ahead and leave the information down in the description box so you guys go ahead and check it out it's pretty dope you know it's a flip battery and also comes with the little lock so you can't open it so like if it's in your pocket you're up and down at work it's not going to open and break up on you which has happened to me before and it's not good so it's dope it turns on automatically as you guys can see so that's one of my favorite cartridge batteries that i'm using right now selenius but other than that guys um i'm gonna be having some more hotbox videos soon for you guys i know i've been lacking on those two so oh [ __ ] i got the ac pumping right now this thing has me sweating man and as you guys can see it says 90 thc hopefully you guys can see that cartridge is really good so if you guys ever see these in this in the store go ahead and purchase one you know they're really good and for the price i paid 30 dollars flat for this [ __ ] guys and that's that's a good thing about living in california you know right here where i'm from in modesto california everything's cheap like a top shelf eighth is like 25 bucks if you want like an exotic uh if you want like an exotic eighth it's like 30 to 40 dollars max you know you know it's pretty dope you know but if you guys enjoy videos like this give this video likes don't forget to subscribe you know i really appreciate that guys that's hopefully you guys stay safe you guys have a really good day thanks for watching", "_q2YChBKNZg": "so the video did get cut off like what I thought so I put my other car back on because I didn't want to hit this one yet so I'm gonna go ahead and pop it off and put on the TK old cart let's go oops and go I had to take off the little rubber piece I'm just gonna put it on my other cart just so it doesn't get like dirty and all that they're gonna I got that all put the new one on focus there we go it's not really focusing whatever I turned her off back then I'll turn back on there we go let's see first fat they're killing me I wasn't even sure if it was hitting it's hitting but it's hitting sitting very weird to be honest I don't know I don't know I don't know why to and wait though there's like zero smoke coming out of this I don't know if I got a busted cart what but this is not very good right now I mean some smokes coming out by there's nothing made this videos gonna be short because it's not I can't really hit this like I know the person like close that got me this I'm just gonna have him give me another one because I mean I don't know it's not really hitting that much and you said that like a couple of them weren't um working correctly so decided for one's busted just let him know and he'll give me um like another one so that's straight ahead that'll be in this picture right here nice boat on the TKO there we go that's a thumbnail picture right there so I mean I don't want to say we're done with this one this video I don't want to be finished with just that the form in the video 3-minute video I'm just gonna put on back on my cookies cart smooth that for a little bit just talk almost drop down so I'm just gonna put it back in the case now I know every box like it's like different there's so many different types of details um I guess I'll just depends I don't know so put the cookies cart back on and this oil on here is so I'm trying to get it's so thick because I've had this for like I don't know three weeks and I hit it every day and it does not die let so many people hit it like it's really super thick and lot of smoke comes out so it's pretty good I was pretty good most probably one of the best ghosts I've done to be honest freakin Lippert I like a little cutter something I'm newnode it from but I guess okay I don't even talk about nothing really yeah so uh let me know what you guys are smoking on let me know what type of battery guys use I always say it I just like to know because I'm more looking that cooler batteries come on that - beep um you keep I think that's the name here's the box I don't know what happened on my desk guys babe you keep pretty nice think two stories and then here's the back and then I have just well yeah it's a pretty nice battery small it's not like I've seen the key batteries I think double the size not the best that's mean in the video thing guys for watching subscribe leave a like comment do whatever if you guys haven't already I don't start giving some activity on this channel I've been gaining subs and I'm having fun so yeah and you guys watching she didn't sign me out peace", "jDMFQ429UZM": "hey guys his dad connection and reviewing cookies gelato and I got this in the class reveal I believe area somewhere around there it is a legit cookies cart it was a good price it was 30 bucks for a half not bad at all and so far it's okay the taste is not so good it tastes kind of co2 ish you know kind of like co2 oils and not doesn't taste like this w VAP co2 oils those days exceptionally well if you've tried those but it tastes kind of more like like the regular kind of co2 oils a little bit it kind of tastes like a mix of the distill it and the co2 oil the second thing is it does use good hardware it uses real see self I like the ceramic tops this is the th 210 I believe they call it and yeah so good airflow I know it's gonna be efficient of course it uses a Jackson cartridge so many times but it's it's not that strong oil is is decent its decent it's pretty good it's not super good and you know California bands that are stronger would be AeroPro and select I would say they're both way better than this I would take both leaves over they this ones that I've tried for Nevada brands also AeroPro roots blows us away you know I expect more I thought because it's like a big company cookies is like everywhere would be really huge but roots that is like advertised nowhere and is a small brand in Nevada that does like no advertising and I'm sure probably has like a tenth or twentieth the budget of cookies makes a way better cartridge then cookies can of a t'v as well was way better than this but so AeroPro and select though are your the california ones that are both way better than this and you know I just give it like to some sideways cuz I was hoping it'd be really good and it's not really good it's just pretty good but here we go with take a hit you can see how it looks yeah it's alright so this cookies gelato I got a few of these cookies cards so maybe some of the other ones will be better but after the gelato yeah it's just all right pretty good pretty good not really good not great so this is dab protection thanks for watching guys and have a great week", "C0I-fw0LvPM": "what's up YouTube welcome back extinct 420 here with another medical marijuana review got my new uniform today that's what took me so long to put out this next video yo your school shirt it's gonna be my new uniform for all my videos I might get another one I'll put the link in the description just the case you guys want one today we're checking out some of the cheapest the best vape pens you could get on the market right now coming from Liberty Health Sciences that's gonna be the THC count on that and then on this one this is gonna be a jack hair it's pretty good stuff I'm smoking on this you spin here I've had these a couple days so this is gonna be the gelato mmm tastes it tastes delicious these are the reason I say these are the cheapest is because these are $35 for 400 milligrams of THC and a lot of people they are misconstrued about how they sell them and whatnot dispensaries usually sell them by the milligram counts and not like half gram or grams like you see all these street cartridges have in Liberty Health Sciences is selling these which have 400 milligrams THC for 35 compared to true leave that it would be 47 for 350 or cure leaf which is they get a hundred and fifty for 18 or even move which has 250 for 35 or sir Terra which has 250 for 35 but that has a disposable pen with it this you have to have your own little vape pen I got this is for free from a friend of mine Wow it's killer right there mm-hmm you could check out the app hmm the oil in that stuff nice golden color it doesn't move you can hold it upside down for as long as you want it'll move eventually but all these cart Street carts are ugly and brown all right we're gonna try this Jack Harry this one's unopened this is what a car looks like fresh out of the pack 400 milligrams THC like I said this one it's got like a fruity taste this gelato got that delicious oh man alright we gonna try this Jack hare I didn't even tried this yet I had the flower in my last video it was pretty good I actually still have a butt of that left I'm saving it you know special occasion not so special occasion just saving it alright I'm already ripped you off that [ __ ] gelato you know I'm tell y'all what this does cuz I'm ripped definitely not like uh that one's like a citrusy taste that gelato this one has more of a berry taste man I'm ripped y'all the first batch I got which is this gelato had 75% THC the second batch 87% THC so I mean they're both really good yeah so there you have it guys these are definitely the best bang for your buck if you're going for any kind of dispensary cartridges in Florida I mean you could pay I mean yeah these people on the streets and say that oh I could get a gram for 40 or 50 but that's like of like Eric Conn says some hot dog water or something I mean hot dog water probably be better for you but I mean it's not that expensive look you off y'all get invest in your in your card which cost two hundred and seventy eight dollars and then you can get the $78 discount earth no $75 discount on $150 so I got five of these cartridges for $100 so that's that's two and a half grams for 100 bucks compared to these fake-ass half grams y'all get big-ass grams y'all getting for full 50 or 40 or whatever and this is real legit delicious dispensary lab tested quality stuff that's just you know my opinion my channel is here for people who are curious about getting their card and don't want to get ripped off or waste their money and don't know what they're getting because like you would like to see what they get before they buy it and none of these dispensaries show you any flour or any any cartridges that you can't taste it at the dispensary so that's what I'm here for guys but I'm gonna get off here I'm gonna smoke this Luke's tendo right here that's coming up next I mean I'm ripped but I like to smoke so I mean we don't get it and here check out the shirt y'all want it I'm gonna leave a link in the description thanks guys catch y'all next time", "W5c2hQqr8No": "yo what is going on youtube welcome back to another banger by your boy sebi g guys so man as you guys can see by the time i'm not even gonna sit here and just try to keep it going like you guys don't already know what we're gonna be doing in this video but guys getting straight into it man we got the legendary all right the long awaited buddies liquid diamonds live resin cartridge review all right boys so for those of you that don't know what but it is it's a liquid diamonds live sauce cart all right live resin cart you should say and pretty much there's no distillate no additives none of that bs it's just straight up live resin slash liquid diamonds you know this one in particular is legend gx watermelon skittles sitting at a 71 percent thc all right boys so by the low thc percentage i could already kind of tell you know it might be a true light resin because live resins in general re shoot really really really low and thc percentages for some reason so i'm assuming this is right on there man if it was a distillate cart it would probably be over 80 all right boys so before we break this in though i do want to let you guys know they do have a cannabis drive terpenes one so be careful when you guys go to dyspo's and things like that because i almost got that one that one does have distillate i believe it has this i'm not 100 sure but this one right here is the true 100 full spectrum live resin all right so on the side of the box right here let me go ahead and read you guys this out right it says our full spectrum liquid diamonds extract is harvested fresh frozen and processed at sub critical temperatures to preserve maximum with the fudge they did a little typo there to preserve maximum cannabinoids and terpenes all right boys so this is just a fresh cart bro so i'm gonna go ahead and peel this open go ahead and peel the little sticker back boom take the card out open it like this lift the little box out boom out comes a clear little tube and as you guys can see through the tube man that oil is looking a little bit dark right this one is looking a little bit darker but go ahead and take it out the tube it honestly looks really really good for some live resin men i've seen some live resins that are just super super dummy dummy dark and brown but this one has a little bit of a lighter tint to it obviously it's still dark but it does have a lighter tint to it man i'm kind of excited to try this out all right boys so go ahead and take the tops off make sure you guys have those on if you don't it's probably a fake man go ahead and slap this on the trust worthy ooze variable wattage battery all right boys so i believe live resins usually have to smoke them at a very very low temperature so i'm going to have this one the lowest one it goes to is 3.3 so i'm going to go ahead and just go in on a hit man i'm hoping that this is good i'm i'm hoping it falls under the same category of ursa diamond cartridges man you know they're both live diamond live resins so it should taste kind of similar all right the only difference is obviously bunnies has different strains ursa has different strains and i'm on the hunt to see which strain is the most potent all right this one is an indica like i was saying so you know your boy's a fan of indigos man i'm ready to get faded right boys cheers yo all right i think i'm gonna have to go in on another hit man because honestly i that was a very very very distinct flavor so i can't tell you guys what it is right off the bat but if i had to try if i had to try it tastes freaking earthy it tastes like very very earthy like i don't know how to explain it man some very very oh genius in there and i like it i like that first hit but we need to get into this deeper man a bit uh before basing it off the first hit all right guys so let's go in on another one choose yeah sheesh i'm telling you yeah that tastes like a freaking dab so for those two first hits man i'm telling you guys that the legends og it has a very very very heavy flavor profile in this cartridge okay so i taste a lot of the oh genius like i'm talking about as soon as i inhale like it's just straight up punginess straight up earthiness and it's super super good if you don't if you guys have never tried an og man they just have this very very distinct flavor and just smacks you across the face okay and this one in particular i've never tasted legends og but it's a fire strain off basing off this car alone and the watermelon skittles so far i haven't really tasted it man so maybe i just have to keep breaking into the cart so it's going on hit number three um honestly after those two first hits i kind of am starting to feel a slight head change nothing crazy but i can see i can feel like you know i'm starting to chill out a little bit more than i'm already i already am so that's upside that's definitely an upside that's definitely what you want to see out of a cartridge menu you want to feel the difference you want to notice the difference you want to see the difference okay so going in on hit number three man i want to try to take a blinker out of this i'm gonna die actually i don't know if i'm gonna die but either way let's go in and get even more faded man you guys could see it in my eyes just starting to progress slowly which is honestly really really cool it it all falls into the full spectrum live resin honestly and that's why live resins are just a whole lot better than distilling man so cheers guys the blinkers for the boys i'm gonna keep it real with you guys that blinker just altered my whole game bro like i literally just my head change went from like slowly progression to oh 180 bro i feel the high now like it's just setting tingling sensations down my body and it feels good it feels good i must say like honestly like all right when it comes to cartridges guys or any just weed in general okay depending on the strain you know and depending on the terpenes that it has all that stuff it just it it's gonna cause you a whole different high every single time man and this time this legends og slash watermelon skittles this combination their terpenes their flavor profiles is just an awesome conjunction of you know of like mixtures man and it it just it just tastes so good it makes your body feel good it's just the overall taste is like fire it doesn't taste like live resin you know like like i always complain about the the statistic of the tasting live regular tasting live resin man like stizzy has the same tasting life resin friendly farms has the same tasting live resin i don't know what other cartridges come to a select or is another one of those companies um their live resin is just so ugh like it's just so weird dude it's just the taste is just like it's not an enjoyable taste that's why i don't go to stizzy and cop live residence i'm sorry suzy i love you guys i love everything about you guys except you you're like resident pods are just man you know they're not the best friendly farms you know same thing they're like resin carts or man their flavor profiles on them like you'll get a cartridge every now and then that's all right yeah this is a pretty decent flavor but for the most part the flavor profiles on some most of the live resin cartridges they all kind of taste the same you know when you exhale you just get that really really nasty taste in the back of your throat and like for me personally it makes me want to gag and throw up i'm one of those who's like if i taste something nasty i'm just like oh no it's a no for me boss so this one does not taste like that one it has a very very distinct taste like i was saying earlier in the video um the legends og stands out a lot and on the exhale i do get a little bit of a sweetness i'm not getting a crazy sweetness you know so i'm not really tasting the skittles too much but the high man the high is just so relaxing so relaxing what so i'm going to hit number four because i just cannot stop enjoying this if this video speaks for itself you know when i keep hitting and hitting and hitting and hitting a car it just means that it smacks bro so cheers guys that's fire dude and i don't get that sensation of wanting a cough like i was saying with distillate i do get only like like for example today this is the first smoke of the day right it's currently like eight o'clock in the morning or something like that so i don't know about you guys but when i wake up in the morning my lungs are not they're not 100 you know ready to go because they still have to wake up take some big fresh breath um air and then um after that you know then you start smoking it's just more smoke going into your lungs and it's like i said it's the beginning of the day so it's not used to it and um it's just it just irritates a little bit more than it usually would you feel me but with this one i'm not feeling that sensation um i don't want to cough like crazy and the flavor is fire like i was saying but overall this this quality the quality of the cartridge is fire i just kind of wish someone will come out one day one day they're gonna come out with the live resin cart man that's at least the 85 percent thc bro at least the 80 i feel like i've never ever seen a live resident card that goes that high so maybe one day man any cartridge companies that are watching this please make it make your boy a 85 cartridger at 90. because you know i've we've only ever seen those in desolate cartridges and i we don't we know f with distillate cartridges no more boys we're on the live residence live ros and wave slash liquid diamond wave i think a lot of companies are trying to you know put diamonds inside of cartridges which is starting to work it's fire um like i was saying buddies i'm so glad that i was able to try this out i'm going on another hit i'm talking too much without hitting it boys blinker number two yeah dude that blinker just oh man you feel like like when you take the blinkers off of this you feel you getting more faded honestly like i'm just like stay i just stared off into space like i was like started thinking about like cartridge and food and stuff and i'm just like wait hold on dude i'm making a freaking video that's how you know this cartridge is hitting man because when i'm faded i'm just like i'm just uh in my own zone you feel me so with that being said guys this watermelon skittles legend og buddies cart fire the liquid diamonds i'm starting to appreciate them a lot more so i think soon if you guys make it to the end of this video man i want to see all right if you guys would like to see my top cartridges of 2020 since none of them are going to be really distillate anymore it's going to be all li resin live rosin it's going to be a banger video so if you guys want to see my top cartridges of 2020 let's go ahead and hit 600

just stuck on raw garden so bad but um that i just really didn't want to pay attention to this but now that you know this i know this is not distillate i know this is some fire i'm going to be

fire that one would be right so 600 likes we'll get that cracking buddies super fire i love this strain legend og watermelon skittles even though the tc percentage isn't too high it still does what it needs to do the full spectrum high is on point and the flavor is fire too it's not the best tasting i'm not gonna say it's like crazy insanely good tasting it's live resin so but um for this one in particular it does taste pretty decent you know um and with that being said guys this [ __ ] is fire eight out of ten for me if it had a little bit more higher tc percentage you know that that would

my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man that's all i got to say about it this joint is pissing me off much love y'all seven likes do it do it all right go to twitch.tv link will be in the description uh go to my twitter man i'm trying to get my twitter up as well like i want y'all to be able to follow me and know what i'm doing you know know when i'm going to make a video knowing i'm going live you know i always want feedback as well you know i want to talk to you guys too that's always awesome so much love you guys let me know what you guys thought about the video i will see you in the next video be safe peace out [Music] you", "l7PHGUHdhNc": "story this evening an empire of illegal drugs that's the description of a massive THC vape cartridge operation busted in Kenosha County investigators say they saved about a half a million and a half dollars of illegal drugs our Hanna Jewell is live with what's been found so far and how this all started with somebody's worried parents yes is this one of the largest drug operations you've had in Kenosha I don't think it was but of this type it's the largest we've ever had and as far as I know it's probably one of the largest in the country Kenosha County Sheriff David beth says the THC vape cartridge operation was being run out of a house and paddock Lake and a condo in Bristol Beth says they seized THC products with a street value of 1.5 million dollars focus was on making money sheriff Beth says two brothers 20 year old Tyler Huff Heinz and 23 year old Jacob hoppings are both facing multiple charges for illegal drug violations that's just the tip of the iceberg in this operation search warrant served at the residences last week led investigators to find more than 31,000 illegal THC vape cartridges almost 100 thousand unfilled cartridges and dozens of mason jars filled with THC oil imported from California they would take a syringe and they inject it into the cartridges the sheriff says they also found guns marijuana buds cocaine pills and $60,000 cash investigators say they may never have uncovered the covert business if it weren't for a couple of parents in Waukesha who tipped them off to a THC cartridge they found with their son I asked all parents out there this is a perfect opportunity and a friendly reminder to have that conversation with your kids six deaths have been blamed on vaping nationwide many more injuries federal investigators are stepping in here now to see if any of those cases are linked to this case here reporting live in Kenosha Hanna Jewell Fox 6 News", "akyKHTB0qH4": "[Music] let's go youtube ministry boy man fellow signing him back with another video today I'm at Windy City cannabis it is a dispenser that sent home word you got to pick up a couple parts get wedding cake and I'm also about to grab our train Hayes or something like that but I'm gonna go grab two carts and then on my door review like usual although swaggy this way Corin C&I are some people like super cautious steel stick another wine but it's not as bad as when we go ahead last night he is why it shouldn't be much of a late a wait they got it like a little thing going on right now when you just you order online and then you get a time where you come pick it up at so I'm here at my time right now to pick it up I got the cards this is Ronald like I said wedding cake I'll just do some b-roll but another one ghost train hey that's what I got ghost train Hades I know something but I think welcome got like 81 percent to eighty seven percent I got both of them it was overall pleasant experience with the city Canada so give it like two thumbs up pretty simple I know this really fight doesn't matter to other people in other states it should like that because they're dispensaries aren't like that they don't operate like it's a banking [ __ ] but out here in [ __ ] Illinois act like the Spencer is our bank and you know there's like a security door behind a security door behind another security door what is good YouTube and we're back like I said I just got back from Windy City cannabis right now I got so this is what I miss using to smoke this is not a really cheap doesn't cost much at all pay my five bucks for it like I said ended up getting two carts I got like I said got wedding cake and the guy goes try and I used about 500 milligram how finally just short of what I usually do but this joint called and they don't costing me 65 on top of that I ended up paying my 75 attacks in other words so and I know what in other words robbery bro this is it right here waiting cake do some b-roll [Music] [Music] again this is Verano now use this sticks hit this [ __ ] that's that join us is it right here or on tone beep anyway this little thing screwed a [ __ ] in here reason why I got this one in particular could this convene I could just stick this in my pocket I'll take it with me looks to go it's smaller but yeah hey slow bro it's a smooth pen I just probably last me a month I use mine tickling too however they have much for you as far as like a player for flavor program which I taste this [ __ ] one more time I can't really taste much out of this I'm not really getting like a cake taste oh no matter like look up and let you guys know like whether that actually works I don't really taste nothing cake wise as far as like wedding cake but uh I do feel something is usually pretty instinct with cars it's just like this literally just like smoking flour which has been my experience still early just like smoking flour so yeah I just be starting to feel some already that first day I took what was pretty was pretty damn massive but yeah and that man I'm gonna let you guys know I like I said hey buddy taste it tastes just a bit sweet but I outside of that any taste nothing I'm for real but eighty percent THC it is a hybrid I saw an indica and sativa and yeah other than that miniature boy man I appreciate you guys supporting the content two channels still steadily growing steadily growing and I'm just nothing but appreciated appreciate it to you guys and I've been in my experience that Windy City cannabis I give it two thumbs up as far as like I had like a bad experience I went to security guard but outside of everybody was cool most people was cool just like one little bit it didn't really blow it I still recommend though they're cheaper than the ones are that's gonna say that cuz they have yeah overall great experience I give this to thumbs up with them filling it for sure outside that man should I pick although I'm out under that this pan yo and I feel like my face is melting off right now", "IYWyKuLSB98": "[Music] what of my stoners and chuggers welcome back smoking with small town back at it again today is a cartridge review and a beer review we got a two-part review today before we get to the cartridge let me show you the beer real quick I know a lot of people don't like Budweiser but I do drink it and they had these nitro reserve goals and supposedly you're supposed to shake it three times open it in a hard pour and then wait I don't know I just want to see what the difference is between this is regular Budweiser I'll let you guys know if it's worth this [ __ ] it's even worth buying or what it's all about yeah it says right here you're supposed to tilt it three times open it and a hard fall so I don't know if this cup is big enough but it's the biggest one I got so cheers everybody oh and my channel is for adults so little kids back on up and if you haven't subscribe hit that like button and subscribe right damn now alright so it goes one two three open cardboard what the hell this [ __ ] looks weird you guys see that look good it's what the hell I've never seen anything like that you're supposed to wait for it so I'm gonna wait for it and then drink it okay well we're ready for that okay we got the first time trying select select elite live enhanced live resin this one here is an indica it is the gelato and it is coming to you at a 85% on the THC and this is a food gram I have took it out of the box already because I wanted to get pictures for my Instagram so here's the cart it's got the select in the front California these tips are clear the plastic I kind of not into that I like the ceramic ones better myself but this is the first time trying to select so we will see and it does have too much Headroom for me like it's missing quite a bit at the tip right here so that automatically I do not like and I got my battery here it's fully charged give this a go I think this is a C cell battery it is a C cell so and this is libel resin and this is the gelato so first time trying to select cheers everybody hope you guys having a great day staying baked all that good [ __ ] so let's get a rip flavor not bad it was smooth and then but it did choke me out like it was strong I gotta say just off first like first hit I'm gonna have to say that I like to select better than I like the Ursa cart that I just smoked recently on that B hasn't if you ever guys haven't seen that review and check it out already posted it it taste like a gelato it's pretty smooth and it's got some nice kick to it so let's see what's up with this beer as nitro beer smells nothing different smells like normal Budweiser it's a little darker than normal Budweiser quite a bit darker actually you can see it yeah it's pretty dark it's got like an amber color to it almost all right let's get a drink it tastes like like beer on tap coming up I'd say yeah it's time to me it tastes kind of flat I guess that's because it's not carbonated I don't know if I had to choose that have that normal Budweiser I think I'd go to normal Budweiser let me get a couple more drinks in but first initial taste it's kind of flat and it tastes like a like a not very good IPA or a lager like I don't know I don't like it it's very light it's not strong or heavy tastes very yeah it's not good so far [Music] so select I like to try different companies I've already done raw garden and they've done la cuz I don't know I done Moxie selected one I haven't tried yet or friendly farmers how will be trying those soon Elite live enhanced live resin gelato in Dakota 85% on the bottom they have this like this label they're supposed to take off and put on your cart but I think that's lame and I'm not gonna add anything extra to my damn car they should put it on there already they wanted to dominate I'm not gonna edit I refuse uh-huh I really like this battery to it uh I know there's all kinds of craziness going on in the world right now and I try to stay keep that stuff off my channel it'd be kind of lame if I didn't address it at least though I'm not gonna go too far into all that stuff I just I don't agree with it I think that police brutality and all that [ __ ] is ridiculous racism still is in this world and I wish that everybody could just take a bong load and have a beer and kick it with me and be do but I guess it's just not the way the rest of the world things so wish everybody would get their head out of their ass and get with the program and do like me and B do coexist awesomeness bestfriend shape so cheers everybody hope you guys are staying safe out there and have a great day yeah it tastes like an on tap beer not I'm not liking it at all to me I'd rather just do this and get abnormal Budweiser cracker open and get a guzzle that's not all familiar flavor I know a lot of people don't like you but alright [ __ ] dude I'm used to it anybody like these [ __ ] like these went to a birthday party the other day my girlfriend's daughter shoutout babe she's just turned eight and then and these were in the pinatas so I like these damn thing they taste good all right let's get another hidden before I get the review oh and I did do the like the bubble test you turn it upside down and it's very slow doesn't really move very slow bubbles normally it does it just takes a while takes a while so I don't know seems legit I got from the dispensary I shot out the blue fire Merced California they got awesome bud tenders and great selection they've been pretty packed lately though it's hard to get in that my locker they don't got no parking no parking in there at all all right considering flavor smoothing this price and Highness flavors great smoothness is there it wasn't that they need that expensive yeah and they do get you lit it did have a little bit of headroom like I said that was one of the knocks on it and I do not like the clear tips I wish there were ceramic tips but those are the only two knocks on it did get me really loaded so I'm gonna have to get it the 72 I recommend trying out select and you guys haven't tried not yet so and that beer horrible unless you guys like flat tasting [ __ ] beer then yeah I do not recommend getting the Budweiser nitro reserved gold I think they [ __ ] suck and this 72 what it do I really like it hope you guys enjoyed the review hope you guys are staying baked until next time smoking with small town [Music]", "rJMjnifYgts": "hey guys what's up my name is Mary I look like [ __ ] right now so I'm not really going to show myself but hello I'm here anyways so I'm going to be doing a quick little review on the King pen cartridges the strain one is trainwreck and let me just firstly say how disappointed I am I tried their cartridges before I didn't have that big of a problem with it I thought that the concentrate thought was in there was kind of thick that was kind of I guess a little indicator that there was something up with it but this the current time that I needed another one alright this is only one I could find so this is what I was dealing with and it was a lot worse than last time so mmm let me just show you I guess what this looks like as you can see instantly this looks just absolutely disgusting this is something that you clearly don't want to smoke let me focus game clothes do you see what is in there can you guys tell me what you think that is I mean this is clearly some type of like DIY cartridge or something that someone have [ __ ] me over on like Ivan like look at this color separation right here in this like air bubble that's neither floating up to the top may I tell you like this has been in the year for about nine hours and it has not moved let me flip it upside down nothing you can see it is slowly hardly moving at all but it is just so so alarming this is clearly my fault that I purchased this I got it for about $50 I don't know I'm just very upset about it I don't really know what is in there like I said if you guys know if you guys ever seen thing like this please tell me what you think this could possibly bleep like be cuz I'm actually scared too I smoked it a couple times clearly not that much because it's uh I didn't notice it until it got down to this bubble like how bad it was so yeah guys please be careful with the stuff you buy you never know what's really in it and that's the truth so yeah if you guys can just comment down below and let me know what you think what is in there cuz like I said clearly it's some some [ __ ] and I'm trying to figure it out yeah yeah", "egEJZpfMd3w": "[Music] all right and we are back here on cbdhemplibrary.com with yet another cart breakdown hell yeah we want you guys to know about your carts what's in your carts what flavors your carts before you get them so we'll do a quick overview once again absolutely on this sub breakdown we're doing the gelato cart and again that's the legally lifted gelato cart that's our in-house brand we've been working hard to bring you all the best quality delta eight carts we could find oh yeah as well as other products that will be on this website but right for right now in terms of the gelato we've been sitting here smoking it i would say it might be our most flavorful flavorful cart and for the houston inspiration um for the gelato we actually have a cream-colored slab on the front um if you know anything about houston they're popular here man we have a huge slab culture here and i mean like we've said before all of our products are houston inspired yeah and i think um for the flavor on the gelato cart it has very lemony limey taste to it definitely it probably is top two in terms of noticeable over the five cannabis derived terpene carts that we do have oh yeah i don't know if i mentioned it earlier in the video but all of our carts all are cannabis derived terpenes 94 94 delta 8 thc so we're trying to get us trying to find the best balance for y'all as possible we found some carts that really hit smooth as and they also don't sit heavy in the lungs that's something i look for i say this in every video because i've hit some carts that three days later i still feel like my lung has been punched by it so i we tried to make something that's as smooth as possible and this gelato is it i'm not willing to say my favorite yet but it's in terms of taste but it's it's close it's nice it has a strong tasting like he was saying it's very citrusy like lemony taste to it um it's it's sweet at the same time it's it's a nice taste and it's a pronounced taste yeah and for it to be so pronounced i'd expect it to have more of a a cough right it hasn't got me not too bad not at all if you guys are looking for a hybrid cart something to kind of just chill get you through the day um this gelato might be the perfect card for you yeah i agree this is um the hybrids seem to be with the delta eight they seem to be a little bit almost a perfect mixture if you're looking for a midday to afternoon type of smoke so i would really i would highly recommend the hybrids if you're looking to just maintain maintain the nice hybrid throughout the day oh yeah oh yeah we always appreciate you all for tuning in thank you for considering a purchase thank you for watching this video and if you do purchase please leave a review please let us know how you like it and we'll tweak it and change it accordingly absolutely we all we we figured out early on that in order to make the best product you guys are the most important part of that because you can provide us the best knowledge into what to make better what to how to adjust here and there and we'll read through all of it and try to make the best product every time oh yeah it's been another one indeed it has peace [Music] you", "_woZ8IzEH50": "dabbe connection here with the Eden diamond line gelato cartridge this one is a higher-end cartridge as you can tell from the packaging here before we get to the cartridge itself it's quite well done they've got a nice finish here so it catches the light real nice so even the cartridge itself is in a higher quality plastic tubes and the usual just plain clear plastic with a top top you've got yeah solid white plastic tube here that's got a childproof cap on here little difference that makes and the cartridge itself is a custom design according to their website that's a proprietary it's got these two air inlets here which while the cartridge does clog on occasion you'd think that the air holes would impede the ability to clear those clogs they don't at all the cartridge itself performs great you see it's got the Eden printed on the chamber here and they've got their symbol printed on the mouthpiece here overall pretty great job overall on the presentation and the cartridge itself it's really couldn't ask for much better it's gotten it's on the pricier side as I mentioned it's a higher-end cartridge but you get everything you just specked out of a higher-end cartridge it's got good flavor the high comes on quick and it's heavy but it's pleasant it's never overwhelming unless you take more than a couple hits then it can get a little overwhelming but that's your own fault and yeah it it's pretty great it hits pretty heavy too which you know kind of come to expect those that aren't see cells are oftentimes pre light on the hits but this one isn't as I'll show you right now as you can see is it's pretty heavy you almost couldn't ask for better than that hmm see cell itself sometimes doesn't deliver that also there's no burnt flavors at all toward the end of the card here taste overall has been really clean like very natural sort of flavor to it not any sort of bitter tones nothing chemically or unnatural about it you can see here that the fluid is a bit of a different color than the usual and that's not a trick of the light it genuinely is it's almost more like a rose color rather than the usual green or yellow and I it's probably has to do with the proprietary extraction technique of some kind I don't really know but overall the oil cell if it doesn't drain overly quickly and there's nothing to complain about with it at all and even at the higher price point that it is 40 50 bucks a card the thing elasti a several-day is easily and I'd say it's a great deal highly recommended one of the best I've come across hopefully that helps to inform your purchase and hope you guys all have a great day", "wwLFNAGRECk": "[Music] l will make the beat down welcome to my channel welcome to this hippie headband channel this is a channel where we review carts and we review beat moments now before anything I want to start by saying thank you so much for taking this time out of your day to come watch this video thank you so much now today we got a little special product for you guys last video I did a little dancreep review purple punch not gonna lie to you change it changed my perspective on take beeps was not bad at all but now today you know we came in we came through with another dispensary [ __ ] I got two products for you guys today but I'm only gonna be reviewing one we got the new kingpins this is the Skywalker og which is an indica this is the gelato which is a hybrid now these are the new newest newest boxes so before I open this up I'm gonna show you guys how to make sure that you know if you get these new boxes and how not to get scammed so with these new boxes [Music] instead of having the seal that was more of you know it was it was kind of patched on this is fully printed on so this is on here you can't scratch that off for nothing like this this is on the actual box it still has all the same information it still has the manufacturer date the best body the batch number everything like that you know I'm saying and of course ingredients just cannabis oil and then of course one second draw is a single-serving you know they always say that but you know for today let's try out this gelato so today we're gonna be trying out this gelato kingpin next time why have the Skywalk OG the reason why don't want to do the Skywalker og just just as yet I had the Skywalker og strain and man oh man it is a night night hitter like the Skywalk OG is very strong in - that's the thing was trying to have you do it just it just have you all types are completely gone so let me start right here by Samuel it says on here this is July - of course a thousand milligrams the THC amount is seventy seven point 38 percent total THC is seven hundred and seventy-three point seventy six milligrams there's zero point thirty percent CVD and it's 2.99 excuse milligrams of CVD so push I already know C so don't judge me we're using a plastic knife today to open these up yeah sorry for that that didn't work so we're doing the crackhead way the only choices now if y'all haven't have this tool you need to use this please don't use this tool I done damaged up the box oh yeah I forgot whole sides both sides both sides now a lot of people was saying that with the kingpins you can get the stickers online don't be real with you for you to try to take this thicker Zoff as you can see watch I'm trying to take a sticker off and show you guys you can tell if it's tampered with you see how dingy and everything on top of that looks already so you can put like no and look I've ripped it off and you see what happened the whole bottom came on you bro you you know what you didn't when you know what you're getting this very very hard to do it with that look and I rip off the other side look what happened same thing with the other side you can't just rip you know rip them apart put a new one in there these kingpins are different they're different I mess with them heavy heavy heavy oh okay okay with these new boxes they went back with the regular black of course got the insert [Music] [Applause] [Music] got that my stinker there it is right there as you guys can see of course has the grommet of course has the grommet on each side just take off the holes take off the top let's take off the bottom this one no leakage at all I mean the last one was months and months and months old I live on the East Coast so to ship it and whatever it's been stored it kind of makes sense that it was a little bit of leakage so you know for that last King and it kind of makes sense with no leakage at all for this which should be expected the fact that it only has been manufactured about a month ago and other thing about the king pins where I don't know if you guys could really see but what the king pins being on here there's an actual physical reflection that's all in the back of it that reflects everything that says gonna sit on it so on the back of it it basically has the exact same thing as this kingpin is it has the kingpin man what is right honest so of course as usual we're using the yoke and mini today fully fully fully fully charged today for this video have a whole day rest in peace - Dex screw this all I [Music] [Music] [Music] already know kingpin oil is so thick so big so thick all right let's get to it let's get to it person oh what's the justice real quick let's give this a fool I remember with this review we reviewed three things we review the color taste and how medicated they get you but of course that says reach full its peace right now I can't I can't I can't pinpoint an exact taste but I said this again [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm sorry for that oh [ __ ] oh wait that just felt like my ancestors came back and slept this [ __ ] out of me for every wrong thing I just did what the [ __ ] gotta take this drink of this Depot ooh oh man let's take another three-second hit again [Music] so I mess up with this heavy and this is a hybrid - I'm messing with this heavy heavy but you guys already know always give you guys a 15 minute prelude to tell you guys the effects so that's what I'm gonna do we don't take one more hit right now and at this I'm I'm a class back in with you guys and tell you guys the effects what's up I'm clocking back in with you guys you know I'm saying it's been more than this move 115 minutes actually made of this video already looked at it I didn't like it so let's do our ratings taste I don't know if it has anything to do with the fact that I don't have like actual gelato tastes but I will say one out of five which is gonna be a ruby it's definitely only a three at the highest three entire three second we're gonna get to the color really nice color [Music] [Music] nice honey-colored so I would give that a fire of course and last but not least it's actually a really good balance of a hybrid - this is so for that I would definitely campaign so thank you for staying tuned for everyone that stayed tuned for this home time video and watch this video I appreciate you guys tenfold it's been hard to get a lot of these premium products that you see me getting now but I'm trying hard for you - I'm really trying hard you know I'm saying I get a lot of negativity and I'm not ever gonna respond to it I'm sorry because there's a lot of things people don't know what's going on in my life one time one last thing you find me this is the team hippie she's all team hippies and I'm appreciated all your team hippies and supporters has been going up and beyond for your boy so thank you to all my hippies thank you to all my hippies older keep me up on my social for anything if you guys ever want to see when something's coming out beforehand snapchat and I will see you guys later so I just want to thank everyone for tuning in like comment and subscribe and peace Oh", "sU8lInunbZU": "yo yo yo guys what is going on we were back for a third video in a row told you guys I'm back I'm not going anywhere who should I keep grinding this out first things first again thank you guys we had a thousand four hundred and something subscribers or something like that so I'm crazy still working out sponsorship stuff like that some dumb stuff but uh ya know it's all in the works it's all the works uh yeah other than that I just want to say thank you guys you guys are awesome but yeah so it's for today's car I have two different ones I don't know which one I wanna give to you guys or review for you guys this one cuz it's late at night so we'll do the end because so we could sleep on right so this one right here there's a sticker on it but it says key relief um there's a couple states that actually have this dispensary Arizona I think Wisconsin somewhere back east I think they're pretty popular back east yeah there's like four or five in Arizona for cure leaves and this is their in-house carts so I think they think normally they run 25 or $30 a piece no I'm sorry they're $30 a piece for these parts they're half gram $30 right and today they were running a deal not gonna show you this one oh no that's this one I want to show you that one so I got two of them for the price of one so I got two for 30 years or one for 15 basically that being said let's go ahead and I mean let me read this out real quick oh I didn't even tell you guys the strain this one the strain is called rainbow Jones I've never heard of that scream if you guys have let me know this is coming at d 9 t HC % is eighty two point five six so not super high the THC percent isn't posted on here or THC a percent I'm sorry well other than that I guess let's pop or open and start reviewing it mmm comes without you know your standard little boxes with your little corner in them she can keep the carton it comes in this little tube too I've noticed that a lot more courts are coming in Dube to do basically for whatever reason I don't mind it though it's nice it's never bad to have a couple extra Dube tube saying you know I mean so my first impression it's kind of sticky on the outside so I don't know if it's leaking or not I hope not could just be the metal and stuff just like the finishes but sup it's actually really nice looking card guys right here so on the front there you got the little leaf logo right that's the airs and then you got that key relief writing frame wow that's it this is a really gorgeous looking card not even gonna lie I don't think I've ever been turned on by a car but this one comes with your standard little rubber stopper on the bottom I don't have any nails tell my nails so it's just dancing alright so you guys go see the wax like like a good weed to be reviewing it's not focusing of course cuz I have a phone but you know no bubble though not the biggest fan of it not the biggest fan the other one has that too all half-korean cards have them usually full grams are a little bit better but yeah this oil looks gorgeous though super thick it's not running no bubbles except for that one gorgeous like gold color to it so it's go ahead and pop it on the good old booze battery I don't know where my only one is and it won't charge for some reasons so we're just gonna stick it with this one alright guys first hit of the night guys Cheers okay well okay okay so the only flavor you get out of that excuse me hydration break wow man I don't really get yourself going man well that was a great hit um oh so first impressions off that first one big fan I highly recommend it already but we'll keep going with the review you know if you want to stick it out and you know keep looking hmm then he said hydration brakeman oh well some yeah this car is pretty dang nice this is an indica so hopefully slumped me out a little bit I'm gonna go watch a horror movie or something after this chill relax that's distress that trip hi his funky some toasty nose you already muggy let me gonna let me know what you guys favorite uh like food or snack and beverage so give me like one food item edible item and one beverage right to eat and drink when you're stoned or just smoking or hot boxing or just any situation what your high right what are your go to edible items that are non marijuana you [ __ ] drug addicts yeah I was talking about edibles no no so now marijuana have food or drinks not marijuana world there's THC drinks you know yeah a little zoink you guys let's do it all Cheers it's a great hit from the thin by the way that is a solid asset real well for $30 for two of them I'm not usually guys $30 for two of them is not a bad deal at oh wow I think okay except for like first time patient deals and like that that one video I did were it was like I got four cards for like 24 dollars or something like that besides those like really crazy deals like the wild wild ones like that one for for 424 so it came out six bucks a card this is the cheapest I've ever got a card like a real dispensary card because $15 for a half gram some of you guys live it up in like Michigan and [ __ ] isn't Michigan I don't remember who just legalize weed for the like me I cannot figure it out at all but um I heard somebody told me like half gram carts there we're going for like 60 55 $60 or some [ __ ] like that dude I love marijuana but I cannot spend that much on weed so getting carts that are 15 dollars for a half gram so probably like 30 $40 for a full gram would be insane and so many people would have some more access to it and hopefully one day we can get that figured out maybe I mean concentrate like dabs and stuff that's not that bad I mean flour is pretty pricey you can get yeah it depends depends on your tears but you know there's a lot of variables of course but I don't know I hope one day they forgot a way to maybe if it becomes federally legal they'll be able to lower the prices because they're a little high yeah um I also want to know if you're still here what is your favorite brand of Kart or like if you don't have like a favorite brand like what's your favorite strain like across across the board for all the brands um I don't have favorite strain to be honest I make these reviews and I review these cards just to tell you how they are and then I just completely forget so that's something alright let's do number three oh that reminded me of my girlfriend Leslie you should kept doing this to me I don't know why anyway guys I am I'm really I um if you live in any state that has a key relief dispensary that's uh oh so that's these guys right here hey they're key relief I'm just so [ __ ] stupid that's your logo that doesn't even say their name I am so sorry and I gotta grab my iPod so rate purely great store they're running pretty great deals um you get 20 area for every twenty dollars you spend you had a dollar back so that's pretty cool so I got eight dollars off for these things I spent like [ __ ] 26 bucks for two close what's can't go wrong all right well fair shot ask you your [ __ ] dope you're better than all the other people Logan see you on the next one deuces", "NYweYsi0x2E": "everyone Pope all's well so recently there's been some negativity when it comes to vaping and buying carts off the black market knowing what you inhale into your body should be priority number one and when stepping into the realm of vaping you don't want to inhale something that's gonna harm you long term so today we want to put an end to all the pleasures out there regarding bad practice and to truly answer the question what is a fake oil cartridge and how to avoid [Music] they coil cards go beyond branding and counterfeit boxes the number one question you should be asking yourself is where am i buying my cards from most reputable companies have authorized retail stores that are allowed to sell their cartridges if you're buying from anywhere other than licensed reputable companies or their authorized retailers nine times out of ten it's a fake and companies that are legit aren't gonna risk selling products to non-leap States eBay Amazon Alibaba are not where they experience weavers goaded by high quality oils sure you can compare your boxes to the boxes on the website but unless you buy from the right site you can still get it wrong also if you're buying oils on a budget you're gonna run into the same problem a big red flag is recognizable big-name brands at low prices let's face it if you paid bunk prices you're gonna pay for bunk oils but how do people get ahold of big name brands and if it's the same cart how can it be fake that brings us to fake cartridge answer number one fake oils take these sell cartridges for example defconn action calm says that all seasaw cards must have two logos a serial number and a transparent rubber ring at the bottom of the cart this cartridge is everything a vapor should look for but I know for a fact that the oil inside is fake meaning that nothing's tested and they let the name brand to sell the cartridge for them to me this is black market plus most cards and boxes can just be bought online and some people think that if cartridges and boxes look legit then there's nothing stopping people from putting their own formula inside plus cartridges can just be a replica and they use cheap metals unless you have somebody you trust a source who tests their oils you never really know what's in it from a normal customer standpoint so what could be in here was they can put synthetics in there like k2 which is a huge deal you shouldn't do that oil thickener or anything that you usually wouldn't see on the cartridge unless your oils are solvent free distillates which indicates that the substances are environmentally friendly with no des lunes then you're gonna run into terpenes in PG you want to limit the amount that's put into your oils both drippings and PG act as carrying agents to carry more flavors into your discipline because distillate itself doesn't really have much flavor and no PG does not cause formaldehyde companies only use these agents to give it their own unique formula and it may also indicate on the stickers the percentages that they use but not always think about as buying mid grade versus Private Reserve but you still don't know what a fake oil cartridge is so what's a fake oil cartridge okay so you got your cleaning lab all set up you got your formula lock down and now you're ready to start filling it up cartridges can you just use any cartridge no no you cannot in January this year of 2019 a new California State law was passed calls phase Reena saving that all California cartridges must be lab tested for heavy metals these tests are specifically for for metals cadmium arsenic mercury and lead and phase threes testings limit is 0.5 parts per million of lead allowed in your oils this is a big deal for vape cartridge producers because unless you have glass pores cartridges contain metal and sometimes the exact same cartridge will pass in one lab and fail in another causing producers to just bypass testing all together just to make a quick buck also the price of testing in a lab has gone up so people are cheating the system by avoiding it entirely so why the variation of testing there is no standardized testing procedures for each lab to follow this means that each lab extracts oil differently and if oil touches exposed brass then it may very well fail phase 3 testing so how to metal get inside of your oil cartridges well that's easy 99% of companies buy cartridges from overseas which allow up to 4% of your oils to be made up of lead which is much higher tooth into what phase 3 wants and unless you're on top of your menu this could be a problem let an arsenic is added to metals like brass which help make metal easier to mold into cartridges and oil is acidic so it eats away at cheap metals allowing particles to be invaded into your body so stop giving people reasons to ban they don't become a victim of uncertainty unfortunately some companies don't want to know how the cartridge is made because they don't want to be how reliable and there's just too much money to be made not to get inside of the oil cartridge market we can't change state law or lab test procedures but we sure can certainly change babe cartridges there are companies out there that are responding to the issue companies like Herve pur have already started innovating carts that are guaranteed to pass phase three testing and multiple facilities and are currently leaving the market who completely lead-free cartridges that vetted testing facilities in California that know how to properly test for phase three requirements the next generation of VAP cartridges might be hidden stores in winter time this year but keep in mind that cartridges made before January 1st 2018 are still allowed to be sold and could still be in circulation and states like Washington and have passed similar laws only allowing 0.7 parts per million so be aware of your state's requirements I know it seems like a lot but now you're in the know and knowing is half the battle so please no more black market cards we hope this video was helpful to you guys let us know what you'd like to see in the next video where do you buy your loyal cards did you know that metal could be in it as always don't forget to subscribe and like and we'll see you next time face", "nkLla_V-vmA": "[Music] what's up I simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title already we got that buddies let's just do a quick little thumbnail hopefully it's good I know you guys have been requesting for me to try the buddies cartridge for a while now and I finally located one in my local dispensary I actually picked this up at a dispensary that I've never been to before well that's a lie because it's a franchise there's actually another one that I've been to with the same name but I haven't been to the newer store which is located on McHenry and yeah I mean it's called people's remedy as you can see right here you see the little QR code all that stuff and I bought this for 43 bucks originally priced at 37 but you know tax and all that stuff so $43 for our gram cartridge not too bad but yeah I'm excited the image up here it kind of looks like the Select cartridge the same cartridge so yeah should be pretty interesting it says seventy-three point zero six percent THC and as you know buddies they like to show their terpene profile as well which is so dope I feel like a lot more companies should do this because terpenes have individual effects and it's good to know what's in what you're smoking like there's probably other stuff that they can mention on the label that's in there that that companies don't even so or maybe they don't even have terpenes in them you know so as you can see it says a pioneer four point six one beam murder scene four point four eight and then beep I mean one point something and this is the string and lucid blue guys buddies and it is a sativa so it should get me getting me to wake up you know I'm saying so we're gonna open this is I'm gonna take good care of the box so never [ __ ] it ripped off the stick little lever to pull out okay Wow okay even has the buddies logo in there noise yep same type as select [Music] very very thick this is liquid diamond sauce liquid diamonds live resin boys so not the best smell like this citrus we're gonna be using my chill battery for this one very very good battery it's a good truck alright buddy Cheers it's a it's dark it's what what ten what you tend to see when you get a live resin in your cartridges other than raw garden I don't know how they get there so light but you know if it's their secret they're gonna keep it to the grave with them but as you notice just like the Ursa this one's very very dark just like that not as dark as the Ursa so I'm interested to see how this is gonna taste so Cheers [Music] Wow not gonna lie that did taste pretty [ __ ] amazing things I've noticed not as Turkey it could be the strain it's not as chirpy as the strain that or is it used but it's not as chirpy but still really really good and for $10 cheaper you really can't complain about that it's just minuscule you know it's still um when I'm saying it's Lester P that means like just a little bit you know I'm saying I'm not saying that it's like one level down or anything but this is pretty [ __ ] good I'm not gonna lie you know I bought this myself so this is not in a way like a paid review or anything I bought the Ursa one as well and Wow if I had to choose which one to get no I can't take another hit oh the cloud production is there ooh the taste is there ooh the potency is there holy [ __ ] that [ __ ] really hits so just like the Select cartridges it just hits just like that it hits just as hard as the select cartridges I would say it's a lot better in taste than the Select cartridges because the select cartridges all taste the same to me this one although I haven't tried other strains I'm sure they taste according to string and not just some generic co2 distillate tasting oil but and I'm liking it I'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and yeah this I'm probably gonna enjoy this behind-the-scenes you know I am Cheers maybe I'll do a blinker for you [ __ ] it I don't know how with this shirt off time for this is but [ __ ] it I feel like this buddy's cartridge hits harder than the earth cartridge but the Ursa one tastes a lot better and I feel like they just switch those two around it's like vice versa you know this one the taste is a little bit less but the clouds are a little bit more what the Ursa it's the clouds are a little bit less but the taste is a lot more there but overall pretty good you know this is only ten dollars cheaper than the Ursa cartridge which is pretty [ __ ] good in my opinion yeah I don't know I think I got to do like another top five cartridges of two or just top a top five cartridge list you know I really like I'm sorry like I haven't been getting too much cartridges lately it's just that most of them are a pretty pricey and I have a wax pen and usually just a grandma wax just will last longer to me than me having this at my disposal cuz I'm gonna just be [ __ ] hitting the [ __ ] out of it you know like if it's there it's there you know it just makes me want to hit it hopefully you guys enjoyed this video would I get another buddy's cartridge yeah definitely like I have nothing but good things to say about this other than maybe like the Select cartridge being like a plastic mouthpiece you know maybe a ceramic one would be better maybe I'm just spoiled from the earth one who knows you know but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video peace out [Music]", "7KDXXoIL28Y": "[Music] what's going on guys my name is Jeff Austin is popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys are smoking with net let me know what videos you want

"what is going on guys it's your boy 7g back at it again with another review for us so for today's review guys we're just gonna hop straight into it man we know we haven't done a review and so long I've been kind of trying to like you know since its first of all it's the end of the year so there's not really too many other cartridges to try out and plus I am if you guys didn't know trying to evolve my content I'm not only doing cartridge reviews anymore because I kind of want it I want to do more you know I want to do more stuff so that's why I've been expanding so I've been doing a lot more collabs and more hablok sessions a lot of [ __ ] that normally wouldn't you do right but I do miss those reviews man I do definitely miss doing reviews because I don't know I feel like since that's my thing that's my thing there's there's so many people out there that tell me what like you're you're the originator of the car reviews brother like I've been watching you you're the first one to with your car because I was like I mean I didn't say the people said it man I'm kind of happy you know that people kind of know me for that because you know that's that is where I started technically some reviewing cartridges and I'm kind of I'm so happy that you know I built I built this platform from literally just reviewing cartridges but like this thing is pretty amazing he's pretty amazing so it's getting straight into the room you guys today we got a special call I have a special collab man I've been waiting to review this for the channel for so long and if I was able to go out and comp a couple of these because these are not easy to find man these are not easy to find anywhere if you're in California if you're over the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal state and you just have this make sure you guys try it man because honestly it's pretty crazy so happening - they're so friendly farms cool friendly farms X alien lab - Cola this is the area 41 hybrid and then I've I've already achieved if you guys haven't watched my top 5 cards of 2019 that video is up in that video will be down in the description below but yeah like I said I cut I copped a couple of these and I already like I literally just started chipping around this this is by far one of my favorite cartoons you know just because the taste is phenomenal everything about this cartoon is phenomenal and all right so like I said I'm gonna slap it on here when you guys get it you guys are gonna get the black tip with a little alien engraving in it and full spectrum you already know the oils gonna be a little bit darker no need to worry though full spectrum if you guys don't already know what it is pretty much you're getting every single spectrum of the cannabis plant from the taste to the feel to every pretty much everything row all inside of a pen so that's pretty amazing so I know a lot of you like to see the packaging and stuff so let me go ahead and give you guys a little closer the close-up look honestly dude friendly farms is doing some sick-ass things with with their packaging because mostly all their packaging looks like this but this alien labs co-op specifically is pretty damn sick dude I'm not gonna lie this alien labs co-op box is pretty unique dude honestly in in terms of artwork it's pretty sick it's pretty sick alright now that you guys saw the close-up of that man let's get to chief and boys I'm pretty much in this review we're gonna be media as the full taste test with a full body effects high head effects all that stuff what I like about it what I don't like about it what I wish they would have done all that good stuff you guys already know how we get down with the review guys so I'm excited man I'm excited like honestly this is this is so this is a whole different type of cartridge like honestly the taste in this is such unexplicable like insane it's insane like I've never tasted anything like this so give me you guys the full rundown on this review so area 41 alien labs ex-friend firms let's get it cheers guys and by the way if you guys do end up copying the proprietary battery from the feliforms I do recommend using a green setting anything higher than that which is I believe like the orange setting it's too hot it's too hot you're burning it too much you're wasting your oil it's always good to get such a little a little lower temp but obviously you're still going to get the clock so cheers guys if you guys are over the age of 18 21 whatever it is in your legal state I don't want any little underage kids in our that stuff in here you know we can't even enjoy it so choose [Music] so tasty bro all right so that my battery literally just died after that second hit back with that first hit so if you guys didn't see too much of clouds it was because that my the battery is dead so when also that brings up to another topic if when you use it as battery I do recommend charging all the way because it makes such a difference man that hits our way Milky Way flatter when it's fully charged compared to when it's obviously low and low and battery so let's go ahead and test hopefully this is fully charged simple choosers you could definitely tell when it's fully charged man the hit is just so much more strong I dude I'm telling you alright if I had it compared I know I said that the taste is not it's very very distinct you know I can't really compare it to anything but if I had to compare to something it has to be fall under like the lines of the cannabis drive terpenes from Suzy like those pods are so Turkey and so flavorful and when you hit them they're just so gassy and you honestly only taste like the straight-up but dude you just just trade it like straight bud no no preservatives no additives into that [ __ ] whoo shout to hydro hydro flaps if he has her oh geez on the challenge guys know I've been having this thing since day one right so uh for that first first two second initial hit you know right off the bat I feel my eyes getting heavy and that's that that has a lot to say dude because those two hits were very very very small in terms of the vapor products that you know yeah so for it to have that much packing so it's such a little hit it's pretty crazy so and the taste like I said super gassy super Turkey you don't taste no oil as it doesn't taste boilie and all I can like dis lids they usually do and it's something that you want to keep on hitting honestly and something's just so distinct that you're like hmm well you just want to keep tasting it because you've never tasted it before so cheers guys let's go in for another hit and then right away you want to enter your lungs they're like the longest benches instant dude it instantly guy I want to coughing so and on that exhale I'm getting like a little like some undertones of you know how like when you take like a pretty wanna temp tab you get those little it's taste like Turkey dude it tastes like turkey warm Turks in there you know and it just like fills up and lingers in your mouth and it's like cow like like like if you just baked some lie president you feel me like not not not cooked it bake it it you know when you bake something you get that aroma you get that full flavor taste that's kind of like what like you know baking out here boys I know I don't know if that makes any sense but you know making up new terms every day so when you go in on another one man because this thing is phenomenal I can't get off of it so even what I know I said let's not go to higher setting but I just want to see I just want to see how it compares on this cartridge so choose oh yeah that is what that is definitely way too hot like it tastes a little bit more burn so than anything not even burnt but a little bit too hot in my opinion like a hot attempt ugh I like those little lower temp ones and honestly man I know I keep saying dab and this is a pimp but this pen literally makes you feel like you're taking a DAB and the funny thing is I've tasted their full spectrum salt and it's literally it tastes exactly similarly super super similar like this taste that this taste that friendly firm produces is very very unlike be replicable and like it's kind of like like just just straight-up fire dude I don't know how to explain it like the taste like I keep trying to like bring out what the what the pinpoint tastes this but I just can't I just can't mmm so like I said the hi man I'm definitely feeling it more drawn my head than I am my body and then again it we've only been pinning in for like five to seven minutes so I'm pretty sure the longer I wait the more I'll feel their effects and it's a good smoke man it's a good smoke definitely you know and something's so exotic this isn't something gonna be picking up on the regular man definitely not getting picking up gonna be picking this up on a regular bed because the price there the price range is a little bit more up there you feel me compared to other cartridges that's why a lot of people don't really mess with with filming phones because they go into the shot they see the prices and then they're like the bounce I'll go to rock garden whatever whatever the lower end price is you know so but if you guys are in the market you know got a little bit extra money that you know is there the Christmas and maybe you guys got some extra Christmas money and you guys are in the looks for new cartridge alien laps X from the forums definitely check them out so we're gonna end this review out here guys I know it's it feels a little bit different reviewing this time I don't know what it is I just maybe I'm falling out of the reviews you know I feel like a lot of people have been coming out of cartridges so there's not there hasn't really been a lot of search for a new cartridge reason I feel like the time that I got into it was perfect because I was when cartridges were popping you know I got my I got my people and I got my viewers locked down you know things like that I think it's time to now progress on to the next thing which is you know going out session event doing big big whole lives with bigger people mr. TC you has seen that collab with Edwin sparks you guys having go ahead and go check that I'll put that description below and you know which is we're just working man we're just working we're just we're still trying to find ourselves in this little wee tube thing because I wanna say this is still as a hobby I'm not taking this thing too serious and I don't plan on taking it too serious because honestly I have bigger things to myself and then just only YouTube if you me I got way big things I hope hopefully you guys get to see those things I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be able to bring them to

London pound cake right here so we're gonna hop straight into this and while we're smoking I'm gonna be talking because there are some fake products that have been coming out supposedly cookies but this is a real deal man right here I'm gonna show you guys so you get the box out get the box out high flyers get the little thing out getting a little too bright see little cookies logo right there it's a little white tube got a little piece on the bottom holding it together as you guys can see right there London pound cake hopefully there's a verified cookie sticker right there at the back and then right here on the side you got pretty much everything you need to know I'm not sure that's gonna focus up or not right right there should focus at London poundcake total THC eighty point nine no cannabinoids I'm a no CBD and then it was its best by 11 to 19 so yeah toss that huh pull up the cartridge real quick show you guys the oil how it's looking there's a little logo right there cookies logo so they only sleeve a really really small air bubble right there it's really small and then it's filled to the brim which is a plus you know definitely when you want to be when you're spending crazy amounts like this you're gonna want little to no air bubbles so just to show you guys how to cyllage it here's a receipt at cookies right there it's probably not gonna [ __ ] it up but all right there Londyn pound cake let's get it you already know what's up and we're back to the video so let's get to this review man I'm so excited to be trying this [ __ ] set this off to the side if you got it and by the way if you guys like this new little setup right here I got a couch in my my work room so it makes it a lot more easier to make videos in here too so take off the plastic pieces pop the little bottom off has a little cookies engraved right there and then be like Jimmy Jam that dad man dude let me see you [ __ ] get any prominent flavors I'm not talking [ __ ] I'm just saying that's what he does but I don't really get any flavors I'm not sure like if that even works or not but it smells like very very dang let me get my raw garden battery out real quick and then I'm excited yeah I'm over here shaking but so let's get to it boys the cookies sitting nice and flush on the raw garden they actually used the same batteries cookies it's same C cell rebrand m3 and this one is so I'm excited man first impressions right here if you guys are 18 over 21 and over make sure you guys smoking along with I was going to say it hit that like comments up but it's not even that part of the video so go ahead and let me know what you're smoking or some cookies if you guys ever tried real cookies let me know so this is London pound cake in their high flyers cartridge so Cheers whoa there's not what I was expecting that at all who aren't that initial hit was literally straight up like gas like if someone opened a valve a [ __ ] propane just filled my mouth and that was out guess it was mmm whoo that's a very very nice flavor though I'm not gonna lie this is different way different than what I'm used to so bro holy Wow there's lemon pound cake is straight dude like it's literally tastes like gas in that second hey I got gas and mixed in with a little bit of um like orange let me just take another hit I'm gonna put this on the bat my battery it's also just all you do is just screw the bottom on the wrong side screw the bottom on if you guys don't have a battery like the raw garden one can just coo a little very very small and then just rip away a little lights gonna appear here in the bottom yeah dude that the very gassy oh no honey get some water yeah I can't keep coughing like this is too much for the video so so far oh that head changes starting to kick in after three little three to four little hits the head changes definitely starting to come in I barely got a very very small little air bubble coming up right there so that's gonna put a little dent in this and I'm not really feeling this big-ass battery I'm gonna switch it back to the raw garden because I feel like it gives you more flavourful of it and you guys aren't gonna be seen that it was battery in this video because I forgot to charge it my fault my fault I decided to not charge the best battery I could possibly have for right now so oh yeah like I was saying fake cookies cartridges man so some dude for my work if you're watching this bro he told me he's all oh yeah this weekend at a party I picked up with cookies cartridge I was like oh you need to bring this thing to work let me hit that like and then um he told me he told me I remember looking at watching a fake cookies cartridge video and then I asked him I was like a bro like what was the what was the cartridge like like what was the insides like he told me that the insides were plastic they're like it's a little plastic piece that kind you get cheap from very very cheap cartridges that holds it you don't get that little cylinder tube and then the outside is just like all white it's like a really really big all white in blue box and it says cookies on it and it's nothing like the original box like literally nothing like the original box it doesn't say high-fliers it doesn't have fists on the bottom it doesn't have the testing on the bottom and it definitely doesn't have the little certified cookie sticker on the bottom so I was like yeah bro it's kind of I doubt you got a real one but you know whatever's he said he got I'm faded I feel like everyone everything gets everyone no it is you this is like a very very like oh I'm getting that little poundcake taste in the back now maybe I just had to wake up the coil when you hit this a couple more times get that full effect whoo-hoo that that gasps like it lingers in the back of your throat and yeah this is definitely a government I'm kind of I'm very very glad I caught this like it's either you guys could see I spent one hundred and ten dollars 115 dollars on literally just bud and a cartridge but the thing is like the quality of the product that cookies provides is definitely worth it you know like I could get another booth cartridge like a 55 for a full gram and then it's it's gonna get me hot but it's not gonna get me as high as this and the flavor is not going to be as good as this you know things like that and with the raw garden um you know for example raw garden the after text as they come out to like 45 a half to 250 dollars a half so you you like P works that your period of time and why don't you just cover all garden it's similar price it's actually not similar price because you still from raw garden sells to only licensed dispensaries and then licensed dispensaries tax you of so much dude it's insane I don't even want to talk about that she's gonna give me a mint so I'm gonna take another hit off this man where he's gonna keep ripping and see if we get any more flavors and turps you know turps that's actually something we need to point out let's see what the turkeys are about mmm you bet very very chirpy it's not like overpowering like a garden it kinda reminds me of Le cush I'm not gonna live kind of reminds me of them the le cush disel it for sure and but this one this is just like super gassy the Le cush had like more of like a like a I had like a filler you could tell like the last one that I got it tasted like strawberries it's not supposed to taste like strawberries I mean but this I feel like if I were to go out and buy London pound cake right now roll it up in that in some elements rolling papers smokey I'd probably get the same exact taste and this is burners favorite smoke right now he said I think it's London pound cake cereal milk cheetah piss like but those aren't even out yet like cereal milk actually sir I'm oh just drop today I was gonna cop that but when I saw that it was like $70 and 80 I was just like I just I just shift my head but I was just alright never mind I was like give me give me some of that that sherbert octane man yeah all right so we're going it to the review of this video part of the video and the word you keep talking and the video eventually so alright so far I don't like how the freaking oil isn't going up to the top that usually with cartridges they should go up automatically but when there are some cartridges like West Coast care for example it does the same exact thing where the oils somewhat gets stuck and then it's just stuck then you have a big gaping hole right there hopefully that's not the case of this hopefully I just had to keep in here so flavorful mmm um I need a copy London town Kate like the bud a sub that might be the next cup [Laughter] rolled it up in a nice little Jaynes market way up again into the video I mean the review the Terps I would rate them a good seven out of ten it's not to Turkey but the Turks are definitely there you get a nice flavorful tur penis in the back of your throat the flavor wise gasps this is like no other flavor that I've ever tasted I can see why Berner likes London pound cake I never seen anybody else review london pound cake so i'm probably to be one of the first people on youtube at least to say this thing is pretty freakin good man pretty freakin good and then but I do like if I had to describe what the flavor it is I can like I really can't describe it I would have to just say like it's kind of like a gassy taste obviously like the gas you get from wheat but a very very high gassy taste you're not getting too many notes of like fruity things like that you get a very very slight taste of like like Patna pound cake like if you guys ever been to the gas stations and seen those little those little bar bar pound cakes the ones that are really really thick kind of tastes kind of like that and it's good it's a very very subtle though it's not it's not in your face so that's a very upside that it tastes more like weed than it does then it tastes like artificial mists and fillers and things like that and the hi I'm I'm pretty stun I'm Paige stone this isn't my first height of the day and I'm trying to regulate my high right now I'm trying to only limit myself to you things like that so the height is definitely 8 out of 10 it's not getting me too high I'm pretty sure if I keep hitting you know [ __ ] you kill me but you know we're not gonna we're probably gonna take one more trip for the boys so yeah definitely overall product I'm the price point is probably the only downside but then again you're paying for good quality stuff you know like this isn't something that you can get just anywhere in the world it's only just one section of the United States you know one part and that's kind of what makes it valuable this is very very exotic and it's not like anyone could go out and buy this and not everyone will go out and buy this even if they if it was disposable like you know right around the corner from them like people always are gonna go for the cheaper price and it's always good to just have a good smoke you know that's one thing that I've been trying to do with myself like instead of just smoking like mid mid mid like price [ __ ] and smoking it all day just limp and then just ruining your tolerance ruining the overall experience just go out buy something like this just take a hit in the morning take a hit in the afternoon take a hit at night that's three times you take two or three hits you'll conserve it like no doubt and you'll be smoking good [ __ ] so you take another hit probably in the video and you guys know the deal super gas by far I'm gonna have to make a top 5 distillate card soon or just cartridges in general if you everyone see that let me know and we're gonna end the video here go ahead and follow me on my answer here I'm at backwe daddy turn on the post notifications on this YouTube channel because I'm gonna be posting vlogs which is something different I'm gonna be trying to put them a lot more effort and going into those because I don't want to just stick to reviews and just you know the normal in the car stuff I want you I want to be able to show you guys in my life and show you guys a little little parts of my life not the full of things but you know show you guys things that you know I would see in my daily life like smokes and things like that so yeah if you guys enjoyed the video go ahead and hit that like comment and sub and then were see you guys later", "8AOPeuZwq8w": "[Music] what up what up everybody it's your boy deuce once again today before I start this video I just want to say thank you to everyone who is still continuing to watch the channel be sure to keep spreading the love you know tell a friend to tell a friend like I said before wiser Minds television the channel will only get better for everybody who's sticking with me and still watching I'd like to welcome you guys to my wiser Minds familywize your mind swag game yeah y'all my brainiacs man I'm real thankful to everybody who's been rockin with me so I just thought I'd get that out the way before I start today in this video it's gonna be another segment of Kronik chronicles but I'm gonna be reviewing another vape cartridge um this as you can see if you can't see this is a full gram cartridge not the half gram this is by heavy hitters let's not really focus in too well but this is about heavy hitters this is a hybrid not sure if you can see it still okay I tried and didn't work but yeah this is a hybrid strain and I'm gonna try using this battery that I have here my blue battery um it's cool because now like the club everything that you guys get it's all childproof so you don't have to pay for the bags and stuff like you did at the beginning of January and this one here you just the same as the Select cartridges they have like a little thing you push in on the side this one you just push in the little back part there you go and now it lets you you know open it but if you don't you're not gonna be able to pop this top off well yeah man late I know that let me know um this which you can also look on the back it tells you the percentages and everything I'll read them off to you guys because I'm not getting this to focus too well THC as you know that's what gets you high that is weighing in at eighty four point two percent and it does have a little CBD also thus for more it's more of the medicine i'ma try to pop this top off oh it's pretty easy it's like you unfold the top and then pop it up and this one comes with a little block at the top oh you can use this as a mouthpiece so I'm gonna do that because usually like when you put on your lip chap and stuff like that when you go to hit these like you can get it all over the silver part and the cleaner just looks like a little foggy and you don't you you want to have like a clean little P little technical you know a pin but yeah man this is the cartridge as the look have you hit her symbol there sorry you guys can't see I'll try to get better at focusing in on things but I know they let me know this is a cross between Girl Scout cookies and some Oh Oh Girl Scout I believe is Girl Scout cookies and cherry pie but matter of fact I got my phone so I could go in and actually see for sure but yeah they they know that like I'm at the club I'm a I'm a heavy indica type guy and I do mess with the sativas in hybrids but mainly indicas and they let me know always like what what a new strain I always ask about new strains I ask about new things and they just let me know that this was crossed with you know something pretty good earlier once they told me what it was crossing with I'm like oh yeah you you saw me already plus I've heard like I said of wedding cake before in this stream but umm if you guys need any information like you can go anywhere type in on Google um and find out about different strains but I like to use Leafly it gives you like a lot of information pictures everything let you know how this train is gonna make you feel everything oh here's wedding cake alright so it has 4.6 stars out of 5 198 reviews and oh this this strain is also known as pee cookies all right so it's cross like I said is Girl Scout cookies and cherry pie so this is fire some fire I'm pretty excited to go ahead and get this warmed up if you guys are watching this video and you got something um go ahead and spark up with pin blunt drink bong boughs whatever go ahead man if you're 18 up 18 and up and spark up with me y'all cheers let's see what this does [Music] I'm very very big his like I told you guys before in the Select review these pins I love them because they give you a whoa they give you a big hit and the reason like I said I smoke backwards and sometimes I like that you know that that hit that kind of cave your chest in like you know because sometimes I don't know I don't I don't I like coughing when I slow they say you're not smoking if you're not choking and a lot of people be like oh you you a sucker you a nerd for choking on the Wii but Brooke come on now let let me enjoy myself and medicate you feel me like come on brah that's how everybody be like when you be doing really all this man got the baby lungs shut up Rob can you fill me up living out here I'm doing me but leave me alone let me be but anyway man yeah I feel like with these pigs with this specific one here heavy it I know I noticed you see I'm still coughing off of that just that hit I noticed this makes me kind of feel later on like after I smoke it for a while it makes me feel like I took a DAB or something in a lot of people like that about depends I I mean I do I just like experiencing different things with the Pens on like always let my body get used to the same thing I like to try to you know like I said experience new things meaning why not but ya may not let it taste of this um it has some a similar taste um of it was a pink pushpin that I got it wasn't pink cookies like they said in that description so you know it was different it might have been crossed with the same thing or something but our you know it could have been in the same family not sure exactly what it was crossed with but it does have a similar taste not sure if it's just their oil but but the oil in the cartridge does taste really good like it doesn't have that wick taste doesn't have that burnt taste none of that like this just tastes straight like flour it tastes like medicine and man I'm telling you this is the best thing for when you want to go the half grams now they're going for about like I said in the last video you could walk out what about $35 depending on how the tax is in your area the tax here right now is horrible but um I walk out sometimes paying about $40 honestly for a cartridge but the cartridges last you a long time I like to medicate a lot but at the same time I don't I don't try to try to outdo myself like everyone does just just to be like oh I'm the highest like you feel me i medicate to a certain extent once I feel like I'm fine I'm fine I don't try to overdo it and do too much cuz you know I even got you know some people that I used to hang with like a lot of people I used to hang well always used to be like oh brother you can spark up another spark another and don't get me wrong it's nothing wrong with token up you feel me if but if I got something to do and I got to be on the move I'm not trying to be just stupid stupid lit to where I can't dang near function I don't want people to think like oh he just smokes just to just to smoke cuz I really smoked to Medicare I'm not trying to complain and do too much but I got a lot of problems with bones that I've broken and things you know that ain't right so I like to medicate and I don't like taking the medicine that they give give me the pain pills the narcos and all that when I was young I experienced experience might have my experiences with those and man I don't like it a lot of the medicines have a lot of side effects I'm I've gained a lot of weight taking different medicines and I just feel like hey the flour is the right thing for me like it helps it's been helping all this time and now it's legal so I'm glad like that my family is kind of more like open about it and is like adapt into it because I first like when they found out about me smoking before you know they were they then was curious they just really didn't want me to get nothing that was laced oh really which you could understand that I mean everyone everyone's parents our elders will feel like that they don't want you to you know go down the wrong path period so I understand now but it is it's cool to see how things have changed it's just you still have to know what you're getting because a lot of people are putting a lot of additives and things that you don't need like just let the medicine be we do not need all the additives and things like you know that's killing you why but anyway man like I really really cannabis is for me cannabis is for me and I feel like everyone that I connect with I mean we do connect through cannabis like that that's how others feel also I'm not the only one who feels like that it's just I've had my like I said my experiences with the drinking when I was young I don't like drinking like the drinking brings day you know it brings the devil out of me you know I get real rowdy real real sick and yeah man I'm like that I end up blacking out stuff like that edibles my word saved that for another video but edibles is also my thing in moderation I'm depending on you know the the milligram of milligram count or how many milligrams are any thing I have to switch the battery just because I'm not sure if this one is dying but um it stop stop heating up what I like to do I wasn't doing it at first but I like to hit the button and hit it for about five seconds and let it heat up so you know you get that good hit and you don't gotta just you know keep holding it for a long time and in hitting it because sometimes it you know this this part of the battery will heat up and you don't want it to overheat they say like once you do take a hit let it um let it let it breathe for a minute just to you know kind of cool back down you don't want these batteries overheating it or anything because you don't have to just go waste your money and get another one or you either you just wasted your money on the cartridge you're gonna be that type of person like oh [ __ ] that I don't even want to go and get one cuz I know that's how I am a lot of the time I'd be like [ __ ] told you can walk this no more I know I probably won't you'll see some videos of me smoking um but I won't be smoking too much because those videos I have to set an age restriction and I'll age restriction and I want everybody to be able to look at the videos you know I don't want it to be restricted to anyone so you probably see me vaping more doing vape reviews and things like that more than burning up the flower but I mean you're still gonna see me reviewing flower just because you know why would it not but yeah it's just gonna be a variety you'll see me like more on camera smoking my opinion just because you know that's not you know it's not a against YouTube some restrictions and things are there guidelines well yeah man continue to like comment continue

"MF3_LCwzHd8": "I don't want to get too morbid in the beginning of this video but how is it that CNN is telling us that the death toll for kovat is gonna [ __ ] skyrocket but in the same breath say that California is gonna be open up by May 18 [ __ ] is going on I mean you want to talk about sus a suspect what they doing in the White House right now I don't know what the [ __ ] is y'all what up in shabari for [ __ ] rude man well to the site on this beautiful Saturday morning what I'm kickin it and I know for a friend the fact that you guys are kicking it make sure like comment subscribe you over the age of 21 if you're not over the age of 21 I'm as politely for the fifth hundreds and seven time exactly to get the [ __ ] off the page that's it I'm not asking for too much let's get it so yes like I said if you enjoy the content if you like what I'm providing make sure like comment subscribe there's something that you want me to smoke if there's something you want me to try out let me know I'm here at your disposal let's get it so luckily around 4:20 I had won $420 from ease ease is a cannabis delivery service in Southern California whose menu is kind of trash I'm not even going front especially for my area if you type in like a long beach or an x of code you're gonna have everything you want on Eve if your app if you're where I am ease is not the way I'm not even gonna front when I was on ease I did see a couple things that stuck out to me number one heavy hitters heavy hit sucker heavy hitters pineapple express cold filtered high posts and cannabis concentrate from heavy hitter labs are coming in at eighty nine point forty four percent total active cannabinoids eight hundred and fifty seven milligrams of THC two hundred point eight milligram CBD this was packaged for sixteen twenty twenty now when I had Saudis on ease I was like alright well I gotta get it because it's pineapple Express my favorite strand right now is pineapple express vape juice anywhere vape concentrate whatever favor one is pineapple Express from schism not even gonna front it's literally the dopest dope I've ever smoked but when I saw heavy hitters pineapple Express I was like I gotta do the one-on-one I have to see not that I have much of my pineapple Express from Suzy left I probably got maybe one good hit two good hits but it's enough to try to do a little bit of comparison for you guys and because you know what truthfully you know we don't really have much to tell us what's different about different oils to different companies I just want to know does the pineapple Express from heavy hitters tastes just as good as the pineapple Express from Stacie I dunno companies use their own little formula but we're just going off of whatever right now so let's just enjoy the moment let's go I hope you guys got your apparatus is out once you smoking wit me let's take this venture adventure together okay like I said he's not really you know they don't really have too much why man but I am grateful for them so make sure to go to East comm just to see what they got I mean you want to see what's on the menu just look it up and you know you'll be able to see what I'm saying is right if you're a tease or if you're working at ease hook a brother up and fix the menu a little bit thank you so yeah let's get into it oil looks really good now I'm gonna be honest with you that's not the reason why I haven't [ __ ] every hit is and I know a lot of you go to be legal dispensaries so don't be offended but the illegal dispensaries that I've went to the heavy hitters were always so sucks you know what I'm saying a little bit more than your average dizzy so I was just like you know if I'm gonna fake anything it's gonna be as dizzy you know I'm saying so I usually just bond with the stitches because they're 2530 dollars to where this would be like maybe an illegal dispensary forty five fifty as low as 40 but you don't want to cop this when it's 40 dollars bro you know I'm saying sometimes it's too good to be true so let me just shut the [ __ ] up and open this bad boy up this is a first for me which means it's probably a first for you so let's respect it as such all right so I'm gonna take this off at the bottom [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'll get that in mind then we get that bubble of air bubble Dan this is a big cart and it's heavy too and look at that Teen Mom look at that rise cloud oil liquid roll mine and it got the little California emblem it's it's small it's not distinctive enough you know what I'm saying it's not out there or it's not a sticker so I'm not gonna front that got a little bit more taste than this dizzy first wins first play I mean that first taste first try all right so I hope you guys got your [ __ ] out man cuz I'm trying to smoke I'm trying to smoke this [ __ ] so let's take this wild ride together this little adventure and a little 510 thread nothing crazy I mean and I charged the [ __ ] today have the charge the [ __ ] today let's take this wild ride together like I said if you're 21 or older make sure to LIKE comment subscribe this is a say for 2020 salute Cheers [Music] [Music] [Music] that was good I liked it I'm gonna do one more hit the four of you let me real I expected a little bit more taste more flavor here's the thing this isn't a flavor cart do you know what I mean so I don't think it's meant to have a lot of flavor now - it is kicking mmm it's good I like it um so okay so the review of how to be a heavy hitter like I said it was one of those brands that it felt like it was just a it was just one of those brands you saw an illegal of dispensaries and for whatever reason I just was never comfortable with purchasing a heavy hitter until I had the money to hence this video now I got more of a taste off of the dry hit than I did off the actual legitimate hit which is a little bit funny to me it's not bad does it have as much flavor as beast is e off of first R it can't really talk and I don't want to over a judge it when I shouldn't so let me just go in for the second hit and we'll see heavy hitters Pineapple Express saalu to [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so I've hit the heavy hitters enough at this point I'd like to think now to go head to head pineapple Express dizzy I want to see how well this can hold up in a fight against the heavy hitter he's not a heavy hitter that's gonna knock you out it's a heavy hitter so let's see where we can put the stygians blinkers only come on [Music] [Music] [Music] whoa [Music] Nega no way no [ __ ] no [ __ ] one [Music] that's busy has a lot a lot more teeth then that pineapple Express to us from heavy hitters wow this was a heavy hitters video that [ __ ] knocked it out of the [ __ ] park now I don't know what I think it was the taste which tells me either they put a little taste in this dizzy and this dizzy distillate and it has some pineapple flavor and this may be the true version of pineapple Express with Noah did it I did it with no additives so either stygius pineapple Express has a more flavor I don't know this should hit this [ __ ] pumpkin hit this dizzy they both hit let me make that very clear but with the the pineapple Express like the pineapple eat like you get pineapple from it I got pineapple from both but nah man wow this is a great product don't get it [ __ ] up but pineapple Express from steezy one I gotta try someone other heavy hitters [ __ ] this is great though I don't want to make it seem like this is like the same you know what I mean totally not the case I [ __ ] with this this is good if I didn't have this if I didn't have the pineapple express some sticky this would have been the next up but I don't know man that's tizzy pineapple express got a little bit more taste to it a little bit while I was eye-opening to say the least holy [ __ ] I'm baked right now - Wow didn't think that was gonna happen I really thought this is gonna win I wanted it to I didn't know if I wanted it to but I just was like this is okay this is gonna be it I gotta try other heavy hitters [ __ ] let me just say that this oil moves to compare that steady oil this oil totally moves if you leave it I mean you give us some time I mean it's gonna move you know what I'm saying it's definitely but it's all good I'm not really I'm just shooting the [ __ ] with you guys I'm just seeing what's better what's not better you know what I mean I'm really not doing this for the old five out of ten you know what I mean like it's good you should try it bro it's all [ __ ] weed at the end of the day let's be real here you know what I'm saying so I mean I understand the comments of people in the comments like oh is it better than Vince it's better is it better than this is it better than this I mean to answer your question this weed I mean unless you get in hot dog water which I would like to think that you're not at this point you know what I mean I would like to think that it's all weed and it's all gonna get you [ __ ] up you know some have a little bit more than others but I mean I mean to ask me I would never ask me I would never ask me I would never ask me what is what's the best hard car to get you hot I would never ask that cuz it's just like I get high off of everything it's we right I'm high right now hence the babbling about nothing let me get the [ __ ] out of here man yo listen it's been a [ __ ] pleasure vibing with you guys today I'm [ __ ] high as a kite but you know I'm gonna do one more for the road make sure you have the apparatus is out let's you know what I mean we high let's just let's get more high [ __ ] it and Saturday and then adieu I'm off I mean this is the Pineapple Express and heavy it is [Music] [Music] is", "ljdgvqCZHW8": "attention i want my videos to look like this and not like this so if you're under the age of 21 and don't have a medical marijuana card leave what's going on everybody willow g here back again with another video in this video i'm doing a vape cartridge review i'm going to be doing a vape cartridge by papa's herb this car only cost me nine dollars they're half gram carts and they're only nine bucks i copped three of them so 27 bucks for three carts is really not bad at all i would think they were fake but i've had homies do reviews on them and i've also i've seen reviews on home pages about them and it shows that they're not but i just went straight into this and opened this up without saying anything i'm going to start off with the lemon cello today the limoncello is a sativa and i'm gonna go sativa hybrid indica gotta go in the right order oh there we go all right we got it open i know in one of my videos i told you guys if the carts in a bag it's probably fake but i take that back because these carts aren't fake and they come in bags most cards that you find in bags are fake don't buy no exotic fake [ __ ] mario kart type [ __ ] that's a scam so i got a new battery today it's called a yo can and it's electronic it goes from 2 volts all the way to 4.2 i think so i'm gonna give it a go with the papa's herb cards let's throw this in here oh [ __ ] that worked perfectly all right five clicks to turn it on uni pro it's at two volts right now because to taste them i'm gonna have it at the lowest setting and then i will try them out at a higher setting too so here's lemoncello on 2 volts cheers you guys damn that really does not rip at all let me try it again hold up there's a 10 second rip right there on two volts but that actually tastes very good i can already feel it in my head low-key carts don't really do much to me but i you can't feel it it's this one is 85 along with the gelato 33 i believe yeah and then the granddaddy perp is 87.5 but they're all around the same so you're probably chilling on whichever way you go it just depends on what your preference is with sativa hybrid indica and taste plus there's more on flower cup there's there's six flavors right now but i only got three let's try one more hit but let's put it up to 3 volts for this one cheers [Music] i can already tell that going up to four is just gonna burn the coil because three rips pretty fat [Music] all right that's enough for the limoncello though i'm gonna get this out this battery though is actually really far i'm low-key more hyped on the battery than i am the carts but that limoncello was good it was actually very good for being a nine dollar cart like you do not expect much from that [Music] next up we're gonna try the gelato 33. this smells good as [ __ ] already oh my god this smells really good way better than the limoncello did all right i had i don't remember who it was that told me but someone told me that granddaddy perp and uh gelato 33 were the two best out of the six so i'm hoping that they were right throw that bad boy in there cheers [Music] yes yes yes yes i like the taste a lot of this i like the gelato 33 taste way better than the limoncello so there's my first rating of it is that it's much better than the limoncello let's give it a rip on 2.5 volts [Music] even like french inhaling that it didn't tickle my nose and wax usually like tickles the [ __ ] out of my nose and makes me sneeze so i'm really liking the gelato 53 i might have to make this the first one that i neck all right let's take a rip off three volts real quick and if i'm feeling it i'm gonna do this one on the max [Music] but so far if i were to rate these out of 10 both i'd give this limoncello like a seven out of ten because it's good and i mean it actually like for some reason i felt it which i don't know how i felt it that's crazy the gelato i'm gonna give like an eight and a half to a nine like somewhere around there like the gelato is really [ __ ] good you guys i'm gonna take one more rip of this before i go on to the granddaddy perp i'm gonna bring it down a little bit cheers [Music] yep i like it i definitely like the gelato let's get this [ __ ] out for the grand daddy purp finale see what i did there all right this is two point five percent more than the other two cards plus it's an indica which ain't smack the hardest everyone knows that so let's see how this is because because i'm excited to see if this hits me in the face i'm gonna pull this down to a 2.2 cheers you guys cut it yep that tastes exactly like a [ __ ] granddaddy purp should taste i've had so many granddaddy perp carts i'm hype on that because i at least have an indica wax i only have sativa with my stizzy right now so i've just been chiefing stizzy wax um that's sativa it kind of sucks because when you want to go to bed at night and you hit a snizzy that has sativa in it you're like but uh yeah i got i got indica now let's take a rip off 2.5 volts see how it is let's take a rip on three volts of the granddaddy perk cheers [Music] before i take a giant rip off of this uh limoncello card i want you guys to do me a favor subscribe follow me on instagram and

know what the hell is in here and i do like to know what the hell i'm inhaling so i went on the site and just going by the pictures i believe it's their tko oregon berry one gram cbd blood because from the packaging that's what it looks like it doesn't look like the other ones on their site so i'm assuming that's what it is so we're gonna see let's pop it cork over you know i'm looking at the pictures here it's just the cork it'd be cool if there's another plastic on it because it's just very easy to just yeah nicely packed blunt she seems cool i'm just seeing the paper with cbd because it says very i don't know just checking you know other companies they wrap with there is this flavored you know i'm just testing it out i don't know so this is supposed to be berry one gram of premium cbd hemp flour grown by tko reserve so this is one gram of premium cbd hemp flour grown by tko reserve expertly wrapped in an organic hemp blunt wrap indulge in a new smooth luxurious smoke guilt-free it is smooth now i'm trying to see if i taste anything very like not yet made with fresh ground flour never shake okay because i'm seeing their information but it's not like their site is on other people's other company sites so i can't even say it's horrible i ain't there yet i don't know it's like not much information i'm like come on somebody have information on this okay oregon berry blunt again no information on this it's very smooth it was very relaxing but um yeah i was trying to see if it says anything about you know the flavor profile the terp you know with the terpenes and yeah but nothing [Music] nothing so i like this very much it's um i was trying to still feel until i get any berry undertones any kind of sweet you know fruit but i don't get that it's dry so maybe you could contribute to a a dry wine but it's very nice it's very relaxing very relaxing you have 10. yeah i hate that this should keep popping up on my blinking thing like can y'all fix that that this only shows up one time i'm just saying one time it keeps pop ups so this is 15 cbd zero zero point three tc you know the legal this is cbd y'all this is very relaxing yeah it's like a dry wine kind of thing going on it's earthy i wouldn't say herbals earthy ness earthiness yeah it's very dry but the effects are enjoyable yeah it's um yeah the taste isn't for me the dead dry wine bills yeah

the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made my opponent it's just like alright you won't turn it so I have to do it like this I got to hold it that's gonna be the video guys I hope you all enjoyed make sure to check out all the links in the

they they put a higher percentage of terpenes in these than the standard amount you know I'm saying to make the flavors better and [ __ ] which I thought was pretty cool that's probably why they're running in a little lower on the THC like 83 mm say 87 but these are really [ __ ] firemen hey I also got a [ __ ] I got a new battery tree all [ __ ] I just picked this [ __ ] up [ __ ] Kang vape it's called the classic box mod b1 b2 [ __ ] gang of eight rock ejecting Mountain [ __ ] I'll leave a link in the description this is a cool ass battery Broughton never had one like this this is

bro my homies was getting lit everybody was just trying to bro off the dark hug but yeah like ever since i never had one of these that's why i kind of wanted like so bad to do a review on these but yeah i [ __ ] with this i'm already pretty little cap off that blinker and i don't get a bit faster okay that one was great taste okay if y'all want me to tell you that taste i'm not gonna lie to you when you hit that [ __ ] let me hit it again get some gas bro it just tastes like like skittles like real talk it tastes like skittles but um what's it called [ __ ] whenever yeah like y'all see this like the inside of it how the coil is that's just not no metal it's not a metal coil [ __ ] ceramic bro that's why it just hits way better it's like a real dab bro and his life isn't like bro y'all don't understand how how lethal this is right here i don't know if y'all had one of these in your area but if y'all have like let me know if you [ __ ] with these or not let me not if you had a fake ass one like you see how gold this is bro it better not be no dark-ass [ __ ] that you were smoking on bro straight up doctor is cool but i'm not gonna lie to you i still [ __ ] with this either a long way no home i [ __ ] with suzy a little bit more regardless bro because this is just too vicious should i just take a stizzy rib i'm gonna take a hit oh both of them for the [ __ ] video yes sir yes different this is that can't miss the right this is kind of derived it's um what is that [ __ ] super lemon haze bro y'all want to go watch that video that was my last video y'all could go check that [ __ ] out the light bro i'll [ __ ] with the butt bro [ __ ] snot just came on my nose no weird [ __ ] bro [ __ ] but yeah i'm gonna take one more hair for your [ __ ] man i think i'm done for the videos", "x9B4oIZFsIo": "I have everything we're gonna turn this down this is like my third time making this video so I really hope I don't [ __ ] it up what's going on guys it's JC 710 and today I'm gonna talk about another cartridge that picked us this one is gonna be on the high extracts or hy extracts and it's the gelato flavor which is that's typical of me I guess at this point I think of this one and I picked up the Scott Walker og I haven't opened that one yet but when I do I'll let you guys know but as far as this one goes I am really impressed by this it has that sweet candy taste that gelato usually has and it's very potent so this is the cartridge that I've been using for the past few days and the reason why I picked this guy up or well both of these cartridges was because I saw a delivery service had these and just looking at the packaging and the cartridge itself kind of intrigued me so that's what it looks like and um when I saw it I was like oh it looks like a good product and it's not outrageously priced let's try it out on top of that I also found out that it was a San Diego brand so that's pretty cool I can support a local company I've always thought that it's a cool that's a cool thing just supporting local businesses and stuff like that makes you feel good so when I got the cartridges I was like okay how is it going to perform what's the little going to be like how it's going to taste you know what are the effects gonna be like they're on their Instagram it said that they're testing I think over 80% THC so that's a good thing and then I also did the first initial test where you like hold it upside down and see how thick it is as you can see I hope it focuses but it's holding up really well um I was pretty impressed by it and yeah I'm gonna hit it out okay so I'm gonna try to get my breath together before I start talking around some [ __ ] coffee but uh no no this [ __ ] damn it okay okay I guess we'll wait a little bit longer okay this cartridge is good don't get me wrong however I feel like the cartridge itself could be better the oil in it um the oil itself very thick very tasty very smooth even though I was coughing that's just me being a [ __ ] um the cartridge itself I feel like it could hit a little bit harder as far as vapor production goes I like the design of it but as far as the hardware inside I feel like whatever coils inside could hit a little harder because right now I had this thing up well my battery turned up all the way on the highest setting and I mean it's not doing that it's nothing to complain about but I definitely think that the heavy hitters and select leads produce a lot more vapor than this if I had to compare this cartridge just something else it might be like brass knuckles or something yeah as far as vapor vapor production goes yeah it's like along the lines of brass knuckles and that's my opinion you might have a different experience yeah gelato I really like it I like this flavor it's giving me all the effects that you know gelato or other cookie strains gives me so yeah it's it's not like this is a BS cartridge or whatever I got both of the these cartridges originally they were I think one for 45 but then they had a deal going on so I got two 480 and that's not that's a pretty good deal I guess in my hand hasn't leaked on me yet it hasn't clogged on me yet but I'm only like a quarter of the way through it so I guess that's not saying a whole lot all in all I'm I'm impressed by this you know basically paid for Tia gram for it and a cartridge that's not a bad deal at all cool design I like the packaging it's not a [ __ ] to get open like some other ones yeah it still protects the cartridge but this is what I'm gonna do I'm gonna take one more hit and if I can't think of a single thing to say about this cartridge after taking that hit then we're just going to something Wow okay if I had to compare this cartridge in this oil to another one it would probably be the happy sticks this one is as far as formula for the oil it's pretty comparable to the happy sticks new formula the hackmore like an ambarish color oil at now it's more of a yellow one so it tastes kind of like that no yeah I'm really impressed by this cartridge it exceeded my expectations for you know the price I gotta for excuse me uh and I'm really excited to crack open that other one to try which I will momentarily I promise yeah if you guys like this then do it if you guys don't I'm sorry I hope I can do better next time if you want to subscribe can you don't have to if you don't want and uh yeah I'm gonna go enjoy this thing more and then do some other stuff I'm gonna want to try the Alpine cartridges and then I also want to try the moon rock the zodiac moon rock ones so if I get my hands on those I'll definitely show you guys if I get my hands on anything I'll definitely show you guys and yeah I'm going JC", "kM_rI34TKDI": "[Music] all right what is going on youtube it is

this real quick can y'all see the color what i'm saying with the with the color in it let's see like this maybe sorry if it's too damn bright i'm just trying to get you guys to see what the hell i'm seeing i don't know the headspace doesn't look too bad though i mean it's just a normal average bubble well let's uh let's get into it huh of course i always have my [ __ ] on the lowest setting the lowest setting on this used battery give it a dry pull here real quick nice and fruity like gelato supposed to be relaxed happy or fork uplifted creative uh amd i guess i don't know i've never seen this cartridge before a v d o c g never seen this cartridge before boys it's not a jupiter card obviously it's a 10 um a 510 thread huh it's definitely oil it's not that waxy stuff like the mk ultra

depression chronic pain insomnia peppery's citrus earthy are the top terpenes i tell you what it's got a nice uh a nice tickle and throat nice tickle on the nose what did i pay for this i think either 50 or 55 bucks it's a new company it definitely explained lungs it's not bad it's got a hell of a nice gelato taste to it [Music] the lookout is nice the cartridge seems to be like any other 510 thread cartridge so i just don't know what the amd stands for a-n-d or something i don't know if you guys can see it right there all right see it right there maybe somebody can tell me if if you guys seen that seen that one before but uh starting to feel like up up in the upper low area the head the forehead uh area the eyes i believe this is uh gelato is a uh indica dominant i know it's a hybrid but i believe i believe it's an innocent diamond so it's more of like the couch lock kind of buzz if you guys know no know what i'm talking about take another pull i'll tell you last two days of work

leaf uh looks like and and tell you a little something about it about the uh the blue cheese strainer cheers if you notice i don't do blinkers i don't heat it up i go straight in i mean not a bad card not a bad cartridge at all all right i'm gonna set that to the side turn the battery off i forget to do that look before i go to the other other g leaf fire one thing i do not like about these batteries is that when you're smoking them if you do not forget to turn the battery off and you go to stick in your pocket that battery can be pressed for a long time it can burn your [ __ ] out waste half your cartridge and make the rest of it taste like a burnt coil just it's disgusting so if you can get the inhale active batteries which normally i have my cresco on uh it's probably my pocket no it's not i don't know where the [ __ ] it is somewhere close but anyway uh the inhale is is the inhale active is what you want okay or just make sure you're you're you turn your [ __ ] battery off that way you're not wasting your cartridges when you're out and about because normally you just have them sitting down okay let's get into this flower let's get right into this flower here guys uh blue cheese blue cheese flower here's some numbers i'm not going to read the numbers off to you you guys can see it for yourself okay uk cheese times blueberry i might have done this before because

videos but I wanted to show you guys what I've been smoking quite a lot of which is the brass knuckles cartridges right here I did buy one of these vaporizer pens while I let go for these little wax cartridges they're very portable they don't leave like a smell and a resin and they're the flavors are amazing they're really strong too this one says a lab tested contaminant free no polyethylene glycol or glycerin it's a gram you guys and this one says blueberry of course so they've been the other flavors that I've tried like Girl Scout cookie and or rather cookie and what was the other one gelato were amazing so I have really high expectations for this all right you guys so I guess it was stuck so I did get it unstuck so now what I did was I grabbed my like a pin and pushed it down into the side right over there and now I can just push down on both sides and go ahead and pull it apart so there we go again this is the brass knuckles blueberry indica and it's pretty big cartridge you can see the brass knuckles logo on there that's pretty cool just opening the package the whole thing just reeks of blueberry so I'm really excited to try this given that it's almost Halloween I did wear a mass but let's see how this hits and how it tastes please remember to please remember to Like comment share and subscribe let me know what you guys want to see and give me a thumbs up and here's that brass knuckles Wow that flavor is amazing Wow so going that's really big hit still boy I don't smoke I don't know if the camera is picking up picking that up at G's the flavor is amazing it literally tastes like like a very smoothie like or maybe berry ice cream as you can see it hits really really smooth that didn't cough or anything at all or need to and that was a really big hit so I'm gonna go ahead and let's turn the heat down and then I'm gonna set this is my absolute extracts pen by the way it's really nice it's got the three different heat settings so I'm changing that by pressing down on that three times and that indicates or the color indicates the temperature settings so I'm gonna go ahead and press it twice which is gonna keep it on for a pretty good amount of time without having to hold the button and I'm gonna take a really big rip I'm gonna be really actually already really baked again like comment give me a thumbs up subscribe hopefully I should be making more videos soon and doing a giveaway it's been way too long so I'll get something cool for you guys and one or two lucky winners will get something so the flavors like overwhelming it's it's not over well I mean given that I'm already high it's already it's yet it's overwhelming this is definitely strong and really I hate already it's just you like breathing it out through your nose and just breathing it you know at all or you can taste it like even on your like lips and stuff that the blueberry and that like it tastes like berry ice cream like I said still blowing out smoke all in all I would give this a thumbs up five stars just like the other brassknuckles cartridges I've tried so far their flavor on them is really amazing they're always consistent they always burn all the or they always go all the way down to the bottom and you can use all the wax and you never get a burning taste through them and they're always consistent always delicious so I'm really excited to try their other strains they've got like seven or eight others that I know of that I'm really excited to try so I've tried the gelato the blue blueberry which is what this was and then also the cookies so their packaging is really pretty interesting I don't know if I quite show that it's got their branding and stuff all over it it's pretty cool I like it so I'm taking another really big ooh another really big rip and it's pretty much it like I said comment let me know what you guys want to see I'm over here and I have a lot of access to dispensary so I can get like cookies edibles waxes cartridges stuff that even you know but and show you guys and you know just try it out so have a great day you guys and here it goes a long space [Music] [Music]", "DRhCBf9ZJxA": "what I do YouTube is that Bob

you guys what we got so uh the pr lady she gave us a backpack how cool and some really cute stickers and also we got a little um a lanyard which is super cool the quality is really thick too so i really love it because normally when we get lanyards from like other um like uh dispensaries or other like brands they're really thin so really pull through and also to let you talk about the little bags because they're so cute they got little wheat plants on it last time we went we had got into blackboard but uh they just said that they give them out so like we can stop taking the other one and so this is the one now and um so today what we got they also gave us this which i don't really know what you're supposed to do with this so i'm just going to toss this in the bag until i figure it out say hello to georgie he's just chilling back there we brought him in his cage because we slept over my friend angelica's house so i'll you know put him in the cage to be safety first but he does have his little car so we just want him to chill with him okay so today we got this dizzy gelato and this is a hybrid and it's a half gram for now i'm just gonna be trying it out just one moment you gotta push the button with this i'm pushing the button but it's not working ah okay perfect okay so this is it and also too just to verify that it's real you can scratch that little thing off and the way you know it's the badge number and also too um you know it's legit because it's from stitchy but um like legit it because it's from susie and also too they have the little california it's not a sticker so don't be fooled don't even be buying pods from like other dispensaries like like low-key dispensaries you should just go straight to a big dispensary like a normal one like empire cookies or most likely that's where i hit my pots from and let me just get my pod on my pod my battery me okay [Music] so so i'm back guys kind of how to cut it out real [Music] kind quick lost my pod for a moment my train of thought so they so you take that little black piece off and then it looks like this the little hole and then you know it's also legit because magnet the fake ones don't have magnets they just fall off i bought one on time from the low key dispensaries and shouldn't you was fake and but i really like was barely like getting into pods and stuff and and then i found out like what was totally fake so now like i'm i'm educated on it and also too um on the back of this of the boxes like so after you check that it's verified that it's real you could just go up to the back of it and it says like stizzy a half grandpa gelato so it has vape in it so just so people who don't know um so just from what i'm aware of and also to the questions i've asked in google and stuff and you can feel it too like when you smoke um this is what it looks like the regular ones they don't have they're not live resin so they're mixed with i think it's distilling and also two and terpenes yeah so that's what gives it the flavor of the vape and so technically like you are hitting thc with vape juice which is why like it's a little bit more harsh the live resin ones what i prefer so i'll do a video next time on that one um those ones are my favorite because uh from my understanding and from google um basically like what they do with the weed is they compress it and then they like take it off like the parchment paper which is not parchment paper but it's like just some type of paper and so um it's really backboxing sorry guys there's a cop there you still get scared and so like i was saying uh the live resin it's like compressed nut and stuff and so they just like froze the nut and they compress it and then they take the thc out and that's what they put into the pot and you could tell that it's live version it's a little darker like normally like before when i was a little younger i would say like don't smoke anything dark which you shouldn't if it comes to wheat or like wax and stuff like that you shouldn't um but just like i said my understanding is just compressed out so it's safe too and also too you know it's bomb because it tastes just like wheat um so it's really good and so like i was saying though back to the box so on here you have you have like it says vape it has the office like where it came from this one was from jericho california and then the vendor is dizzy then it has the register certification number so and then also two in the front it'll tell you um there it is i'm sorry guys it's not really loading but it'll say like for this one it says thc 45 459.97 milligrams total thc 91.99 total cbd 0.98 milligrams mfr date mfr day just google that um but it's the first i mean it's september 1st 2020 oh manufacture date the package date was september 1st 2020 the badge it tells you s-c-o-r-g g-e-l-o-a-3120 and then it has a uid number don't really know what that means okay so enough about the box that's just so you guys know that it's legit and also too just for an idea if you haven't gotten in the pot a pod you'll know like it's on the box and what kind of means um but now let's um hit this real steady so you see how it lights up so it's really cool it takes like a little lemony just like a little bit like [Music] and kind of feel it not instantaneously it'll take a few minutes to kick in it's a lot quicker than flowers but like i said i'm trying out this disease and stuff just because i really do like this disney brand and um it's just really convenient you know what i mean like i just puffed like i don't even have to worry about like a lot of smoke around me even through a puppy so i could get that air out just a window let it air out takes it out boom we're chilling relaxing kicking it so you know i like it i

stopped working on me so i have to go get a new one uh i have to go down to this monster and get a new one i haven't done that [ __ ] yet so that's the only only reason why i've been buying stacy's

so I was going to throw that down in the description his video on that and I was going to do a review on the gelato wets the extraction from shatter house extractions gelato opening it up comes in a nice little box unfolds Oh comes on a nice box that unfolds and folds back up this was a half a gram the revealing let's get the macrovision on there for a moment it's got like a really strong like diesel gassy smell to it it smells pretty awesome all right now the consistency see if I can pull this piece off right here yeah it looks like it's gonna be a pull yeah there's a little bit of a pool

we go cheers guys Wow really strong really strong on flavor - yeah that tastes really good I went in really hot though kind of burnt my nail I will clean that off as a if I couldn't get basically a q-tip to clean it off I would use this and it will aqua dyes alright you seen how dirty that note was this ammonia go bad heat and the stains go away but it does make a little bit of a cloudiness left in the glass hmm all right why we let this nail cool down time to grab another dab a little bit the pull and snap we're really strong reminds me of like Death Star or something that has a really

comment and subscribe welcome back to another day of cash made it turn on those post notifications right next to that subscribe button that little bell turn all of them applications on so you can be notified the next day of Kush miss and all my other videos so yeah let's find out what's in my little stoner bag well not really stone her bags but attached to my little bag Christ make the share myself anyways it's my little backpack that I usually use that I use on a daily basis I usually carry my pant in here my wallet it's a really really tiny backpack but it comes in handy whenever I need to take products and light okay I am dizzy today yeah so you guys already know I focus is he hard Susie Susie it's always gonna be all right okay yeah my question you guys how do you guys cost dizzy do you guys say dizzy the way I'm saying it or steezy cuz I heard I hear both ways a lot I've heard like bigger influencers call it's easy but I've heard like other influencers sayst Izzy so which was the right word is it just preference or what so I do have um I only have the starter kit packaging on me I don't have the big advanced kit on me but I'm gonna be smoking from the big and starter battery as well I'm gonna be reviewing for the very first time the littlest is e there you guys have it it is an indica it's purple punch one of my faves everyone's is definitely one of my faves it's a half gram I believe I believe in the lilz they only carry half cap so I have um like I said I have the starter kit and the big battery on me just not the packaging's for both and you guys have seen the packaging the advance kit is a black packaging versus the starter kit is a white packaging so that's how you can kind of tell the difference between which one's the big I mention is the regular battery go ahead and pull those out so this was the regular body battery first is the big so you can see it's much wider Tsing excites though just wider and more more bigger hits and more clouds there we have it so I will be reviewing the Lille for the very very first time so today I have to derive terpenes two different flavor the hybrid is super glue and the indica is Grape Ape I love that flavor too hella bomb and like I said the little so today I will be reviewing comparing with a lil and like I mentioned the lil is distant I will be comparing them with derived terpenes I have a hybrid and an indica the indica is Grape Ape one of my faves for sure and I have the hybrid which I was about to forget but I remembered it and basically I'm gonna be just reviewing how which one hits more if the little hits as the same like a regular diss link art rather because it isn't disposable the lil hello isn't disposable you just once you finished you can just recycle it and yeah I'm just gonna be letting you guys know which one at the end of the day I prefer more even if it's director please you know the prices the prices are much different distantly is much cheaper than the writer drippings because it is more of a it is more full spectrum THC and I did hop on the city website to get a more interest in this than a better understanding of derive terpenes so I'm gonna go ahead and read - guys if you guys solo cannabis derived terpenes preserve the natural terpene profile of each strain to deliver optimal synergy and both flavor and potency so basically it's much of a more cleaner here and more of a spectrum and concentrated th scene yeah I did smoke I've I've smoked arrived tycoons already and I really [ __ ] with them more than the Liquid Light resin but basically what I understand from this article is that statistic dizzy customers will get an access to the rotation of true full spectrum cannabis extracts that's why I keep mentioning full spectrum so you know more about this go ahead let me know yes ma'am come in comment down below have you tried it and what do you think about it do you prefer regular distillate liquid or terpenes let me know below so alright let's get into the video the packaging is the same with a lil you guys already know the drill for the other ones for the low so for the low you push as well and you pull and as I have mentioned before Suzy does have these scratches when you can just scan the barcode so you can see if you have a verified product and which is even cool about this review is that they all have on the similar THC percentage as so purple punch is 83% Grape Ape is 84% and super glue is 84% some people like [ __ ] liquid live resin but others they don't find it worth it because for some live resin THC percentage is lower so it comes out sometimes to smoking same as a discipline so I'm gonna go ahead and let you guys know if I think that the derived terpenes is worth it it's all it's dizzy haul review basically reviewing everything everything so let's go ahead and set these up of course the little is disposable so it's already set up BAM to all right and as you guys can see I did smoke already most of it but I do have a little bit left over yay for the video and I do like the function from the lip from this smaller one because I mean I love the function from the bigger one that's my favorite it tops this one but I love the little function for this one because it lets me know when if it's working or not basically and the light pops up right here it's like a blue-white light and that's how you know it's good to go of course the big this is the same as well but the big doesn't do it at the bottom how the smaller one did it it does it right here there you have it they feel a little different like this one feels much smoother feels very light as well like fake quick like there's nothing like feather type of thing like very light compared to this one then I'm just like whoa I feel like it'll fall well I have had disposables before and just another distills one and not really the best like preference for others supposed to I don't really [ __ ] with them it would just be whenever I was really broke and I couldn't afford a cart um the reason why I don't really [ __ ] with this poseable that much is because I have noticed that battery runs faster than the actual wax that's in there and go ahead and give this a try and you don't really ever know if it's hitting or not so I don't know if this is gonna blink right here or if it doesn't at all I'm not sure if this is a blinker as well so you gotta find out so that's the only thing that's the thing that sucks too about disposable is that you won't really know if your battery connecting to the actual like the top because I don't know if you would call it a pod because you don't just connect it you know and connect them yeah but let's go ahead and quit talking and you take it Cheers for the little has a really good hit here let's see if it'll blink that was a really really good unexpected hit like I was not expecting this down Oh little Suzie be hitting bro we're barely under the 1 let's move it up the middle child by the way guys it's Easter so it won't be Easter when you guys are watching this but happy Easter because I didn't get to tell you guys and if nobody told you how pleased - happy Easter you can see my arms Cheers if I said this already but I definitely do it like derive to her friends drippings more than the liquid one but personally me if I have the money to go buy more like better quality weed yeah by all means like I'm gonna go for it but if I'm like on a lower budget and I'm like nah you know what I don't I'm not eating myself I would not find the direct though so it's a derived terpenes and liquid live resin worth it because for the life live the liquid live resin at least the percentages are lower than the actual dissonant and it's more expensive so derive terpenes 1/2 gram pod would be the same price as the regular dissonant full gram oh sure got that a bird was coming I have my Sun roof open that would have been like the scariest moment in my life a bird being locked in my car and me freaking out I can see it already so full grant might even get me more high than the terpenes the half cab am I even it might even last me more as well so I mean those are things you can think about it it's kind of more like a preference and your budget and preference and now also I think it's um disposables are pretty cool like if you don't you want to try out a new brand but you don't necessarily want to invest in a 4 car that you don't know you're gonna like and disposal and disposable comes in hand because you can just try it out and toss it if you don't like it or whatever those apples are already ready to go when they're $26 versus the the half gram pod it's $25 plus the the battery which is another like twenty twenty-five dollars so um if you don't have one so it's a good investment but you can also think about it this way like if you already have a battery it's more it's better to invest on the regular one time to hit the big one oh no actually we haven't done a blinker from the middle child and it's purple so we have two already I feel alike the little definitely had bigger clouds then the derived turbines on the middle child and I feel like like the second one like it got me too but I feel like the little the hit there was bring clouds bigger hit and hit me back bigger so we're gonna go ahead and read a little kid I'm on the passenger side to see I don't know if it looks any different yep let's go ahead and take I actually attempted to take blinker with all three cities and I failed it's ugly okay let's go ahead and take a blinker very punch he's really good this is my face whenever like I [ __ ] take a leak I'll only my time or this one my eyes are getting like are wandering off I just know it is roses and I never really notice them I just noticed a pink a white one in an orange from nougat alright so I have taken a blanket from o3 I really think that honestly the hit that got me the most no cap was a little I don't know if it was because it was a very first one or I don't even know him but I feel like it was it like it had the biggest clouds and it hit me the most so yeah second I would probably think this one and then this one or like between these two but for sure this one hit me the most at the end of the day I feel like if I'm gonna budgie and I want to save some money or whatever I would most likely go with the distillate because like I said a fulcrum it's the same price to me as a half gram of derived terpenes and the distillate might even get you more higher than the direct chirping not that I'm saying that derive Tribune's and live resin it's like bad [ __ ] you know but I'm just saying like if you're trying to save some money and you don't have the full money to me say to be spending on better quality THC that's gonna when you can easily save that money and get a product that's gonna hate you even more and you can have more of the product and you're gonna spend less so I feel like that's us the OL ordeal lasts just me but like I've said if I keep repeating myself if I all means you got the cash and you want to spend you're like me too I'll be like that too you know like if I had the money I sure what we throw-in it on gray as products like high quality products because who doesn't want the best concentrate of THC and the best THC they can smoke you know but that's just my opinion go ahead and let me know you guys think which mean would you guys prefer which one do you guys think was the biggest hit and got me like honestly look at them and watch this video and compare each hit and my facial expression so let's go ahead and pretend that these are all half gram distillate so don't don't even [ __ ] cap on how the [ __ ] I said we're gonna know how the [ __ ] I say it so I'm pretty sure I'm saying you're on so it's okay whatever whatever um so basically these range to around 25 the half grams and versus the the lil which is already like the full battery and everything included is $26 so it's like $1 difference it depending where your shop is I purchased these in Cincy downtown LA so I'm just telling you guys according my experience and where I went to so and I believe in other shops they can the little and the half cans can range up to 35 even to $40 so you know not every where will you go don't think that where your shop you're gonna go and you never a quarrel Sela said it was gonna be 25 so why isn't it 25 you know um yeah this one it like I said it's all included everything battery in the pod whatever 26 dollars versus the half gram plus the battery which would range probably around 20 to 25 work I went and the big is around 30 to 35 dollars so let's say you don't have a battery I feel like it would be more convenient to honestly in my perspective I love having batteries like I love having batteries and just having them with me like I don't know I just love them so I would definitely just buy the battery and I feel like it's better in my opinion I'm just switching onto the pod because you can take it out whenever and then you can charge it and you can see whenever it blinks in you're taking a blinker and I just feel like it's better but these are definitely like coming clutch like the way a hella hit don't even underestimate it like if somebody's really trying this out for the fur for some they're gonna they're definitely gonna come back still and want more during the starter kit and advanced kit I would definitely choose the big because I feel like it is a bigger hit like a stronger hit and bigger clothes in my opinion as well I'm gonna just say this one last time period bigger hits make the clouds think same thing right um definitely hits me I feel like it lasts way longer do like way longer the battery the the battery for this is pretty like I don't know about now I have a really like paid attention to it now like the new ones cuz I know this is a new battery as well they recently came out with the green letter just pretty dope and I do have the like silver metallic looking one now the orange one and I have had plenty of black ones and the I've had a few big because I always lose them yeah this is just my preference they both work perfectly fine if I had only had to keep this one and take this one I would be fine I definitely fine it'll do the job soozee soozee hella rocks so you don't necessarily have to invest in the big it's just if you have that extra money I feel like why not alright now comparing these two the big versus a little look at size difference by the way the Lil's only um they only have dissonant like the um honestly would I purchase low again yes because it did not disappoint me even if it's a disposable I would definitely purchase again if I had the money and I wanted to report purchase a disposable for sure do it again did not disappoint me at all yeah like hella [ __ ] me up like the [ __ ] big dude obviously the only downside is that you can be switching on the pods you can research with trying the derive terpenes you can't try a liquid like resin you can't smoke any you can't smoke this link but that definitely only that's awning you know you can't be switching the pot let's say you're like a heavy smoker and you have like three pods on you and you like constantly switching and [ __ ] you know you're not gonna be able to do that all three of them hit amazingly fine like perfectly fine I just prefer that's the only thing that also sucks because if your battery dies and you still have wax it's just like [ __ ] what the [ __ ] how do i you know that's just wax wasted versus the battery you can charge it and it's rechargeable so yeah I'll go ahead and keep you guys updated I hope you guys enjoyed my video and like I didn't mention in the beginning of the video I don't have the liquid live resin on me anymore it was lemon cookies but I'm gonna go ahead and compare it the liquid labret resin versus derived terpenes I feel like in the one ground liquid live reason that I did I wasn't so big how I felt like I would have been like it wasn't just like it was cool but it wasn't just kidding it wasn't getting me big deaths I feel like he could have like the regular distillates to be honest I don't know I wasn't I don't know so but when I tried to rive terpenes like that was a different story like it had me baked for sure like and hella hit the spot so there's your answer derive terpenes you guys are trying to drive turbines on the big let me know so if I want to get my money's worth I would definitely go with this lit doesn't this is it do something this'll it I don't know but if I do have that extra cash like I have repeated annoyingly repeated I would I would stick to the right that derived terpenes versus liquid light resin and yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this review and smoking still is with me and you guys are all getting high with me", "eDn3wTnbsE8": "how's everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we've got a much requested one for you today so do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it well this also applies if you happen to purchase one of these questionable cartridges and it fails how do you remove the mouthpiece to extract the oil I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail 1 mil or 1 gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges that being said let's take this to the deck ok well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sail brand that is a batch code on the bottom alright this is another one this one here does not state sea sell across the bottom but on the base it does say sea sell m07 9 this is also a Jupiter distributed cartridge so the first things first we're going to take a pair of vice grips common write scripts and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this collar right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged that one was a little bit difficult I'll apply it to this just to stand it up and they'll have a go at one of these other ones all right I will show you again on this one here I said this is a C cell you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it alright now I'm gonna apply this cartridge to this battery just for a stable base and I'm going to open up this gelato right here and warm it up to dispense it into this cartridge okay now here is the cartridge we are going to refill all right here is the mouthpiece for the cartridge perfectly fine a couple of scratches on but that shouldn't affect it in the least here's the distillate we will be applying to it I have warmed this up substantially just to ensure that it does flow rather well into the system you simply place the applicator tip on the syringe twisting it to ensure that it has a good seal you put the syringe tip down into the cartridge and then just begin to apply the fluid all right there you have it as you can see the original line of the older oil right there at the bottom of the new oil coming down to meet it okay take that off the bottom there and see it's sinking down there very nice we didn't get a protective silicon cap for these threads right here apply it to the threads take the mouthpiece that came off of the cartridge put it over the top and it will it will not go on all the way that's a good thing that means that the seal still works it will not go on at this point you want to take a precision device and apply pressure now as you do that you will see this seal disappears and there you have it let's take this back up top and see how she does all right and here we are back on top with the csail refill that we have here now as you can see the oil has got down to the coil has mixed with that heather oil bubbles are rising to the top let's take this protective cover off the bottom of this hook it up to a battery let's see what we got shall we well there you have it that's working like a champ looking that of oil through there I can get that a little bit of gelato flavor from that distillate that I put in there it's very nice well there you have it that is how you can remove and refill one of these cartridges to extract the oil from it what you're going to want is a slightly longer blunt syringe tip and I have a few of those a slightly longer blunt syringe tip such as this one right here as you can see how long that is that would definitely get all the way down to the base of that and you would be able to extract any additional oil that happens to be in a cartridge where this this cell has failed this one no it's not failing all it's working great well thank you so much for tuning in this has been John with TMZ connoisseurs you be sure to remember to subscribe and give this a thumbs up if you liked it and tune in to some of our other videos to see if you like those as well thank you so much this has been great you have a nice day peace", "UmT0yiIcFZs": "how's that bike that's easy connoisseurs and they got a good one for you today so today we are going to take this C cell 1/2 gram refillable cartridge we picked up at vape part smart comm and we're going to be putting some oil in it and showing you just how easy it is to make your own cartridges well here we go what we're going to be putting in it today is some dab ex gelato this is 92.9% total THC for a grand total of ninety four point three total cannabinoids as you can see the color on this is absolutely beautiful let's open this up and get to work okay there you go opens it up every time very nice very nice look at that color it's about as clear as it can get right there loving it now all of this is extracted using ethanol alcohol so it is definitely the way to go this is a good company they make really nice distillate it is quite thick so I do recommend a cartridge with large holes like this see cell first things first you need to try to acquire an applicator tip this is very simply a very large syringe tip to administer the distillate into the cartridge now there will be a link to where you can get some of these in the description a lot of people ask about them and I did the work find it one now first things first we take our distillate we assemble it not too hard now as you can see when I pull off this cap [Applause] the tip is slightly frosted that is to ensure that this when you apply it has a good mating surface and does not slide off now would they recommend first and foremost is that you heat this syringe up just a little bit using whatever method you prefer to get it nice and viscous you take your oil that you want to load into the cartridge have it ready you take the cartridge simply unscrew the lid from the cartridge very easily take your syringe full of the fluid that you would like to dispense into your cartridge insert it into the cartridge as far as it can go and begin to diminish pinch the fluid you can see it pushes down simply go around the cartridge filling it up as you go okay I knew at that point just top it off a little bit remove the syringe take your lid replace your lid on the top [Applause] and there you have your cartridge simply allow the oil to run down to this spot and test it for function as you can see the oil as has gone all the way down to the bottom is filled to this level at that point in time so if we remove the mouthpiece and a small silicone seal on the bottom get a standard 510 thread battery this is a VAT mod very nice battery 510 thread screw it on to the bottom [Applause] and let's try this thing out shall we [Music] all right well there you have it that's how you refill a C cell cartridge you guys have an absolutely wonderful day thank you so much for tuning in and if you want some cartridges to refill yourself make sure you check this website out Bait part smart vpm comm very great place you guys have a good one that thanks for tuning in peace", "h-JDDMSwBh8": "what a few guys fly guys fly girls whatever the [ __ ] you are identify as it's jhc 710 and I'm gonna bring you a second review on another pen um I think I'm gonna review this pen because I don't know it just kind of caught my eye okay I think I'm gonna review this pen because it really caught my eye in a couple different ways one this thing packs a punch and for the price I got it for I'll tell you guys the quick story of how I got it not after I kind of covered this kind of crap so it has a clear mouthpiece that's freaking dope what other what other cartridges do you know has a clear mouthpiece there's not a fee there's not like a whole lot out there there's the I think like la Kush has one with their disposables and then moonrocks has one with their cartridges and their disposables other than that I don't really think any other cartridge has a clear mouthpiece so that's pretty cool on top of that it has one of the the C cell battery or nut batteries cartridges which has like a ceramic coil inside that preheats the oil that's pretty cool doesn't really mean anything to me as far as a consumer but it's another cool thing to added um as far as the oil goes this is probably some of the strongest oil I hid in a pen and that's just my my opinion I had brass knuckles a few times and their oil is like it's good but I don't know I feel like it could be better and when I say better I mean stronger that's why I like the 710 kingpin so much is because the oil was so strong it only took me about like two maybe three hits max to get like a really good buzz or high going and I'm finding the same thing with the select elite so going back to how I actually got this cartridge I went down to urban leave down by SeaWorld that's pretty cool and I originally went there to get a couple 710 kingpins um so when I got there I was like hey you know I came down here do you guys have any you know some time king Pez and they're like no we actually don't I was like that's it's a shame I kind of took a 20 minute drive down here because it said it you guys had it on weed maps and like you mean you know what man I'm really sorry about that if you want I can give you a bigger discount on another product and so I was like okay why not you know and so he showed me this the selected leads and I think I got this thing for like 35 or 36 bucks and it was a fall gram um I wish I could get that all the time but shoutout to that guy at urban leaf for getting me this one and this one in particular is actually the gelato flavor I really like gelato it sits well with me it gives me a good ear for Chi puts me to sleep when I need it to be but at the same time if I want to be up and active and creative it doesn't it doesn't bring me down and if that makes sense there are a lot of OGS out there that have that effect one of them being I think fan emoji and then Mars og and the hardcore og from West Coast it puts me down so that's why I like gelato it it works it's a really universal strain for me I'm able to get a good taste out of it I'm able to get a good high out of it and the high that I get of it is really like what's the word you never know there's a better word I'm kind of medicated off this I'm gonna take a hit for you guys but yeah I my vocabulary is not all the way there Wow that's great man that's great what was I talking about pretty sure I had to do with like potency or the taste Oh No okay so I went into the the damn shot and he gave me a really good discount on it so I think yeah I got it for super cheap and I walked out there super happy but also kind of like you know how is this thing actually gonna perform man when I put it on my pen it it did amazing I mean I got better vapor production out of it than I did with the honey bit not knocking honey babe that's so great cartridge but the vapor production was grana this the oil itself works really easily with cartridge that has in here and a flavor great it has like that sweet kind of berry taste that gelada usually has just like the 7:10 King fen gelato yeah that oh no I'm a fan of gelato it's a good string try it if you have it but yeah the the sometime kingpin is no exception I mean of the selectively is no exception this is a great cartridge great strain and they're also two branching out and I've noticed that they have a look like a lot of new strains I saw the sherbert select elite um I got my friend cherry cookies one the how was really dope to see so yeah they're just it's really great that they're they're making a whole lot of new strains and flavors for these because this is a really great cartridge and I hope that they keep putting these in shops like now because to be honest if I see these well these in heavy hitters if I see either one of these for you know 50 bucks or under I'm probably gonna pick that up I mean sorry 7/10 but fixture prices I guess it's not really their faults the shops fault for longing to capitalize off that name but um you know I'm trying to say if I can find a pen that's that it's just as good but you know pay less for it or whatever you know why not yes plus it looks cool like I said look at that [ __ ] clear tip that's pretty dope um I think I'm just being silly now but like if you want comment if you want subscribe if you want I'm not a cop I don't know my Instagram will be in the description below yeah select elite this is a great cartridge I really like to design I really like the oil tastes really good and its really public and if you get it get out of bed if you can get it for the right price buy it that's what I'm trying to say anyway JC", "L08jHwno1w4": "hey everyone jp here checking in respectmyregion.com here today with another west coast we do a review today we have a special guest hyatt's max back yet again we'll be doing a live resin dab review we've got a unique addition to or i'm sorry an alteration to this video and to this review max's score will be the official and only review for this it won't be a combination of our two reviews going into it for the actual rating interesting it's just gonna be yours reason i work for buddy's brand so can't give the unbiased okay you're gonna have to do it makes sense and i need you to be real stickler on it if you don't like it if there's something about it i want you to be open and honest all right fair fair authentic we keep it real i'm generally not you're not a fan yes i'm not the easiest not the easiest person to impress so uh and very outspoken about certain things so today we've got buddy's brand we've got the indica live resin i want you to check it out and be the one to kind of walk people through what you're seeing um on the packaging and the results and the ingredients stuff like that all right live resin we've got terpene profile on there pretty nice that is uh something that most brands are not doing which is i think it's kind of a bummer so it's nice to see that i got a buddy's cartridge today which also had the terpenes on it which is why i bought it there we go what are we looking at for the thc and the terps chc and terps total cannabidoids 84.73 okay thc is 73 so you got 10 percent of terps here you've got beta-carotene 3.7 percent alpha-human peppery and 0.53 some citrus yeah okay here we go that's some live resin cool thing about buddy's brand the live resin is all fresh frozen material so flour freshly chopped butt frozen sub-critical temperatures we then extract with it using you know our own you know live resin process and then you know they do some things to get i guess some strains are more saucy some strings are more diamond um that's cool i haven't seen the diamond on the bottom yeah the diamond shape view on the bottom nice view of the product going in what are you getting for that smell smell is a little sweet but there's not really like an overpowering like dankness or any real strong scent to it maybe we can stir it up it's not the initial nose is not too not too potent okay it's not very colorful it's been in the refrigerator it was brand new hadn't been touched hadn't been used okay open it up a little bit more whoa there we go open it up a little more okay let me check this out oh yeah i can definitely see what you mean by that sweet and there's like a creamy smoothness to it a slight bit of floral like citrus the more that it's sitting out here now like exposed to getting a little a little bit warmer um after moving around getting a little bit more air you get a little bit a little bit more of a smell too because when i first cracked it open there was really not much there what were the terps on this again three point seven one percent of the better carryoffland so it's going to be more peppery and spicy and then the humilin and the limonene are literally at half a percent each so i'm not going to be too crazy i feel like it might be hitting it on the nose for the true profile yeah it is not supposed to be super like noisy honestly it smells now it's starting to feel really good and i am actually pretty excited to take it down oh i want that screw it all right well you're gonna get a nice coupon out there there we go there we go we're gonna give ya anything is possible anything is possible oh [ __ ] i think we're losing the the tank right here we gotta go quick toss it in i think i'm gonna be able to get it heated up on the low temp gold star five four three two one oh i don't know damn we wasted a dab no i don't give that's probably all right oh no we got it the low temp dab you all seen it it's out the last dying flame here damn that has some crazy smell to it wow well i definitely didn't overheat it i think that's what we know you've done one hit two hits what are you getting on the taste the flavor what kind of high are you feeling definitely feel just like whoo it's like washed all over you from like from like your chest upwards um the aftertaste like the taste in my mouth is delicious what are you getting what am i getting it's sweet it tastes like it smells and it smells like the air right now smells delicious kind of floral sweet and a little bit of spice to it a little bit of spice it smells good this is good i wish you were able to i wish i were able to get it down with it as well but this is why this was the thing it naturally played out that i don't even give get to give the review it's all on you it's all on me so when you when you consider everything there's presentation appeal taste smell color potency everything is out of ten then you talk about the experience you just had and you know it's the box it's the it's the high right was there more information on there for you to you know know enough about the product um read the ingredients we didn't check this out what does it say here's about ingredients cannabis concentrate usage apply to tool and use heating device yeah pretty standard stuff um would you recommend it to someone as part of it i would what does this say live resident enjoy the experience of dabbing live resin fresh frozen and harvested and processed at subcritical temps means you receive a full flavor full spectrum extract packed with cannabinoids and terpenes and to me that's what matters is the cannabinoids and terpenes thc can only get you so far correct and that is why i would definitely recommend this to anyone who dabs i don't know where this falls on the price spectrum these are between four i would say between 37 on the low side to 52 on the high side okay yeah i mean i would if i had a dab rig right now this is probably what i would go to the store and buy um because that's more gelato huh that's at least buddy's live resin i mean more gelato honestly yeah i'm feeling good right now i like this you like it this is what's your score out of 10. score out of 10. i'm gonna give it a 9.25 okay high score there we go that's probably one of the highest scores i've given anything correct no tell tell me what didn't you like about it i guess it comes with part of the fact that it came out of the refrigerator uh before like your nose on it the initial nose on it was really not there and i was afraid that that was going to carry over into if you would have gotten that smell from a fridge at a store you'd have been like i would have not bought this at all and i know there are some stores that sell probably this exact oil out of the fridge and they give you the sample to smell out of the fridge yeah and maybe that's the problem maybe i never thought about that but no it smells good it tasted good it's going to preserve the terps there a little bit more to have it that way it smells good i i would buy this 9.25 5.25 final score appreciate that my brother well this is the west coast we tour review you guys heard it here max gave us the lowdown nice like a really fair score thought it was pretty solid i look forward to sharing my thoughts i guess i'll take a dab let you all know what i think in the comments stay tuned we uh got the videos on igtv youtube it'll be on max's here soon for his ig so i love you guys and we'll see you down the road appreciate y'all buddies brand shout out peace", "QOfAZbbA0_M": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video it is another stizzy video i haven't tried their wax in a while well i've tried it but not like actually bought my own in a while since i know it wasn't banana pie i bought something after that but uh yes i i picked up another stizzy product we got the gelato 44 i like to mention that i did open it but i did film a little some some so i do have an opinion of this product already but i am going to show you the packaging all that stuff the the um the wax itself and how it looks how it smells but i like to mention right away like this is definitely a lesser quality than the banana pie the first disney wax that i've actually tried it was like you open it you smell it right away this uh not so much i'd like to mention but uh it is the gelato 44 and it is i believe it was uh uh i bought this at authentic 209 and i believe it was 29 uh also it is running at about eighty three point two percent uh total thc uh that's about it basically right there but yeah batch height number uh uid bid all that stuff yeah curated live resin so let's just open it right here you can open this from the sticker and just pop it up and then bam so as you can see i'll show you again right here this is what it looks like it definitely smells a lot better than the banana pie but the banana pie was just a stronger gassier smell that was just like damn this like i believe the smell is better on this one though but it's just not as strong and uh it's a very like i get a slight slight sweetness i wouldn't say like a fruity sweetness but it's just sweet uh i'm not really familiar with gelato too much you know i've tried it before but most of the time it is a sweet earthiness but yeah we're going to try this in the pen and like i said i did try this already so this is just like a showcase that's the thing with my my uh videos on these products they're not i wouldn't consider them reviews because honestly i smoke so much weed it's like i'm not gonna distinguish each other's eyes you know i'm not really good at explaining taste as well you know i'll tell you if it's sweet lemony you know but that's as far as it goes you know i just i smoke you know what i'm saying like that's all i do you know like i'll try my best you know at the end of the day that's why i don't title my videos review videos anymore because i figured you know i'm not the best reviewer in the world you know you have other cannabis youtube channels that do that very very well compared to me you know i will admit that but uh yeah i just i just buy some stuff make a video on it you know and i'll just tell you if i like it or not you know it's just very simple when it comes to my channel i'm not and you know i'm all for rating systems you know if you do that you do that i used to do that but then i was just like we all have different preferences i'm probably gonna be biased towards certain products that i enjoy you know based on flavor you know and not everyone's gonna enjoy the same flavors as me so uh just keep that into consideration but cheers boys [Music] you know i'll just tell you you know if i i enjoy the product you know and in this one i do enjoy the product it's not as good as the banana pie or the um actually i can't really think of another one right now i think there was a watermelon z one that was really really good but this one uh is fairly good i'm not gonna lie but um definitely not as good as the banana pie but we're gonna try another hit and take another hit try and again blow it towards you guys and towards the camera and then we're going to blow it towards the light just to show you guys you know how much cloudance we can actually get from a device like this because i know you guys are probably just like well he ain't even dabbing it from a dab break you know well you know i'm saying you don't have to have a dab break to be to be the you know some some people just prefer you know their own methods of smoking or dabbing you know i like this wax pen it's just very portable very just compact you know cheers boys oh actually i can't do another that was pretty big you saw that though like you don't need no light to see how big that [ __ ] was that was pretty big uh we're good this that was gonna be my last hit [ __ ] that was pretty fat but yeah overall a good strain from dizzy not the best out of this disney line i did i did really enjoy the banana pie a lot more but the taste is good you know if it had a more stronger taste i definitely i would see myself probably getting it again but i don't know it's all right it's all right for 29 dollars for stizzy you really can't complain you know it's like at moderately priced and uh what you're gonna get is some pretty good stuff so if you haven't tried already you know i suggest you try it they do have rosin um it's dizzy like i said have been killing it they have rosin resin pods distillate in pods live resin and pods distillate with live resin or cannabis derived terpenes like they they have it all you know i'm saying if you have tried the gelato 44 let me know in the comments if you did enjoy that strain and yeah if you did like the video like it subscribe all the good stuff and i'll see you guys the next one peace out you", "ESBjcH-8q9E": "this time i am so honored to be reviewing my favorite hands down my favorite disposable vape and for so many reasons it beats the hat for the price the quality even if the price was ten dollars more um i think it would be worth it heavy hitters as i um is kind of my gold standard and i'm telling you kosher b is like half the price when they have sales and the quality is is is right there um it comes with a charger so yeah heavy hitters has a disposable but it's 0.5 grams and you have to check sometimes these disposals have 0.3 grams like is that a joke 0.3 grams for 50 and it's a disposable and i also always had this question are these disposables these suitable vapes are they running at cause a lot of them i used to get these bloom white sticks they were they were freaking great i haven't seen them in a while but you could see the level right you're like okay yeah the kinds of look up it kind of looks empty right but i would always wonder what about just the time not being charged i know some of them are different they use the wind of your air and so that's how the uh what do you call it um i know this word because i got a little bit into vaping when i put cigarettes like three years ago um for good for good i mean uh oh it's on the tip of my tongue it's the thing that makes the thing go like it's called a ma there's a ma involved whatever so some of them they use air they'll never need recharging but like for example this heavy hitters one i remember the direction said to place it flat and that charges it i was like interesting technology but i don't know and then it would look like there was more uh juice in there that was not used this one is aesthetically pleasing tests at this is the kush fly kushabi clear premium disposable vape i love their logo so much the b the black the gold so their packaging is it's soft i remember one of my mentors told me at one of my studios he was like make sure the next schedules that you print spend a little bit more money make sure they they feel good to touch this is like it feels nice it's soft there's a song i heard recently and he goes satin sheets for the bed they soft they're also really good for your skin and um if you want to avoid wrinkles you should uh definitely use satin sheets i was like oh duh like cotton kind of squishes your face and get them at ross for like 20 bucks so it comes with a charger so it charges so that is all that that i think about everything this is a gelato hybrid at 91.3 percent and yay hybrid again [Music] so um high potency high potency clear cannabis oil rechargeable [Music] could be [Music] i'll get that one down to a jingle so it's one gram i believe let's see one gram it comes with a charger that there for now um sometimes i like to see this is right out of the box i like to see if they are it's beautiful and i'll tell you i have had 10 of these easily very durable i like coffin [Music] wow this is lovely i was thinking yesterday don't worry people it's not the cold but it's the cannabis i was thinking yesterday i made a video and i was like i took a hit and i said i'm just smiling makes you want to smile i was walking my dog and i was like have i ever taken a hit of weed i've been like like [ __ ] angry i like to pratt", "MkSRS7QzefY": "i'm going to show you a fake glow cart versus a real glow cart real packaging fake packaging super big 10 of these are not going to fit in when a box meant for these that one came in this box 10 came in here see 10 cow this is also old boxes these are still floating around so just because your box looks like this doesn't mean it's fake just means it's old these are the new boxes new carts boxes i believe the cartridge itself is still the same good that's the carts this was a real glue cart i finished it a while ago and i just kept it in the box and didn't ever think i'd make a video like this um but my buddy actually got this one and i told him to get me one because i wanted to make this video he didn't charge me i mean he did charge me for it but i'm just going to give him a real cart instead it's showing the difference um charge me 20 bucks for it i normally pay about or two for these p 22 20 anywhere between 22 and 25 is what i pay for these right now it's not the best price but hey it works um this is the real one i'm sorry i mean i paid 22 to 25 for these these are the real ones not that um but as you can see there's something still in here it's a gold oil gold amber color oil all of them are they're all like this this is a fake one that should crystal clear they're not crystal clear but i don't know what the [ __ ] that is it's some weird [ __ ] and that's how it is when you turn it upside down it moves slow this is still like i think this is delta eight tell you the truth i think somebody stuck delta eight in a fake glow card because it's harsh as [ __ ] and it like gives you this weird like hi i only took a couple hits off this thing and try it out to see what the [ __ ] it was uh because my buddy was smoking them and uh they didn't do [ __ ] to him yet but you know i don't know it's one of those weird things i wouldn't i'm not going to smoke this [ __ ] i'm throwing this out after this video actually i'm going to keep it just for like you know future references never know make another video um but yeah that's another thing you can tell the fake ones you see the way it says glow right there for one that looks [ __ ] weird why does it look like that on the metal piece right here that shouldn't even be there um that's how you that's a dead giveaway your card's fake all cards that have that are fake glue has never done that has a california logo on it but that's that doesn't matter so this is another thing i was going to address right there it says c cell on there but that's fake because these aren't real c cells these are some shitty [ __ ] um but they've done that that's the fake one this is the real one and the real one it looks like it's actually like engraved in there like laser etched not engraved but it's like done with the laser that almost looks like yellow paint yeah this almost looks like yellow paint so not that is um the middle of the rod right here in the middle is super thick on this one too you can notice that this this metal rod right here is thicker than this one is see and if you say oh it's because the liquid is magnifying it or something i will show you another part of glows where's my [ __ ] battery yet give me one second guys this is my cart that i'm using right now you see [ __ ] is hella thicker still now rose isn't the best oil around you know you're still gonna get bubbles and everything those are just air bubbles something don't move when you turn it upside down so you know these aren't real clothes you can piece it oh it looks there's all those bubbles in it they're [ __ ] air bubbles you don't know [ __ ] don't talk [ __ ] did you see this i got [ __ ] boxes you know i don't have to worry about getting fakes i buy them by the box bro there's another [ __ ] box somewhere here by the box you know i'm able to [ __ ] track my [ __ ] i don't know about y'all i have like my plugs going directly from these vendors these glow vendors so we know a thing or two about the you know good carts for the price you know for a street car here in my state cost about 130 prior to tax for a gram car of distillate distill it not no special rso anything like that just distill it and i couldn't imagine paying more than 20 25 bucks for one of these things dude i just can't so yeah um you want to see you know be like oh that's a fake card still i'll [ __ ] pop open another one for you guys i glow even sent me this is one of their older masks they have new ones out now you can tell i put it through the machine they also sent me a hoodie but that [ __ ] was too small that is an xl i wear like [ __ ] 3x bro i'm [ __ ] 6'2 and 250 260 pounds dude come on help me out here [ __ ] i can't try and do this one [ __ ] hand in my ass here we go there's a fresh cart right here this is the uh cereal milk i wonder if that strains supposed to be sold anyways is this like one of those terpenes i don't know i kind of think i low-key just think it's different terpenes they add to their distillates so it gives it its flavor because it's kind of artificial you know it's an artificial flavor and for sure but um yeah no it's just uh cards are pretty you know all the same say glow extracts right there as you see california they come with seals the glow um then there's a couple's likes they should all always come in a box like this now these are the updated packaging like i said there's still these around because like let's just say i know a thing or two about them and they were still making you get some of these when you ordered the new ones and uh yeah you got the new ones you had to get some of these oh sorry i just got a message i was reading that and uh you had to order some of the older ones obviously get the new ones so they wouldn't be stuck with a [ __ ] ton of old ones you know nobody wants that and they wanted to get their supply out so that's what happened with that um besides that happy smoking you know i hope you really enjoy it um you know i'm just trying to help you guys not get ripped off like i said don't buy these big-ass boxes what's in a big-ass box where the cart doesn't fit snuggly like these carts fit snugly in here you know they move around a little bit but not much in here the cart's going to move around like [ __ ] crazy it's just not it's going to move you know that's a dead giveaway [Music] they don't even make these anymore but this is the same one of that box this one was the real one oh yeah this is another thing i know look towards this little extracts right here and right here says glow extracts there's a space between there shouldn't be that so yeah look out there guys don't get ripped off please", "xokGUN8-7IM": "hey everybody my name is nikki i'm the marketing manager for evergreen market um and i'm here to review a couple of products on behalf of respect my region's west coast weed tour super stoked thank you so much for having me guys um i love to smoke weed and you give me a great reason too so let's talk about constellations rainbow gelato vape cart constellation is super fire i don't know if you have any serious serious like smoke or smoker heady stoner buddies but they get down with this um for those of you that don't know hash oil rosin's made with just heat pressure there's no butane there's no propane there's no uh co2 any of that um so it's all just super clean and fresh and fire so watch me rip this and you'll see the moment i become stoned are you ready are you ready oh i mean give it up give it a second there it is there it is as you can see we have video evidence that there is some dankness happening here so the color of the oil is like honey this stuff is delicious i would put it on toast um but it's also tasty to smoke it i would say flavor it's got to be a solid 90. a peel definitely probably like an 80 or so maybe 75 just because consolation is you know you pay for quality um and they definitely deliver on the quality this may not be everybody this may not be the one for everyday smoking for everybody's budget um but definitely treat yourself every once in a while you deserve it you've done good this year and it's been rough um the the standout about taste obviously it's rosin you're going to get a little bit of that earthy a little bit of that planty um overall it wasn't too overwhelming of an experience potency it ripped what more can you ask for especially in a vape cart so i'd give that 90 um overall i mean i'm gonna buy constellation again obviously shout out way to go um and i recommend that you do too probably as long as you really enjoy the plant and really have a passion for the things that you smoke uh if you honestly are just one of those like weed as weed people maybe save your money let's let's be honest but if you want something special and if you have a really piggy palette when it comes to weed constellation will deliver i highly recommend um overall i would say let's give them a 90. um thank you hope you enjoyed this review watch me get stoned on the next one peace", "G1VQlA7A9R8": "what is up YouTube family boy Vasquez here gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys those who are new here I really appreciate you guys for subscribing to the channel and those who've been here you guys are awesome you know I really appreciate you guys taking the time out your day and watching my videos you guys are the MVP for that and if you guys have any questions and think about it you know you guys just want to talk [ __ ] you know I'll reply to you you guys know could probably be friends you know just comment down in the comment section and yeah guys but let me know what you guys been up to it is Sunday afternoon I'm just kicking back today you know I'm gonna be chilling at home so yeah guys if you guys have any good shows on Netflix let me know as well but today we have a special cartridge that like I've never thought to be honest when king pen came out they're really really popular but now they have a live resin like they kind of fell off you know cuz there was a lot of fakes and there was just I don't know they were just bad you know a lot of people they really liked kingpin but there are pretty good cartridges but you know I assume that they came out with the life resin line so I definitely had to go down to the shop and pick them up now they're half grams so I don't know if they have full grams yet but the packaging on these are [ __ ] amazing like you know it's like a ten by the tin box you know so it's really cool but yeah it's a half gram I've got it for like 30 bucks so let me give you guys a close-up on the on the packaging on the back the THC level is like sixty it's 61 percent guys so it's not as high so I mean the taste should be spot-on you know life residence should be always be good but you know kingpin a really shocked me when they came out with the light resin you know I was like what the hell because I thought pink paint just you know was regular distillate which it is but I don't know it was kind of weird seeing they came out with some light red and so some people had said you know to go check it out and they're pretty good so we're about to find out right now so the manufacturing date was January so it's a pretty fresh cartridge still I had paid $30 for a half gram so it should be good you know cuz the full grams gonna be like 60 bucks so you have this little sticker on the bottom and I grab the biscotti flavor because that's the one that stood out the most so we're gonna open it so has a little sticker in there where you can fi your product and [ __ ] like that and we're going to spill it damn it's really excited you nod I thought King pin fell off you know a lot of people don't really [ __ ] with king pin because there was a lot of fakes and they were just I don't know some people said they weren't good but to me they're a pretty good cartridges I really liked them a lot so the pill the little stick off I'm just gonna open the little thing [ __ ] here we have this little thing that came out pretty sure it's just like information you know it says the counterfeit the counterfeit prevention program ensures your product is authentic using a kingpin iZON it's the website where you can go check to make sure that you think is authentic your cartridge I should say which is pretty dope you know and yeah you guys can give you guys a little close-up on it it's cuz kingpin there was a lot of fakes and telling you the streets were flooded with kingpin a lot of black market and I'm pretty sure you guys know appreciate guys I've gotten one before so I personally have gotten a fake one before and it wasn't as good so this one has a little digit code on the on the little sticker we just ripped and you just type that up in little computer and you know it shows that you have an authentic pen which is pretty dope you know just to make sure so we're gonna go ahead and open this up and bam that is [ __ ] sick right there tell me now that is not dope right there guys that is like fancy packaging right there I've never seen a cartridge that came pretty sick like that you know it looks like something something that it looks like something expensive you know what I mean so that looks pretty good right there that's the first indicator which this is gonna be good so we're going ahead and take that out and there's nothing else so I'm gonna keep the uh I'm gonna keep this little box you know can probably put some doozies in it I'm in a couple joints you know take this [ __ ] off but this is what you guys came to look for so it's nice to man I'm also keep that it says kingpin on it and and on the back says made with a hundred percent recycled plastic which is pretty cool you know they feel kind of different which is pretty cool so we're gonna take that off I'm really excited about how they're getting the look and how they're gonna taste so I don't really expecting pet to come out with a light resin lines BAM that you have it guys it looks kind of little darker couldn't a live resin so we're gonna take these little rubber caps off and it says royal on it so I think it's like a collab with Roy I think it's like a different company because I seen a had royal on it so I didn't have kingpin so I'm pretty sure it's like a collab which is pretty dope and I was about time kingpin did something you know to come back but and they came back good with some live resin cards which is not bad you know and we're you guys close up and I'm going to flip it over and see if it's some nice thick oil this is a nice little day in there which is the half gram you know I'm pretty sure the coil absorbs some of it and it does not move at all guys and we're going to dry hit this yeah it's pretty weird cuz on the thing it doesn't say kingpin it just says row as you guys can see but I mean I don't care so we're gonna going that dry hit this and I'm going to see there's some flavors if I get some flavors off it this one's a biscotti so a biscotti is like how can I say to me a biscotti is like a cookie a cookie cross with something I'm not sure how it is if you guys are familiar with the biscotti straight let me know in the comment section below would really appreciate that I mean I smoked it before but I'm just like I said I'm not familiar with the cross it so you guys know and I'm not gonna lie to you guys this thing tastes like a cookie you can get you to get that nice clean Wow it's it's amazing guys it tastes like a cookie honestly if you guys ever had the the strain cookies exactly it tastes exactly like it so I'm really excited about that and I think we're gonna go ahead and hit it out of the yo can okay if you guys have if you guys are ever looking for a battery you know I'm not you know then there's sponsor me or nothing but you guys ever looking for a battery get a yo can you know order on their website or just go to the smoke shop any smokes just have it this shit's a [ __ ] [ __ ] beast you know I've dropped it in water it dropped so many times open beers within it still works you know it comes with a little magnet you just screw on bottom of the cartridge so we're going to do that I'm really excited man cuz it was about time [ __ ] kingpin came out with light resin which I've never thought they would you know I thought they would just stick to their normal distillate so here it is we got their magnet on there so make sure the battery's charged guys and let me know what you guys up to on this Sunday afternoon what kind of cartridges you guys smoking on and always don't forget to let me know in the comment section what kind of videos you guys would like to see as well so I know you know what what you bring out for you guys you know because there's times where honestly I go to the dispensary and I don't know what's a good cuz I don't like getting the same cartridges I mean I would but you know I like bringing out a new concept for you guys but if you guys would like to see some new some some of the different I mean some of this same cartridges are over and over just let me know you know I'll do it but yeah guys if you guys are smug along with me go ahead and do so we're about to get high so I'm going to drop this in and I'm gonna drop it in in the battery BAM so cheers guys if you got to smoke along with me go ahead and do so yeah really excited man hopefully hopefully it tastes good right like [ __ ] wow wow wow I'm not lying to you guys this [ __ ] is fired for kingpin a dual life resin honestly I thought it was a joke I thought it was gonna be as good because you know kingpin literally either solis people to come out with live resin and this [ __ ] tastes good it kind of tastes exactly like a raw garden but more of a Terp flavor in there like a strange Pacific flavor like this one's a biscotti and you really really get that cookie flavor him you know that earthy cookie flavor in this fire wow it tastes really good I'm going to hit it longer to see if it like chokes me a little bit so I can get high now I can explain to you guys how the high is it's just making me drool damn yeah this shit's fire guys I'm not you know I smoked a lot of cartridges since ever since I've been smoking I smoked a lot of cartridges before I ran through a lot of them and this this has to be one of the best life raisin cartridges I've tried i'ma have to compare it with the raw garden one day man this shit's fire it tastes exactly like would it like the strain if you guys had a biscotti it tastes exactly like cookie it's like fresh earthy clean taste - it's so good now the high you get a nice good of buzz you know I'm feeling good already I've smoked it in the morning I smoked a blunt but I kind of sobered up so that's why you know I decided to do the review so I can explain the high man but I feel good you know afraid for being 61 percent THC it's not a lot but it it also depends on the strain you know you also get different effects the THC level doesn't always got to be high to get a good feeling you know what I mean that's what a lot of people don't know cuz just cuz you hear it 90 or 80 percent doesn't mean all I'm gonna get high as [ __ ] it's not like that you know well some people it kind of is but to me like some strict like the strains you know they all got their own high so whether it's 60 80 per se you know just gonna is gonna get any hot so I'm feeling good right now you know I'm getting a nice little buzz so I'm going to hit it again just to you know the cartridge tastes good it tastes so good I can probably smoke it in one sitting but I'm gonna try and save it a little bit for the weekend so I'm going to hit it again before I take off gotta go to the store man I'm we're stuck I already booked and these things are so big if you guys ever see the kingpin man you guys you guys got to give him another try if you guys said [ __ ] kingpin before this is the time to give him another try man this [ __ ] tastes so good I'm not lying to you guys they had like four different kinds of flavors but like I said the biscotti ones the one that standard out the most so it is really good you know you get that nice cookie taste to it so do you guys ever see these you guys got a copper you know they're $30.00 1/2 gram right here in California in Modesto California that's where I'm from so I don't know they're probably gonna be twice as much over there from where you guys are from but over here at medical and recreational prices are the same so so yeah guys I really appreciate guys appreciate you guys watching my video and you guys stay tuned for more guys and uh hope you guys stay safe don't do no dumb [ __ ] and yeah just like and comment on the videos and don't forget to let me know what kind of videos you guys would like to see and you guys have a good day guys", "AIjt7R_71M0": "all right today got a brand new diamond cartridge it's an apple gelato hybrid pretty excited to try this one out since their

YouTube family boy baths is here I'm gonna be doing another cartridge of you today for you guys now today I had 10 ran into some new cartridges so nothing for like a little that like a catalogue that had gaming at the dispensary so about these new cartridges just explaining about like you know the new flavors that they had and like what they were about and [ __ ] picked up with this I was gonna get like a rock garden or like maybe like a plug and play some but I just didn't want to have the same [ __ ] you know I like trying new things you know it's not bad to try anything so you know that way you guys can like see what's good and what's not you know but these cartridges really grabs my attention there's a church Church cartridges I had never had it before the thing that really caught my attention was they have like this adjustable airflow you know which is pretty pretty dope you know I've never seen adjustable airflow on these cartridges I only seen them on like got 2020 vapor now if you guys had seen those where you could like that just like on the bottom yeah you can they're pretty dope you know you can hit them hard in it would be really smooth it which is pretty cool you know and there were like 40 bucks no $40 a car which is you know they they're pretty neon the marquee I've never seen them before and on the bots on the back that says their Instagram and whatever so it says super premium cannabis distillate you know so it's um it must be some pretty hard dis Allah you know it's a sour it's [ __ ] a super premium distillate you know it's pretty far cartridge guys for the price you guys can't complain so let me know how you guys been let me know how my new subscribers been I've been pretty good as well let me know how life's been treating you guys I really appreciate you guys watching my youtube video you know my videos as [ __ ] you guys are [ __ ] awesome for that you know for taking the time out yesterday and watching my videos I really appreciate that and [ __ ] trying to fix the camera a little bit but you guys are awesome for that and you guys just keep it up you know like an income that on my vetoes and you guys are my snapshot you know you guys always cool you know really appreciate you guys adding my snapchat and [ __ ] but yeah guys let's get straight into this cartridge this cartridge like 40 like $40 you know so also about the barrier that goes along with it Hey look is this for the thumb now so it's Asif so here we have the battery so we're just gonna go in the shimmery drop in the cartridge and ship but but yeah guys it's Sunday afternoon tell him not he has been um it's gonna gotten a little tab on it so it has a little sticker on the bottom so the THC on this is 81% it's a strawberry cough so it's gonna be good guys that I mean we finally we so we finally got the [ __ ] cartridge open after a while struggling you know they gotta like I might work on the [ __ ] cases or something but here we have the church or I don't know if it's just me but I have trouble helping this [ __ ] ship but yeah guys so the thing that really caught my attention was a the design of the cartridge and it kind of looks like a heavy hitter but it's like a really really different different company so we're gonna open it it's a nice really faculty and also really caught my attention so as you guys can see it's also so the coil itself compare this the size of the cartridge this is really really big guys compared to like you know that it's really really a big cartridge and like no joke guys right when I pulled out the cartridge you can smell the the terpene something smells really really fruity and the really thing that's really cool about these cartridges that not a lot of cars you just have to have this adjustable airflow so you guys can take big big clouds or you know you guys can get it really really smooth hit so so there's the cartridge itself right do the bullet test and this thing does not have a bubble in it this thing is like literally filled to the [ __ ] top so it has a really really thick oil in it big coil I mean so this thing should have some good airflow in it and I have this battery along to there you know it's the same battery for the cartridge so I had a copy you know had to it's a adjustable 900 battery the ma battery so it's it gots to be a good Betty so we're gonna pop it open just like that this battery was like twenty dollars so and also you know it's a surge protected so I don't know what I think it sounds like if it blows up on you or some [ __ ] but the max on this is like a four point one voltage so we don't we don't need that much so we're just gonna use the lowest setting on this it's pretty dope these guys packaging is pretty DUP you know everything comes the nice hard plastic packaging so it's pretty dope so it's a battery I really needed a new battery I mean that yoke and it works pretty good but to be honest with you guys I don't know if you guys are the same way but do you guys get tired of using the same [ __ ] battery for this cartridges like this time we're like I'm like [ __ ] I want any battery but I mean even though I don't need one I still want one so I don't know if things just mean I like using these stuffs all the time but here's pretty ears battery and here's the charger simple plug and play for the thing you know it says search on the over and here's the battery it's a nice thick like a brass knuckles really really thick so this battery right here should [ __ ] last you guys for a while the quality on it feels really good it's nice and heavy it has this little rubber tips on there we're gonna take that out and has a California warning sticker logo whatever so you guys know you guys smoking a good cartridge so the the quality on this is really really amazing I had this Cadillac that explained everything about it the oil and it looks really really thick it doesn't move at all and I'm recording uh as yes can see it has this little adjustable air flow net where you guys twisted so that's really really dope you know I had a cartridge before they had that it's the 2020 vapes the feature is something like that and they were [ __ ] fire so imma go ahead and try hit this and I'm gonna go and let you guys know what it tastes like oh wow I'm not gonna [ __ ] what you got your nama straight up guy up on sugar Coast [ __ ] you know if something's bad I'm saying it's bad you know but the tip the terpene profile this is [ __ ] amazing you know the flavor on this it's a strawberry coffee and it tastes like really really fruity you know that's really crazy I don't really think there was gonna taste that good but it tastes so fruity so you know we got this nice big thick battery the same same church on it and like the logo as I said as a cartridge as well so we're not going to see if it's charged hopefully it's charged man I don't know pause the video and alright so turns on so it's on yellow and I'm see that's on the middle one alright so we're gonna put on the 3.2 volt which is the blue light it's already going to screw the cartridge on it sure looks [ __ ] dope guys I'm not gonna lie to you it's really the quality on the quality on the battery and all the cartridges it's amazing just the way it feels in your hand it feels like if you're holding like like a nice gadget you know what I mean so it's pretty dumb guys so we're gonna close up as you guys see these these are really neat to the cartridges so we're gonna quote go ahead and close this little this airway we have here see you ask him alright guys my bad so how to delete some footage up my phone and you know get the video start again because I ran out of footage of storage so we have the cartridge here we're going to just take the sticker off you know just to get that [ __ ] out the way so we're gonna go ahead and hit this and if you got a smoke let me go ahead and do so I'm gonna get back to real quick I'm gonna be heading to follow me on snapchat go ahead and follow me you know yeah that's where I keep up posting updates you know about my lifestyle [ __ ] cheers guys we got this church here so we're gonna go and see this is really good I had to close this airflow so I'm gonna compare it whether it's open and closed I'm gonna tell you guys the difference so Cheers Wow you get this nice really really fruity strawberry taste you know that's [ __ ] awesome it's like and you get some actual terpenes in there I don't really taste like distantly to be honest it tastes like some really top-notch distally really really fruity guys so I'm going um you didn't really get a big cloud as you guys see I don't really get a big cloud with a little airflow closer so I'm going to twist it I'm gonna go ahead and open it and I'm gonna see if I can get a bigger cloud with that as you guys see I took a blinker really really thick oil you know you don't really get big clouds so we're gonna ahead and bump the [ __ ] voltage level on this siren garden one two three ICS conceived so I got in close the thing again and we're gonna hit it cheers guys smoke along with me take a blinker now you really do get this little bigger cloud yeah that's what you needed to do is pull up the voltage on that so you really get the same flavor but it tastes a lot way way better you get this nice fruity Strawberry Cough taste it tastes amazing for the price the cartridge was like thirty six dollars guys now you guys can't beat that to be honest it kind of reminds me of a what's a call you know it's kind of hard to burn so we're gonna go ahead and I'm going to open this airflow let me see what's the difference with the higher voltage oh wow tastes pretty good but to be honest you get a big you get a bigger hit whenever the thing is closed I don't know that's just up to me and it tastes a lot better but I think it's just a preference just depends on anybody but we're gonna flip the thing go over it just to make sure you know there's no [ __ ] bubble in there it's really really really really thick guys all honest it's like amazing if you guys haven't had these Trish partridges I guess you really check them out I would really ricky'll recommend them to for the flavor you guys really get a great great profile terpene profile so I'm gonna hit this again to see if get it cut for you guys I don't know if the batter needs to be charged or some book oh yeah you definitely get bigger clouds whenever the dings closed so yeah guys I'm the hive I really feel great you know I'm really like ready to talk [ __ ] some other [ __ ] you know I mean I'm usually quiet I'm the quiet guy but I guess a now it makes you kind of feel like you know you want to talk a little bit more you know makes you talkative and she like that cuz I'm really like the quiet guy you know you don't really hear me around like I've run a group I'm like the one that Lena talks less but whenever I smokes the teal of products and [ __ ] sativa strains it like makes you want to like I don't know just conversate more you know it makes you want to be out there a little bit more and that's where the kind of mission field right now you don't mix me [ __ ] there didn't know god makes me want to you know hope conversations should but I'm gonna rip this again for you guys and hope you guys are smoking log with me I'm gonna turn the voltage up to the highest setting which is on the red so cheers guys took a blinker and the taste still the same you know this oil is really different than what other distillate is get the nice big

stream review on a pure earth partridge and it's gonna be gelato how to go out this morning and pick up a nice little cartridge was running low so right up to Nirvana and shout to navona for always the great pricing the great patient service definitely one of the best in the valley in Arizona but uh jump into this cartridge like I said today around with gelato aka Larry Bird which is a nice 50/50 hybrid from the cookies family believe this is a bit mint cookies crossed with sunset sherbert so definitely Bay Area heavy but yeah let's jump into it it comes in this nice little coffin style which I always like that they do but uh kind of rip off the bottom here open it up nice little nice little style there anyway like the mouthpiece definitely a nice little suction style there pop off the bottom there so get this thing going not like I carry two pens usually one for the emergency backup you know just in case this one dies on me but I like the more temperature setting so that way I can hit it at you know the temperature setting that I choose rather than not just pull it until I feel so you thought you know I was going and shot the giorgio Pellegrino in the shot man don't listen to in the background over here definitely taste the fruitiness definitely don't lie to close a lot oh very nice very nice definitely one thing that is part of this that most people understand that there they're not full spectrum that broad spectrum which means that they're only attacking a small percentage of the cannabinoid system they're not giving you 100% high but you wouldn't be getting away with that you would be go with getting or smoking a flower but it does the job very tasteful a fruity definitely men cheese goes up by telling jokes anyway so next time I appreciate you between

that because that is one good point about it entry point great flavor a great knife 3.5 out of 5 let's go your host me and dads finding out with another review was sponsored by so jumpy stator pee", "ThGajqE3aAg": "all right myself y'all is your boy master blinky back again with another video today we're gonna be looking at this dab woods honey berry cart I definitely definitely am starting to get some strong opinions about dab woods and I will say they're not positive but either way stay tuned for the review all right so in the front of this tablets baggage it says 85% potency honey berry cart sativa one gram all says the same stuff on the back as I've read most people times before so I'm not even gonna get into that but pause that if you want to read it so looking at the cart we can see that the wax is a sort of lighter color not like straw but just a little bit darker and it is very slow moving which usually I would say is a good sign but knowing how this step was wax has been performing lately I'm not even going to look at that as a sign for quality analyzers are at least decent I always say that so it's got a white ring on the bottom and the wood tip as usual that's like dab woods signature at this point I like the wood tips because I do think that they hit nice and give good flavor so the atomizers will always be one of the strong points of Javel woods but anyway I'm gonna be hitting this car off of both my Cecil and three and my CBD five battery I use the CBD five because I think it's better for flavor and four hits but I use the Cecil m3 because it's the standard battery that comes with most actual dispensary cards anyway let's get into actually smoking alright also I got the honey berry cart loaded into my Cecil m3 let's just take the first rip on it Cheers [Music] so this one this is sort of interest right off the bat discards kind of interesting the flavor on it is very muted it's almost non-existent I'm getting very very very slight very slight berry taste really just tastes like I'm inhaling some juice and exhaling it but it's also very harsh it's hitting me right in my throat not in my lungs which is a bad sign I've been noticing some comments that get confused when I say dry hits and honestly I should explain it better so when I say I get dry hits usually I'm talking about my throat dry hits all my lungs also feel warm so I usually say like they feel full-bodied or warm but if I'm saying it's a dry hit I meaning that it's giving me a very dry feeling in the back of my throat which is not a good sign when it comes to carts bellows within that live resin cart that cart just felt very smooth and it felt full-body it isn't it made me feel warm in my chest and it was dry hits to my chest as well let me go and take another hit though and then I'll start wrapping up this first puff session cheers again [Music] sike by the way because uh I still have to hit it off the CBD v battery the hitting dad woods off of that C cell m3 back when I was first getting them that first batch that I got the hits would be very full they'd be very thick and they taste very like high once i've been getting off this new batch of the strawberry and now this honey berry one they're not very they don't feel like I'm actually hitting a cart I'm getting what feels like a high but it doesn't actually feel like it dissolute high it feels like a very very very weak in generic wheat high I've had been having other cars like this too it's a big reason why I'm not really a fan of dad woods anymore I'm hoping hanging it off the CBD v battery can produce some sort of better effect I'm on blue which is the medium setting so let's see how that goes Cheers [Music] turning this cart off of my CB d5 battery is definitely definitely producing a lot more vapor it's giving a much bigger and harsher hit than the m3 um I would say that I'm getting a bit tired but at this point this is probably my fifth hit I had to scrap some footage earlier so I lost some hits but this is my fifth hit off the cart I'm feeling pretty high but as I said it feels very generic it's nothing special it really doesn't even feel like a sativa I'm starting to get tired which usually happens when I'm smoking on work bad cards this cart really does not feel like it's at Eva oh it feels a lot more like an indica but of course I don't know who's putting I don't know what's being put into this part but I gotta say I'm not really a fan of it I'll take one more hit though Cheers [Music] right now my chest is hurting a lot my throat feels super dry and these his hurt a lot I'm starting to have a bigger problem with some of these fake cards because it seems like people are just not caring a lot less what they're putting into them in my area now and I'm starting to see effects like for myself that I'm a fan of I think I'm gonna end up doing another talk about fake hearts because I definitely have evolved my opinions since my third video I'm not gonna take a day to review this card I'm already gonna say right now I don't recommend it to anyone I probably look like I'm fated right now and honestly I am a bit faded but I'm not gonna suggest these to anyone because they hurt I don't feel like I'm getting a healthy high this feels like a very dirty high and it kind of hurts a bit it doesn't even taste like berries that much it's very very slight and yeah I'm gonna stop doing number ratings by the way I know this is probably my second review saying that we just in case you missed the last one I'm not gonna be doing number scales on my channel anymore simply because the numbers are relative to my opinion and really I'm making these videos to show you guys how to see fake cards if I'm see getting like a fake of a popular brand or if you are buying just fake hearts because you need them and you that's all you have available I'm just trying to tell you guys which are the better was that which are the worst ones to go for when it comes to dab was this batch for sure I would stay away from I believe the flavors are honey berry watermelon strawberry and pineapple now they got rid of banana which was my favorite I'm not gonna be recommending to apples anymore I don't really want to buy any other flavors but if you guys want me to like just pick up another one if you guys have good experiences with the watermelon or the pineapple I have not tried those yet let me know but either way I'm master bling see I hope you enjoyed this video I'm sorry it's a bit shorter because I'm not going to take a night to review this but I really really don't see myself finishing this card I will however take a last hit on camera just because I do want to make that up to you guys we're gonna be using the red dab cap and we're gonna be hitting my paint cam from daily high club that I sticker bond so either way I'm master blinky I hope you enjoyed this video please like and subscribe if you aren't already

yo what's good YouTube so today guys I don't know man late night video dude I've just been so busy lately with like overtime this weekend and just spending time with my family so having to you know having time to record a video was just so hard to super hard just like but today I had overtime it's a Monday you guys know I didn't put out a video earlier so that means I have to put out a video man you guys are getting the full fresh like it's 859 you guys are plugging the scene is at nine o'clock okay two minutes now sorry about that but you as a [ __ ] you like it by 10 o'clock so today guys is yes you see by the title of the video we got the Jenny extracts mm-hmm we got the skittles I might be sure if it's you know focusing or not but it's whatever man we're just going and going and go so hmm so this one manufactured on to 2219 packaged 425 so it's fairly new it's a little over a month just barely so let me see it's a indica dominant it's 83 percent THC 415 milligrams and oh I like the packaging dude I love the packaging the packaging on this thing is pretty amazing so let's go ahead and open it for you guys oh so pop this sucker open I still haven't opened it this is actually the first time I open it so pull out the little hack and then boom boom let's see what's in here Oh a cartridge that's not really filled up all the way what what is that dude it's not filled up all the way that's a weird but they got the wooden tip the wooden tip is a new to me I've never seen any weights with [ __ ] wooden tips on it so let's go ahead and crack her open I'm just trying to his review yah I'm saying you gem that dad man out here boys so let's go ahead and take the battery out we're doesn't even get straight into it man I hope you guys had an amazing Memorial Day weekend shout out to all the soldiers that have risked their lives you know for everybody out here man it's appreciated even though even though people want to say it's not appreciated you know it is appreciated you know there's tons of people just because this little group if people aren't supporting these soldiers aren't supporting the Memorial Day a holiday it doesn't matter you let them be [ __ ] let them be they obviously don't know how great this this data is how great I mean not the state like you know this whole country dude so yeah JD extracts skills let's get right into man trying to hurry up so cheers boys because they're 18 over 21 and over make sure you guys are hitting along with me let me know in the comments below what you guys are smoking on so cheers boys so right off the bat I'm hoping at the window hitting me too hard about keeper so right off the bat to Hungary sweatin like I was saying before I died there dude it was a little this is literally the first time I've smoked it I do I've been so busy like I said I haven't picked up this weekend I haven't done anything so that hate low-key hit me I didn't really get a taste of it but I'm headed again just for you guys so I'm getting like a skittles flavor with the taste like oregano what yeah it tastes like oregano dude so weird this is by far the I don't know dude it could just be like my my tastebuds right now but literally tastes like oregano with skittles but overall the potency it's pretty potent I would give it an 8 out of 10 the Terps are lacking big-time dude the Terps there's no Terps there it's just straight-up dislike if you've ever had like just straight-up desolate like plugging play like that's pretty much what it is just straight-up dissolute you know turps added how's it very very oily taste to it too so I'm gonna take another hit for you it was up hmm it's not bad like I don't get that oregano taste anymore I just get like a very very subtle skittles flavor it's not bad yeah man Sogeti extracts it's a it's a like I don't want to hop on this train but simplistic he did a review on this but he did it I think he did an alien OG I'm not sure and he said that it was a good mid-level cartridge and I kind of agree with him in that point like it I would say maybe if you're a beginner this would be something that you should be trying to get at yeah it's definitely like on the lower quality that's kind of why you don't really see this too often out in the in dispensaries and things like that delivery services you know so I actually came across this because I was like dude what do I get look I was like what do I get I tried everything I can't keep giving my viewers the same thing so I decided to do this you know I'm sorry it's all right there I'm not a bad cop yeah I would say mid mid entry level just straight up desolate you don't really taste much yeah late at night doesn't I'm not really getting anything how do I do so whatever I'm man", "8O4OJAIX1jQ": "so

discussion here at the site when I saw that friendly farms was releasing a full gram cart which was knit which is a new thing for them you know what I mean which I had no idea I'm relatively new to friendly farm hindsight 20/20 if you don't have to sell the full grams don't you know what I mean like and the surprising thing is is that this was pricey but it wasn't you know it wasn't like the 50 $60 half gram and this is still connected cured residents now they were known for the live resin whenever they did to collapse this is cured which if I'm not mistaken and it doesn't take a scientist figure that out cure it I'm sure is what just cleaner live resin and it's one gram brand friendly farms came out with a 1 gram cartridge right now when I had heard of that I was just like damn I hope it's not as expensive as half luckily is really not as I think they actually lowered the prices this was $60 almost 70 same for the half gram the biscotti cross with gushers biscotti cross with

google google baby baby good", "fSNDZ9HQnQk": "[Music] all right guys what's up simplistic here back with another video i'd like to mention that randy is filming this whole entire video on his camera so the video quality is going to be a lot better but if you didn't see from the b-roll all that good stuff i do have three buddies i mean you've already seen it but uh basically i bought a distillate one and a live resin one but the distillate has live resin terps and uh it is a form of live resin to me so for those of you who say it's not realized to me it is all right but uh one of these are actually ben's and we're gonna give him right here thank you but he's also gonna be in the video shout out to be legit also subscribe to rj eats and i'm saying the link will be in the bottom description below all that good stuff but for this video we have two batteries we have a stick battery from the chill and we have your typical box battery uh from the brand das vape so we're definitely gonna try both of these these are both sativas as well one's clementine one is train wreck and uh for those of you who want to see the differences this one the green one is actual live resin this one's distilled with live resin terps and as you can see this one has ten percent more terps or ten percent terps while this one only has uh four but what this lacks inter uh percentage they actually have a lot more not a lot more but more thc see as you can see right here total cannabinoids like 80 something this one's like 70. that's the difference between distillate and live resin live resins generally 70s maybe 80s if you're lucky with distillate being 80 to 90. so um i'm going to open these and uh i'm just going to take some hits i don't know i'm going to title this video maybe buddies live resin and distill it live resin terps i don't know what i would call it but something along those lines and uh just let me know in the comments how you liking this video quality you know what i'm saying i appreciate mandy for uh filming this whole episode with this stuff i don't say but right off the bat opening this smells very lemony i believe the prominent oh wait i thought it was there right so put that in you can see the color of this the color of this distillate with the live resin terps is generally going to be a lighter more green or yellowish color i mean it even says in the box right look at the colors compared to them the live resin right here is uh generally going to be darker but distill it with live resin terps gonna be a a yellowish greenish color yeah got it got it so yeah did you take the first hit well this is an action i don't know autofocus is pretty [ __ ] fire okay yeah standing still is a little harder but moving around like it's i'm wondering that's how it's gonna work with the app too because the aperture you can lower the aperture a lot further down on that on the 22 millimeter that i have yeah so this one's the captain kush this was what ben chose as you can see let's just mix them up and [ __ ] damn that's fine let me see oh [ __ ] yeah very good that one's a live resin on the right no these are both the distally with the live resin terms [Applause] but you'll see the difference sorry about that broke this box this is the [ __ ] that [ __ ] all right right here get that see you can see the colors oh yeah yeah the one in the middle yeah this one has 10 turfs these ones have four percent but these have a higher percentage in thc or cannabinoids so uh this one's yours before i forget and we're gonna just take it take a hit off all three i'm saying who's calling me cheers [Music] hello no gotta give one to the camera man um yeah i got it um it's auto focus yeah i'll do it for you oh [ __ ] that's dope go no wonder you're far back yeah i was like what the heck that bigger crop it's it's uh uh just randy oh my god it looks dope uh yeah damn you can feel this glance working when the it's shaking so we have to switch the spot real quick guys because the kitchen is being occupied but randy just took a hit off the train wreck cartridge how'd you like it it definitely hit right definitely hit yeah honestly you're paying 28 for a gram of this right yeah that's why i bought two more i mean uh this is like my third one that i bought of the white one because some i don't know why i i seem to like the distillate live resin turps better than the live resin one and i don't know if it's just me it's a lot cheaper too maybe that's uh it tastes good to me i don't know but ben hasn't taken a hit off this this is the clementine i mean trainer okay what's up alexis oh i still got a pretty good angle of it because i got in there in time i was still uh like last time i thought it would turn out i was like so no we got the live resin one of the clementine so if you're not awake all right so i'm gonna take a hit of this off this battery you guys know this battery hits okay oh this is a good shot holy [ __ ] this one's a lot smoother the the library is a lot smoother this one uh i feel like it hits a lot harder maybe that's what adds on to the harshness to it you get a fatter hit off the distillate one because maybe distillate is a thinner oil even though it's still thick it's a lot thinner i gotta get out the shot that was kind of weird there you go i love the cart whose was this one this is the the clementine with 10 turks one was wet last one was i need to try it again this one's good though i don't know i like the this this one tastes good though yeah it tastes more like natural yeah okay and then we're going to try tastes like actual dab now so since this is his he's going to try it first and it's going to be a winker cbs can you bring his calling no yeah [Laughter] this is actually ben's so when we went to authentic today i i came with the idea of buying a liquid live resin or a live resin one and a distance live resin turf one and then ben also came along and purchased one as well because he tries he tried my buddy's car before and he liked it you know and it's 28 you really can't beat that but yeah i'm gonna try this now um the total for all three of these was only 86.50 that's pretty good that's hella good usually that's like almost grabbing a half maybe that ground and 20 quarters i mean a quarter that 20 that 20 quarters [Music] and you can see his pores and [ __ ] oh [ __ ] dog though all right so [Music] so oh this one's a lip do you change the brightness yeah did you die it still look nice change it oh go hold on we got to fix that though no it's cool it's cool looks good it's not too bright no it's better now but the other one wasn't wasn't that bad it was still bright but you guys hear that joe rogan in the background you feed me that's the biggest [Music] all right so um uh all three you guys like the live rest one better uh probably the what was the first one that was the train wreck i like that one better yeah but the close that the second one is going to be the live resin one that's my birthday um but to end off the video guys i am going to take a hit off both at the same time and uh i don't know i'm going to title this video maybe somewhere along the lines blinking both buddies parts i don't know something like that um but yeah look at both legs clicking both buttons so cheers [Laughter] [Music] that's for you guys we're gonna end it off with uh randy taking a hit i'd like to thank you guys for uh watching the video and also randy for being a part of it and using his camera always also be legit for taking those blinkers even though he didn't want to and uh you know what i'm saying i can obviously i can really tell the difference between my camera and uh randy's camera with the the landsat oh [ __ ] you don't have to hold it in bro [Music] all right guys so as you can see it's about done so cameraman has been switched but we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video just another buddies cartridge video i've been buying them a lot lately because i really [ __ ] with that they're really affordable and high quality at the same time you know i'm saying i don't care for these 80 gram cartridges or fifty dollar half gram cartridges and i could care less for that but yeah other than that hopefully you enjoyed the video like it subscribe all that good stuff and see you guys [Music] you", "iLs3ho8cCYM": "hi everyone welcome to another west coast weed tour review i'm going to be reviewing the king roll tonight which is a cannabis infused wrapped in keith pre-rolled joint uh it is triangle mince flour and gelato oil it weighs a total of 1.3 grams it is testing pretty well at 35.57 percent thc so overall i'd say i love the presentation i think the little graphic with the guy with red eyes is kind of cute um product appeal i mean this is one of the prettier pre-roll joints infused pre-rolled joints that i've ever seen it's pretty descriptive too with the flower type and the oil type on it i'm gonna open her up i really like glass packaging for joints i think it's really pretty you know the color is a little dark for the keef um but it's not too bad really nice smells very fresh smell wow definitely getting gelato coming through which is interesting that's from the oil allegedly and then triangle mince the triangle is a pheno of og kush so that'll be fun um dry it a little bit i guess that's pretty sweet pretty funky so that's awesome like i said it says 35 thc and there's no cbd the only thing i would say about an infused joint is i don't love when there's keef on the outside just because it always drips on me um and then i'm always really skeptical of oil infused joints because they tend to clog but other than that pretty exciting wow that lit really nice pretty good flavor a little harsh from the oil i don't recognize the brand of paper but it looks like a rice paper way more into rice paper than hemp for whatever reason it has a pretty strong burn to it not gonna lie i'd say it's definitely gonna get the job done the taste is pretty palatable it's not dripping at all so i'm impressed by that although my mouth is a little sticky more information there is a qr code on the packaging so i can scan that and find more information but it does have the batch id the email i'm sorry the website not the email batch id um yeah uh and i would definitely recommend this this is a california product so anybody looking for an infused joint in california would enjoy this product i think overall i'd rate it pretty high actually probably like a seven and a half for for an infused joint yeah i'm pretty impressed thanks guys have a good rest of your night", "KdpVntWyFOk": "hey what's good everybody jay ping here checking in respect my region.com here today with special guest justin cures what's good doing a west coast we tour review featuring the buddies brand forbidden skittles liquid diamond live resin one gram baked cartridge i'm excited we've got a buddy's brand vape battery it's going to be an exciting time now the cool thing about this particular west coast we tour review is that justin's review his score is going to be the official review score for buddy's brand why i work for buddy's brand so to be fair and unbiased you're up i need you to be extra tough you're on camera always honest with you i know you're always honest stay honest okay i'm not paying you there's no money right now i've given it's a 6.5 all right here we go but be honest so what we're working with here is the one gram cartridge see we got a buddy see cell cartridge 76.7 on the total cannabinoids thc 74.61 terpenes are always listed right so buddies greenbox terpenes are always listed on the back we've got eight point two one percent on the total terpenes we've got three terps always displayed which terpenes do we have this beta caryophyllene limonene in eight yep yep which is from hops i think this is going to get me this is going to bring like that stoned uh that's like the one word that one word i think i'm like really that's gonna get slightly 8.2 woody yeah it's going to be good 76.7 total contaminants with our cartridges i always recommend a four to six long like vapor rip you if you have a battery that can change temperatures put it on the first like lowest temperature setting or the second the second lowest and you're generally pretty solid if you have a battery like this one that just pulls then four to six seconds should do you just fine if it doesn't if you pull it and your battery doesn't like do anything then consider changing out your battery that's how you can really tell it's that real deal live resin liquid full spectrum liquid diamonds extract is harvested fresh frozen and processed at sub-critical temperatures are you ready this is real live resin nothing but no atoms this is that low temp life right here five seconds no blinkers only type of [ __ ] you don't want to do a blinker and burn at all yeah don't burn the terps all right let's see i love it clouds right there see what i was saying oh i get that taste that skittles are right off the bat man that's bomb that's really smooth really smooth probably one of the smoothest uh live residence panda i've never tried it usually sometimes i'll get like uh which one we'll call which is harshness in the background right like super citrusy vapes tend to be kind of harsh sometimes right because it's so like potent or powerful tasting right right this is the key word really is smooth light there's a piney gassiness in there like the turks kind of roast the nostrils right but then that when you finally exhale it out you get a slight citrus just like anyone you know i'm really i'm really getting the uh uh um the humeline and the karyophiline coming through because when i was blowing it out it's almost like it's like a it's like a um like a cider almost yeah it's like a right it's like a earthy cider citrusy earthy and then the woodiness yeah i really like the color i really like the taste i really like the flavor um i mean everything speaks for itself like everything is the high letting you know what it is uh right off the bat seeing the terpene profile i'm like okay this is gonna get me stoned this first hit i feel uh i feel like calm i kind of feel it in my legs a little bit what do you feel and i feel uh that indica high like you're where you get it behind the eyes you know and already making money what do you feel like behind the pressure in your eyes because that's what i'm really getting right now is just like i want a homing sensation i want to squint and i'm also like you almost could just go to sleep just puffing on this bin it tastes really really good and the high is immediate in terms of both the body feel and like a slight burst of energy as well get it out the nose just to get just to get more of those major curves and that's how i kind of like you know if that if that really like is a burning sensation sometimes i'm a little iffy on the pen that's why i was saying this one's really smooth no harshness even with that i'm not even no no phasing over here and i'm i'm stoned presentation appeal i'll think consider all these things right now okay there's a number out there i want you to marinate on it presentation appeal the color the taste the smell you can smell the turkey you want to get stone buy this banana potency more information available would you recommend it overall what are you thinking i'm thinking i would recommend this especially this strain like i would say go find this because uh two hits and i feel like i took a dab yeah two doc feel like i feel like i took a dab nice dad you know um and that's hard from from a pen to give you that such a head change so that's like really upping the score for me um and then also i like i said i really like the color on it um yeah this packaging's there your major terps you letting me know the potency uh doesn't really show me anything on cbd but that's okay that's not everything that says that happens um but you're showing total cannabinoids and that's what matters that's what matters so overall i'm gonna give this a nine a solid nine i think what would be missing is just maybe more i need to do that well that's what i was going to say just more of the information on on what like this specific strain is going to do to me what it's about and that would be it that would be it i mean everything else is is letting me know this is this [ __ ] is what it is it's fire yeah that's what the color the color is come on come on that's consistent right there so but uh i know you guys you all heard it here and also from the rosin head himself fresh as well yeah this is this is our newest drop really good solid night i tried to bring i tried to bring some the buddies maybe maybe throw some more info on there it doesn't hurt people want to know i want to know you know what's up with this strain and that's about it other than the terps you guys are hitting on t nine club well very much appreciate the honesty man and the transparency on what you're looking for thank you this is jay ping

follow justin curious we've got a lot coming so thank you guys for the love let me know what you guys think in the comments we will see you all in the next review peace", "clGjauiXKDo": "all right guys what is up today I'm back with another video or actually the last video you guys saw was actually the same day yesterday you know I'm filming them the same time basically I have goddamn scoured og the rest of this pot here we had gelato my hands I hit this it's kind of weird when I paint this kind of like tea but I'm gonna go ahead and put into the dizzy so alright it's on you guys let's go ahead yeah so that is so much sweeter oh that tastes so much more sweeter you guys and more flavorful just like with the battery oh it's a [ __ ] beat guys oh [ __ ] all right but there's way more sweeter can't it's like birthday cake from busy I've had that one before this kind like that I'm doing that rib like I said really sweet it tastes almost kind of like like a real birthday cake like you know with the frosting and [ __ ] the vanilla one you know guys how it tastes like it's pretty good you guys took I'll acid and then I'll kind of show you guys how the high is because I am high off the cartridge that just did it now so yeah I can take a glass here really tasty card this is my first car sister that had like that taste is like like sweet like pastry types feel like dessert because the other ones just taste like [ __ ] candy this one tastes good so yeah hopefully you guys enjoy this review", "S_PLcfNv_gg": "[Music] p2pt [Music] what is up y'all p2 peeps welcome to season 3 everybody and for our video here today we're gonna be checking out some himalaya super sour diesel for the most part i don't really like distillate stuff right but there are some good distillate brands out there and himalaya is for show one of those so i had their live resin first if for those of you who are veterans of the channel you guys know i did try out uh something a long time ago but before we go and more into that let's go ahead take a hit y'all thank you guys for joining me for season three and uh once again is that super sour diesel from himalaya vapor and i got that battery from him too right here so cheers up everybody hope you guys are enjoying your day or whatever time it may be when you're watching man cheers [Music] it's a tiny little hit there just because we want to get that flavor so a big thing about these this himalayan distillate cartridge so far is that flavor man on the box here it says terpene rich you know what i'm saying and this is for show terpene rich this tastes phenomenal like out of all the distillates i have had this definitely sets in the smoothest you know hits the smoothest and i'm not getting too much scratchiness from my throat there and it definitely has the most kind of like cannabis kind of taste if that's a word kind of busy but um you know it doesn't taste like artificial flavors or fruit or anything like that it just tastes like some really good terps like you know that you could probably you know find you know your normal flour and all that so that's that's what we're rocking with here man i know i didn't say the percentages but here we go we got 91 total active cannabinoids in this one so this cartridge for show can pack a punch so that's the good thing you know they're not really listing out that thc percentage which isn't a bad thing for me that's normally a good sign when i see cannabinoid percentage over thc percentage you know we all want that you know uh uh entourage effect you know full spectrum type of high and uh you gotta appreciate it with a product like this man so let's go ahead and take a blinker now and i'll talk more about what i'm tasting and [ __ ] so cheers everybody [Music] oh man now that hit packed a freaking punch man so this is a sativa strain not exactly one more like my favorites you know what i mean like uh sativa is not exactly what i prefer to smoke on but a super sour d is a classic and i am digging the flavors we're getting here pininess some sour there not it's not too crazy of a sour um i know sometimes when i try super sour diesel that limonene sticks out hella tough and it makes it taste a lot more lemony instead of like just regular kind of like like a sour tinge and that's what i'm getting here you know i'm not getting too much of a citrusy sour i'm just getting like a quick little undertones of it with a little tiny little bit of sweetness but mostly that gassy kind of piney flavor so that's it's good stuff man it's real good stuff okay so for those of you who are curious man we're working with about 431 milligrams thc 1.2 milligrams of cbd well that's that's all i can say about this you know the cartridge so far guys i like the flavor it is indeed terpene rich 91 total cannabinoids this thing will smack you and um you know it's just a smooth cartridge man unless you're taking a fat hit you're probably not gonna cough much off this one it's really smooth so we're gonna take one last hit here end off the video and i hope you all have been enjoying it and i hope y'all go check out some more himalaya products man they make great great stuff and be sure to watch out because guys let me go pull this out real quick we are going to have another himalaya product pop up soon this one is the blueberry muffin live resin cartridge i've been waiting a long time to open this one so thank you guys for watching let's take one more hit here and before i take this hit guys don't forget to like comment subscribe share the video whatever you want to do all that [ __ ] man but yeah thank you guys so much and [Music] cheers yes this [ __ ] is guys michelle so this has been p2 peeps and i hope you guys are going to be enjoying more content and things coming soon from me man so p2 out peace", "KWbodcspzeo": "welcome to the shed this is ice town with images coming at you with another Mary's medicinals product review this is the last one other before I got of those only because as I said in my other previous videos I've already done the sugar cookie one before which I did like so we're gonna jump straight into skywalker OG indica seventy seven point one seven percent with zero CBD so scott walker OG so we're just gonna open this up you're gonna get into it once again like i say in most of my videos anyone and everyone that's been commenting on my videos lately much appreciated I really do hope I answer your guys's questions to the best of my ability class I mean most of it is just me getting the information oh sorry from the internet myself try to contact some companies here and there they don't always get back here and or respond but I'll keep trying and see what I can come up with the newest news I just saw today is that a just started the licensing for recreational sales on November 1st they're talking about December 1st being possibly around the time when they start first opening up their sales to just recreational 21 and older users patients whatever you want to refer to yourself as um so if that's true these reviews are about to get [ __ ] lit because I will have no middleman I will be going to get exactly what I want or things that I think look really good I don't got to rely on somebody going into the store for me then I don't have to be overcharged by a middleman and pay $40 for something somebody's paying 25 for as I've stated I understand how drug sales work and how people are trying to maximize their profits understand all that [ __ ] but from a consumer standpoint it sucks so once again we're gonna be hitting it out of the elevat-- see you roll battery the one that they sent me we're gonna dry hit this and see if we can get any flavors out of it it's almost like that taste you get from like black licorice not quite as predominant but pretty close and that's if I can come up with another word by the end of this video I will but I'm not getting any citrusy or very flavors coming off of this as of right now I'm gonna guess from previous ones I did that it's more of an earthy undertone one but I can't remember what I said in that last video when I did the claw carts which also they're claiming that sometime in March they have actual or sometime by March that they have an actual cloth store that you could walk into and 21 and older purchase your stuff here we go it's almost like a flowery taste way different than the taste I got from the clock arts not bad the aftertaste part in the back your throat's a little harsh just a little nothing nothing too drastic but it's whatever that last little bit of taste is that rolls across the back here throw it's like like I'm definitely gonna go on a limb and say this isn't my favorite marriage medicinals that I've had yet this isn't something I'm gonna be smoking on I will be selling this one not saying that it's bad but with the flavor profiles and the things that I prefer this isn't it I have a buddy and a couple other people that I would recommend this to because they like this stuff like the flavorings that come off of this anything I pretty much haven't liked or didn't enjoy as much they've all seem to love it so it may just be me and me being picky I I don't know once again excuse me guys so that's the Mary's medicinal Skywalker OG indica not bad I don't feel it up in my head like I do with a lot of the sativas I feel like a level of calm slash chill coming on so predominantly that is what I'm this video is all about is that this next part is just me chit-chatting and smoking on something else for a second nothing I'm not even going to talk about what's in it not even gonna say anything else but you know that's because it's about Mary's medicinal not to wax I'm gonna hit in the video now I have done a review on that wax and I did a video of it previously from healing tree Wellness Center it's one of my last like four or five videos clearly I have over filled this because the wax is spitting out the top just trying to heat up a little bit of this oil build up around the threads is loosened apparently there's a bunch in there still so we're just gonna rip it and just chitchat some more so if any of you have heard anything else about what I was just talking about about the legal sales and stuff that I didn't mention in this video comment below for any of the other subscribers just to pass the information around as I said if people could start telling me like if you're not in Michigan tell me what you're paying per ounce program per whatever where it comes to wax oils flower you know it's just interesting to know I used to get that kind of information out of High Times Magazine and I just haven't bought one of those magazines in a long time nothing against them I just I just smoked my shin go to the store and buy it but this so l VAP C roll now I'm just gonna take a couple little damn ribs off of the auricle which is also an ama product but so if that all goes the way it's planned or they're talking about that's amazing I can't wait like I mean I've been waiting for this since like I think 2015 2016 when they first started talking about the recreational then I think it was like a year but you're so following that where all the [ __ ] that I call them petition signatures didn't they didn't do something with it correctly so all 500,000 of them were useless and then boom here we are we got it it's on its way and I can't wait and I hope that they use the money for what it's supposed to be for hope the kids get their [ __ ] books help fix the roads fix bridges do what needs to be done in this city and even if it doesn't get it all done you know if we'd sales help that even a [ __ ] fraction then something good came up if it helps one kid get the school supplies he needs so he can actually [ __ ] learn in school instead of go there every [ __ ] day and hate it and I'd rather go out there and [ __ ] make money on the streets or whatever the [ __ ] situation is you know if it educates if any of the money goes towards that and it helps keeping schools open in Detroit in any surrounding city that is a huge bonus and the guess rich Gretchen Whitmer Whitmer had said that every single person would have to smoke close to $2,500 dollars worth a month okay no I don't agree with that assessment I feel that you're gonna get way more tax money then I think you're giving it credit as soon as legal sales hit and you add your six to ten percent 12 percent [ __ ] tax on it so you're paying like say 50 for a normal car or four for 130 or 140 on some [ __ ] used to pay before for a hundred on just gladly accept that [ __ ] like [ __ ] it just gladly accept it pay that [ __ ] money hopefully fix roads hopefully help schools and its cost of doing business at the end of the day you want to be out of legally walking or someone buy it and that's what they want in return for you to be able to do that so once it's implemented and everything's going on in a year or two go by I bring it bring it up at your City Council meetings about the sales tax on how it's unfair and then start bringing it down a little bit you know get it down to like maybe like a 8% and then you know it's not so bad you're only paying like five six bucks on like a forty dollar card or some [ __ ] like that the math is all just guesstimating I am not that good at math so if you want to check those numbers go for it you're gonna realize that I'm not smart at math but I think of uh I saw another brand of carts recently on the THC Detroit website I'm gonna go back and do some research on those and see what I can find I'll get the name of it and I will end up putting it in another video so that hopefully some of you guys have tried it and then you can let me know what you feel about that and if I should review it I'll probably just review it anyway just because that's what the [ __ ] channels for you know so with that being said I'm gonna cut this video I would say short but it's a long one Scott Walker OG mares medicinal it's good just don't really like the aftertaste and personally myself not saying that a lot of you won't like it but it is still far far [ __ ] better than any of the mitten extracts that I tried if you're looking for a new rig this is the one I strongly suggest at the moment suggest I pronounce that all [ __ ] weird C roll you know pretty pretty uh pretty convenient and on a blank on the [ __ ] word I'm looking for like you can conceal it it's whatever I'm not gonna [ __ ] sit here and try to figure out what word I was looking for or the a oh babe Oracle the three-in-one vaporizer if you need something portable for some wax flour and oil so whether it's this one or this one Hale date.com contact them anyone go ahead mention the shed or I start images in any of the inquiries that you send this company and uh I don't know you watch my videos and that you enjoy the or you're interested in a product I get nothing from them for doing it and I don't have any codes for 10% off or any of that kind of stuff because I'm not actually being sponsored by them I'm just reviewed their products that you could go watch those videos and I am enjoying using them to smoke my products right now so like comment and I will see you guys in the next [ __ ] video peace out 18 and older disclaimer thing is gonna be happening in front of my videos here soon I got a thing about it so it's nothing against you guys just I got to do it and children shouldn't really be watching me smoke dope well piece of [ __ ] out guys have a fantastic night and I'll see you in the next video", "eC4XsUNW2_I": "[Music] what's up everybody welcome back to a TC spot Here I am bringing you a half gram

know if you recognize that or not that wasn't even a blinker in Wow nice cloud tastes good powerful now harsh on the throw either it's always a good moment when you find a cartridge as you know lives up to his name or that has potential to teach you purchase again because sometimes your cartridges in this line and that strand is whatever or it company is whatever or something subtle but a lot better companies have come out now so that's something one off the word about now I wanted to the future 2020 I'm loving it this is the half gram again mochi gelato and a lot of CBD and I'm a big fan

so guys this is the first time i've ever done a q a ever what i did the other day is i asked a question on instagram doing a q a for youtube dropped some comments there was hundreds and hundreds of comments so i went through got everybody's name that i want to get the questions from and here they are so i wanted to make this interesting since we can't go outside how am i going to murder these things just sitting in the house i'm going to take double blinkers as much as i possibly can so before i get into this let's go oh my god i won't do double quick like i said these are strong as [ __ ] and i just realized i can't see when they stop blinking and it's covered in duct tape so maybe i'll just hit it as long as i can okay guys this first question first q a ever on youtube jan starlos this is from jan starlos what's the most expensive pound you've ever bought i remember it was girl scout cookies it's when the craze was really [ __ ] high the tickets were high as [ __ ] but for me at the time when i was way younger i was selling it so i didn't give a [ __ ] how much it was as long as i was making money on it my friend introduced me to this guy i go to his house he tells me the price and in my head i'm like are you [ __ ] kidding me i paid 3 600 and i'm in california 3 600 for a pack here is very [ __ ] high i don't know about anybody else in other states i'm not used to getting tax like that i was not used to paying that much now yeah i see 5 000 packs all the time i understand the branding the hype i get it they're selling it somewhere i get it i'm just trying to smoke it so i'm not going to pay that so yes 3 600 bucks most i ever spent here's the next question talei dot mrcl don't know how to say your [ __ ] i'm sorry if you could smoke with anyone dead or alive who would it be also much love from germany thank you from la i appreciate you so much the first thing i ever sold push trees wise the first sweater the first sale the first day was to germany

someone a dead celebrity who would it be it's always gonna be adam sandlin chris farley just remind me of being younger and when everything was dope as [ __ ] still before i even smoked weed or anything i was just it was just comedy to me whoa are you [ __ ] serious oh my god oh my god wow this is so much harder than i thought it was going to be here we go that's what she said okay the next question is from prez dot walker before you came up with dopaziola as a name what names were you thinking of any cringe-worthy ones mac dre is one of my favorite rappers ever andre nicotine one of my favorite rappers ever they have a song called andre and andre look it up mac duration says he's dope as yola and i thought it was the dopest [ __ ] ever dope is yola what does that mean to me yola is slang for coke so i know a lot of you guys like why are you talking about coke and your name you're a weed person but what is slang for coke dope drugs [ __ ] like that right so i figure dope as yolo so dope is coke dope as dope so that's how i interpreted it it's dope as dope dope as dope kids nothing is doper than dope i tried to get them to save for graduation and they wouldn't do it because

entire life i was getting a bath in a sink by my great grandma i remember the faucet was above me the water was coming in i don't know about other mexican kids but you all got showers in the sink we all did that [ __ ] so that's my first memory i can literally look at the room and i can't tell you the co oh this this color here i can't do that but i can tell you everything in it like i know where

cool let's do a little slight music video montage in my house since we can't [ __ ] go anywhere [Music] so [Music] foreign [Music] okay you ready all right guys i decided to do a story time because we're on quarantine and why not i'm so high i almost feel sick we filmed two story times with two story time joints right before this video i gotta wake up i do story time so i'm trying to wake up and try my best let's do it here we go story time this story time is about [ __ ] i feel sick rosie tom's dying for the first time ever i had to take a little break i feel hella dizzy the first time i did this challenge it was two stizzy pots half grams these are full superb grams [ __ ] me up way more than i thought it would [Music] okay guys this story time topic is a mini story time like all of you guys i've snuck out of my house hundreds of times too many to count so this is what i used to do from about 14 to 16. and my mom thinks she caught me but she never caught me years later i actually uh no i know i called you back no you didn't no you didn't i know you didn't because you weren't there you would have rushed in and started socking me you're a damn liar since i was a little tiny kid i've had insomnia bad i have insomnia today i'll have it tonight and tomorrow when i was a kid i'd have to wake up at like six or seven after going to bed at four just sitting in my room all night trying to sleep about 14 15 i just started ditching school i was so it wasn't even just i could go get high do cool [ __ ] it was i was just so [ __ ] tired i wake up like oh dude i can't go to school my head's throbbing i feel sick as [ __ ] just because i was malnourished as [ __ ] and i was not sleeping right i was always sick of [ __ ] always in high school sick as [ __ ] i was doing drugs not eating right [ __ ] up when i lived on la crescenta over by walmart with my mom my little brother when he was about one maybe two and my older sister all right wake up all [ __ ] up don't do my hair don't do nothing wake up all right mom i'm going to school all right bye but right before i left my room i would unlock my window i'd walk around the block come back hop our back fence sneak under the window go to my room window open the window sneak in go to my closet there was already a pillow i would always leave in there and i just go to sleep because my mom would go to work about 10 o'clock so after that i was just free to chill hang out smoke bowls it was great man until one day this [ __ ] happened my little brother he's about like i said one maybe two at the time he's barely like walking he's walking but he's in diapers he's still got a pacifier he's a little kid always playing with him so every time i'm around he's always running to me trying to play and [ __ ] so if he sees me he gets all hyped up like any other day i sneak back into my room i go in the closet go to sleep i'm in the sliding closet door i'm on my stomach on my pillow and i just hear my little brother like please don't come in here please don't come in here he just opens the closet door and as he opens him like don't do it don't do it to me my mom's still home because he's not a daycare or anything and he opens it slightly and he sees his pacifier he sees me and he gets all hyped up and he starts opening the door fast and as he opens the door remember in p.e you should do the touch your toes how far can you stretch they would measure the inches and then you have to hang and then do the toe touches but remember the one where you have to sit on your stomach and do the [ __ ] trunk lift the arch remember that you have to arch your neck i pulled one of those i was on my stomach and he started opening the door and i couldn't like pick myself up so i just went my mom comes in from this way and just picks him up get out of thomas's room and i hear her close the door and maybe see him ah he gets taken away he's laughing my mom doesn't know he's laughing because i'm in the closet like i'm playing hide-and-seek with his ass i'm just ah he's trying to [ __ ] play with me i'm trying to get him away without going and then i want to tell you one more little story one time me and joe like always we did school i called my mom and told her the old yeah no school got cut short today it's like teachers thing they're doing all the testing me and joe walk from merced high all the way to walmart if you know what we're saying it's not that far but when you're a kid it's like it's far it's hot we gotta walk we gotta sneak because we're ditching we get to my house and i realize i don't have my key all i know is i have a bunch of money i was selling weed do i want to trade some of this money and buy a new window or door so i can break it and get in the house i was just super bummed like dude am i gonna kick a door in just so i can get my weed and chill for the rest of day my mom doesn't get home from work until like eight o'clock it's either sit outside all day with no weed and have to go to the bathroom or kick the door and break a window and just go pay for it so i called my mom told her what happened if you kick the [ __ ] door and i will whoop your ass my mom i will pay for it i'll put it in everything thomas do not kick the [ __ ] door and all right mom i won't kick the door i hung up and i [ __ ] kicked the door straight in but the thing that i wasn't anticipating is i kicked the frame off so it was so expensive for me to do it it was not worth it i should have broke the [ __ ] window thank you guys so much for watching until next time i'm dope yola have a dope

did not say right that's that fancy smoke first show and we're about to give you guys a review and let you guys know is it really worth 180 make sure you guys like this video subscribe and gonna let you guys know let me know what you guys think down below before we start would you buy this for 185 before we even light it look at it it's a grenade YUM you can pull the little thing and boo sure let me know down below what you guys like this baby of them so ready we are in the tent as you guys can see I don't bring it back and it's about to get night time for you guys cuz I know a lot of you I wanted to see the night time so stay tuned see if it gets night gang [Music] keep down please smoke everywhere we go [Music] let's go baby fam we got the joint lit as you can see it is ripping you guys you guys see the cherry on that thing I think it's back what you guys think about it yes I really like the tip that it has on it it's like I never seen a tip like that before but I'm really liking it because it keeps all the Scooby Snacks we're coming in your mouth and we also noticed that you don't have to get a hella hard like I thought that you had to be like you know how like when you roll hella fat you've got to hit it hard know that one you can hit it regular like a regular joint and it's hitting really good yeah I'm hitting it way too hard it is pretty heavy you guys there's hella [ __ ] weed in there I mean what the weed included but the tip is pretty heavy left away the tip itself see how much it that's some Gaston I didn't even know there was constant rain there either I just see like the celebrity spike scenes and I was like in aware how much to smoke on what should be cat he was saying that bringing a joint like this is like bringing like a bottle oh yeah like okay it's like usually when you go see like a family friend or just somebody like that's important to you bring him like a like a cake or a bottle you know something for like this nice gift big Oh join make sure if you have it comes to your size I mean if you ever go see your friends you pull up with one of these and yeah and if you live in a set you better keep its rental in your pocket in case you're looking up saw yeah it's kind of running a little bit late yeah that's the only thing that I'm trying to figure out how would you stop that or just [ __ ] probably start lighting the other side once I feel like you need to have like [ __ ] yeah look we did it work to catch it up old fashioned hello saliva you know stop the look going out right hopefully that works let me know what you guys do to stop your plants from running put it on but so far what do you guys what do you think I'm highest luck gets high in here it's boxy to be honest with you I'm gonna give mine to pee I'm not gonna if I go it's its exhibits joint the [ __ ] flavor is could be more flavor II like I've been smoking some SF cultivators wedding pie $61 out the door testing at 31% that [ __ ] is way better way better than this but I mean I don't know maybe maybe I maybe it's the concentrates too though I'm just doing a little bit of flavor yeah I mean honestly I'm gonna keep it really guys I feel like it's not hitting like a hundred percent it could be I think if you roll do be better but yeah you know I don't like the fact that it's running so bad I think that's like my main problem with it and yeah I feel like I'm wasting away I'm so high that I'm just like [ __ ] you know but it's like if I were to rolled it I'd be more pissed because it's like damn you exhibit homies these are hand rolled them I see them making them I'm pretty sure I have no idea what is each test bet just a big flex guys we're smoking a [ __ ] $184 joint what let me know if there's things that you guys feel like it's just for the foot I feel like designer is just for the Flex you know I know bass quality to this testing at 27 percent by the way pretty high 27 percent concentrate don't see any wax running or anything like that either so I'm not really sure where the concentrate is in the joint I mean it is like white ash though all the way yeah it definitely does the job oh yeah let's play baseball you know what I was thinking is that like it's a big guys joint you want it to last you how long Lee I don't know I didn't set a timer but it's feel like I'm going kind of fast yeah yeah you right sure it's eight I mean there's still no cuz it's hella fat but it's like you think you'll be just custom ah don't underestimate you guys and then I just want to remind you guys to go cup some lady where a wave emerged a very explosive second exclusive that we got the sweats on Ted I got them on today real one make sure you guys go cop it going real quick thank you guys for supporting us shout out the whole way and we appreciate you guys for getting us here we got bigger things coming you guys oh my god looks like gonna burn your lips I know follow me let me like the other side back because I really like easy burn me I have bad luck burning myself with it I bet you as the video when it started it was not that smoky and now it's like the only thing I don't like okay so we're getting to the end what are you guys thinking is this what is $285 honestly it's not $1 i'ma tell you why you guys polite you could just get so much weed with that money you could just roll so many blunts that just getting so much higher I don't know that's my s what I so I think creating for me was worth it listen out listen up so it's a pandemic I can't come to accept that much I only hang out with them so much I only have so much time so we got to get hella [ __ ] high in a short amount of time [Music] want to get hella high in a short amount of time that's a good way and there's a lot of money well but it was worth it yeah it was worth anything I think I would buy it if I was like gonna go see ya like a friend that I haven't seen him tell along and like your city just said you're gonna top the whole chain because this thing was a [ __ ] but she doesn't really need a [ __ ] damn I feel like I'm hella re inhaling all the smoke we want some water free I got you Brandon thank you like really even higher we just sitting here no you're not going we get in one hundred and eighty dollars worth of Highness dog like who do you know is smokin a pumps let me know down in the comments if you guys have tried this grenade like cookies rolls in the lift tickets so now I know where the concentrate is the concentrates in the paper so the papers made will concentrate yeah I've heard about CBD infused papers and even - yeah smoke vibes everything so we're here cookies I bought hell of I papers and I like wrong something wrong though do you really do you think vibes are better than wrong honestly it's like keeping I do I do is the rice ones they taste hell it feel like I've been smoking all the flour rice ones it's like almost like there's no paper I don't know I don't know what the everyone making papers so I you're right there like it's not healthy yeah it's just kind of like a competition with one another now I don't know I'm not gonna get into politics let me know if you guys could still see cats crying in the back I'm gonna open the window you guys know I know I will say there's a good graph look at that they turn on tasting you never know you just said it's a pup go I'm not tapping out

legal doesn't get you high but definitely has the possibilities to make you feel better health-wise but don't hold me on that if you're under 18 I don't know how you got here because this review is interested in let's go to the forum so making this review possible now y'all know I'm I this is one of my favorite CBD companies their flower is amazing if you haven't seen it reviews are linked I'm at the end and I am so blessed to be able to experience their cartridges yes and it sent over a few but we're gonna take it one by one we ran into Jack come on suck it this is really chop roof I mean we don't get this open all right got it but I like that cuz yeah I can't office yeah let's get into it focus jack herer my same is right Herrera Hera OC so we're getting into Jack Herrera and it's a sativa strain 63% CBD under 0.1% TAC so what it is not going to get you high but it's gonna make you feel a hella good cannabis derived terpenes Oregon made the package is made 400 side plant base yeah I like that it's very serious about the environment so that's your your cart it came with a cap [Music] so with the sativa dominant strain and what do I get from it so piney woodsy kind of tastes like it's really again giving me a herb well I think all of so that what I'm getting from it I got notes is the earthy pine woodsy taste all them to come together this is giving you a look at her beau blend you know when I first started very benign I was like okay this is a little it's kind of little peppery but not so much so I put it more towards to her beau side and for me what it is this a cheaper strain so I found myself to be very focused very focused and I chose us in particular because I was doing before I was getting ready for work and I'm like you know I let me not mess up and do something that's not put me to sleep now I would definitely recommend this if you're about to do some work whether it be gardening whether it be school work because like I said for me it has has it had me focused and I like that and this is something I would do definitely in the morning yeah before I start my day definitely we recommend again it's an earthy Pineywoods he kinda tastes enjoyable you want aces this um see like lesson pressing in here putting it yeah somebody answer I see we burn in your throat yeah yeah this is not this doesn't bring it though that's important so it's smooth yeah it doesn't burn your throat and again this one for me it's just a cheaper so but against the TV affects people differently some people sativa it affects them like it's an indica this just kept me very alert so I definitely recommend that you give them a try I'm really happy that they also do cartridges and we're going to get into more about them so stay tuned you know where you get all the

about this packaging SoCal cards Hybrid one gram whatever whatever SoCal whatever all-natural terpenes no additives real see self cartridge so let's get into this [ __ ] right off the bat you kind of get it like fruity dessert type of flavor right off the dry hit it's not bad here we go that's just let's try okay it's pretty good it tastes better than I like I said I've had one at one other one of these I believe I did the review on the Slimer allergy I did I did yeah the slime Reggie is a bit weird man a little bit this one's pretty good that's decent paper man um to be real drop gasket the fonts off on this he sell this he sell holes are not the right size there's no lines in the mouth tip but I don't I don't know nothing about these cards I'm gonna try them all right sorry guys I just got a text about um hopefully receiving another your cart and I'll do a review on this next upcoming cars but yeah that's um my follow-up I just wanted to say sorry Betty I was [ __ ] smashed last night but yeah we're gonna we're gonna tell you what I think about this next part but yeah gelato not bad I prefer tank be a little more flavor but that is like a lighter altogether more like almost the terpenes are like not of a punch you in the face like taste wise like it's kind of um a lighter taste too which I kinda enjoy too but I don't know it's just a little different and I'm biased towards tanks cuz I've done so many reviews and have smoked so many tanks well thanks thanks for watching guys on like subscribe comment if you want to leave you", "4GRgXvT6-4c": "hey what's good everybody jp here checking in respect my region.com here today with a quick taste test review featuring justin from edmond and buddy's brand acai gelato live resin dab so i'm pretty excited to check this out we've uh previously taken some photos with this so this is kind of what we're looking like in terms of the extract nice solid herby gelato-y smell there's a quick review for you guys um justin here i'm going to serve you up a low temp dab if that's cool let me get a quick scoop out oh wow look at this consistency on the diamonds wow pretty beautiful i'll show you guys what we'll see nice big chunky diamond there all right there we go and then i have a quick little heating method here come to five one two three four and five and then that's gonna move there we go one two three bam all right brother go ahead and let me know what you think so taste test review you all please subscribe we've got the new playlist here we're going to be reviewing as many of these dabs and products as we can give you guys a good idea of the terps the flavor the high etc justin what are you feeling and tasting in terms of the terps and the high over your body right now on the eyes it's really nice and sedated on the body i love gelato you know july is my favorite stream it's got that really nice body like creep in them tastes really good though body high solid flavor is it accurate for a gelato profile we're looking we're looking at beta-carotelline 4.73 percent alpha-humaline 0.76 limiting at 0.47 so are you getting citrus are you getting spicy earthy are you getting a woody musk more than winning most okay more of that interesting manufactured september 14th not exactly super fresh but it is the sativa coming in at total cannabinoids 84.71 uh big shout out to buddy's brand one uh they do the terpenes on the back so that's super super helpful and informative um it is just cannabis concentrate again just some live resin diamonds and do you feel like here i'll give you a less quick smell do you feel like between the smell and the flavor do you feel like you got an accurate flavor profile and if so what would you give this taste test review in terms of a sport in terms of taste definitely maybe a 9 for sure i love the aftertaste for sure i love the fact that with gelatos you can really get that floral essence after you hit it whether it's right after a couple seconds later yep it really has to do with the terpene profile in fact that's all displayed here love that as well that all goes into account when you especially when you're taking dabs you really dab for the taste especially doing low temp dabs like we did still a fat dab and i could definitely still feel like myself like i said this is still kicking in into sativa so you should feel some waves of energy yeah it's like various types of highs you know how you have you ever had like a kush very cheesecake yeah or that uh that floral vibe but like you said still more a little cerebral but a little bit of body as well mm-hmm i can really get that as a nice deep so nine out of ten final sports for sure appreciate you on that brother well justin here thank you my man for coming through buddy's brand the acai gelato coming in with a nine flat on the official taste test review please be sure to tune in for more taste test reviews smash the like button be sure to follow for more uh reviews

okay yeah i'm curious i like that all right now we said we we won't do two reviews but we'll do two reviews ladies and i'm kind of gentlemen [Applause] about the jack here i actually want to try to tangy though tell you the truth so we'll do two reviews and we'll do the next review on this video which will be the jack here so let's try to get this open because you know we solo dolo ladies and gentlemen all right we back let's do the tangy okay good look at the cart y'all see that bubble is not moving it's moving a little bit but not too much all right this is changing don't thinking we're back i know what you're thinking you know you need to hire a cameraman man i ain't there yet yo we still gotta get tomatoes off our back you feel me all right ladies and gentlemen this is tangy yo the wall look a different color than the other one so let's get to it y'all last setting that was instant that was instant it took a minute for the fire ogi to hit me but it was instant with the tangy so right feeling right back by the eyes i had it i had a headache the headache is gone so it's good very good for medicated so we're gonna do this review we're gonna do two cart review today ladies and gentlemen all right for fire og it was it want the full effect you could tell it was there but it just wasn't the full effect i wanted it took a two i took maybe two or three hits you know what i'm saying for me to really feel the fact the fire og so the rating of fire og i give it now remind you i don't like indicas too so this could affect so though if you see this in the dispensary don't say oh i don't want that because he didn't like it everybody is different my rating one to ten for fire og i'm gonna get a 5.7 don't think i gave it to 0.7 because it took like three hits but it got me there now let's get to the review on tangy i'm allowed y'all tangie hit me the first hit that it could have been because i was smoking fire oh gee but this is how my effects after the cough it was straight instant i felt it behind my eyes i had a headache the headache was gone it disappeared and i did run in at was it 4.0 on the high highest wattage there was so my review for tangie standards is 8 out of 10. i got rid of my headache so this i really recommend if y'all see these in your dispensary standards does that really spell standard but if y'all see this in this country please pick this up and this is a high brand edge i'm thinking this is a hybrid but the way it hits me it's a sativa it had to be a sativa you know and it says nowhere in these boxes whereas it has to be a sativa there it goes right there 92 percent thc sativa i knew it was his teeth what i told y'all y'all did not tell y'all it felt like it felt like i have bread but the way it hit it felt like a sativa you know and i knew it so this is what in my right indica like i said you know 92 percent tac in the guy i knew it was going to be indica the boy knows [ __ ] and the jack herrera would be a sativa so jack hair will be our next review y'all so stay tuned for our next review on jack hair but tangy eight out of ten i love it y'all seen your local dispensary this is going to be a short video you must pick up and try these standards and then hit me like this really hit me this ends our video ladies and gentlemen and i hope you like this quick short review video more coming and i gotta say some of

me so ladies and gentlemen this is our review i'm thinking dwelling now i think about holidays at thanksgiving life is so cool without you i remember you was [Music] you'll never leave me", "q3ZtUDrBkjQ": "[Music] [Music] you [Music]", "_zL_uHV6fQQ": "all right y'all today i'm gonna be making a video on the friendly farms cured resin cartridge this is some gmo so let's get straight into it all right y'all so this is the friendly farms and gmo cartridge this is going to be cure resin they have a live resin version and then they have a um cured resin version so there's going to be the cured version um i don't know what the difference is i never personally had live resin one but uh somebody tell me what's the difference between cured resin and live resin because i'm pretty curious to see or if actually i'll probably just look it up and put it up right now but this is this is what the packaging is going to be looking like man like i said gmo is going to be an indica it's going to be a black box with a yellow writing that's kind of what they're known for that their main color is a yellow so it's gonna have that up front fresh cure liquid you guys can pause that to read it it says uh farm friend all natural from plant to pan no additives distill it free and this is the bag looks pretty cool in the back i'll put a picture of it [Music] and the top is just the uh sticker of the dispensary that i got it from i got it from a firehouse in sherlock california um west west main street turn like california i forgot the address but it's called firehouse uh just look it up on we maps um so when you open so to open the package it's gonna so to open the package you're gonna have to rip the sticker right here and then you just open it like this and it's gonna come with the cart in there and it comes with this piece of paper uh i'm not sure if it's actually scanning or some [ __ ] to receive fifty percent off or something i don't know something or something like so my honest thoughts about this opinion so my honest opinion so my honest thoughts about this pen man i will not get this card again and i don't recommend that you guys get it um this card as you guys can see i'll give you guys a closer look right but the now on this is [ __ ] horrible man the taste of this reminds me of taking the hit from a dirty bomb like that's exactly what it tastes like dirty weed from a dirty ball or it tastes like good weed hitting it from a dirty ass bong you know what i'm saying uh you guys here with a bong if you guys have hit a bomb before like that you guys know exactly what i'm talking about but uh the guy told me this was his favorite one but i caught cap i think he was just saying that you know so i could get so he could like sell me like sell me this um this tastes like trash man i let all my friends hit it and they do not like the taste but i will say nah i'm gonna say this this is probably one of the worst pens i've had um this is better than the jeter cart for sure it gets you way higher than the jeter cart and the only way i'm able to enjoy this pen is by doing uh the the dab cap with the with the bong because it gets rid of the flavor and that way you're able to get a lot higher without the nasty flavor and one thing about this is i forgot where it said on the i think it was on the box or maybe it's on this paper that it says in hell for one second using a low voltage battery 2.0 through 2.7 volts recommended repeat this step after a couple of minutes if you like if you would like a stronger effect adjust your battery to under three volts and inhale for four three through six seconds let the cartridge cool for 30 to 60 seconds between hits to ensure that that you do not burn the oil so with that being said the maximum that i recommend you hit this car is like five seconds um i haven't hit a blinker of it yet just because i don't want to burn the oil and there's so much left but i'll probably take a blinker of it for you guys just for the video just so you guys can see and i'll let you guys know it tastes like burp and so that way you guys don't have to do it yourself but i'll recommend using at least the max 3 3.3 volts max i believe this one is vaping at 3.3 volts in the lowest setting which is green and then i have another honeydew battery which also smokes at 3.3 i don't have anything lower than that so that's all i was able to use but for me it's been working fine even though they did say to not use a battery above 3 volts so if you guys have that problem just 3.3 is max i would recommend so you guys have a 3.3 volt battery you guys are good don't need to worry about that um but the flavor man i had to give it like a three like a three out of like a three or four out of ten man horrible horrible flavor um the high i would have to give it like a five uh maybe like a five and a half um like i said it's one of the worst cards i've had but not the worst um i would recommend a lot of cards over this daisy kingpin select a lot of things i would recommend before this and i had a lot of friends telling me not to go not to get it but i have not made a video on it so i wanted to see for myself and it turns out they were right i have yet to try the live resident win so i'm not sure about that one but this one man the uh cured resin is a no go for me man i have not tried the editing labs yet though so i don't know how that would work but um sorry for my long hair too man i'm about to get a haircut on i haven't cut the top of my hair for over a year and a half and for or like about a year and a half and i'm gonna go get an undercut on the sides real quick so next time when when you guys i'm gonna upload a dispensary video if you guys didn't see the video i just uploaded before this one i'm gonna make it uh i'm gonna film the dispensary run today and i'm gonna have my hair cut in here so you guys can see how fresh i'm gonna look for the ladies watching if there even is any but um but yeah man like i said do not recommend this car just um if you tried a lot of carts already and like this is one of the only ones you haven't tried or this is all you could get it's not that bad to the point where it's like if you haven't had it um you know don't get it like go get it see if you like it it's worth getting it it's gonna get you high you won't i'm not saying you won't be disappointed but you won't regret that you bought it because i don't regret that i bought it just because i've never had it you feel what i'm saying but uh yeah man if you guys were just wondering this is a good card and it's not so get another one but if you want to try it i would recommend to try it because who knows you might like it um everybody you know likes different stuff so let's take a hit of this cart man and so you guys can see some cloud production i'll take a blinker right off the rip i've never done it like i said because i don't want to burn the oil but hopefully it doesn't burn the oil and if it does you guys don't have to burn your oil because i'm doing it for you so let's take a hit with my dirty ass rig if you guys haven't seen my dab cat video make sure to go watch it you just put any type of pants dizzy plug and play any type of pen circular anything you put it on there then you grab your rig put it just like like this into the hole and take a rip so i'm gonna take a bleeder for you guys ready cheers came up that's my first hit of the day too first time the day took a blinker like i said i've never took a blinker from this car and i've had it for like a week already so holy [ __ ] so like i said man it's not a bad car by any means but i would definitely i'm not gonna buy this car again for sure it was cool to try it though because i was really curious i've been debating on buying this for a couple couple months now so it's cool that i got it um so like i said man buy this at your own risk you guys really want to try it you guys might like it who knows but if you guys want to take my word and you guys [ __ ] my channel and [ __ ] like i like [ __ ] my channel but like if you guys want to take like if you guys believe my word i wouldn't get this man there's a lot of stuff that you could get um besides this oh and if i didn't say i got this for 36 out the door um that's after taxes and everything you guys can see that i'm pretty sure you guys saw that in my last video in this bench for you but i showed it to you guys but yeah 36 dollars out the door when i cop again [ __ ] no overall rating man like like a six maybe like a five just because the flavor is horrible i would not get this unless you have the dab cap and the rig because that's the best way to work like that [ __ ] hit bro when i took that blinker right now i have not took a bleep from this cart so that was crazy i doubt i could take a bleeper without that because it's just too nasty but that's gonna be for the video y'all hopefully y'all enjoy the video hopefully that's awesome hopefully i'll learn something and uh hopefully i'll inspire y'all to go get this or not get this but maybe i'll save your ass may save you some money but uh hope you enjoyed the video and i'll catch you on the next man peace okay bye", "DpXEya_eY2s": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive yo what's up ladies and gents and if you're new to the channel my name is shaka x420 and we're back here for another video guys it's just another chill-ass day it's actually nice and bright today it's actually pretty warm compared to the last couple days where it's just been cold and rainy and stuff um i'm out here in california but today guys man we're um this week has just been a budget week i bought a whole bunch of budget cards so your boy is doing budget cart reviews today so today i got a honey leaf and i'm trying this [ __ ] so you guys don't have to man but um honey leaves they're pretty cheap distillate but i've heard they're pretty good and i've never tried one or at least i've tried one but i've never tried one on the channel i've only tried them like you know in passing one of the homies had one so you know i ended up buying it but i got the northern lights and um it has 92 percent thc it's pretty freaking high in thc but that's a given with the distillate and it has 2.26 cbd guys so your boy we got the ursa bat today shout out to um ursa extracts i came home today and i got two packages um one from ursa x-straps and one from another company they sent me a gravity bomb but shout out to ursa extracts i love the lanyards because i love wearing a battery around my neck you feel me if i ever get big you know i won't have a chain your boy's gonna have lanyards with like different cards like different lanyards with different carts on it feel me so let's open this baby up and let's get into it [Music] like i'm not a big dislike fans but these carts are like 20 bucks 15 20 bucks a gram so when you hear that price you're just like huh should i try it should i try is it worth it do you guys think it's worth it so let's check it out see what it looks like [Music] the oil looks actually looks pretty good i'm not going to get a super close up but you guys can see it it's like a super gold color um darker than raw garden darker than a lot of distillate cards too in my opinion um but let's put it on [Music] and it looks like it's just in like some cheap cars not in an avd card or c cell it doesn't even have a name so you know you gotta watch out for those type of cards guys with either c cell or avd avd cards or one of the cards or any type of ceramic um but avd is um one of the big brands that are kind of dropping their carts and they have ceramic coils inside of them so they look like a normal sea cell but inside they actually have ceramic coils but shout out to ursa extracts man they got a full ceramic cart that's crazy so we might have to get pick up some ursa extract soon a strain that i haven't tried yet or something so cheers guys we're gonna take a rip of this northern lights it's not bad [Music] it's not bad but it's also you know not my type of flavor like it just tastes too much like it doesn't taste like they put any kind of terpenes or anything in it sorry i'm trying to get a fat rip i have it on red on this battery but if you guys don't know ursa strikes batteries uh they only go up to 2.0 voltage so sorry if it doesn't look like i'm hitting it but i'm actually i'm hitting this [Music] [Music] but this is good i guess if you're on a budget you need this lit but it's not the best distillate i don't know if it's just the terpenes they put in it or it's just because they barely put any terpenes or anything flavor but i don't know it just tastes like like basic distillate if you guys ever um had friends who just had a jar distillate and you ever just took in a dab or smoked a little bit of this religious straight distillate you guys kind of know it kind of tastes like that in a way [Music] man i gotta take super heavy hits to get nice hits off of this ursa battery but i do like the ursa battery but yeah guys man i don't know if i like this i would give this cart a rating like six six out of ten just because i would buy this if i was on a budget and this is all i could buy to get me through you know a couple weeks but i would rather go for a raw garden or a stizzy type distillate or any other this one's not as good like i think papa herbs is better than this one i would say papa herbs distill it is way [Music] better but yeah guys man today is just a chill day i just got back from work got some hennessy coming because if you guys don't know on saturday nights i like to drink a little bit of hennessy and smoke a bit with you guys a live stream and this saturday we might even be able to throw some gaming in there a little bit because i finally got fortnite and i finally have cold war on my computer so we probably could play some games too also if we wanted to you know shout out to all the people that are in the live stream man the live streams are actually starting to get a little more fun than the freaking the vlogs man i like the live streams actually um so i'm gonna start going live stream way more often guys um but i'm also doing more reviews i still haven't even tried um that noose dizzy strain that came out i bought i bought it and i just haven't even tried that out yet and i feel like everyone's trying but i'm gonna try that out and probably do like a wake and bake or story time but during the week it's kind of hard to like you know get out and do those types of vlogs because i'm just working but um yeah we're just trying the honey leaf guys man let me know if you guys ever tried honey leaves this is the northern lights 92 percent thc in this it's not bad i'd give it like a six but it's definitely not you know the best quality you know like if you're gonna choose a cheap cart just get a pop of herbs it's cheaper and it tastes better just tastes way better but shout out to everybody that made it this far in the vlog man don't forget to like comment subscribe more vlogs to come i just wanted to give you guys my opinion on this freaking cart but yeah guys more vlogs coming soon don't forget to keep watching guys and let me know if you guys have any suggestion on videos too i'm always open for suggestions and sorry if i don't do the cards that some of you guys suggest is just some of the cards that some of you guys suggest is hard to find and if you guys were on the live stream last night you guys know that i live in a city where they don't have storefronts so i have to drive 30 minutes to go to actual storefront so most of the stuff that i buy is delivery so if the delivery places don't have them i usually can't get them um just because i'm just not trying to drive out right now like i just don't have the um time to be driving out like that right now and the transportation too at that point but um we're definitely gonna get more freaking cars more vlogs coming guys man i got love for everyone man thanks for always

start i dream every day as i look to the stars spilling my [Music] so", "Eg_VOjeO6ls": "[Music] welcome back to another Leafly reviews my name is Jeremiah and today we are reviewing the 2.2 grams Skywalker og cartridge by heavy hitters oh my heavy hitter is available in the California medical market 2.2 grams is something that I have never seen in the recreational market so this is kind of a special treat for me one gram of oil can go a pretty long way for a consistent medical or recreational consumer but 2.2 grams is the gallon jug of cannabis oil on the go so I'm assuming months and months of consistent cannabis enjoyment Skywalker og is a indica dominant hybrid a mix between Skywalker and OG Kush known for its relaxing euphoric qualities so you take some of the good parts of OD Kush which is yeah that really sort of bright euphoria and mid-level sedation and then just pile on some extra sort of relaxing sedation to that so just for size comparison it is literally as big as the battery the volume of oil is is unreal I suddenly do feel like I'm holding a yellow lightsaber whoa Skywalker og has a pretty robust cannabinoid profile that includes eighty two point eight percent THC 1% THC v 1.5% CBG as well as one point three percent CBC the sort of eclectic spectrum of cannabinoids just adds complexity to the overall experience so let's see what it's all about black licorice immediately off the off the top no kidding and maybe a little bit of a earthy astringent taste to it you can't even really see if that pulled any oil because there's just so much of it so we tried the two point two grams Skywalker og cartridge the buzz was super duper chill great to play video games great to watch a movie and yeah with 2.2 grams of it you definitely have more enjoyment in store if you enjoyed the content click the like button if you want to see more videos here at Leafly hit the subscribe button if you want to know more about all things cannabis go to Leafly calm peace

"3L2JecFMHXE": "hey what's going on guys it's I stay grinding and I'm back here for another video for you guys alright guys so I'm gonna have my girlfriend in this video to help me out with this review now she never smoked weed like probably the last time that she ever smoked she probably took a hit like a couple months ago but she never smokes now I know this is a little bit off topic but I just wanted to show you guys in my new shoes that I got it's not first woman she does the other one got to just so you guys know I got I got both pairs but yeah this is my first pair of easy this is the new uh the new statics and yes these are legit um these are the most expensive shoes that I ever got let me know what you guys think of these in the in the comment section down below I think these look really dope I like how these transparent how the stripe transparent I don't know man these look freakin sick like just look at the stitching in these shoes man these are freaking dope and these are freaking comfortable guys alright guys now let's get started with the review now I've picked up a selective a bait rijckaert now this is the first time of I'm ever trying the brand select I've tried brass knuckles I've tried a lot of brands I tried a lot of different cards most of the cards honestly that I've done have been from the streets because cars are stupid expensive in the dispensary man super expensive like I only got a half gram cart and I'd only want to tell you guys how much I spend because I know she's gonna get mad yeah man this this this cost a pretty pain let me just say for a gram of this stuff and the dispensary is going for over a hundred bucks now this is a half gram now the guy in the dispensary told me that yeah he's some that he picks up from the streets as well but he told me that he really thinks that these are worth the price so I don't know the dude in the dispensary convinced me to pick this up and as you guys could see in the back right here um I don't think I could read that this has 0% CBD which is kind of kind of lame but it has zero 0.67% cbn but it has ninety one point 7 percent THC guys that's freakin high cuz I know most of the cards test around 80% I don't think I've ever seen a card testing at ninety one percent is the highest THC percentage card that they had in the that had in the shop now the packaging looks pretty nice looks really professional shout out to the met men in Las Vegas they are freaking dope a suspense are you very professional they have their shirts tucked in man like very friendly friendly dudes in there man they convince him the bodies expended a scart and there that's how friendly they are but yeah but let's open it up Oh see how is now she's gonna take a hit guys so I think she's gonna be she's gonna get pretty hot cuz I don't even know him the last time she smoked was was the last time you smoked it's because what happened with her she's in the smoke we have a baby and she didn't smoke during her whole pregnancy and after she was pregnant for nine months she had a c-section and I wanted her to what they tried to give her opiates and I want her to take those I children ought to take them but yeah I gave her a hundred you're supposed to they say four like a beginner or someone who doesn't really smoke they should take like 10 or 20 max 30 milligrams I gave her a 100 and she she tripped out like she had like a like a psychedelic experience type [ __ ] so here's the half gram select vape cartridge I'm also gonna let you guys know in a few days how long this lasted me because I'm gonna try to make this last because I spent a lot of money on this guy's that's most expensive car let me just say on the streets I can get a whole gram for cheap and then for a lot cheaper than what I paid for 1/2 gram of this but I'm very curious to uh to see how this how this tastes now on how high it gets me the tip looks pretty dope yeah the tip looks hella dope like I've never seen a tip like this I'm the dude told me that these are these are like hard to refill as well the guy in the dispensary told me that these are actually the number one carts in California and Oregon like he pretty much the when he said it that these are the pretty much the best cards on the market better than brass knuckles he was like yeah these are way better than brass knuckles yeah pretty much she was just making it seem like these are like the got it cards now I have my pen charging over there and let me just go grab it and I'll be back shout out to us I have another review of their of their wax pen review that the link will link to that will be in the but yeah they hooked me up with some bad news just so shout-out to lose their dope I like yous they're cheap and they're reliable that's that's that's the best thing about loose a lot a lot of the vape pens they break very easily but loses a good brand that you could trust alright so have the card on there let me just turn it on that's one five times all right cool another card is on you wouldn't try it first I'll let you try it first you just try it first yeah you just gotta press the button yeah bro that was cloud bro you saw that dude this smell is that was that was a little ass here but I was cloud bro like that's when he come over here come over here damn bro a little he doesn't smoke you guys better be high another one want some water babe what about it I'm gonna get her some Gator [Music] yeah I think that that concludes the review guys that's perfect I'll be even taking a hit but I've never she's hitting cars before and they've never even been that bad what do you think before I try this like what do you think of this it's make harsh on your dope if you haven't smoked what's more good rude alright let me try this now some missing I don't even know I had the yeah I had her temperature up pretty high though how did I like four point too much on mine down to three point eight all right guys Cheers no I'm just playing on my person girl 420 but he's dull damn bro straight-up tastes like you're [ __ ] taking a DAB out of them tastes like you're taking that dab bro just tastes like a dad dude damn dude that [ __ ] is kind of kind of harsh on your [ __ ] I want to come it actually is kinda hard roll - it tastes strong - I think she's more this is more like what just make her throw her like it's like it's like a instant hits me I think what is this a sativa oh yeah this is deficit even that I could just hit it knocked it just as pretty obviously kind of weird in red but this is a sativa man ninety one ninety one point seven percent THC guys damn just less than eight percent more and this would be a hundred percent yes Josh hurry shuttle - I've heard is that [ __ ] always fire deep like the flower always had with your I've heard is always fire so I mean I think the big question is you think this is worth more money compared to the other cards yeah I agree with

you're gonna be doing another cartridge review today now I won't be doing a hotbox video no either today or tomorrow so you guys stay tuned for that gonna be having a couple videos coming up and also just like weird reviews you know like I feel like I'm boring you guys with just cartridge you've users [ __ ] but I don't know I'm like maybe just stop from the cartridge reviews a little bit well I'm still gonna smoke on the ship but you know I'm just gonna switch up the vetoes a little bit for you guys but it's been a while literally since I've done this dizzy asti review like literally months so I had to ran into this blue person I guess to say that the blue purse is like one of the best best flavors out there right now from Steve Zissou and I guess one of the newest ones as well so if I'm wrong on that I'm the best flavor let me know because I haven't tried all the Stacy's uh this one's like the third one I've tried before but yeah they say this one tastes like berries and [ __ ] so I'm like I'm really curious about that so I have purchased this for like like 40 bucks like around around there I'm not really sure about the price but this one's from my dispensary I had gotten my fee no they're here Modesto so this one's a blue purse and on the top it says blue club blue gummi flavor so we're gonna check it out guys so I had lost my steez battery so the good thing my smoke shot they carry out a fake ass dizzy battery so these ain't authentic I already know so they probably get them off somewhere but the good thing the smoke shop carries them you know you don't got I didn't have to drive back to the dispensary so good thing we have that so we're gonna get into the cartridge guys if let me know what you guys up to on this Saturday Saturday afternoon I'm just kicking back you know gonna watch some Netflix in a little bit guys I'm gonna pop this up for you guys and I appreciate those guys out of me uh if you guys had to add me on my Instagram go ahead and do so I would appreciate that I just made a new Instagram for the channel I mean I have always had an Instagram but that was my personal like my personal account so out of maker for the channel so here it is guys a gram of the blue burst Izzy looks pretty dope you know Stacy packaging I really like it a lot so it's nice and simple but it also looks pretty good you know and here we have that California logo it's a sticker guys so there's a lot of people that ask me is they like in grade there is the sticker but this one's a sticker as you guys can see hopefully you guys can all get a good close-up on that but this one's pretty good you know the color on is nice and light it looks pretty good you know it has a nice decent color to it and I'm going to just try it to see if ooh what it tastes like oh [ __ ] right off the bat you know it does taste like berries I'm not gonna lie it tastes like a gummy berry tastes really good so I'm going to open this battery nothing too serious about this better you know just straight simple I grab the red edition there's like different colors and [ __ ] like old black orange I like the red one I had the black one which I ended up losing so ended up getting the red one simple battery you know let me know what you guys prefer play a recision you know a hard choice I mean like put in place a little more plugin plays are a little bit more uh more flavor wise you know but they have high policy as well as dizzy you know their cartridges are like 80% as well this one's a 83% I forgot to show you guys 80% cartridge so part I should say so I'm gonna open this real quick [ __ ] nah whoever got that germ axe or that lifestyle spray man good at me my [ __ ] me someone [ __ ] pay you man I need that [ __ ] ASAP out here in California right here world from everything's gone man people are going crazy right now for that [ __ ] but if you had a tartars man out of state people got the jug on that get out of me would appreciate that man but you know you this one's a red battery and they've had the red battery before but I seen some people have a gold one which looks pretty dope but stay simple so you have a simple battery you know we're gonna head and uh get the magnet and plug it in you guys are smoke along with me go ahead and do so would really appreciate that guys haven't really smoked all day I've been like really busy I'm out doing some errands and [ __ ] but hopefully you guys smoke along with me cheers guys I'm glad let you guys know this [ __ ] tastes like some people say it tastes burnt dizzy tastes burger but I don't know it just depends on where you get him from so where to see oh [ __ ] I'm really really surprised some Stacey's that I've tried before like the turpan the tur penis wasn't really there but this one's here you know taste straight like berries like one of our boys told me that's what it tasted like like gummy like a gummy bear it tastes pretty good you know I'm gonna take a beer here see if I can get it like uh that taste is still my mother she's good I'm gonna try to take a blinker for you guys all right guys so we had charged the [ __ ] battery cuz they came [ __ ] low battery so we couldn't get a really good hit off it but let me know um I don't know if I'm tripping but happen has happened to me before but a lot of people say that some states burnt bottom oh is because of it's not legit or I don't know they say the big battery Stacey I love you guys seem that big stingy battery that that may be the issue because of how it's a big battery and the poly burns the oil so I don't know let me just let you guys know about cheers guys definitely gets a hit now but it's definitely definitely like berries you know it tastes Halle good I'll describe it as a gummy blueberry gummy exactly it should taste good I didn't really think I was gonna be this tasty you know there's some Stevie's there I've tried before that just tastes like straight this in it but this one does taste like this little bit tastes like a really good distillate you know I mean it's really fruity you know I'd really recommend this bluebirds man out of all of them if you guys have a choice get the blueberries you know if you guys want to [ __ ] with this Daisy get that blueberries it should taste good straight berries I'm gonna take a blinker for you guys if I get out this [ __ ] I gotta go to the store Matt like I said if you guys have that hats on it ties that lifestyle spray your knee up man we'd really appreciate it I'll pay you guys you guys should be a package on your mind but cheers guys take a blinker these blinkers ain't as bad as a plug-and-play it's really really smooth you know and even when you take a blinker it still doesn't taste burn at all get the nice full flavor of it it's just pretty good you know but yeah guys I really appreciate you guys for watching my veto stay stay safe out there you know wash your hands to be safe and Mia guys thanks for watching", "J40U6akTHNs": "[Music] what is up y'all p2p and today we're doing a video of the osmo pocket one of our newer cameras we're gonna be using and uh yeah so this one might be moving around a bit no not really too stationary type stuff as i mess around with the osmo while we're filming and stuff but yeah but today guys i've got the skittles punch buddies cart review for you guys you know as always it's the but not as always but as it's been recently we've got another liquid diamonds buddies right here maybe we'll go for a distillate next time we get buddies but yeah they're working with about 70 thc on this one 74.72 total cannabinoids and uh you know an indica strain so you know it's definitely right up the alley for me so uh terpium profile let's go ahead and look at that we got an 8.56 percent profile not too amazing but nothing too low either uh you know some mirror scene in there karyofleen and limonene let's see back in there for y'all hope you all can see that yeah without further ado let's get this video started the right way and the way we always do with for those of you at home if you are packing up your dabs getting that already or you got your cart pin already ready right there right next to you i'm gonna go ahead and take a hit of this and i'll let you guys know what i'm tasting what i might be feeling [Music] creamy uh sweet sweetness there not too creamy i guess but um almost like a tart sweetness there um not too much of anything else you know that limonene that's in there i'm not really tasting it as pronounced as i did in that banjo cartridge but um i'm getting very very light hints of it so it's not exactly absent all the way but it isn't as pronounced so that's all the flavor notes i'm picking up here let me go ahead and take another hit for you guys real quick here and let you guys know what i'm thinking that one partially went down the wrong way [Music] so that hurt a little bit so what am i picking up there so now the limiting standing a little bit more you know i'm getting a little more of that limey citrusy kind of taste but it's still like again i said not as pronounced i'm not sure if you guys would even pick it up if you weren't really trying to hunt for it like i am and you know the only reason i'm really hunting for is to see if i could taste the terps that are listed here in the back you know i use them for the most part but um you know for a straightness at skills punch i was expecting more of a sweet kind of uh taste to it a lot sweeter than what i have here um but it's still not too bad so far potency wise it's okay so i've had i have hit this card a few times this isn't the first time recording this video um but uh yeah it's it's not the craziest like buddies card i've had you know this is indica it's pretty relaxing i wouldn't say like other ones it's sedating this one's more relaxing and mellowing which is too bad at all maybe that's just how the strain is but you know i'm assuming it skills punches across of skittles and purple punch so um me personally i was hoping that this would hit a little bit harder on the indian side but it's still not too bad though 74 total cap noise isn't it's not crazy a crazy amount of uh you know cabin rates and as we all know you know the higher capital percentage is actually what you want to look for rather than a higher thc percentage i mean you know thc percentage is also very good to look at but you know you want more full spectrum stuff more cannabinoids [Music] and once again i'm getting more of the tones the sweet and limey tones as i hit it more i think this is something that you won't taste much when you first hit it but um you know after like you sesh with it a little bit or maybe you know when you're sitting there and feeling like 2p hits and you'll taste a little bit more on the second third hit which is a little bit rare because generally speaking we normally expect cards to get harsher or darker towards the end you know but uh that remains to be seen with this one it's not to say that once it reaches the bottom it's it's gonna still taste better and better you know what i mean like it could definitely do what i just talked about before um yeah in terms of high impotency it's very mellow you know i definitely i mean i can go out and talk to people and hang out while i have this but it's definitely not really not no energizing yeah that's all i have for today's review guys i hope you guys enjoyed this quick little informal one and uh yeah i hope you guys bear with me while i still get everything figured out with my green screen set up with new cameras and all that stuff but i want to thank you guys for joining me and always and kick it in here so if you did enjoy this video please like comment subscribe all that good stuff check out all our old videos if you're new um you know i'm sure you'll love everything on this channel thank you guys for supporting me so much and i hope to keep making you guys

right but before we get in there I said of course you know I gotta ask you [ __ ] are mother [ __ ] please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always say cuz always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that thing so you can get a notification any time I post um yeah and make sure you also go over there and follow me on instagram is cannot underscore mink now if that [ __ ] is out the way let's get to these before we get in the neck you know what I also wanna give a shout out I had a homie it's always good to have homies that Got Talent one of my homies quest he made this [ __ ] for me for Christmas man this [ __ ] badass I really like that [ __ ] a super-duper appreciate it so I'm gonna put it hang it up behind me or something like that but it's always good to have homies with talent and [ __ ] like that because you might get somebody heart work or something there's some of the big talents so good-looking that question out man alright so Jenny extracts I've never had a genuine extract cartridge so we're gonna find out how to [ __ ] this together I've heard people say that they're really really good I do know that they're flower is out grown outdoor grown so that's pretty cool I'm not like against indoor but I really do like you know son wrong week I don't know why I don't know but anyway so that's that another thing is with their [ __ ] they do test it obviously they're like nobody Benny everybody's saying that [ __ ] now but they test their flower three times when they first get it out of the farm for pesticides and [ __ ] like that and then once it gets an oil form they test it two more times so pretty much your [ __ ] is getting tested five times to make sure this as pure as possible so that's a pretty good thing right there they're very big on terpenes that's why I have to wear my shirt for my [ __ ] because they make big on terpenes so what I have right here is the sativa dominant a sage and sour so that [ __ ] seems like it should be pretty tasty I was going to open it I do like the packaging because I like that it's just a cylinder versus like the little boxes so that's pretty dope now I did just put some lotion on my we can hope this moment open hmm let's see let me drive my [ __ ] hands up [ __ ] shower man [ __ ] be supposed to be this just [ __ ] proof there we go damn alright so we got that open so it's pretty dope actually like that design on the inside they got the birds with an electrical power line so I think that's pretty dope let's take this out boom I like how it comes in this little bag here look like some Indiana generals to be searching for my go be sitting on the thing if he likes switches it out and put some sand on there but it looks like when you use that [ __ ] to switch out the you know what I'm talking about mother okay now this is really good it has a wooden tip on it that's pretty sick I do like the wouldn't it make up the holes at the bottom not a fan of them big ass holes man I like smaller ships because there's that's it gives that too much vapor and make the [ __ ] burned a little too quick for me alright not burn below it basically empties out too quick for me now I'll say the hole I'm not sure if you can see that the hole on the mouthpiece is a really good size cuz when they're too small they end up clogging so I don't like when they try to make the hole super duper small then every time you go to take a hit you gotta suck as hard as you can hear that cop noise and then you good to him he'll so I'm not really a fan of that I will say that and of course this csail like who else why would you not have see so so oil seems pretty normal nice and thick so we gonna use this rich cannabis battery i didn't reveal about that [ __ ] about the battery and oils from this but I really like this battery so I pretty much use this battery with any [ __ ] cartridge I get so I'm gonna burn it I'm like three volts it is so Bottoms Up [ __ ] and [ __ ] it's super smooth hit I will definitely give it that you can definitely taste it you can taste the sour is Vic as a sour taste not like sour powers are nothing like that but it does have a salary taste to it I really like this wouldn't it dude I could taste the season that when I just put it out and put it back in I was any what it tastes the sage it was interesting I wonder if this would tip helps bring out the flavor of the sage it's not saying that's the reason they did I'm just curious because you know when you run certain flavors or wants to say well you were uncertain flavors doing certain things I don't say oh you know it's different drinking a beer from a can versus a glass I wonder if this has anything this has any effect on the flavoring for the weed period but it seemed like I'm able to get the sage on that pretty good so gotta say that shit's pretty nice and it's a sativa dominant okay yeah I was going to try and say yeah so this one has three hundred eighty seven milligrams of THC in it so it's about 77% they also don't use any cutting agents in the ship so that's pretty good I like these [ __ ] these my fingers are smooth man definitely say package is oh yeah anyway so yeah man I like these shits these shits actually pretty dope I can already feel the head change coming up probably work on some music or something actually no I'm not about to go flag your own I just got a drone for Christmas so I'm gonna go out and find out mother if I can have some fun with that Wow this [ __ ] seems pretty don't matter I don't say if you can find one [ __ ] with it I know they come in grams and half grams they also have ones to cite like they got packs pods they dude applicators the dad locators are dope I've had their dad locators that's the first thing I've had it from them as ad applicators til [ __ ] are dope this [ __ ] I believe they also have wax and they also have another cartridge call it the sesh so it's supposed to be like more potent or some [ __ ] like that but this one like I say I actually I dig this [ __ ] this shades pretty flat and I feel like just the wooden tips I've seen some like Marley Naturals with wooden tips a couple other ones but I just really like it is something different and I feel like it probably won't get hot like the tip cuz some of the metal tips they get hot if you ever do a preheat or something like that but this one I think we should be Highwaymen so that's the review on the jetty today really you know I don't really be doing stuff to say get it or not I just get it and tell you what I think about it like I could probably never buy one of these [ __ ] again or I could but I always go through different things I like to try new [ __ ] see what's out there plus a little different yeah I mean anyway definitely that's the end of this video like I always say how much can you really say about a [ __ ] cartridge right so I do have another video coming though in two days and once this up I'll link it up here it's a really really good video it's more so on a medical standpoint of you but I really think you guys are going to dig that [ __ ] so make sure you stick around to check out this other video so I'm

want to talk to you really quick about our vapes [Music] our newest distillate formulation is averaging about 90 cbd and 95 total cannabinoids that's almost double from our previous batches hang on charlie i don't think they heard that right play it again for the people in the back averaging about 90 cbd and 95 total cannabinoids yeah you heard that right our team was able to create a high potency formulation that is a single source true full spectrum crystal resistant distillate with live cannabis terpenes this means that our oil is naturally distilled from the plant and not some concoction of isolated compounds thrown together in a lab like almost all cbd isolate-based vape pens we are also able to leave as much thc in there as we legally can around 0.25 since we are big believers in the benefits of full spectrum oils cbd distillate usually starts to crystallize when the oil reaches 60 potency and beyond because of its molecular structure however we figured out a way to naturally maintain the distillate in its oil form without adding any artificial ingredients or cutting agents like mct or vitamin e finally we introduce real cannabis derived terpenes extracted from freshly frozen cannabis plants in their live state pre-harvest and cure giving our vapes a true-to-plant taste and authentic farm-fresh cannabis experience i have with me here today two of our newest full-spectrum cbd vape pens white fire og and gelato 33. that rhymed lit let me unpack these and give them a try white fire og is an amazing indica that's perfect when you need a little r and r

happiness gelato 33 is the perfect way to go yvonne says this one is nice no substitute just what you're looking for the quality of this vape is top notch you'll definitely be impressed with the taste you're right yvonne there is no substitute for this quality chelsea says i bought this vape because most people say that when you start cbd you should vape it i loved the description of the flavor and it honestly tastes just like that this vape really helped me in the busy hours between work and feeling you get after smoking it is honestly uplifting and relaxing and i'm just now realizing that's the literal explanation they give you in the description of the vape i'm kind of mind blown that this has the effect that secret nature claims in those exact words chelsea we let the quality speak for

we're also going to be reviewing the actual vaporizer battery pen itself so let's go ahead and unbox these things and see what we have here first off is do we have the actual vaporizer pen and this is the pen that's actually provided by heavy hitters that you can purchase that's branded by heavy hitters it includes a little USB charger plug as well as the pen itself and that's a 5-10 thread pin okay and now we're gonna unbox the 1 gram cartridge this is an OG Kush cartridge which is a hybrid but it's in indica dominant and that's the one gram cartridge and now we're gonna unbox the 2.2 gram cartridge this is the ha static cartridge and this is a new flavor it's the blue dream ok so now let's take a closer look at these individual items first we're going to look at the battery itself now the heavy-hitters battery that is available through heavy hitters and which is recommended for the device is just the right wattage at 4 watts it also has no buttons or anything on it the only thing that you can see is the logo on the side for heavy hitters and then the 510 threaded end that actually plugs into the USB charger that's the simple kind of USB charger that plugs directly into USB and you could charge that with other kind of chargers as well ok now we're going to look at the 1 gram pen and this is the cartridge pin for the 1 gram that's the og cush I'm a big AG fan so I'm really looking forward to trying this out in a minute and it's really simple it's just a one piece I know there was a little rubber cap that goes over the 510 thread there on one end but you just could discard the little rubber cap and then you see it's just a simple cartridge that threads directly onto the pin and these are sort of low wattage it's a 3.7 watts recommend it there so you could try these on other pins but you wouldn't want to try these on a modern of high wattage device okay now we're going to take a closer look at the big 2.2 grand pen and these are monsters I really like this the concept here of just making a tank that's gonna last you for a couple of weeks and also a big fan of blue dreams so looking also for it to trying this out and you can see this pin is so big that it's actually the cartridge is a little bit longer than the pen itself but it's very similar to the other pen other than the length of it it has screws right on to the end of the battery and it's the same battery that you can use on both size cartridges look at that at this like a it's like a rifle or something they're just not rifle you can see the comparing the two you can also see that the two oils look different as these are strange specific and you can also see out of the quality of the oil is very good how thick it is that takes that bubbles so long to roll up but one thing to be cautioned with and this is a lot of vaporizer pens they will roll off the table and break so be careful you don't want to break your heavy head or you'll cry okay so it now comes the favorite part the part of that we've been waiting for here at Roth house studios and this is amazing a pen if you've tried any kind of these cartridges you just can't equal the taste I really like the little light-up end there when you you don't have to do anything when you draw through the pen it lights it up and also ignites the the vaporizer atomizers so you don't have to press any buttons or anything like that it's just air controlled and then I had a little fun here to try both flavors at once that OG Kush was delicious by the way very piney a little bit of lemon but very piney and delicious and the same goes for the Blue Dream it wasn't as pioneer but it was a much more lemony citrusy flavor and just awesome the flavor on these is incredible and heavy-hitters is the correct name you can get major puffs especially for the low wattage coils you can still get major big puffs and like I said we've tried these on multiple batteries and they work good with most of your low wattage batteries but you do need to be careful not to use too high of a wattage of a battery because you get burnt out the coil in the atomizer and it won't work another thing to be cautious with about using these heavy headers or any kind of the cartridges or a lot of these cartridges especially the high-end strong ones like this is that you can find yourself overmedicating very easily because it's such a pleasant experience it tastes so good and it doesn't make you cough and choke that after a few hits you may just find yourself staring out into the window aimlessly and forgetting what you're doing so be careful not to over Medicaid and don't drive or operate machinery obviously anytime but especially in the case with with these heavy headers because they are appropriately named-- you will definitely get very very high off of these all right very easily super high quality very premium premium oil right here [Music] so that comes to my review or my rating for the heavy hitters and I'm gonna give it five stars I really can't find any problems with it the only problem that I have is you're gonna be upset if you let it roll off the table and break it which is only a testament to the product itself just top-notch product so I would like to say thank you to heavy hitters who sent out these pens for us to review if you'd like to learn more about heavy hitters you can check them out online and you could also ask for them at your local dispensary I hope you enjoyed this review of the heavy hitters solvent free concentrated cannabis wax pens if you did please hit the like button and subscribe to

to guess what man we back today and today we're gonna do a review on something a little different got this little package today of course I got the little sticker and everything like that that always comes with to the phone's product but today we're gonna do the Twitter phone's be calm and not only we're going to do the favicon but it came in this nice case so then if you're gonna go and it says it's a travel case so I don't know if you could take you on the plane I'm not going trying to do that so this is the travel case this is the car this is the gelato number 33 to see what this bottle looks like is it thick okay thanks see my house is kind of cool right now got my a/c on it's 90 degrees outside and gorge yourself when I got this out the mailbox the box was actually hot so maybe I'll all use a little thicker but it still looks pretty good so I'm gonna start here of course we got the tweeter phone's battery that comes with it charge it that has the little tweeter phones logo on it which is cool this really looks cool it's rad so let's put this together and see we working here I know this thing should have some charge on it we're gonna test it out so it does have charge it has three voltage settings and the way you change the voltage you press the button here three times now let's see with a song okay that's green I think Green is the medium that's blue that's a lower setting and that's red so actually it's the other way around I think but whatever it is and you press it two times to preheat so now is preheating we're gonna stop that way I wanted to get to and not a bad taste not a bad taste tastes almost like it has mint in it and let's look at the it also comes with the letter to law enforcement of course I love having that this is how to here tells you how to operate that animals and this product has 65 point 93% cannaboids and the total CBD percentage is 65 point 87 percent Wow that's a lot okay so this is not the full special product or a broad spectrum so right now we're dealing with discipline so that's what this is all about right here so this product here is good to calm you down you know if you have anxiety or if you just want to relax this is what this is good for it doesn't taste bad I also want to try a few different flavors so I kind of like it me as far as the effects I'm really not getting too much of an effect in it that was my second time pulling on it so give me a minute I'll let you guys know how I felt but it doesn't taste bad that's the most important part I know I heard a lot of people complaining about I hate the way it paints and this one doesn't taste bad the Delano 33 pretty good good job three two forms I'm just waiting to see how that this affects me right now I've had anything today I didn't smoke any flower no CBD babe juice because I do they I'm starting to feel a little calm now all that CBB inside here it's not a work already yeah absolutely so it was definitely doing what it's supposed to do I'm feeling a little calm or a little better than what I did when I first started shooting this video so you know I got a weap calling this over meanness all we really do with this thing here man I like it so I'm definitely gonna be ordering some more cards from Twitter forms few other companies I'm gonna try them all out you know I'll let you guys know exactly how this thing goes be back with you in a few feet", "2RWJYgjCpMk": "[Music] what's up guys I burned a 420 I'm back with a new review I got told you I had the happy Stix yesterday and I have happy Stix sunset gelato which is a hybrid it is a point five cartridge if you see this right here here's the California symbol there's a hybrid it comes with a little thing telling that it's premium cannabis vape concentrate no cartridge in the back guys you have your lab test where it was tested it was at the hive lab LLC here's the little code they give you it is 83 point 96 percent THC and it is 0.53 to 2 point 65 percent on CBD and it also tells you when it was manufactured when it was packaged and when it expires it was manufactured February 27 to 2019 packaged the 28th of February 2019 and it expires on 2020 in February so you literally got a year to smoke a point vibe that is not that bad at all you can also find on my happy sticks and I'll tell you right now guys in California they they gave me a little undies just for China in the first time so I got three for the price of like one actual like real heavy hitters and a free battery which is not that bad at all so you pop it off on the back like that comes in as little doobie tube look at this look at that that little smiley face right there this is happy sticks in the back look at that bubble guys don't even move you pop the doobie to route slide it up look here's your cartridge here's come to green seal to tell you that it's a hybrid the purple one is an indica which I've started to notice and look they have the flat tip like the old kingpins and they don't have anything at the bottom guys because they baby having all that [ __ ] at the bottom Dee's don't you can get a worry about under that we're gonna try this out on the happy Stig's battery I got and cheers let's see saw sunset gelatos okay it is pretty sweet it does taste like a fruit flavor basically I just tasted a little bit of pineapple for some reason it tastes a little bit of strawberries as well but it was pretty sweet compared to the the indica I had forgot the name of did lazy og this one's better the flavouring on this one is way better and really smooth guys like they don't really hurt your throat but they do pack a punch once you take a couple in-house let's see the second here guys my bed is early in the morning down here this is good I'll tell you right now because the first thing guys smoke today in the morning and already got me baked for eighty-three point 96 percent THC it's pretty damn good my eyes feel really low it does feel like a hybrid guys it doesn't make you like tired it kind of has me uplifted a little bit at the same time slake made me a little bit tired but compared to the indica this indica from yesterday it had me extremely tired because I got here pretty early and they added me extremely tired by like six o'clock in the afternoon this one I think this is gonna have me up but at least a little bit tired close to the end of the night but that's what I'm looking for basically if you haven't heard of these guys happy sticks the flavouring and the high ten out of ten they actually deserve it they are they do have the lab tests right here you don't have to be looking for real or fakes with these and like I said guys stay high stay tuned comment and like down below and don't forget to subscribe and Cheers because I got more coming soon [Music]", "HmF48q-kI8o": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive kind of think of it every day is a good day to be alright guys back here for another video and today is just a beautiful day guys like look at the back man everything's looking at look brave things looking good so today I decided to do another cart review because I know you guys are wondering when is Shaka Zulu gonna try that sierpinski card I got a strabinsky card and then I got a I got another card forgot what it was it was the crew card actually the crew car isn't I got some flour from a dispensary called nug in the East Bay if you haven't seen that vlog that vlog will be in one of these two corners guys go check out that vlog right now and then come back to this vlog but go check that out and then come back but if you guys don't know not yet there a dispenser in the East Bay and recently actually shout out to nug for this they subscribe to my channel I think they follow me on IG and they um they recently put me on their page on there sorry there's an animal over there but they recently put me on there their webpage so if you go to nug webpage I'll put the link in the description where it is I am on their webpage and I think that's so dope and I hope to grow our relationship hopefully you know and maybe do some review of some nug things you know so hopefully that happens we'll see what happens guys I don't know this is my first time you know having like a company actually reached out to me and asked me about like putting my video on their webpage and stuff like that but that's definitely a good thing as hella freaking dope so today guys we're gonna try two cars from there alright now we're just gonna try one car I'm just gonna split into two different videos but I want to try at least one card so I can have something to smoke on for a couple days and yeah we're gonna try the shirt Biscay car guys but before that I'm a smoke and we're actually gonna probably walk around and try the cards so I'm probably gonna head out and meet up with one of my friends and we're just gonna chill we're gonna chill for today and he's he's the type of person that doesn't like me on the vlogs guys so you guys won't see him but he'll be there and I'll just be smoking and just talking about my life and what's going on and what not but yeah let's take a freaking rip guys and also guys before I take this rip please go to nugs go to nugs youtube and sub them I will put their youtube link in the comments and in the description below and please go to that video guys and say shaka x4 20 cent you you know show them some love guys show them that we are a freaking we're a community that supports them you feel me because they're dope ass community they they make a good product so let's support them and maybe they'll help me out you know give me products so you guys can see the product - you know I'm saying so you know go shop if you [ __ ] with me if you're a day one please go go to nug and tell them I sent you guys tell them I sent you but here's a bum rib I'm gonna take this bond right before I leave [Music] smooth this isn't the tree that I got from note I wanted to try that for blog mic roll up a joint our palm our King palm but this is some pool that I got off of one of the homies real clicks just talk I have something to smoke [Music] alright guys I hope everyone's smoking with me right now if you're not ha just pause the video because the deals not done yet go get you some call up your dispensary do what you gotta do and come back guys see you guys in like seconds so guys I'm out here I'm gonna walk the homie you already know what it is he's over there you know gonna keep him off camera right now guys you guys already know that I told you guys but I got the new car guys I've never tried this car and it's additionally car guys you guys know me you know I love my life resident and I kind of sometimes this gets chill alive but that's just because I don't care about the flavor too much I love that dank this that comes with the live presentation in the sauces and stuff like that but we got the freaking Serpent's Keys I'm pretty sure that's how you pronounce it sharpen skis and it's the acai berry gelato so one gram cart but um says ingredients so it's a cannabis oil mixed in with terpenes so you can get the flavor of the gelato basically and it's seventy six percent THC and twenty point two five percent CBD but it's kind of low actually usually I feel like dis Chili's usually have a higher THC but it's in the 70s so I'm gonna see how it is I'm not really trippin about the percentage I already know I'm probably gonna still get lifted but it's in a dope-ass little box and I have uh I looked on their website and honestly they have a cool-ass battery that I want to try like because it matches with their card the card looks pretty pretty decent let me show you already took it off the box for you guys so it's easier on me so let me get it closed up for you guys so boom the cart honestly looks bigger than your normal cart using the stag bat right now but um the card is honestly bigger than your normal cart that's why I think the bubble is so big because when I opened it up guys it looks so big this bubble right here you guys can see it it looks so big it looks like they didn't fill it up at all but because it's a bigger car I think that's why if anyone knows tell me in the comments but cool I like the color the orange color the tip is a little different I've never seen a tip like that but it looks pretty decent and then it has the little holes in the side for air flow so it doesn't get clogged and whatnot so let's see how it smells guys this car actually has a good smell to it has like a I don't know it's like a it's like a sweetheart like smell to it it actually smells hella freakin good it smells like sweet tarts so I'm not gonna go I give it like I give it like a 8 on the smell and then the oil looks pretty good like it almost has it maybe a little bit darker than like your raw garden and other distillates but honestly it still looks good guys so you know what guys we're gonna give it a try I love this design actually [ __ ] let's see oh I like this taste [Music] it pretty much tastes like it smells honestly have like a sweet find a sweet tart sweet taste to it guys like yeah it's definitely got the sweet berry taste it definitely doesn't have that gelato like your normal gelato but I guess that's because it's the Akaya berry gelato guys but I'm not gonna lie it's pretty good I'll give it an 8 out of 10 on my skill just because I'm not a distillate guy this car is like made for people who like to get that we know that fruity terpene taste from different you know flowers or whatnot they want to get that flavorful [ __ ] you know or they're trying to be discreet you're at home you can't really smoke inside you got kids whatever you know you you hit this pin guys you hit this pin but you know me I got a stick with live resin I can't I don't know I'm gonna smoke the heck out of this and probably the other district art that I have but I probably won't buy it as often only if you guys want me to if you guys want me to do another review of this guys let me know because there's probably other even better flavors and I need to check actually to see if they have a live resin let me know guys in the comments if they have a live resident uh sure Pinsky's let me know guys because I feel like every freaking any company that makes cards and they're just making additionally you're gonna be losing in the game of the the marijuana game you know you gotta have a live resin a sauce it out because that's what people are on now because it's too many fake digital cards they be cutting it with things with flavors and stuff and people just want that sauce because you know could you could taste it and tell that is the real deal because you get the flower profile guys the flower profile so let me take a couple more rips and then I'm probably gonna do it's just a chill day guys like walking around getting a little exercise cuz can't just be stuck home all day on the computer playing video games watching Netflix and all that [ __ ] now let me shut up and take a rip it's two nd and it's just fly it anywhere does but bro this is a [ __ ] hitter guys it's gonna have me load his [ __ ] I'm already filling it right now [ __ ] mm-hmm but I'm gonna take one more rib and then I'm just gonna hang out with the homie right now more vlogs coming more vlogs coming soon guys I plan on doing a vlog this weekend I hope it goes down guys we're gonna freakin go to Berkeley and we'll see was poppin so who knows what's gonna happen it might just be a daily a day in the life kind of vlog fan guys so you'll see that coming soon plus I got another car to do I gotta try out that flower that I haven't even tried yet guys I had to do for you guys man shout out to you guys for commenting like all the time I see all my day ones there and I [ __ ] what y'all have you know so just keep doing y'all remember to breathe no stress guys and peace I'm gonna take this last riff for you guys in a bonus one for us oh it's not over yet [Music] - baked when you're not recording at the to dinner [Music]", "I3C5WsMIXmc": "oh how you doing guys war vision back for another review I'm gonna be talking a little bit louder in this video I noticed the audio of my videos has been a little bit hard to hear if you don't use headphones to watch the videos so just got done busting a dab of some of this cherry wine from extracts labs easily some of the tastiest CBD that I've had and I have a very tasty product to review for you tonight as well so I got this earlier today this is something I've been wanting to try for a while secret nature's vape cartridges now I did a video on secret nature's but back in the past so if you'd like to see that go ahead and check it out but this is secret nature's vape cartridges these are some of the most highly regarded cartridges that I've seen online everyone says they're top of the line and the reason why is because they're you they use cannabis drive terpenes so they use terpenes derived from actual but this particular cartridge i'm going to be reviewing is the gelato strain gelato if you don't know is one of the most popular top-shelf cannabis strains right now in legal states it's like 30 percent THC I think and it's a cross between well it was the gelato strain was created using the famous strain Girl Scout cookies or GSC so this is supposed to be a extremely popular top-shelf cannabis strain and I've never tried it so I decided to go with the gelato cartridge flavor it is a hybrid because the gelato cannabis strain is a hybrid so they extract the terpenes and they mix it with CBD distillate this particular distillate that they use is 51% CBD 0.2 three percent THC so you get that full spectrum entourage effect the only thing that this oil is lacking that I would have liked to see is CBG and CBC those are some other cannabinoids when you get high concentrations of all these cannabinoids you get what is called the entourage effect which means you get its more full spectrum and they work together to produce the effects that they would have it would have naturally caused or produced in like but if you're smoking bud so the more cannabinoid spectrum you have the more effects you are likely to feel so this is a 1/2 gram 500 milligram cartridges if it's 50% CBD there's 250 milligrams of CBD in this so the first thing I noticed when I open this package up is the packaging on secret nature this packaging is super professional-looking in just premium and it sits like a hard cardboard stock it almost reminds me of like when you buy a new phone the black cardboard box it comes in that's kind of what this is and I like that they use cardboard versus plastic the amount of plastic that we use as humans is getting out of control it's not good so any company that's using a paper or cardboard I applaud them for that so I'm gonna go ahead and show you this packaging it is beautiful it's black and it's got gold ink and it's even like indented and raised up in some parts so when you open it up it slides open which is cool and then the cartridge was sitting right in there so really cool packaging in the front says secret nature artisan cvd gelato hybrid vapor cartridge full spectrum CBD distillate 500 milligrams on the back that secret nature our goal is to help people enhance their chosen lifestyle through relaxation meditation relief in creativity this 100% organic extract is a true full-spectrum CBD distillate has been purified to concentrate beneficial compounds while removing unwanted plant materials full-spectrum oils contain a wide wide array of cannabinoids like I explained together these compounds synergize entourage effect to create the desired effects from the planet we use real cannabis flower terpenes THC free source from artisan cultivators in California to enhance our extracts and give a true plant experience this company is out of Rogue Valley Oregon without further ado so 10 out of 10 for the packaging let's get into it I'm going to show you the cartridge before I taste it so this oil is like really light in color it almost looks if you've ever poured a mountain Dew in a clear glass that's kind of what the color looks like and it's got this really nice metal mouthpiece I'm not sure what kind of cartridge this is it doesn't say C cell on it but it's definitely a ceramic coiled cartridge the oil is very thick as you can see the bubbles are not moving which is expected CBD oil is usually very thick because it crystallizes around 60% so these are supposed to be some of the tastiest cartridges available because they have real cannabis terpenes so we'll go ahead and try this gelato so the first thing I noticed when hitting this cartridge is it kind of has a a hard you have to kind of pull a little bit harder than you wouldn't normally then I've had to pull on cartridges in the past which doesn't bother me sometimes I like having to pull a little bit harder because you can almost feel how much smoke you're taking in a little bit easier and the mouthpiece has a really sturdy feel to it I don't know it feels good on the lips Wow so the flavor on this stuff is amazing you get all flavor and nothing else you don't get any weird taste you're just getting the terpene flavor so it kind of has like a woody fruity taste to it I know that sounds weird woody but that's literally what it I'm getting and it's an enjoyable taste yeah I don't know how to describe it a head it's like oh like a woody fruity taste like almost like if you I don't know I'm almost getting like some strawberries what I want to say but extremely tasty um if you want a cartridge that for the flavor check out secret nature because this is the best tasting cartridge I've probably ever tried this blows for the people's card Church out of the watermelon taste I mean I thought this tasted pretty good but I mean this is this is the real deal Wow amazing taste I'm I would actually really like to try all their flavors now too rather not like a sample pack because it's really that tasty so I got this from the chrome leaf if you watch my videos you know I've been getting a lot of cartridge from the Khalif website it's because the cone Lee's hat the chrome leaf has the cheapest cartridge prices that I've found online so the cone leaf is a reseller so they'll buy also from a company and then sell but they're pricing their pride it's very very cheap I went to the secret nature website and the cartridge on the secret nature website are even more expensive than what you'll find that the column leaves so if you're interested in cartridges check out the palm leaf and I would highly recommend secret nature I think this 1/2 gram cartridge runs at about 40 maybe like 44 dollars for a half gram so it is expensive but it's not uncommon for what we're seeing CBD cartridges being priced at right now and this is I'll tell you what a premium product I would choose this over for the people for sure just based on the taste and the looks of the oil but like I said the only thing lacking in this is the CBG and cbc that's okay it still is a full spectrum product I have to give this 10 out of 10 the effects on this stuff I did hit it a few times before I did this video just to try to give you guys good effects I'm not tired at all it is a hybrid so just with the terpenes you're not gonna get sedated or anything like that and especially it's got the lower CBD not lower CBD percentage but right around 50 so this would be a great daytime product to use I feel energetic but focused as well and I'm also used to CBD so if you're not used to seedy trying a cartridge like this may make you very tired you know it kind of just depends on your tolerance your body type what time of the day you're using it but overall good effects on this stuff I definitely feel it with any constancy be concentrate you will feel it if it's full-spectrum and I feel just a little bit lighter a little bit more uplifted a little bit happier more and more content with life that's my review on secret nature gelato cartridge I couldn't give this anything less than a 10 out of 10 to be honest with you well I've give it a 9 out of 10 because me personally I would like a little bit more full-spectrum maybe a little bit more THC like right cut off maybe even some thca to really bring out the full spectrum effects and hit yet but nonetheless this is a very uplifting cartridge and extremely flavorful that's all for this review I hope everyone's having a great day night whatever it is as always peace out", "GmvfI-Qe4CM": "all right y'all jp checking in man respect my region i gotta go right here because the wind is insane today

you couldn't tell from the title this is the interesting video this is obviously a cartridge video but this is surprising I've never seen like a cartridge come in this measurement before and that measurement is 0.75 this was only like 25 or something like 25 to 28 dollars I'm not too sure I forgot but you can see right here it says 0.75 milliliters or grams or whatever we want to call it and it is white Walker ology by cruise I've never tried cruise cartridge but I've tried they're there but and it was good you know very very decent flour for decent prices but I believe this is also this is going to be distantly I believe so you know which is still pretty good you know I'm not I like distillate but as you like I really prefer like sauce cards or live raising card some more you know but this split is it bad it's just sometimes it's just like a artificial flavor so we're gonna see what this is and this is white Walker og you see all the specifications right there everything on the back you can pause if I'm going too fast hopefully it's focusing so just like in the other previous videos I like to mention that my merch is available right now I'll post the link in the bond description below this is just one of the sweaters and they have various colors I think I have like twelve twelve designs on there so like if you don't like one maybe you'll like on another one you know so there's one things to choose from and there's a lot of colors on all of them so I got you there and if you guys are interested I'll post a link people been telling me to make merch for a while and these are all designs I've made myself and I feel like it's more genuine that way because I wouldn't want to paste to design something for me I feel like it should come from the content creator you know and not to knock on any of like other content creators but some of their stuff is a little bit lacking I really wanted to like make it known that I made these and also you know I I understand that most people don't really want cannabis on their shirts so that's why I have some shirts that's just it's more about my life you know like how I was actually born in San Francisco I have a San Francisco shirt the bridge is a conic bridge I think we all know even people that don't live in California fall you know about the Bay Bridge and there's a story behind that because like I named that shirt the bridge to the Spencer eeeh and it's because back when Modesto didn't have too much we had to go to the bay and get all their [ __ ] you know and we had to cross that bridge and it's a play on to that one movie I didn't even see that movie Bridge to Terabithia there's some [ __ ] so I thought it was pretty cool but yes you were not inclined to buy any of these things if you want to support me and buy one of these you're more than welcome to but you're also more than welcome to just not buy it and just chilled me still so let's get on with this [ __ ] review what are you doing but link will be in the book down below so this is white Walker og syndicate as you can see right here really really good stuff it looks pretty nice no no way cartridge so far it's a [ __ ] plastic radiator Calvin your sticker our caution sticker whatever you want to call it I'm not gonna lie this looks pretty [ __ ] nice this thing the oil test or whatever this is dumb as hell I mean I've seen some that's very liquidy and you know what that's just it but very thick I mean this just proves how thick the oil is I mean other than it's [ __ ] legit cuz it's not moving no it could still be sure you know trash off the bed notice that there's some like weird like thing on here that I definitely gotta wash off be using it in my as a beauty which reminds me I still need to do that giveaway for this I'm waiting on light so I can do a live on YouTube in choose a winner but guys [Music] Cheers [Music] very small - not too tasty at all of you is that some sort of taste but I'm not really sure how to describe it I mean it's definitely alright I definitely wouldn't prefer other cartridges I mean what enticed me though was that it was 0.75 for twenty-something dollars which is pretty weird for a cartridge like they usually never come in 2075 so I had to get it never tried cruise cartridges soul paper production is there though it's a very like the sensation to cough afterwards is minimal the taste can't really describe the taste but it's minimal as well other than that pretty decent cartridge if you don't really care about taste you're trying to forget about value out of what you buy because it is 80 percent THC cartridge and I believe it as some sort of amount of CBD in it other than that very good cartridge for what it is not a very tasty one in my opinion but that's just me maybe it's just because I brush my teeth no but woman playing an end the video here hopefully you guys enjoyed it [Music] [Music] [Music]", "N_zruHc9dHk": "yo hey guys and welcome back to my

guys chain vaping before i start waking and baking when they land and they fall the crystals on these many grams predicted all like a crystal ball charged his bad boy last night it's my geek vape aegis x with the tfv16 tank by smock on top i'm using um some choice e-liquids it's called uh doodle drip it's like a snickerdoodle cookie so it's pretty fire you can't lie it's only a three milligram so it's not too harsh but um blood sacrifice and beats not throwing on the torch yeah it's not harsh at all it is a three milligram but it's smooth like it's a zero so that's really good i barely need any breaking time this morning nobody's [ __ ] we all ride each other's dick for crops nobody gets everybody hold yeah but i barely need any break in time so i might start um taking some blinkers this video since i don't have to vape uh too much to get used to it nobody gets you nobody [Applause] pretty much empty but i'm just going to hit it to make sure that it's empty in the wide white depths next to the iris inside of the redness that i accepted his eyes exit the pride to the left step in the light heavens arrive your imbalances are chemically derived at the end of the night the [ __ ] are two separate lives but that's my jeter juice gelato cart i'll go ahead and hit a blinker see if there's any uh oil left in the cart that got soaked up overnight time so let's see like i am legend while the virus is spreading somehow i survive infection smoking mirrors cut you between both your [Music] [Music] that's pretty much the end of my gelato cart but it's pretty much the end of this thing but um that's okay because i brought out another cart i've got cheater juice strawberry cheesecake this is a hybrid by jeter juice you can see the cart in a little window it's also made to look like a juice box little straw on top press the button on the side and you open it but i do have to break the seal on the bottom but i'm probably gonna wait for one more video to open up that cart i'll probably take another blinker out of this empty cart see if i can get anything else out of it and then uh my next video probably opened the jujuju strawberry cheesecake in case you guys are interested in that i'll let you guys know how it tastes and how it's hidden how potent it is ever wondering what song is playing in the backgrounds one of these videos you guys can just leave a timestamp down below i'll do my best to let you guys know what the name of the song is i'll let you guys know that because it's what's important to me whenever i'm listening to a youtube video i like to know what i'm listening to in the background that's if youtube doesn't already pick it up and already link it below the video you can check down below if it's already there if it's not i'll let you guys know it's anything like any other other carts it should be a tasty cart and also potent as well it's a hybrid i usually prefer a sativa or an indica but um hybrid will definitely get me faded this morning see how it's barely anything inside of there [ __ ] it i'm just hitting it just to make sure there's nothing left inside get this cursed take another blinker cheers wasting your preference not as much as uh when i first opened it or anything like that but um definitely a good thing to hit the cart even when you can't see any wax left in there glad i'm used to vaping already so i can take some blingers and uh vape at the same time i don't warm up my lungs with the vape before i start smoking then the vape's usually harsh and i have to warm up but after i start smoking i like doing that so i usually just start smoking like right when i hop out of the shower type of [ __ ] to watch videos ad free offline and in the background start a free trial of youtube premium today i don't want this video to take too long and i do want to open up my strawberry cheesecake card for you guys in another video so um if you enjoyed this video make sure to slap the like button down below if you guys

is going on people of earth my name is chilly dilly back at you with another chill ass video man and in today's video we're gonna be talking about does delta really get you high [Music] okay so i know i haven't really talked about delta e lately um i haven't really made a video over it uh just because you know sometimes i want to and sometimes i don't uh but i realize i've never made a video just me sitting down talking about do i actually get high from delta so i haven't smoked all day for the video so let's go ahead and get 30 likes on this video and we will make a cake cart review okay so the cake cart has actually been like really popping for delta 8. um a lot of people have liked it so i went ahead just bought one they didn't send me any so i went ahead and bought one with my own money so if i don't like if i don't get high i'm out and you just learned a valuable lesson through me okay so yeah anyway man so yeah 30 likes and we will do a cake review uh so i've tried like a lot of delta cards and edibles now at this point um delta companies out there if you're seeing this if you want to hit me up man send me some of your bud the concentrates i've yet to try those i would love to try those man um but i haven't found a company to work with that i really like so we're gonna go ahead open this okay so this i literally haven't smoked all day and this is a first review so i'm pretty pumped for it honestly i'm not gonna review it necessarily i will tell you like what i think about it how i feel about it uh or what i think like the taste is let's see gotta pop like five things open just to even get to it so that's cool but yeah i've heard a lot of good things about the cake parts um they're disposable this is what it looks like this is actually pretty nice looking i mean it's pretty sleek i love disposable stuff like i'm a sucker for disposable pins to be honest with you um so yeah let's go ahead we're just going to hit this a bunch hot box the whip and see if i get high as [ __ ] okay like i said i haven't smoked all day so i should feel effects pretty quick uh as long as it does get me high now i've tried different ones like edibles have made me high and some of the pins made me high whereas i took the deltae pills if you haven't seen that video and it did not make me high at all by the way we got lemon kush it's an indica so i'm trying to be in the couch because i got the night off don't uh worry about this i got it at work all right so we're gonna take a couple hits um yeah give you your give you my first impressions and see if i actually get high maybe we can take a blinker i don't know if it allows us to take a blinker but uh cheers boys [Music] okay it definitely tastes kind of like lemon one thing i will always say delta makes me cough like a [ __ ] so if you haven't seen any of my delta videos before definitely go watch them um getting high on delta is definitely a person-to-person kind of thing okay so don't come to this video expecting me to be like oh i got so high like regular weed because i don't think that's gonna happen that's really never happened um and i'm not really a big fan of carts anymore to be honest i've kind of stopped you know hitting carts or whatever anyway though and also for people that like comment and [ __ ] like oh i took this many milligrams will i be okay we don't know i don't know i'm not a doctor i'm not a scientist you'll be fine you'll be fine at the end of the day regardless uh so that first hit was pretty tasty honestly kind of like packed a punch my chest is a little heavy uh or felt like somebody just like hit my chest really um we're gonna take a pretty big hit now honestly bro cheers boys [Music] oh [ __ ] that was a big hit all right so i've two hits i'm already like my mind is a little at ease my body is a little relaxed i would definitely say that i'm not like big hot obviously if i took two of those hits off of a like a wax pen like a real dab pen i think i'd be pretty [ __ ] high but i will say that my body is really relaxed my eyes are kind of getting heavy right now i will say so far that this is living up to its height to be honest with you because these are better than other cars i've tried we might just get high off this man let me know what you guys are smoking a lot dabbing along eating long or eating on i guess um let me know if you guys are using deltae pens delta bud uh like i said i've never tried the bud would love to try it man i'm more of a bud person i love the ritual of rolling up smoking all that [ __ ] i've i've even seen that they have moon rocks now so like that's so cool anyway let's go ahead and take a third hit off this man let's try to get a big hit i mean i want to try to take a blinker but cheers boys all right boys we just took a massive hit i just had like a five minute coughing spree i thought i was gonna die not die but puke i forgot how heavy delta could be on the [ __ ] lungs bro i forgot how much it makes me cough it's been a couple weeks really since i've smoked any dull tape i gotta say though these three big hits boys i'm pretty high like i'm gonna be real with you i actually haven't been this high on any delta a cart so [ __ ] 30 likes man we'll do a review on this i think you could probably get your money's worth out of this to be real hey cake if you see this definitely hit me up man this is good all right bro three hits i'm high i'm pretty high man i think i'm gonna go in there still and smoke like a blunt to get the the full mind effects the psychoactive effect sometimes that i love so much um we're gonna take a couple more hits man we're just gonna dip out i'm high delta definitely got me high it's gotten me high before so don't always let tell people don't always let people tell you that it can't um like i said and i've said multiple times it does go person to person so i will say that this got me high man so let's take another hit let's bounce out of here 30 likes and we will do a cake review man make sure you do like comment subscribe all that good youtube [ __ ] man uh i don't get paid to do this so if you just you know do your part and you like the video man and you watch it youtube pushes it and we get to go up in the world and i get to finally tell my parents i did something with my life cheers boys yeah i'm not taking another humongous hit man that hit just wrecked my lungs like i just coughed for like 10 minutes straight i thought i was gonna puke i was coughing so much oh dude that was terrible though that [ __ ] got me high i'm not even gonna i'm not even gonna lie boys like i would not lie to you about this like i'm a little [ __ ] hot you can kind of see it in my eyes like i know my eyes look pretty [ __ ] but like that's just because i was coughing a lot all right let's take another hit and let's do it man i'm honestly i'm super pumped that i did this video this actually turned out really good i didn't have super high hopes for it it looks kind of like a jewel kind of i don't know i like it though anyway less hit let's kind of make it a kind of big one i don't know i really don't want to die but we'll see it's for the content all right man all right boys that's it man delta got me high i think it could definitely get you high and i think beyond getting just high it would help with uh you know the anxiety and [ __ ] that delta 9 can give some people so i definitely think this uh should be for a lot of people i think a lot of people should try this [ __ ] uh yeah anyway just happy to live in a world where you know this is partly illegal and cannabis is becoming more legal so yeah much loved you guys see you guys in the next video remember 30 likes a review over the cake cart itself yeah i will see you guys in the next video peace", "8gLu6aKZtmE": "[Music] damn oh my god i'm sweating look i'm sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel so this is another three chive delta eight vape cartridge review the last one that i did did so well that i just well i had to do another one if i release a video and it gets 800 hits or 800 views in a for like a week oh yeah i'm definitely doing another video so the one that i got is blue dream and it's a one milliliter container brand new sealed and that's how i like it and you can see right there it contains 95 percent eight delta eight th oil and then five percent of [ __ ] which you know whatever i guess you gotta i guess it can't be a hundred percent or it would probably just knock you on your ass and stuff uh the directions remove the silicone cover and screw into the battery do not over tighten take one puff and wait 20 minutes wow wait 20 minutes um usage is between one and two puffs let's see here i'm trying to focus it for you guys i can't focus it whatever uh says do not operate any machinery while using this product do not use if pregnant nursing or under the age of 21 this may cause a positive drug test well no [ __ ] oh my god uh let's see here if you need more typical usage it's one or two puffs do not operate wait a minute where's that one part at wait 20 minutes before determining if you need more oh okay 5 10 battery 100 percent hint driving contains 0.3 is that a 9 thc batch 6 out of 15 2021 batch id three chives fishery blah blah blah blah all right blue dream sweet so i have a couple other ones over here these are the fx these are delta eight fx cartridges um and i designed this little thing to keep them in the upright for me because sometimes i'll run out and these right here will be enough to get you by for a few days especially if you leave them in the upright these are this was like orange crush and like granddaddy purple if i remember correctly i didn't really care um for the granddaddy purple i do want to say one thing though there is a big difference between the ethics cartridge and the delta eight cartridges i feel like the delta eight cartridges these are put together better they just seem to be i don't know i don't have any leakage they hardly ever clog they just seem to be a better cartridge than the fx the fx are also a lot cheaper too these are like 30 something dollars and these are like 60 something dollars okay now the effects of this all right let's say you're sitting on the couch smoking a blunt there you go you're going to get high but this is great because you can be out public you could be in a mall walking around hitting this and people are just going to think that you're vaping and that's the beautiful part about it and it delivers i mean just one one good hit delivers like a serious bond grip i mean it's depending on your tolerance and how much you smoke it can get you really really really really really high um like for instance i got friends that do not smoke like me i consider myself to be a pothead meaning that i i blaze it up every day we smoke it down okay that's just me i've been like that for 20 years um but we're not talking about me this i hit it one time and i'm like whoo all right if i get somebody that doesn't smoke like me and they hit it they gotta sit down and sometimes they're out for the count like uh like i actually had one friend hit it and it ruined her whole night she felt like [ __ ] it just messed her up and then i had another buddy uh i mean it put his ass on the couch so i guess the effects is just different depending on who you are and how much you smoke but let me tell you what it's definitely worth it it's discreet nobody knows that you have it plus there's no smell like you blaze that [ __ ] up man you hit it pow pow pow you get a big old dragon's breath cloud and it don't smell like weed it's awesome you can take it to work that's the best part about it man is that there's no paraphernalia there's no weed nobody knows you have it on you the only way somebody's gonna know you have it is if they physically see it no smells man i i've been pulled over by the police and i had this on me he didn't even ask me not clean as a whistle goodbye give me my ticket leave awesome these things definitely have their benefits definitely and if you're going to have this you got to have a 510 battery okay this is an e-leaf very simple 510 battery plugs into the bottom i don't know an hour charge you're good to go all you do is you hold the button wait for it to get to about there and then you start hitting it hit it slow you're not trying to rip on it you're just trying to take a slow even deep breath and even that might be too much for you three child blue dream now one thing i did like about it was all they had so many selections for these and then they told you about what they did like this is a sativa brand um this is supposed to give you clarity um it's not supposed to make you foggy it's supposed to give you energy and make you awake and whatever whatever whatever like it claims what it is it's a um a sativa synthetic it's a blend of you know indica and this brand i mean like it tells you what they are and what they're mixed with their strands and everything so you really can't go wrong so it's not like you don't know what you're buying you know what i mean sorry if there's a little bit of an echo i'm trying to do this privately this is illegal in my state you know so you really don't want to be advertising what you're doing that's the other thing like a cop a cop knows what this is because this does not look like a typical vape that's the other thing that you need to be aware of this is very identifiable if they're a cop and they deal with this [ __ ] they've seen this before they will know exactly what you have in your hand so be aware of that uh your average person not so much you know i mean you go out for a cigarette break you hit it once or twice nobody's going to even say it or even notice it but be careful because police they they probably will know what the hell that is i mean because all vape cartridges come the same basically the same look you know all right we're actually starting to get to the meat and potatoes oh come on [ __ ] come on out now here's another thing i like is that they come with these uh get out damn it [ __ ] it's pressure treated uh is that they come with these plastic things right to keep them covered now when i transport mine for instance see like these these even have it on them when i transport them because sometimes i'll take this with me and then i'll take another flavor with me it's very important that you keep that cap on there all right because if you don't keep that cap on there lint and trash and garbage and other things that are in your pocket will get into these little holes and ports and you don't want that because that's going to mess everything up for you so it's very important that you keep these little plastic covers and if you want to even keep the mouthpiece because you know see like this mouthpiece see all the stuff that's in there that's from it being in my pocket like lint and trash and other things get up inside of that you know what i mean yeah you don't want that that's bad so definitely keep your plastic covers man you got to keep those and try to store it upright because if you laying it down you can take a good chance of it leaking and it'll this [ __ ] takes forever it's like molasses to go back in the upright um but let's let's plug it in and check it out not only that check out the quality this is the end cap that came off of the uh the new delta eight cartridge see it see how thick it is all right and then this is the end cap that comes now i ain't trying to knock the the fx vapes i'm just trying to justify the 30 something dollars more that they want for the vape you know [Music] all right and then here's theirs see what i'm saying see the difference look at the difference in the caps big difference this one's nice and meaty and this one's real thin and kind of cheesy looking but uh you know i guess that's part of the difference is that you get better coverage with it also when i bought these these just come in like kind of like this thing here uh but it doesn't have anything covering the mouthpiece the mouthpiece is wide open so but with these you get a mouthpiece covered which is nice because like i said i transport these in my pocket and stuff so yeah you know what that um this this right here it kind of it kind of sneaks up on you god damn oh my god i'm sweating look i'm sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high yeah one hit y'all one hit damn yeah see i can go in there right now smoke a few bowls that [ __ ] won't get me like how i am right now good god oh [ __ ] all right yes um forgot what i was saying yep don't remember now okay so back to what i don't remember i was talking about y'all need to get this i don't know what else to tell y'all three chive delta eight vapes leave me a comment subscribe to my channel check out my other videos i build computers and do all kinds of custom water cooling and technology stuff so you all need to come and check that out check out my channel i appreciate y'all for watching", "DrRSLuSShD4": "hey guys this is dab connection we're gonna be going over the difference between fake brass knuckles and real brass knuckles this one on my right is a fake this one on my left is the real one and the first indicator which you're gonna see some fakes with this anyway but first indicator look for is the sticker so this sticker is actually on the is on the front and the back I just put the the probably actually got ripped off with the back went on here for effect but it's a same stick you're gonna see the sticker around and there's gonna be you know that little left this little childproof thing there as well and it's gonna have a this tamper-resistant part so there's gonna be the childproof part the stamp resistant and this strain indicator no strain instantly a fake now here's the other part of the real versus fake that I thought I found was most telling so right there you can see this ring right here is metal so it's metal on metal down there now take a look at the fake the fake doesn't have that metal the hardware is different you can see that's almost like a plasticy rubbery piece there that's kind of covering over the metal over there you go yeah you see that in there that's kind of a clear plastic Ness and then right in there you can clearly see that's metal there so that's a big difference and of course this is the Napalm OG one so it does have the name a little bit different here you know other than that you're gonna see the text is gonna be fairly similar on the California ones on the real ones you'll probably see some type of California thing this also says for medical use and I'm not sure that that's always going to be that way it's probably on the newer ones it's might not say medical use anymore because it's not really just medical but really main things look for is that strain and that Hardware difference so the hardware difference is something I've really seen covered before and that's the main difference I think between fake and real if you're not sure you know submit your pictures to us you can go on our website to next calm on the about us page we'd like to take a look at them and we can try to help you tell if they're real or they're fake what we really hope happens is brass knuckles actually put a solid store locator on there and then it's not even an issue the other thing I should just say is brass knuckles is really heavily advertised and people seem to love it but I got to tell you there's a lot of better cartridges out there if you're in California check out arrow Pro arrow Pro is much better check out select oil select oil is much better if you're in Nevada you got select oil you got roots and arrow Pro those are all better and you know that's it I you know it brass knuckles it's okay I see why some people like it but the hardware is dated and that's part of the reason not gonna get a good hit the other thing I should just mention for people in Nevada you know their grams their cartridges are all one gram and there's a limit it's either 80 or 85 you 5% THC that the one gram cartridges can be so you're gonna see half gram cartridges like select in the 90s and select is in California everywhere it's all over the place those are just some brands I think that are better as well just throwing that in there anyway thanks for watching guys and have a great week", "4prSaPMylLQ": "high design is cannabis parade with more reviews for you today and today I would like to talk about some vape pen products woohoo hey pen I've got these great products right here 1:1 ratio THC CBD I've got Durbin poison no that's the gelato so there we go again I've got gelato and I've got Durbin poison Durbin poison is the sativa the gelato is the indica I have what do I have in here oh oh do I really oh okay well I guess I've got the gelato I've got the indica in here right now I'm surprised I thought I had the sativa see what happens and you don't pay attention anyway excuse me on piece canyon a month anyway so a little while ago I did a review on a vape n CBD cartridge and I was not happy with it at all and not only was I only happy that the CBD vape pen didn't work for me I really was hoping for that to not have the THC and to just use something that would help alleviate my pain but apparently I'm one of those people that I do need the THC in the vape pen along with the CBD which I've discovered from these I got these on 4/20 and this is what I purchased they had a buy one get one so I thought I might as well take advantage of it and it's this one to one ratio I was really hoping for because again I want I want that pain killing effects from the CBD so anyway again going back to what I was saying I'm so distracted there's people playing acai and I keep looking at them so I should probably stop doing that okay they all have no distraction um okay so I was really looking forward to doing another review of a product cuz they pen was kind enough to give me this battery when I saw them when they were doing some biomass their stuff they were there at the Phoenix dispensary and I mentioned I was looking for some CVD babes and they gave me the battery and so I came back gonna try that product and it was really kind of crappy that I didn't like it it was like oh thanks for the gift oh yes garbage I don't like it so I'm happy to review something of the vape pen for the vape pen battery that I actually do enjoy and both of these are great for different reasons of course I use the gelato in the evening time I'm pretty active person mentally very active and I have a hard time shutting down at night and sometimes again there's children in the home here and sometimes I don't want to go outside and smoke and when I'm really having a hard time sleeping if I'm not using and edible I definitely need to smoke it in to kind of go to bed so these are really convenient I really like using them before I go to the gym especially the sativa this Durban poison was great at the gym because I never felt that the yucky illness you know how you get a little heavy sometimes when you smoke this did not do that at all I was able to make it through my workouts even through yoga and then just some weight training and I had no problems at all so really convenient the smoke is nice I will say though the the gelato the indica is a lot smoother than the Durban poison the Durban there's a bag stuck to a tree and I thought it was a squirrel okay see how easily distracted I haven't hold on a minute I need to bring myself back to what I'm doing hold on get some of this indica gone okay the bag blew away that's good I love blowing smoke at you I just want to say no it would be cool if you sent me videos of you receiving this that would be great anyway okay so even though baby lungs do-do-do-do-do so even though excuse me while I wipe away my cry baby tears okay so even though gelato is smoother again it's a vape pen they do kind of cause me to cough it's a lot smoother than some that I've tried I have had some some big products but I've tried of other people's know something I'm gonna try that and see if I like it they made me cough a lot more so this is definitely smoother maybe it's the battery maybe it's the way it burns it I am looking to try some other one that you can set the temperature and because this one does get hot and I'm wondering if maybe one my oil my my cartridge will last longer if it doesn't burn so hot but also maybe I won't get that burning sensation that I get in the back of my throat mainly from the Durbin poison a little bit here umm so keep that in mind when you're getting them certain ones do burn a little hotter than others I'm noticing so some you might have a little more discomfort and I think it also depends on the way you hit it if you hit it really hard it's been gonna burn a little hotter maybe it's cuz I'm searching sit up straight sit up straight head up and beat into work I know I'm not even funny I'm just gonna smoke this okay see today's a day that I need the in the cup when that stuff to do that requires me sitting down which is pretty much what I've been doing the last few days and it helps curb the I need to get up and do something else thing so big help for those kinds of situations again these were I believe 300 milligrams I'll correct that on there if I'm wrong I don't believe I am though whereas a 500-mile against Amador I knew this before I started anyone it was $30 for one of these 0.5 grams anyway $38 I got a buy one get one free so you know what is that $19 I guess piece and in that sense from the Phoenix dispensary I'm just gonna end up cutting all this stuff out because I'm [ __ ] all right so so these cost me $20 so these cost 38 dollars each except there was a buy one get one so you know game II and the DL they lasted a while I mean you could see how much I have left and I've been smoking on this all week I've been trading off with the sativa but the Durban poison and that's how much of that I have left um so it's been again since since April 20th so since 4/20 I've been smoking on these and I have flowers so I've been smoking my flower to again I'm not real thrilled with how long these cartridges last for as expensive as they are but they are convenient and so I guess you are paying for convenience again if I found the battery that maybe control the temperature there by controlling how much of the oil I was using per puff maybe it would help better I don't know maybe you guys know again you know this is not one-sided I'd love to hear some info from you maybe you've had different experiences or you know certain tricks of using these things that I don't know because I really don't I'm really new to vaping if you have favourites let me know so also if you like my videos hit subscribe this is a rambling one I hope I'm able to edit this together to make it somewhat entertaining because I really like this so that's that's how I'm gonna summarize I really like this of a pen cartridge I really appreciate both of these for different reasons so gelato the turbine the gelato and the Durbin poison they both work different different times a day it's like oh this is the morning and this is the night time if you can do a buy one get one I definitely suggest it as the way to go for trying them out because you can try different products I can't wait to try other ones not just buy a pen but definitely I want to try the other ones like a pen yeah like my videos subscribe say hi talk to me every now and then I'm so long", "1G2w0mlorb4":

is it going like in a long flight but back to this no lab test is over 80 percent THC but I got the Big Chief saw set in the lotto you see right dirt cheap yeah right pretty this [ __ ] there at least 80% you see in this [ __ ] when it comes salty the bait sheet is really gonna be going on the terms and the effects the part itself is so nice anything that's a woodchip I really like alright okay it's on the thing middle so that's published three and a half volts or so it was intense oh that felt really good honestly hey my buddy I did pre feed him then rip it I made so I'm not sure if I maybe burnt the card a little bit really new to these parts but I lower the terms to see if I can get more of a distinct taste the mild sweet earthy tone pretty that's really good the effects are there the

just wanted to say real quick that that's because I've had a lot of stuff going on at school some really important tests and stuff I usually have really important tests all throughout the year but this this specific course in my school kicking my ass it's really difficult but we're good through it we just finished today so I'm treating myself I'm treating you guys we got a new video it's about to be smack right before we jump into this video let's go ahead and throw it out there this channel is a adult smoking cannabis channel only it's for 18 to 21 and up depending on your state and how legal medical or recreational marijuana is I'm here in Arizona I have my own medical card everything I do on this channel is legal yeah so now that that's out of the way I guess we can get right into this so I'm completely sober right now I smoked a little bit this morning awesome an old cart that I had actually was a venom acts I was supposed to do a video for that but I just like I said school was just training me I was stressed I just couldn't do it but I the two cars that I showed in the last the strange Saturday which we're still debating if we want to do Sunday or not but the let's train Saturday I said I had two carts those were venom X's I think they were tangi I don't remember pineapple tangi or something like that I got i don't remember the strain but i threw out the boxes but they were supposed to be two different ones now it's going to review them and have two two videos two completely separate videos but since they were the same it would have been useless and only one video and like I said I just was stressed as [ __ ] so I just skipped out of it and didn't do a video but we are we're here with another video and I got to cut two videos coming up here so this one and then another one the cards were reviewing on these two videos are gonna be pure earth no I don't remember exactly I could be wrong but the first pure earth cart I did actually was one of them I beated viewed videos I think in their first or second which is actually insane so if this video can be even like 1/4 or 1/2 of that that would be dopes mad appreciation so the cart we're gonna review today though is the pure earth DJ short right there I don't know if you can see that there you go um uncut VAP cartridge is a half gram I won't lie to you guys these are probably my favorite boxes I've seen out of any descent cart they're just so [ __ ] elegant I don't know it's just it's super dope um I don't know if y'all are into video games or anything like that but there's this game called destiny - there's this raid at the boss by Calvin our model remember that narrates called but this [ __ ] color scheme anyway flashbacks if you play that game but yeah this box is clean and and just like the other one they're the same box got a little pull tab there I'm pure earth it you know somehow some rep saying this or whatever [ __ ] yeah you guys killed this box gorgeous box so on the back here says in infused with authentic cannabis terpenes no PG propylene glycol propylene glycol PG I don't know what that is or MCT I don't know what that is a proprietary pure atropine and cannabinoid profiles so that's what that says right there on the back right there then there's their website and then all their other information blah blah says requires pure earth battery for use this product has been tested for potency wow that's cool so that says that on the back right there and then read above that it says right here this little like black dark black line so the extremely potent cartridge use small draws until comfortable with the effects so that's super dope I'm excited this isn't my first pure earth like I said I do not remember at all what that one was what the strain was how it hit anything like that so if you guys want to know before you see this video go ahead and check it out you know check out my channel you know life subscribe do all that [ __ ] if you haven't of course but well let's go ahead and open this [ __ ] up I think you just pull okay there's a sticker right here the best thing to use lightning cables for if you have an iPhone is for cutting a little like [ __ ] piece of corners like that [ __ ] yeah cool boom and then not a tape no that's done boom she just slides on out there and it oh no I thought it locked um so it didn't fall out but it doesn't uh box [ __ ] hollow box it's a very sturdy box so that she you know you could take this [ __ ] and eat it and not really have to worry too much about breaking the cart which is which is really nice that's uh that's a good feature to have on carts let's do a little hydration break here guys drinking another pees tea Georgia Peach you already know yall already know so here's the Box simple box right there on the front it even says it says the this is an indica dominant so I didn't even say that this isn't in a kendama net strain it's like 8020 ad indica xx sativa but you know basically indica just oh that's nice so this is a little really soft foam packaging so it's gonna be even harder to break your carts in here if you drop or throw them in your backpack or whatever you got to do that was loud I apologize for that um yeah so here's the cart so this is pure earth there on the front super dope and then here on the back yeah well cuz I'm a terrible youtuber and everything like that it says the strain which is oh I drew that [ __ ] it says the strain which is DG a short and then it says that it is an eighty indica 20 sativa so it shows you like the breakdown which is super cool it's going to pop this cap off alright there we go there's the bottom authentic see so [ __ ] you know you already know here we got the dr. zodiacs Moonrock battery here I really want to get another one of those cards just to have the battery to be honest but those cards did smack as well we just charged this one up you already know how I am when it comes to hits on the cards I think a fully charged battery is always gonna hit hella harder that just makes a [ __ ] ton of sense to if you'll think about it I mean you know but if you guys like to you know use your batteries all day that's fine I do - I did - I burned through them then I charged them for the [ __ ] video so cuz I want to show you guys the potency I had its finest so let's do one more quick hydration break here without out of what what did I just say and with that out of the way let's go ahead and take our first draw up this DJ short nice it was cheesy shortcake doesn't say it's on the bus it says DJ

this is your cart um I don't think I've ever really had any any cart or anything like that hmm that was like cherry pie or no like cherry cream or whatever they short um but for the first one that I've ever had like that pardon me it's hurting me deep but for the first one I've ever had nobilis I should like a shortcake or strawberry anything definitely definitely solid it's highly recommend to

with that all said like I said I appreciate you guys all the support and love I'll see you guys in the next one deuces", "WHW25c58sh8": "[Music] alright guys so I haven't made a video in the minute um that runs video was pretty filmed I'm like a month ago this is like November so that was just something I had that I was able to upload you know does it mean time but I'd be kind of slowing down my videos lately cuz uh not just some [ __ ] has been going on but today I got the [ __ ] kingpin review what did you pack it so let's get into this [ __ ] guys alright so to start off this is a picture of the old packaging and this is how the new packaging is going to look like so doesn't it come in the a tin box like this right you're gonna have this in the front and say kingpin the strain named hybrid in the cursor to go and on the back is where you're gonna have all your information so they put it all in the back instead of like on the sides and stuff the sides are all planned and here actually you're gonna have right when you first open you're gonna have an office authentication sticker there's gonna be like some green sticker with like a key around it type thing and it's gonna have a serial number and I need to look it up or something and I'm pretty sure you can find the authenticity like I'll keep this page or something I don't know but to open it you just simply take that sticker off and lift up and this we can be presented with you're gonna be presented with a black kingpin type of thing a to you just moved from there and this is like plastic to just all tuned and you just pop it open like a Pierrot boom comes out and these are gonna be kingpins new cartridges they're gonna be the regular Cecil cartridges they're not using the metal cards anymore and that kingpin a branding earth there's of stickers not even though printed on the undercard anything it just goes along with the California sticker and this is what the new car is in the B because of the black tube the distillate on this cart is does not taste like gum the disability from when they had the metal cartridges like those I don't know there's something different about it and it looks way different now I've never got to meet him I never got to make a video on keeping but they used to be like pretty clear you know what used to be like this has it it's clear you know it's [ __ ] clear but no how it has like a really gold tint to it it was like clear that before I had like a clear tint to it hello and it tastes I mean it tastes cool now this is my first time getting gelato and this flavor is really strong idyllic flavor got stronger you know there's a lot not in a bad way but you know if the flavor got stronger you could taste the flavor a lot more that's a good taste but it just doesn't hug it doesn't hit as hard I don't know and I feel like with these cartridges the last ones by way quicker just because you have like what four different openings for the wax to go to the clothes so just goes about way quicker I mean you might get a bigger hit but it just makes it go by way quicker and I rather I just have the old school Kaitlyn styled Christchurch my gosh it was perfect to be honest like it was it was you know one of a kind like you know if you seen that car those could be detecting you know because nobody had a long type of car like Dan tips for like a flat and short whoo I like those cars on you [ __ ] with these did everybody else is this like this is like this coming for the review you guys haven't seen it go check it out book I would almost compare this to a skunk for the now like before kingpin was honestly like number one like I always say regarding there's number one our city is like number two or three like right next to LA cuz you know so this kind of sucks that they had to change to this cartridge in I mean from what I could tell it just it was different tastes different looks different but other than that just kidding take some history mister you see the clouds it still throws amazing clouds taste is on point I mean there is nothing wrong I've said it in videos before and that reviewed cartridges I said this was like a 10 out of 10 so this thing was perfect got you high every single hit but now I feel like I need like two hits just to get it like a cool buzz no but we're gonna screw it onto the battery right here that the began battery the smoke shop honeydew but uh take a little blink no I won't say I was about to take a big see from that swallow to hit a cool colleague No - days in Chicago first time getting to shake the cards auto stasis in from the cartridge y'all [ __ ] tasty same for some reason yeah guys this is a new packaging for keeping like a little thumbnail weather yeah handy packaging man not much to it cool packaging is the point takes away your point is a [ __ ] new style of a cart so kind of just even in our heart just stick to the cartridge and buried this to it then to get a [ __ ] a better packaging they probably did this just because um just to catch people's eye you know get some new customers or something but man you didn't have to [ __ ] change [ __ ] car I wasn't expecting for the card to be Delta like cars gonna be the same I told him just the package man change I was surprised but as I'm here for the video guys who VI spied you guys to go baby here around two and nine make sure good I mean yeah you know what I'm a [ __ ] stick to my my roots PCF and phenols man and flavors even though I haven't been the flavors go to those man never had a bad experience one time bro I have [ __ ] bought a $25 grandma sauce and I got home and I realized that lady charged me fifty five dollars for the [ __ ] grandma sauce I like what the foot and because I bought other stuff we're doing you know siding notice they came up like 150 okay then guesses make sense and I get home check the receipt on my wall with the foot saw a column I'm like bread I'm not from Modesto I'm a little bit a little bit of ways you know I was like I could take it back but I was like back you know and don't worry they're like you come in time we've assigned credits to your account blah blah my damn bow they did this Auto phone you know like ultra phone we call them daily or have any waiting like keep me waiting they called me back you know like they're like we'll call you back we're gonna fix anything for you bro I spent at least an hour and a half least the least an hour at the [ __ ] the spiritually trying to I bought accidental God extra cart I miss you by three cards I'm Adam it's like to bloom cards and a kingpin and I got three boon cards in one keeping and I went back to try to return it and they're like oh we lost have returns and I'm right back then okay I don't know they're awful it's just made of the policy of [ __ ] returning cartridges so [ __ ] stupid bro like you're not losing money the [ __ ] company keeping itself is losing money you're not the one that you get a replacement for free at least have seen those kids they said like oh that's cool because I literally take our shoes half ways fools like when because I like stop working like that [ __ ] rod or anyone that's halfway through not hitting [ __ ] this I have to go return this year like halfway school maybe a court before and they took it man that's proper all that that's what keeps customers that's why when you walk in there usually for most of the time you mean ones fool goes by like that bunch of quick so shouts out a pcfg mister flavors and blue fire that's a new location out there and we're safe so

videos are made for an educational purpose we do not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel as well welcome back everybody to a brand new video today we got another educational review yet again everybody we do not condone these products this is an 18 and of Education review from the cannabis patients out there but today everybody we got another King pen I decided to pick two up just because I know I noticed that I've reviewed King pen before this is a King Louie og by the way some indica I've noticed that I've I've only copper King pen like once now I just had to review a second one and now this is my third one that I'm reviewing on this channel I think this is the third one that I'm gonna be on the channel but this is some King Louie we got it right here shout out Disney's for sponsoring this video this is actually a glow-in-the-dark shirt but it fits perfect for the King Lily so shares everybody oh wow this one makes a lot more fatter clouds in the cartridge video I did before so you guys have watched the Kali the Kali oh oh I wasn't actually make able to make big clouds and I'm like okay maybe it's just the airflow of the cartridge but this one is the exact same size and last time I actually didn't have it on the lowest temp so let's go back to the lowest ten I like taking them low temps just so for the flavor the last one we did was Callie oh and again let me let me take another hit Lucy oh yeah something's wrong with the other cartridge that I did haven't talked about at all like damn is this what happened that color went out of the airflow this one I'm already late with this one with the King Louie just literally like to dress oh that flavors nice mmm has like a cereal taste to it like if you guys ever tried um what is it rice krispies or crispy rice crisps you know there's Cocoa Krispies and the other rice krispies the colorful ones pebble pebbles I think pebble crisp dude I honestly don't even know like a fruity yes I got like a sweet fruit type of type of flavor which is pretty nice and I'm not gonna lie damn King Penn what's up with that man I mean we got the callee oh that [ __ ] did not hit well you know what's funny to some of them actually don't hit well like I've noticed that this that wasn't the first time so if you guys watched my previous video on the kingpin Caleo review um I wasn't able to take like big ribs like this one like I wasn't able to make some time like you know nice clouds oh this one you can make some nice clouds and it tastes nice just the one thing is indica so this just about having me slept but damn that's funny cuz I remember I had a I had a friend that actually bought a half game card to we're hearing it and we're both like what the hell it doesn't really have like good like it has air flow but you can't really make clouds and you don't feel like you take a nice hit out of it so I'm just like maybe just something with the cartridges that maybe they're just a little they're just a little delicate you know kind of made this flavor does taste really good though the King Louie I had this before the King Louie og hell yeah [ __ ] like it kind of has like an OG taste to it I mean its own g-get also supposed to taste I go dude but you can kind of you could taste say you know like I said before I've talked about this before King Penn was one of those brands and I first started when I started buying cartridges and [ __ ] days ago so it's always nice to go back to the roots you know and that's what I was talking about in the last year too like I was just saying that come pretty much like it's always nice going back to the roots you know I wanted I actually the review of brass knuckle cartridge just because brass knuckles was one of the first cartridges that I've ever you know smoked before so that's for sure has to be here on the channel but I don't see those allow anymore like right now it's all it's literally select and raw garden selecting wrong our name but rock garden is my all-time favorite everybody and the select is pretty nice too that she gets me baked um but check this out you guys so it's kingpin it's the world's most awarded cannabis vape is this still up to date is this still the most important in 2019 let me know in the comments down below the alien labs is also my favorite when it comes to like some sauce diamonds ooh ooh shout-out look the lights are matching the shirts kind of matching huh let me know in the comments down below if you guys have ever tried kingpin and if you guys have any issues with kingpin cuz I've had one one issue with kingpin before don't get me wrong the taste is great you know the flavors are great to have a bunch of flavors you know I got I mean every time I hit this [ __ ] I get pretty late you guys said clearly see you have to like my second or third drag I got [ __ ] lit but again last time my previous purchase was a Cali oh and that one had too much air flow like it had good airflow but it wasn't really burning like this one is burning you know so I didn't get me like it got me lit but it gave me super lit you know it tasted it did taste good though but we're gonna find out I'm gonna have to remake another video and um see exactly if it doesn't because if you guys can see it right here look let's see right here I didn't show you guys a cartridge yeah there you got the cartridge this one for some reason this one doesn't focus that much like either tell it clear or who knows but you guys see towards the bottom of it it's like okay towards the top it's a little bit more yellow than the bottom because in the bottom it's like really tight down there you know so not a lot of like I'm not a lot of the liquid is going down there so you guys he usually right here in these areas right here it gets stuck I feel like some of the liquid gets stuck so when you finish the cartridge it's like literally like you feel like there's like a layer that just won't be smoked no matter how many times you hit it it just won't burn because last time when I got one of these this was a while ago this is maybe like a year ago when I got it I got myself a king actually no it was the first king no that was probably maybe like maybe like three months ago three four months ago we had a king pen cartridges are the same half gram in it we got it all the way to the bottom right and they were just like a thick nice little layer and I'm like okay cool it still has a lot started hitting it and I was like dude it takes burnt and I looked at it and I was like dude that layer is just stuck right there it's not going in and it's not going in the coils you know so I was like what the hell I was like I hope it's just maybe like a the thinnest little leftover layer like [ __ ] I don't mind but it looked pretty big it looked like almost like 1/3 so I'm like dude in any other cartridge that's gonna fall all the way to the bottom and it's gonna get soaked up into the coils and it's gonna give you a hit you know is that I know a lot of people you guys I'm pretty sure you guys know how this works right there's like little coils that heat up inside this so this kind of every time you take a hit it burns the it burns the liquid that's in there already and then it leave it kind of you can see like it dries off the cotton or dries off the coil and then this liquid goes in there it gets soaked up and it's like you know it's the circle of life until it's gone but if you guys hello if you guys are enjoying these cartridge videos make sure you guys go down in description go follow all my social media you guys are enjoying these videos drop a like comment down below I'll let you guys know what and then subscribe you guys right now click that bell so you guys get notified every time I upload but leave a comment down below let me know what is you guys's favorite all-time cartridge because I've got a lot of people asking me the comments that there is just so many like you guys drop comments right and you guys let me know the stuff that you guys are smoking in your area and I'm just like okay you know I gotta keep there's people dropping comments you know from the east coast from Europe and I'm just like brah what the [ __ ] I got I had a couple people from like Philly Canada oh I'm just naming all types of [ __ ] places but this is like connecting it's like a video to the world so that's stuff that's [ __ ] sick bro I didn't know it like our first one I started their selves like okay maybe I'm gonna get people from Cali watching my stuff then people started dropping from other places like what damn and again everybody these are just podcasts they're literally just like a podcast or just kind of the spheres in shape because we're kicking back you know we're keeping this pretty much raw you know you know what's funny I'm hella way I'm just looking here this is YouTube recommend you guys like the weirdest videos cuz lately I've been watching a bunch of fire ants versus bird-eating tarantula and I'm like what the [ __ ] like I've seen I follow this channel called ants Canada or something like that he shows like his ant colonies and I'm like oh [ __ ] that I guess how the hell did I get like how am i watching is and then a while back I was watching videos about like spiders and tarantulas and all that stuff and I'm like dude what the hell YouTube recommends me the most weirdest [ __ ] ever yeah what to get it is it flashes on fire every cartridge that I get I gotta I always make sure that it's like someone good cuz I know you guys seen a couple cartridges on these channels like for example old pals or the which one of the Humboldt forms I think yeah that was like the strawberry straw man has something like that um I looked at like more of like the the details of the cartridge you know the information the stuff that's in the cartridge you know I try to do my research on that but I looked at the details and you know unlike the stuff that's in there and I'm just like okay this is kind of clean this is pretty uh this is pretty safe to smoke and it's fire you know it's probably a good review you know is that's why you know this is like more like this is like an educational Channel so I gotta I want to make sure that I even I review even like the low key brands you know the brands that people don't really like I feel like eases like right here I don't know do you guys what kind of delivery services do you guys have so the final verdict I like the flavor and the design of it's pretty cool it got me pretty loaded and taste it tasted good but those I was pretty cool it's just that one thing the airflow this one had great this one had great airflow like I could make clouds the other one the callee oh that [ __ ] did not have good like it had good airflow and it felt the same but it just was not making clouds so I don't know what's wrong with that I was gonna get a full gram but they didn't have full grams so I was just like [ __ ] I'm gonna just get two so hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure hands up like a comment subscribe click that Bell you guys gonna find it so you guys can notified every time I upload and [Music]", "MRr-LCOTEc0": "welcome to the shed this is iced out images coming at you with another platinum vape product review um i've been smoking on this one for a little bit so i know it's pretty good um and based on what leafly saying and what the box says uh slightly different but so we have an indica it would usually be in the box but i already have it here because as i said it was already loaded into my uh my vape pen so we have ice cream cake ice cream cake is 83 83.78 with 0.6 cbd i'm sorry i just woke up a little bit so my mind's a little uh i did the video i posted earlier is the dab i did like right before bed so i kind of woke up my head's a little groggy um everybody else is sleeping other than my my my youngest well i can't say everyone's sleeping mom's on the couch watching netflix pretty much just yeah so he's gaming playing around doing whatever so i figured i'd come out do this real quick and then go back inside and probably feeding some breakfast so as i said 84.38 is the total cannabinoids with the cbd and the thc the effects are positive uplifted relaxed so it seems like it has a little bit of the sativa type effects flavors are vanilla pine sweet psi labs tested on 6 15 20 20 production dates 6 10 20 20 and expiration date 6 10 20 21 um as i always say they're out in ann arbor off of varsity drive okay so that's everything on the box and you can go visit www.houseofplatinum.com they have facebook twitter and instagram if you want to go check them out so leafly says indica so that's an agreement but this one said vanilla pine sweet on leafly it says citrus peppery floral bread by seed junkie genetics wedding cake plus gelato number 33 are the two parent plants and then it says when you're hitting it it has like a sorry people a sweet vanilla ah what was the other word that it said like just a sweet vanilla taste so i'm getting like a citrusy i'm just getting like a citrusy flavor on the dry hit so same thing you can unipro boom rocking under the 3.2 volt still which is 1.43 ohms here we go and um as i said it tastes really good i've been smoking on this for a minute um it does still have a tiny little bit of bite in the back um almost as much if not more so than the the last 510 thread one that i did drawn a blank on the name it's in my uh so my top drawer in my bedroom see now that's where just settled in that's how long it took to settle that feeling right back in here um but as i said in one of my last videos a guy mentioned that part of a reviewer is to let people know what the prices are i'm paying 40 dollars each for these um if i go to a dyspo and i pick up my friend who's got his med card i can get these three for a hundred four for a hundred depends on what deals the dispos are running the same thing with mkx fuegos and a couple of the others you can typically get three or three for ninety four four hundred things like that um from your local disco so if you got your med card you can get in on those deals me i don't have my med card so i'm just paying what i pay so i'm not getting a ton of vanilla on the hit i'm getting more of like an earthy floral citrus so if i said that there was a pool of descriptive words and it was all six of these i would say the sweet is a mixture of the citrus sweet which isn't very sweet let me tell you and uh you definitely feel it down here not so much in the temples uh dry eyes a little bit of dry mouth and then as i said you just get a little bit of that bite from the i guess the floral citrus pine uh descriptive tasting words i guess um i'm gonna say it's not my favorite by far not the worst card i've ever had in my life that's for sure it's a pretty strong indica so if you're looking for a good indica for your nighttime strain i'm going to say that this is a pretty good one should have brought something to drink out coffee something um as i said i've been smoking on this for a while it's not bad i will continue to smoke on this one i don't hate it it's not my favorite but i don't hate it i know i say that on a lot of them but if you want to know when i hate something go watch my mint extract cards you will hear exactly how i feel about something when i dislike it a lot like i hate it these even if i don't enjoy the flavor the high's still there um the flavor profiles are pretty much on point you know give or take a little bit um unlike mint and extracts cards that i tried the four that i tried i'm gonna go and say the four that i tried because these four suck the ass and this was before the vitamin e acetate [ __ ] i may try them again and these four may be good i don't know i'm skeptical on trying them again because i had such a bad experience on the first time um but maybe their products have gotten better so maybe i'll give them a try but everything i've gotten from platinum vapes has been good it's been good i can't say i [ __ ] hate them i can't like oh my god i hate them it's just hey docido isn't quite up my alley i don't think i'd buy that one again if i had a choice if it was the only one there i'll pick it up and i'll smoke it you know i'm not gonna be like ah [ __ ] that i don't want that it's not that it's just hey if you have these i'm gonna take these over these after i've already done a review on these because if it's something i haven't done a review on i'm gonna get it even if it says earthy piney woody on the back you know it says hey this was wiped its ass with everything woodsy outside tastes like straight wood you know i i'm still going to try it i'm still going to hit it what you consider a connoisseur i i want to smoke as much [ __ ] as possible i want to try as many different strains as possible i wish when i first started doing this not the videos but before when i would constantly hey give me this flavor and this flavor um that i had a book and i wrote them all in there i should probably just start doing that now and then i'll have a total on like how many different strains of weed i've tried in my lifetime um so if you're somebody that's like me that's doing that and you're not like super super deep into it start writing them down and eventually someone's gonna be like hey you know i've smoked 50 different strains i'll out smoke you and you're like well i've smoked i got a book i've smoked a [ __ ] ton like i mean ridiculous amounts so for me in one year i've smoked on all this all the different bags i've got bags in the house i gotta bring out to here all the different pods vape pods things vape cards everything from different brands to normal brands from the moment i started smoking weed just tons and as i said this is just most of this is just from one year of smoking so and i've been smoking since i was 17 years old and i'm 14 uh 40 now i went to say 14. yeah i wish i'm just kidding i don't want to be 14 again i don't want to be 17 again if i could go back a little bit hey that's kosher but i am who i am i'm my age 40 years old and uh i love smoking weed so platinum vapes doing a big um digging your pods right now as i said the only negative with that is i wish they were full one gram pods but ice cream cake get your hands on it love it enjoy it you got your mad card go get the deals otherwise yeah otherwise you're paying 40 dollars like me still got one of these to try i've just been putting it off just because i've had so much plant and vape stuff to do and everyone seems to like the platinum vape vids um and then to the guy that asked about the mkx i will definitely try to get my hands on those asap even if i have to take the trip down to detroit and hit up my boy and uh go purchase some of those myself um because the guy out here is not picking them up at the moment um yeah that's pretty much all i have to say so indica little bite not a horrible taste yeah that's all i got i don't know what else to say it's too early in the morning well not too early just my mind's all blue at the moment so like sub comment hit that bell and i'll catch you guys in the next video which will most likely be a another platinum vape and or zuzu farms so because i don't know if i posted the dutch treat video yet so i'll get on that if i haven't i'll double check whatever so i love you guys thank you for watching catch you guys in the next video i'm gonna go play some disc golf today peace", "dOr-KK3IAJk": "yo guys what is going on ethan here today i'm going to be reviewing this shrieker cart from rise over in florida i don't know what other states i have it in but this is where i'm at and this is where i got it from so this is what the cartridge looks like um let me try to have it focus a little bit better but the oil does look good and i have tasted already and it is a pretty good car as you can see it may be a little bit high already but this cartridge does i can't even talk right now that's how good this cartridge is so it does smack let me hit it again i said let me hit it again and this was my first hit on the video so this already tells you cheese but i do want to thank you guys for all the support you guys have been giving me i know i haven't uploaded in a while it's been like two weeks i've just been really busy i've been trying to use my other social medias more so i haven't been uploading on youtube as much so that's my fault i've just been trying to grow my other ones so i could bring more of a following to my youtube if that makes any more sense so i'm gonna have my other social medias on the screen so you guys can check that out but yeah i want to thank you guys for all the support recently this cartridge is amazing so yeah it's a good car um thank you rise for giving me this cartridge to review and i'm not being like biased because they gave me the cartridge if it was ass i would say it's ass so this this is a good card [Music] this is the battery that comes with it so i don't know what voltage it's at but i'm just using the one that came with it because i didn't want to [ __ ] around the batteries and get one that was too hot for this and mess up the cartridge but yeah this is a really good battery and a nice cartridge as well i like how on this battery you don't need to hit anything so you just charge it and then whenever you want to use it put the cartridge on and you just inhale and it turns on by itself so so i want to let you guys know like i've been seeing a lot of people saying like oh i don't have the right equipment to start the youtube channel i don't have this i don't have that i want to show you guys that i'm recording this one like this video on my phone instead of my other camera just to show you that you guys don't need every little thing to start a channel like i started using my phone and i'm using it again on this video just to show you guys that you guys don't need all the equipment just start a channel so yeah it's it's kind of cool and i like seeing the channel grows and i get to meet more people so i really like engaging with my i guess the people that subscribe to me and that follow me so i want to thank you guys a lot this video wasn't going to be long it was just a little review on the cartridge and like i said already it is a nice cartridge this is just a half gram they do make full grams but obviously it do cost more but i think it's like like 50 bucks around that price i'm not exactly sure but i'm gonna have the information down below in the comments because i think if i put in the description they're gonna remove it but i'll i'll see if i can put it in the description i'm not gonna be 100 sure and i'll try to pop it up on the screen that's going to be it for the video this card is good like i just said a couple times but subscribe comment leave a like and thank you guys for watching and this is ethan signing out peace [Music]", "NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "0CIgYyCFgco": "hey what's good everybody jpeg here checking in respectmyregion.com here today with a quick taste test review featuring jazzasaurus butt tender from mother nature's remedy in woodland hills and the buddies brand cannabis distillate with cannabis derived terpenes vape cartridge so we'll be doing a review on this vape on the buddy's brand seesaw so today's strain is the three bears og this is an indica it's one that i personally am a fan i'm a fan of i've tried it in the live resin form i've tried it in the dab form but i have not tried it in the dissonance so i haven't tried this either um 91.98 total chem cannabinoids eighty-eight point fifty percent thc zero cbd and it has beta-mercing beta-carothylene [Music] we'll see okay i like these chirps i think i'm gonna like this one should be good three bears og pop it on open let's see what it's like buddy's distillate features the cso vape battery the seesaw hardware on the cartridge single source distillate and they do use cannabis derived terpenes which means that the terpenes comes from cannabis not some kind of all-natural or fruit or veggies or something like that three four second hit what are you tasting it was something sweet and earthy i don't know i really like it oh it does have that good like earthy og it's earthy sweet terps it's slightly sweet and it's smooth oh are you gonna get a turf sneeze no sneeze it's always good when the turkeys happen that's pretty cool that's a good idea potent flavor-wise you get a little bit of citrus on the end or kind of in the middle of hitting it on the inhale on the exhale you do get this sweet earthy oh genius i like it yeah i really enjoy this one 90 91.98 total cannabinoids this is considered hypodecy uh what are you thinking for a score out of 10 and why um 9.2 9.2 um i don't know i don't really get like a body height from this it's just i think it's a head high i think it's gonna become a creeper because og kush is always creepable creep on you a little bit if they don't hit you right away they're still going to get you higher still on their jeep um but i feel you it's really it's really earthy for me but i think someone who enjoys earthy will love this yeah there wasn't a lot of pine on it but there was definitely not like piney and sweets it's mercy so it's going to be more that sweet sour the caryophylline is going to be that slight earthy spiciness and then the osu moon is going to be again a little bit of citrus so i'm getting at least all those flavors which is nice manufactured on october 28th so it's still relatively fresh distillate the color is pretty beautiful i mean my score doesn't necessarily matter because i work with buddies but 9.2 from you 9.2 i feel is pretty solid i get it i'd give it somewhere around the same um this is the best strain i've ever had no but i feel like a lot of strains that taste the way that they're supposed to taste and they give you the high that people have said that they usually give you yeah whoever likes these turks is going to love this if you like oh geez this is going to be really solid for you it's probably going to be closer to a 10. i for one though marathon reviews my that's my favorite so i like the dream so i'm pretty basic i feel that i feel like well appreciate you guys for the love thank you jazzy for your review jpeg here coming at you guys live respect my region taste test review a whole new series dedicated to identifying whether or not this is worth trying doesn't taste good and giving you guys a score to kind of stay consistent with so appreciate you guys for the love we'll see you all in the next review love y'all peace", "BM9ZiyoWM0s": "[Music] I'll start the [ __ ] bag alright guys so I'm not actually gonna make the video right now because I have some [ __ ] to do but I just wanted to cut it open for you guys you guys cuz you like the unsealing part of it since I haven't done that in a minute I've been opening up all packages before I get to film and I got some uh I'm gonna show you guys everything you just have to wait but I got some uh some wax and I already ripped it up in this video you know so like this quick bubble test for you guys alright so that's basically it I want to cut that [ __ ] over figure Hydra quit I'm not going to go into detail but anything you want to cut that open real quick and next to either this will be the first clip I'll put this in between but either way back to the original video and just the case I lose it or see you later how are you have it right here with me right now so I might as well film this real quick the a leakage cartridge actually ended up coming out to 34 dollars not 37 and that wax how\u00eds is $55 the accident accidentally charged me 55 instead of 24 I don't know how I'll probably cuz the name mixed up but yeah so I show you guys that all right man today we're going to continue the LA cush cartridge review video unboxing thoughts with stone know there's literally couple hits list this is a Tuesday now what is Bradley Tuesday it's like poker him right now that video that he has just saw right now when I was shouldn't you guys cut open the baggage ship that was [ __ ] Friday so three days later in this it's almost gone and this honestly is not even like that it goes by quick it's just Friday I was kicking at my homies she got out of hand got a little faded and I just kept passing the pattern man kept passing the pan like a god they're good but uh I didn't get to chose like the video you know just to show you guys a little cut all I don't get me smoking in and getting the full experience all I did was help the video so you know don't matter so this is how all your boxes are going to be looking like the only thing hasn't come different in every box is gonna be this sticker or just gonna be according to strain this one's called jackpot so as you know so it has the slot machine on there and all the information in terms of THC percentage CBD manufactured date and all that Cindy found right here on the side this one's containing I think this one of the hardest fitting sativas it's containing 79 percent THC and 7.2 million Oh Lee Shin Semin point 2 milligrams of CBD that's a lot for a [ __ ] card to be honest you the side view and then on top she said I like Kurdish from the bottom 1000 milligram for the 1 gram cart and then the back has all the [ __ ] all the regular has all the regular warnings issue like that and to actually open the package its employee just open it at the top and you're gonna have your little Lakers bag right here and they're all gonna come sealed me on the top so you gotta cut it with scissors I think that's like the old grade now I even think it like rip it open with your hands hard so make sure that when you go to cop this cart and you want to smoke it you get need to have a pair of scissors on you and in terms of taste I've only had two la Cruz cartridges this won the jackpot which is Deva and the black gelato which I think was the indica or hybrid indica and in terms of taste this should taste way better but in terms of how high gets you or like the way he hits I would definitely definitely go to black Salado I mean yeah she was like a woman hit your query right this one you know I could take my complete not even to be here it's actually kind of hard to see but the agree with this elderly curse would definitely go on my top 5 cartridges although I wouldn't put this man I would put this above select for sure because I feel like that I'm like I really really really really extreme potent wax taste will select and that's one thing I don't like the bottom with these it's like a nice even Terpening flavor and wax you know and honestly like I said to this I got this what is today eight I think today is the 28th 12 I'm on my back today's a 27th August 27th 12 a.m. and I had about this August 23rd at 1:09 p.m. so that night I had to split it with like 4 different heads you know so we're taking this [ __ ] to the dome in the last two equipment and we're some heavy started you know but you know there's gonna last you a minute there's relax me this because know and interpret looks from all the cars ever used so far my top three would have to be Corolla LE push and vitamin I thought what I really like about this one is that it's white so it looks very like high and you know it looks more like clean like you could tell once when you see a white tip in terms of the jackpot strain itself your sativa liver I would definitely go with this strain because just two three hits of this will really get you up there man but if you take a hit round when you get up from bed bro you're gonna be up high that black the lot on I didn't get treating you that was before I was actually even making videos but man I should have nice long that she was in the good this has really high THC content so sativa gives you like anxiety I ought to be really careful with the dosage that you take from this because what's the team goes to like straight heart sativa sometimes I find to give me like a heartbeat or like going anxious but with this you know I take rips not to rip and oh cool but if you go just a little bit so you get really anxious off the teeth like to be very careful with this I just take people know they're hybrids just to be safe you know so now the only thing really left to do is hit the pen give you got some clouds give you guys some ghosts and give you guys some more review of the flavor itself also another thing to know guys that and notice with this cartridge and the other cartridge that I got a couple months ago is that when you leave them sitting down I'm not sure if it's because I leave it like sitting like this but I find when you you know set them down for a bit and you go back to hit it clogs up a lot and I hate that round this leg does that to men and you know how it has appeared tip after and I finally done is just a whole bunch of whacks at the tip I just gone to waste so I hate one cartridge claw girl that's something that Lucas really needs to fix because isn't just happening with the first one it also happened with this one so I know that [Music] [Music] eyes are Agrabah [Music] you gotta see just after those hits oh my god yeah my digital bling crop this year huh I'm gonna do it for you guys but I'm live pretty [ __ ] high just a little she hits does like what for his so yeah man shit's intensity he has loves TV I'm [ __ ] recommend [ __ ] but if what I said scare you guys like if you think you can handle just try it you know it's not that bad and it's a cartridge you know you can control gates I have not to get blink on this party but I'm gonna take his big brother listening I gave you got his that blinker on reg ascending on the rock garden you guys saw how that went so here we go guys [ __ ] that

condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel as well hello everybody welcome to a brand new podcast today again we got another cartridge of you but today we're gonna be doing something a little bit more different I've only tried this brand at least like once and it is the king pan brand honestly the reason why I really I wanted to make this I had to make this video like I have to make this video I have to show you guys exactly what I really think about these and the only issue that I have with these but other than that I think King pen is hella fire it's I guess it's one of the world's most awarded cannabis fate I mean I guess I could believe that because this [ __ ] is it's pretty far is it better than raw garden heavy hitters you know what it's on its own it's on its own level so today I got some Cali oh it's eighty-three percent THC checked it out and I got a Minuteman I mean the design of this is pretty sick you know I think it's pretty dope it's powered by loud pack if you got you guys to see that right there and it says right here a 1 3 second draw as I see while serving so like always everybody you know a 3 second drag that's gonna be equivalent to one hit and let's seize cartridges king pan cartridges are available in indica sativa and hybrid proud to be the most avoided cannabis bait in the world okay in the world but hey man you guys better be cool watch out cuz you know seven 10 laughs who knows how their cartridges are gonna be raw garden to a man everybody's trying to come on big fan of raw garden because everybody that I know that smokes cartridges and I'm talking about like you've wired from like different cities and stuff they're all going for those rock garden songs oh man you better watch out cuz you might not be the most awarded soon so bono so I've actually tried a couple of these before I do have another flavor King Louie Oh got some King Louie og but I wanted to save that for another video but shout out the packaging but let me just show you guys one thing because these are just again everybody I do not condone the usage of these products I do not promote the sales of these products and I don't sell anything on this channel or I don't push anything it's just an educational review it's for cannabis patients 18 and up you know people that are just wanting to look for a review so let's go right here oh so got myself a little half not too bad not too bad I do want to take this sticker off Rennie let me say [ __ ] it maybe take it off there's a little sticker right here sometimes the sticker kind of kills the color it doesn't get you like that full color if that makes sense you know kick off that sticker there you go slowly nice and slowly BAM oh okay look at this this looks kind of fired I do like the logo right there you guys see right there okay you guys see the logo and it's just some clear wax - and this is clear - like the liquid inside is so clear look at that look at that let's do a little test there you go it's not moving at all we got some sativa on our end so you know I'm trying to wake up but like just one thing I can't everybody I've talked about this in different videos don't get me wrong man these King pens are fired I like them to me they're kind of like equivalent to like a heavy hitter so cheers everybody let's try it out whoo that flare mmm that [ __ ] is so fiery literally just tastes like gum kind of like an orange that's like an orange e flavor and you can just tell us a tivo right off the bat honestly sometimes a lot of people could smoke a sativa and they feel like they took like a shot of coffee you're like a little cup of coffee which is kind of crazy to me it's the other way around I feel like sometimes I could be slumped but smoking sativa it kind of does kind of wake me up like mentally it's like a it's like a mental wake-up type thing you know the physical wake up I feel like I'm a little [ __ ] little tired just cuz I smoked it you know but here like hey I'm show you guys king pan BAM eighty three point zero three percent THC so oh well like how these hey the design is pretty cool you know it's kind of heavy notes made I'd like a little likes a little type of metal but one thing I really do like about the kingpin is that some other flavors are just like lose it they got they got a good taste you guys like I I completely like I approve of the taste the taste is pretty nice hmm oh yeah let me tell you guys one thing though and I know I feel like a lot of people are gonna be able to relate to this but let me know in the comments down below but check this out so if you guys see the very end of this so yeah I see the bottom of it right there like this bottom right here I feel like some some of the liquid stays right here you know it's it gets stuck right here and I feel like you don't 100% complete like you don't want a hundred percent like all over the juice doesn't go inside the you know like the little coils inside if that makes sense you know there's always like a little bit left over that's just stuck in there and that happened to me like two times already I bought two cuz back then I used to like the king I used I select heavy hitters brass knuckles and King pens those were like my two daughters before I even knew about like raw garden and all these other cartridges it was always it was mainly brass knuckles I don't really like the brass knuckles and the heavy hitters see here and there I came across a king pin but actually I think yeah cuz my first cartridge ever was a a brass knuckle it was some sv og I remember that I was the SF vog and it was the full gram and I remember when I first bought it I first bought my first pan I was so excited I was like bruh I'm gonna get so late sigh my room while watch a movie watch a show I'm like ooh it's gonna be sick and that's exactly what I did you know I freaking got my home chart I mean I spent without any somewhat charge but I thought it was in charge so I kind of charged it up you know put it in and I was just like oh dude I'll if I can get it can I can remember to lose and it was in the next room it was the next the next door room I switched rooms in my apartment but back there I was inside yeah this is a tea but I feel like I'm kind of like can look creative you know get a little bit like let's [ __ ] get this bag baby let's look in yes but I remember that's - I freaked I think I watched the epic movie you guys remember that movie those like dumb parody movies the epic loot it was like scary movie epic movie disaster movie [ __ ] love these those lows those stupid parody movies I think they're so funny they're so interesting cuz I'm late half the time but in reality they're they're [ __ ] shitty movies but I always thought they're hella interesting the one that I really like oh my god you guys should go check that one it's called Stan Helsing it's a parody of Van Helsing but that [ __ ] is just ash it's just so funny honestly damn I feel like one thing about the King pens is I feel like the airflow is really nice like there's a way too much now way too much air flow but the air flow is just like on [ __ ] point what's my name before I do remember it was like I forgot what 2014 what was one out like I was first introduced to a couple pens no yet no 2013 Oh 13 or 14 yeah I think it was 13 or 14 one of those years but it wasn't like a it wasn't like a cartridge like a wax cartridge you know like like like distally you know it wasn't stuff like that it wasn't like live resin - it was more like a little globe it was like these little globes and inside was like a little like a tab it was pretty much like you're taking a DAB and there was like a little piece like a little coil in the middle there's like a globe and inside it was like a little coil and it was like heat up so you don't have to put your dab on that stuff you'd have to put your down on that and then you would hold it and I should the coil would heat up and then that's when you take it out that's what I remember the first pens that's that's that's what I'm I'm you know like what the hell is okay to smoke out of a pin likewise and after that that happened and I made like a year or two after that that's when all these like distillate that's when all you got all these like wax cartridges all these like random cartridges coming out and they were fired you know I I came across like for sure a lot of real ones but I'm not gonna lie I didn't come across maybe here and there - three of them that were for sure fake and that's cuz again I've talked about this I say this in every single cartridge video if you guys if you guys are buying those fake-ass $20 cards to stop buying that [ __ ] man don't just just cuz you're you okay right now you're in your head you're part like all 20 bucks bro [ __ ] that I'm not gonna go buy a $35 half gram or a 55 or $60 a full gram at the club and I could be buying a full almost a full gram on 20 bucks just like you guys man you guys are smoking those deadly pesticides you guys are smoking that fake [ __ ] I don't care if you're like local drug dealer or whatever selling guys now man this is some fire that's just the real [ __ ] nah man [ __ ] that if he's selling that [ __ ] I got 20 bucks unless you personally know the person and you know that he's making it and you know exactly what's going on that [ __ ] don't trust that [ __ ] bro cuz if you're paying 20 bucks even 20 bucks for a half gram bro I don't think so no but hey sometimes you guys could get I mean I mean I'm not gonna lie something you guys could probably get like a nice little there's probably people out there that get some nice little plugs or you guys you get some real [ __ ] for really low shout-out to you but majority of the people out there hell nah man you guys copy nothing [ __ ] just save your money and just go buy yourself a [ __ ] full gram of like a heavy hitter you know raw garden you know like cuz I know a lot of people that just mind some fake [ __ ] say it and say this real [ __ ] but I don't [ __ ] I don't think so I don't know I would I wouldn't risk it because at the end of the day she guys's body you're not gonna feel the damages that don't see your body right now but you're gonna feel it like maybe 20 30 years down the road when you're like and then you're 50 60 s you're gonna be like tan mask [ __ ] I smoked all that fake [ __ ] this [ __ ] sprocket effect is 2-1 like 50 60 who knows hopefully now but [ __ ] that's what we're doing that that's why I'm doing this review you guys so [ __ ] makes you guys drop alike man drop a comment what you guys have favorite flavor if you guys have tried kingpin and if you guys are new hit that subscribe button click that bell so you guys can notified every time we upload but sure y'all want to take a hit like what's up I bought a when I first found out that there was fake cartridges out on the street that's why I kind of like completely I'm like [ __ ] that dude I'm not I'm stopping I'm not gonna buy off the street I did a couple times here in they're not gonna lie but this was like maybe like three years ago yeah this happened like maybe three almost four years ago I bought a [ __ ] cartridge it was a brass knuckles cartridge and I bought it for 30 bucks at 30 for a $30 full gram and I'm like okay this guy that I knew at the time on this guy probably bottom and bulk got him super [ __ ] cheap he's just adding another extra five you know another 5 10 bucks to the price to each cartridge so that's that's cool you know he's making a profit I smoked like maybe like one third of it in like the bottom of this she started getting black I'm like what the [ __ ] was it getting black I started getting black I'm like what the [ __ ] dude this [ __ ] is not normal she's starting it I like what the hell's inside this cartridge so I showed one of my other friends but if you like it's obvious I doing this is fake bro you're smoking like fake wax fake this to it you know you're smoking fake distill fake to steal like he's like nah bro just don't [ __ ] away so what I did I was like [ __ ] the [ __ ] grabbed it screwed it off I just did that [ __ ] away and from there I was like dude I can be something you can't be something that fakes you do I did know some [ __ ] one girl though I'm not gonna lie like she [ __ ] oh my god I'm just disgusting but I mean she wasn't disgusting what I'm saying like just she just had no idea one time like [ __ ] I met some girl that had a cartridge that was so [ __ ] dark so cheap you can tell the plastic was so cheap like I asked her I was like what you are this [ __ ] I bought it for my friend house like let the [ __ ] how much like it's like 20 bucks and I was like bro what though it was so dark she was smoking like black tar [ __ ] wax or some [ __ ] ha and I was like dude throw this [ __ ] away and she's like nah and I was like okay cool you know I wanna I want to like taste I'm not gonna inhale this [ __ ] so I took it here oh hell no my mouth too blew it out as [ __ ] tastes like plastic oh she pointed and she part finished it knowing her knowing that chicks you pod killed that [ __ ] she got laid off her ass how [ __ ] all these deadly pesticides all these like chemicals and [ __ ] I have no idea but I don't know I just don't think it's worth it honestly I think it's just it's best just to go to the your local club you know like just go to the local dispensary these brands I know it might not be like 100 percent safe but they're free share you're way better than the [ __ ] that people caught cop off the streets and I talked about this in almost every single cartridge video because it's just so important to not be smoking these book these nasty like chemicals because it's not it might not affect you right now but it's gonna affect you down the road so [ __ ] a lot of people say they leave comments down below saying that I need to take I need to hold in my heads for holidays but your lungs instantly absorb all the THC one day when the smoke goes in your lungs it like instantly [ __ ] absorbs all the THC you know so it's not like you have to keep it in there for it till I grab the most tasty you know but oh that's why usually I hit it I hate it make sure it goes all in the lungs and I just blow it out right away so I'm like yeah I got all the teasing I needed I don't need to keep that smoking my lungs I'm already I should that's about to be wow I'm lit can't even talk anyways everybody at your

uh they're one gram um but we're gonna uh open them up and try them on see if they're worth a hundred dollars make sure you guys hit that like subscribe and hit that bell and make sure you uh if you want to legalize medical marijuana make sure you hit that subscribe button you guys rock here we go so this one here i already did open uh i've been smoking on it i love it it's a great great great great sativa rhythm is a great company uh there you go picture of the cartridge from rhythm nice liquid don't move at all straight uh nice thick thick stuff throw it on the battery here like so like i said i've been using this one a little bit so i mean it does have uh some out of it but then we have this one here this is the gelato from alera this one is also a hundred dollars but they even bling this one out for you it has a golden blinged out uh cartridge and i did take a couple hits it was full so i mean it was fuller than that but i just figured i'd do uh the most expensive cartridges uh video but oil looks good it's a little lighter than the other stuff and to be honest with you i always thought the lighter stuff was better but i'm starting to think the darker is better i don't know but yep let's give this guy a try we'll flip his camera around and uh try these babies out now this one here is what i don't like you need a big battery for uh you need either a push button battery with a big high voltage or something like this a yo can to make this thing hit to its uh proper proper capacity because it has these air holes in the cartridge that are kind of a pain in the butt but like i said if you get a big battery uh it's not even a problem all right screw this on all right we got both cards hooked up and ready to go all right we'll start with the rhythm here this is lost coast travel diesel 1 gram 86 it's like almost 87 thc boom rhythm great company great cartridges they're half grams or a little a lot of head space in them this one here was pretty full i was really happy with it uh this has been three days now four days i had this and it's still a good bit left so i mean i'm liking how long they last it's really good oh whoa has a great uh citrusy flavor instantly three seconds in you feel it very good cartridge is it worth a hundred dollars no but very good cartridge love the taste of that lost coast travel diesel okay round two a second hundred dollar cartridge this is a gelato from alera gelato and then we'll give you the boom again like i said you need a good push battery for one of these so we've got the yo cam plus here make sure she's on she's on and here we go gelato is my favorite strain another 100 cartridge right here uh here we go that thing rips oh that gelato man i like it i really like that gelato i bought the 0.5 for like 45 or whatever it was 50 bucks uh this one here i got it for fifty dollars it was on sale i got it on a discount so i wouldn't pay a hundred dollars for these cartridges at all they're i mean they're worth it they're one grams but sell them for 85. come on give us a deal uh we should be 60 but then we go here this is the hundred dollar one here and uh like i said this one here i paid 86 for after the deals so i really didn't pay the hundred dollars for them but i did pay for them uh i don't know if they're on sale at a good price i would buy another one but i can't spend 100 on a cartridge you guys rock like subscribe hit that bell love you hey them [ __ ] got me dumb litter", "EmSxAqFUSxM": "what's up YouTube this video is going to be a review for another CBD cartridge by funky farms this time we're reviewing the gelato flavor I got it in the 350 milligrams CBD content well excuse me so let's dive right into it let's start with the first I should mention because I forgot to in the last one when I reviewed the granddaddy purple I forgot to mention whether it was an indica hybrid or a sativa the Grande of a purple is an indica this one is a hybrid the gelato is a hybrid um so it's good for like midday or in the morning or at night really it's good for anytime I usually prefer the indicas at nighttime and sativas in the morning but hybrids are really flexible you can use them pretty much any time of the day and it'll work really well um let's take a better look at this packaging I think it's pretty cool it flips up and it says enjoy right there and like in the other video there's a tube with a little cap on it to store it in when it's not in use so that's cool packaging is pretty cool let's review the taste very sweet that's the first thing I think about when I take a hit from this is very sweet um it does taste kind of Turpin II kind of plenty but not as much as the granddaddy purple not nearly as much as the granddaddy purple um so that the flavor I like it a lot it's so sweet and it's also really earthy and planty so if I were to rate the flavor out of ten I would give it a seven point five strong seven um as far as CBD effects go it is a very relaxing very um it calms down my anxiety I was having a lot of anxiety before I made this video and I just took a few pops off of this cartridge and I'm back to normal I'm just chilling now um it also helps with pain it also helps with sleep so if you have problems getting to sleep you can use CBD for that um but if I were to rate the CBD content out of ten I would give it a another seven point five because I don't like the effects as much as I do with the Grandaddy purple so this is both flavor wise and effect wise a tear lower than the granddaddy purple but it's still extremely good um I got it for around $35 I got the 350 milligram concentration um hard to rate it overall I would give it a since both of the Ravens Fred the others were 7.5 I guess I've rated overall as a 7.5 but yeah I look

road got the seat belt safety first of course but today we're gonna jump in to some copper state carts copper state one of the better brands out here in the industry love it um today's strain is gonna

things in the cannabis industry and uh let's jump into this cartridge looking forward to it and i think it's gelato number 33. so it's just the phenotype when you see those types of numbers and things

something man i really appreciate the support of getting from you guys out there i really do and if you're here for the first time welcome to the smokers room aka smokers lounge all right so as you can see from the shirt this review is coming in from dr ganja so dr gonz is kind of a big deal all right when you go on the website these guys got tons of things that you can choose from not only can you choose from dr ganja products but they also have a large variety of other products on their site and this is being one guys okay we got 95 delta eight thc oil cartridge all right and it has five percent terpenes added to it also this is the uh one milliliter cartridge and i already plugged this bad boy up just so y'all know i have tested this cartridge out and it is the bomb okay so let me just tell y'all guys a little bit about delta athc and um it's a little bit of magic inside here because delta eight is a little different than delta nine thc and um it's like the sister to delta nine it gives you mostly the same effects you won't get the paranoia uh what else you won't get that's basically it the paranoia um some people they do get anxiety from smoking regular thc you won't get that either okay this is a scaled down a little comma version of delta 9 thc okay but the effects are a lot similar so the difference between that and cbd now you know cbd we're only allowed to go to 0.3 on a thc scale now with this it's called delta 8 thc for a reason uh i don't want to get all scientific with you guys but i'm gonna tell you like this it it just seems like it's uh the highest closer to regular thc than i've ever experienced other than smoking regular thc if you mean if you know what i mean sorry about that so uh we'll get more in depth into it if you guys have any questions you really want to ask you can ask me in the comments all right because this is fairly new um i think this is a great area in our community whereas that uh we're able to exploit certain um scientific methods um that are used the genetics that are used but um this is awesome so delta 8 is the new boom this is not my first delta 8 cartridge matter of fact i am going to post another video um and i really enjoy them i love the euphoric feel that i get from them they're awesome so you head over to dr ganja get you one guys check it out telling you this one right here i'm really liking that all right and um this is called three shot and i love the company's product so far guys i really do and um like i said i've been smoking it uh sometimes other than smoking flour you want to get a little bit over the 0.3 threshold so that's when the delta eight comes in play because it can get me where i want to be guys okay and like i said i don't have um to deal with any paranoia anxiety sickness none of that stuff like that um it's just something that i really enjoying guys okay so this is the card here got it from dr ganja y'all guys go check them out and the taste is great like i said i only have five percent added terps into it so it's not major but it does have a great taste to it uh i love the natural taste also so that's just me when i do these vapes and um the oils and stuff like that i actually like that natural taste so they didn't have to add any terms any flavors or anything like that to make me enjoy it okay so um this one here has a more natural taste and i have this on the lowest setting okay because if i turn it up i'm gonna cough up a lung that's how potent this is and then also you have tons of medical benefits that you're gonna get with a delta eight card all right so i'm just letting you guys know i will have a discount on the bottom in the description so y'all guys can check out also the link to dr ganja's website and then if you guys come back in a day or two you should see a review on this okay this is the sour blue berry cush all right so i'm excited about that so i got both these products from dr ganja's website and they carry tons more so yeah guys go ahead and check them out man all right use my link use my link why not all right so smoke doctor is signing out right now guys but i'll be back shortly because we got to do that blueberry cook all right so y'all guys stay tuned smoke doctor signing out guys peace", "adgflrbw-70": "oh this is therapeutic icons with you guys today we'll be going over a faking pen cartridge whirs real one so I went ahead I went to my local dispensary and a but I bought a real King pink art of the shelf and here's the proof till Jose Texas all that good stuff and yeah and then I went to a pop-up or a session and I bought a fake one it was cheaper than the real one but then again not real so that's why so some details before we go over the real one brace the fake one these cartridges do have a silicone seal they have a center post they have in their holes and then for some other from some of the research I was doing kingpin likes to keep the inlet holes one point two millimeters however some of the standard ones have it at two millimeter size so I guess it just depends on how thick the wax is or you know just other factors that come into play when choosing the size of these in the holes we have an auto miser and then the our miser is just a small heating element that generates heat for the vaporization excuse me then we have the body of the car we have the tank at the chamber and then this just contains your product we have the mouthpiece the mouthpiece are you gonna custom make them you could make them out of plastic metal I've seen some wood ones so it just depends the kingpin ones we're gonna be dealing with our metal so yeah this gets you this stuff all right so first things first the packaging packaging is really really similar so let's begin so to my left side this is gonna be the fake one and then this one's gonna be the real one did you guys get a look really really similar go ahead and let you guys take a look at the sides the back zoom in for you guys sorry for that shadow here we go back to the front all right so that's weekend so some of the differences I noticed with these cartridges the fake one does not have pounds per milligram so let's take a look at the fake one there is no ounce per milligram on this one first look at the real one sorry about the camera just take a look at that you guys can take a look right here pushing it away does have bounced from really ground the fake one has cerro CBD percentage so we take it up side by side as you guys could see this one has a zero CBD where's the real one this one is 0.26 percent CBD or 2.6 milligrams you can see those numbers the fake one this fake art has law pack stickers for sealing purposes and the real one does not the real one does not have any loud pack stickers for sealing this one just came with just some regular tape on top so another detail that I noticed on the carts was that the fake one the fake one had no batch number and then the real one does have a batch number so we're looking at this number right here the small Oh laughter you get I'm not sure if you guys can see that this batch number right there the real one had that there's the fake one it just says this is C zero seven one I'm not sure what that means so the fake one does not have a packaging date the packaging date on the real one is right here if you guys are able to see that it has 4 - 1719 P kg the fake one has some note of that another piece of the packaging would be nice the cart came both of the cards came and these so the real one had a real cannabis sticker California cannabis standing you know you had some product in there where's the fake on the fake one had nothing just take these out both the card you just came in these so that's another similarity I noticed difference I'm sorry and then some of the similarities between these cards so these cards the box the labeling very very similar you could easily get confused if you are not looking at the small details but the cards the box texture feels the same the bars quality is pretty much the same I can't say the fake one came in cheaper since she / packaging because it's pretty much the same so both the both these boxes they both have a government warning and I reread the government warning they pretty much say the same thing the only difference from the labeling is that the font and the fake one is a lot different than the real one so as you guys can see I'm not sure if you guys were able to tell from there but the fake one is a little bit more faded in the real one the real ones are wider you could see it's a little bit more bolded than the fake one so they both have a labeling sticker that includes ingredients serving barcode and another warning so we are looking at the sticker right here we're looking at the sticker in the middle of the y1 they both have it they have a little bit different information like I was explained to you guys earlier the batch numbers are not on the fake one they do both have the ingredients they both have the serving size they both have another warning label right here that just says cancer and reproductive harm PG 65 warning one really interesting thing that I've noticed of the similarities is the bullet of these people to have the same barcode that's crazy so I'm not sure if the fake product came from a dispensary and there was just expired product and they wanted to get rid of it so they sell it on the streets I'm not 100% sure it's a theory that I have but if you guys have any information on that you guys please let me know that was a really interesting factor if you guys are able to see right there starts with an a start both start with an ATM with the three inside of the barcode first two or four three and then the last two are 0-4 and yeah they both have the loud pack powered by loud pack another similarity that concludes that concludes the packaging let's move on to the carts so you guys are able to see this one right here this is a real one this is the fake one I don't want you guys to get lost I don't want to get lost myself they've moved some stuff here alright let's get to it alright so one of the main things that I've noticed with the real one versus the fake one is the air bubble point it closer to you guys the fake one just to fake when I'm holding in my hand this has a really big air bubble as you guys can see look at that that is not a foreground where's the real one the real one it still has an air bubble however it's a lot smaller than the fake one I'm not even sure this program just compare the two look at the air bubble however very similar another little detail that you guys aren't pretty sure you guys were able to see so sorry for the camera issues the the real one has a mouthpiece where's the fake one the thing has no mouthpiece just to cover it up and this is what I was talking about to one of my boys is you got cover the mouthpiece Albert the thread goes this is just to protect it from any debris coming in of the cartridge so you're able to get a smooth hit because if anything clocks of these holes it's really hard to unclog and it's not impossible but you know just prevent a problem from happening another detail that I'm not sure if you guys are able to tell because of camera quality and just because of the lighting the real kingpin it's a lot lighter color than the fake one so this this is a gold yellow versus a really light the really light yellow and put it up against the camera so you guys ready whoo see maybe a little bit more detail all right another small detail the comma I is the the atomizer on the real one is longer than the fake one so again just point these out the auto my sir is gonna be so inside we have the center pole then at the bottom of the center pole we're looking at the tube we have the autumn Iser and camera so this is what we're looking at the autumn is right there that metal piece connecting to the center Pole so the real one to the right is a lot longer than the one on my left but some of the similarities that I found with these cards so these cards are both made of the same material we have a metal we have a metal mouthpiece verse yeah they both have a little map peas they both have a glass body we have a silicon silicon cover to cover the same Inlet hole sighs out of my answer basis pretty much the same yeah these are these two cards are very very similar it's really hard to tell with if you're not looking at the details you could easily be tricked you could easily be confused as you could see they both have the king pen label right there's a little sticker pretty much the same so yeah I'm not sure what you guys think but these are very popular they're being sold on the streets you know yeah let me know what you guys name let me know if you guys haven't have seen similar similarities or maybe people that I'm buying in Auvers people that are selling it somewhere else they have different smaller details so yeah just let me know thank you for watching I'm good you", "wWGmSPR1SR4": "yo yo yo what is up GM it's your boy Sabby the one and only back at it guys today men my first time making a [ __ ] video in the wild man I don't know why it's been so hard for me to make videos I think I've just been too lazy to be honest guys I have no other excuse but today today guys I'm about to bring to you one of the craziest [ __ ] stories ever that well for me personally and one of my own personal experiences we're gonna be talking about this right here boys this right here you see that [ __ ] right there or say you see a little treat logo right there yo if you if you know what that is your your your real one but basically guys what this is it's tree bass one of the most potent [ __ ] cartridges in the damn world one of the best I've ever tried ever and I'm gonna tell you guys a story of how I came up on four tree bases bow for look at that [ __ ] Barry White you got the Mendo breath and got the Wi-Fi Oh gene you got the agent orange [ __ ] fire guys so let's get to the quick story guys quick story before actually before I get into start we're gonna take a quick hit I'm not gonna tell you guys which one this is but just know it's one of the four I'm smoking on it and I haven't actually been hitting this one I probably hit it one spots just to test that I hope but let's try it right now guys I forgot to mention if you're eighteen over twenty-one over whatever it is in your state make sure you're smoking along let me know what you guys are smoking on make sure leave it in the comment below Oh fire mmm he's [ __ ] delicious so guys into the story um right here I'm gonna tell you guys how I got the [ __ ] tree base so I was looking I was gonna pick up right I just ran out of my [ __ ] cartridges and I was like [ __ ] dude I need to pick up so it's time to pick up so I started looking on weed maps you know we usually what I do guys before I purchase anything I don't go in and just [ __ ] go my same old dispensary you pick up whatever the [ __ ] is they have you know I go on weed map see what the deals are if they have if there are good deals I'll get a [ __ ] deal if not then I'll just stick with like a regular basic cartridge fifty dollar cartridge you know whatever the deal is and then um so I was looking on here and then one of the dispensaries that I go to they always have a deal so I'm like [ __ ] it let me check this [ __ ] out so I check on their page and then I'm scrolling through their deals and then she says to grams - [ __ ] grams of tree base right tree base clear for $70 yeah I'm like I look at it I'm like what the [ __ ] that like this can be real this can be because if you guys don't know try to guess how much one have it this is a half game guys I've never seen one full gram of these I know they make them but I've never seen one like every dispensary that I go to they only have half grams so alright so guess how much one half gram costs of this [ __ ] like look at this clear as water guys one half gram of this cost forty [ __ ] dollars forty dollars yup that you could literally grab a full hat a full gram cartridge for that amount and it's [ __ ] insane but but but if like let's say this isn't this isn't your everyday smoke guys UI no-one's gonna go out and buy one of these for fun no one like I don't like unless you're [ __ ] rich you're not gonna go out and buy you like not even I I even I you [ __ ] debate it if I wanted to go like this [ __ ] so I only got it because it was a good deal so yeah guys so they had two grounds for 7d and that was I couldn't believe it so I had to go hit up the dispensary and go check it out and then let me tell you guys so that bats a morning I called him early in the morning outside out like Maine ten o'clock in the morning and now I was like just to confirm if it was that if they still had it in stock cuz I didn't know you know this is [ __ ] good as deal what if it already ran out so I call them they don't pick up I call them apart like three times just to make sure and then they don't pick up you go straight to voicemail and I'm like [ __ ] dude whatever so later on that day I end up going to dispensary and then so I go inside the dispensary walk in there sure I look on to the other menu on the inside they have a menu so I'm looking on there I'm like hey like my deal is and on there the deal that I want so I tell I pull out my phone real quick and then [ __ ] god damn [ __ ] turn your [ __ ] head lights more hoe it's only 7 o'clock so [ __ ] [ __ ] made me lose my train of thought sorry guys so I told how my hey like I want this do and I pull out my phone and then she's like she's that no it's cuz I had a question about the prices for so I go ahead and ask her about the prices right and then when she confirms that the price is right so she I tell her all right give me this deal she starts getting me she's like I said what tree base do you want to get the for and then she's like hold on let me confirm the deal so she got my phone takes it to her manager she's like hey this is the deal he's game and she's like she said what the [ __ ] [ __ ] no that's not the deal that is not the deal so they had to confirm with like another person and they were like if they come back to me like all like [ __ ] like Timman and [ __ ] and they're like hey like like that deal was like a [ __ ] but we're gonna honor it cuz you know I mean I don't know I've never I've never been to dispensary the word they honored what they say is you know like [ __ ] it whatever you like we don't have it you're out you got a lot of guy so it was pretty cool that say that they honored it so I got 2 grams which comes out to 160 dollars a guy's for $70 $70 that's like literally the best the best deal I've ever came across in my whole entire like two years of smoking weed so yeah guys like let me know what you guys think about that story like isn't that one of the best come like come ups ever obviously not the biggest come up but it's a pretty good [ __ ] come oh come on like you really coming up on a hit 160 dollar worth of cartridge so and look how clear this is bro [ __ ] amazing let me show you guys the packaging real quick for the tree base so this is a pretty neat [ __ ] packaging like one of the most like legit Wi-Fi og little it comes with a little card just fell out and what the card basically is it tells you it gives you a description of like what the what the [ __ ] strain is what it has like what it's supposed to taste like or we're supposed to make you feel and all that [ __ ] so and then inside they have their little things you are holding purity quality and consistency tree base they're pretty professional when it comes to their packaging guys and then the cartridge comes in this tube right here and then in the back they have the same thing and they have warning labels all over and then boom in here is the [ __ ] cartridge let me show you guys real quick this is the cartridge right here half gram clears water I'll make sure to put another little video I make sure to take a better

fourth on the list goes Wi-Fi OG so go ahead and let me know in the comments below which one you guys want to [ __ ] see me review - you guys can choose to remember I'm Loki leaning more on doing

yeah guys hope you guys have a good night lates", "9Udxgbib4sQ": "what is going on guys today we're looking at a few different cartridges but we're mostly just talking about fake cartridges how to spot them how to avoid them how to tell the difference because the last the last year has been pretty horrible for pesticide ridden carts and just off-brand fake cartridges and when I say fake I mean companies that are real or do legitimately produce cartridges but are being replicated like if we start this Cali gold I don't know if either of these are real to be honest but if you look at these two like very clearly obvious like this one makes this one just look like [ __ ] hot dog water like I just smoked a whole [ __ ] card of it I don't know this one's more golden and I've also seen I've also seen Cali golds and like tubes like the you know like kind of like these almost but it's very important if you have a brand that you like it's very important to look specifically at them and look for tiny details so you when you when you go out to get them you know what you're looking for like these on the right here this is a fake TKO can tell yellow tip that's one of the more obvious ones and a lot of the times the fake cartridges will have white tips instead of this instead of these black tips and also it's just little things like like the lettering home you see I don't know how well it'll show up on camera you can kind of see on this this top one is a bit darker and sometimes the lettering is the spacing is weird it's just important to you don't know what you're looking for like research the brand that you like Rhys look at the cart look at the very specific details of it so you don't get ripped off because I mean my a lot of people may think it's just you know it's just one cart like it doesn't hurt me I don't feel hurt I still get high so it can't be faked but it's just a lot of health effects that leads from you know smoking pesticide smoking lead none of its good for you and you should be very aware of what you're putting into your body especially when it comes to vape and oils that's really it I would just I would just say do your research if something tastes off if it tastes funny if it tastes like chemicals stop smoking it throw it away get a new one you feel find a legitimate source that you trust and that they used their cartridges themselves you know what I'm saying even some people don't even care it's just important", "MWDniwcf064": "one two three four five hey how you guys doing just tallying up these numbers right here because I get an experiment on how many full hits it takes to or how many full hits there are and a half gram cartridge you know cuz I was curious so I went ahead and did that if you ever wondered well now I have a almost exact precise number so if you stay tuned and watch this video then that by the end then you'll know the number and you know a little bit more information as well shout out to shout our house you know these are some good good cartridges if you find them out there and dispensaries there anywhere you might want to check them out on that note stay tuned and watch the whole video and I appreciate you guys into the next one everybody has the question so I'm gonna go ahead and give you guys the answer to the best of my ability that is the question is how many true hits can you get out of a half gram cartridge so I'm gonna go ahead no not this one as you can see this one's kind of empty but I'm going to be using this one and this is a timeless sfv og right here but this so you see because most of the time I tap it and I hit them you know a few times at once but for the sake of this test I'm gonna be hitting them one time for through each pool just like this so that's one hit most of the time I like to tap them and try to give it a maximum hit for the back some effect but for the sake of this experiment we're gonna see how many of this take so stay tuned [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now people see that it might be one more Inlet someone mark 20 34 34 you know results from a berry these were fooled some of those Mayberry if you're not taking it might get up with this but I got 34 silent ones hope this information was valuable", "SsC4jaIY8sQ": "[Music] welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I've got my trusty pour one out 510 vape battery that is finely [ __ ] the bet on me after 15 cartridge reviews or something it finally [ __ ] the bed and my trusty 510 battery has died so I'm pulling out the backup the cheaper chintzy er one here that's okay we'll get a new one we'll get a better one but I'm gonna miss my old friend there has died but outside of the funeral for our trusty 510 vape pen we are here for a joyous celebration and we are here to review the product that I have had to me suggested the most of anything I have ever reviewed or intended to review and that is brass knuckles we are finally reviewing brass knuckles I have had you guys a lot of you recommending me check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles and I've used brass knuckles in the past and but we won't talk about that but today we are going to be reviewing brass knuckles finally found some here in Long Beach and I'm very very excited to give it a review so this is the one gram Gorilla Glue cartridge and it comes in some a primo packaging that I have no doubt I'm gonna have difficulty opening here really nice packaging as you can see plastic on the outside it's got all the information you want on the inside lab tested contaminant and pesticide free that brings me up to the controversy I I know that there was a big controversy with brass knuckles for a while about pesticide usage but apparently that is no longer the case I hope that is no longer the case I I would a vet suggest you do your due diligence and research if you're really worried about those kind of things what you might probably should be maybe so do your own due diligence make sure you know this is something for you but from what I've heard they have all of their problems in terms of having pesticides or whatever fungicides or whatever I was that was in there it's no longer the case so Gorilla Glue is my favorite strain as I have said many a times I have seen it listed as both hybrid and indica this is a hybrid gorilla glue I like it both as hybrid and indica this cost me as you can see $52 at my dispensary which is a bit of a miss which is a bit misleading because really with the 35% taxes it can cost considerably more than that but $52 is the base price so you know pretty expensive but not outrageously more expensive than other cartridges this one just has the reputation sort of throughout Southern California as being the best of the best and I think I actually got it open without too much trouble there maybe here we go here's our cartridge in its little packaging there for medicinal use only not for redistribution and we can see their weed maps all that logos blah blah blah blah blah they have a snapchat how fun alright we have got our standard 510 pen here not our former best friend bottoms cap just like all the others with these little rubber stoppers whoever makes these little rubber stoppers must be doing pretty bonk owes business right now I would imagine let's screw this in ooh I like the color of this oil nice dark golden oil beautiful looking oil there a nice brass tip I guess that's where the name brass knuckles come from and a nice wide intake hole there so very excited to give this a drop let's give it a go oh wow that is a premium experience that is a smooth with smooth draw Wow ignore the cough that's my fault not theirs I'm a coffer this does not burn hot at all you can barely feel it entering along it's wonderful the taste is exquisite and Wow I'm already feeling pretty nicely medicated actually oh wow they use a bad word on their packaging here I'm gonna have to read that for you guys I don't see what their THC potency is listed at on here but I do know that they are among the highest in the state I think I've seen before that it's over 90% it certainly feels that way I'm already feeling quite high after just 3 3 little puffs there one negative thing and it might actually be this pen is I'm not getting this huge a draw as I would want for pulling I like the bigger clouds but it's sort of ameliorated by the fact that even the small draws are getting me quite high and it might actually just be this pen doesn't have the voltage to get the huge clouds I'll double check I'm gonna be getting a new pen before I finish this so I'll I'll be sure to let you guys know in the follow up if that still the case Wow but up into this point brass knuckles definitely definitely earns their reputation tastes great hits like a dream oh man really really really enjoying the brass on my brass knuckles experience here guys if only it were a little easier to draw from it would be perfect but again that maybe the pen and I'll be sure to let you know guys because I'm gonna review this entire cartridge I'm not just gonna take a couple of puffs and say it's good I'm gonna come back to you guys after I finish this whole Graham here to let you know exactly my thoughts let you know if anything's changed if the starting to leak if the oil got tacky whatever the case may be I'll be sure to let you know in the follow up so I'll come back to you guys probably in four or five days after I finished this bad boy off and let you know exactly what I'm thinking thank you so much for watching weeks to this point guys and I will see you in just a bit it has been actually I believe eight days since I last checked in with you talking the one gram brass knuckles Gorilla Glue cartridge so right off the bat I wasn't doing this really any less than any other cartridge I don't feel like but it lasted a long long time I really got your values worth with this one certainly a gram in there the other thing is it is still very potent this is a potent a blend that they've got in here this is certainly as strong as its sort of reputation lends it to believe but all that being said my initial I'm not as emphatically as in love as I was with my initial impressions or as I was when I gave my initial impressions there have been a couple of things that have walnut spoiled me on the experience have certainly damper the experience one is it became significantly more difficult to draw as time went on I did get a new battery to test it with and even with a new battery it was still kind of tough to draw from and it got harder and harder as time went on and which is something I really have a problem with with the VBA I much prefer the ones that have nice easy drawers that you can make nice big you know take nice big inhalations with as the kids call them make nice big clouds this wasn't really that and I'm not sure if it was this cartridge in particular as you can see there's actually some oil left there at the bottom I just had such a tough time drawing from it that I think I'm just gonna have to leave it there the other thing is it did start to get a bit of a burnt taste as I got closer to the bottom the closer I got the more burnt the taste was it for the most part tasted great I really enjoyed the taste but as we started to get near the end or trim it's the end of its life that burnt taste started to amplify so tough to draw from and increasingly tough to draw from and an increasingly unpleasant taste those aren't good things for sure those those weren't those theirs don't keep it and there's hold it back and getting in my highest remarks for sure but I feel like I'm definitely gonna get brass knuckles the second chance I've heard enough about them that I'm wondering if maybe I just got a bad card what the case may be so I'm gonna give him a second chance we're gonna review something else from them in the future but for now between the two because they're so often compared and they're so look alike I actually think I might prefer the heavy hitters to brass knuckles maybe yeah I think in my initial impressions I would go with the heavy hitter of the brass knuckle but let's get let's go ahead and do another brass knuckle review before we give it any the definitive conclusion and overall my impressions are still pretty positive this is a potent a long lasting cartridge that you're gonna get your money's worth from so you know I it's still really positive review it's just not as good as I initially had hoped but we will be examining them and given the future so fingers crossed and that guys is gonna do it for this review but before I bounce I want to share with you a little cherry on top just something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related but could be enjoyed with weed or with or without weed and so on this cherry on top what I wanted to share with you guys was something nice and simple something nice and easy an 11 minute web clip from the fine folks at where I guess fine folks the mostly male folks over at Adult Swim make Krueger's of creators of chosen Rick and Morty or at least the hosts of such shows as Rick and Morty but that's not we're here to talk about is Rick and Morty we are here to talk about their 11 minutes short too many cooks too many cooks too many cooks it is an 11 minute video and if you haven't seen it a lot of you I'm sure have that sort of tries to replicate many 90s opening credit songs but things go awry and that's about all I want to say because you should know as little about it as possible before going in because it is who it's gonna be one of the most surreal 11 minutes of your life Definitely Maybe recommend if you do have some cannabis on hand doing some before hand if you're not prone to paranoia if you are definitely pass on it but it's gonna be enjoyable I think for you guys again that is called too many cooks on Adult Swim I'm sure you can find it on YouTube just search too many cooks so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat sand that's gonna do it for this cherry on top as well thank you so much for sticking around to the very end here guys I appreciate it as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "g3AFI7Hc6h4": "yeah what's up

reviewing the alpine cartridge blue dream this was a full gram but it's gone let's let's try the flavor it's smooth it's a little minty even really good I think it also has like the highest THC percentage I get higher than 83% it's pretty good I'm gonna be trying other Alpine cartridges though I mean I've tried them but for the sake of the review but Blue Dream it's my all-time favorite I can't go wrong with blue tree", "avlYCguphSQ": "oh gee shout to Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or I don't show you my personal information all right yo what's up guys Ronnie right back at you um I have another court review for you guys in this video I'm actually doing a kind live resin again if you guys see my like last review I did a Arnold Palmer this is [ __ ] fire I haven't really smoked on the car too much besides for when I did the review because I'm trying I'm if you got yeah if you guys didn't know I'm going to ET see you in like two weeks like what is it May 17th so Loki trying to save this car gonna feel others for you wanna go easy because this car is like I said in that review it taste so far like it actually tastes like Arnold Palmer like it actually tastes like [ __ ] you're smoking lemonade and iced tea like I don't know it's [ __ ] fire but um this video we're gonna be reviewing true Oh G and this brand I mean not this brand um this flavour or strain or whatever you really want to call it I know it's kind of been I don't know if you want to say it's there one of the classics or originals or whatever but I know it's been around for like a really really long time like I seem like a YouTube video somewhere I forget the dudes Shanno or I would shout him out but um it was posted like literally four years ago and he was a reviewing kind live resin and it was true oh gee so yes that's just like a little proof that the true og flavor has been around for a while but I don't know this is my review so I'm gonna give you my thoughts opinions my honest review everything I had to say about it the Arnold Palmer one was a hybrid I think that was like I said sativa dominant hybrid if I'm correct and then the true oh geez I got heavy indica up here and the guy so just looking at the two parts they can look at the two you can already see you can see huge color difference that Arnold Palmer it's like a lot more like clear a lot more [ __ ] yeah a little gold you know what I mean the true OG is like that darker I don't want to say Brown but like like dark gold I don't know this I know it's throw some fire whatever this lit because I don't know I've known about this brand forever so I know it's a fire this lit the only thing that I don't like about them well I don't know I mean they're a little pricey they're like what 62 bucks for the four grand quarter there's like this brand right here I have some of review out on these like if you wanna go check them out too these are [ __ ] stupid fires but there's $70 for the full Graham Carter so these are a little bit cheaper than these but these are definitely more fire in my opinion there was a those are stupid fire but 70 bucks for a gram I can't really justify buying that you know what I mean the only reason I even bought these was because there was a buy one get one for a book I'd rather because I can get two grams of like actual concentrate like shatter for the price of one of the years you know and I'd rather have like actual wax but I don't know these are just good for like when you're going to raves like concerts or you know what I mean it's not like oh nice but yes you know you see the color difference but if you want to see review on the Arnold Palmer one go check that video out but like I said with the one true orgy in this video so let's just go over the packaging a little bit I can't waste too much time on it kind libraries and Ruo Jie yeah pretty basic the side of it says organic blah blah blah and then kind that's new ritual every video I have to [ __ ] drop something but it's you guys but if you guys have been watching my reviews dude I don't know why but I [ __ ] drop my cards and have you [ __ ] video for some reason but if you guys want to do some more research from the brand its kind concentrate song right there so check them out then it has like that Arizona warning on the side apartment of services coming back I don't mean just all that [ __ ] it has to say to cover their ass and that was it see another sticker right here oh it says uh natural sources supposedly they marketed as natural and organic so that's pretty far I don't know how true that is says solvent free natural and organic right there in the bottom two I don't know one of the one of the cons like that like if you wanted to make like a pros and cons list about these cards I mean I guess it's not really too big of a deal but as long as it's a thousand milligrams you know what I mean but I always loved it one like like I said on this large carts it says the THC percentage on the bottom I always love that these um Clank these cards the kind I don't at least from what I'm seeing I don't see any percentages it doesn't say what it's what it's tested at I mean as long as it's a thousand milligrams I guess it really doesn't matter you know what I mean so also what I not just noticed too briefly real quick I'm gonna get this out of the way and I'm we're gonna open this card of this Arnold Palmer one where's a harvested on for eleven nineteen so this is like some fresh or all right here this is brand new this one right here is harvested on eleven twenty eighteen so it's a little bit older a couple more months old I don't really think that has anything to do with the quality of it but I mean that's just pretty cool know when I got a fresh card you know I mean yeah besides for that let's just hop into the rest of this video so let's open this up oh gee off the top then it comes in these little plastic things not the nose in the box that's weird so when you take it out of the box that's you're greeted with you get this nice nice looking cart also another thing that I really like about these cards I mean I know a lot of cards have them so it's not only just this car like a lot like a lot of different brands do it well I mean I don't know I guess it's just all personal preference and also kind of depends on the battery you have but they're gonna say like the white accidents that use just because like when I put it on them this guy pin that I have just like blue one white I don't know it just looks so sick you know what I mean but um here's the quality the oil real quick so you guys could see the clarity of it in color let me find the bubble so there's the bubbler that you can see the consistency of it right there so it looks pretty thick it looks like it's barely even moving um if you guys haven't seen my past reviews I always say tell me down below in the comments what you guys think of the oil to lucas's even though this is my review and you guys are watching my review I'm like really really interested to know what you guys think of it too so make sure you tell me don't blow me comments what you guys think of it oh I think the other one was a little bit like the Arnold Palmer was a little bit thicker than this one is this one it's actually like moving up slowly the Arnold Palmer one was barely even moving but this is actually slighted input I don't know it's still really big oil that's a really good sign this is what it looks like on the pen it's a pretty big pin though I mean like so yeah this is a pretty big pin that's like the only downside of it like especially when you have a four grand card on it it's like good like I don't know six inches maybe you don't [ __ ] know how big that is but um here's the quality of the oil one more time for you guys stupid clear like you see just a little dark that's literally like the only thing I could say about it but besides I mean like the color that the color has to do a lot of things you know what I mean it could do with the strain a weed they like the strain they used to make though or or it could do it there's so many possibilities unlike what could affect the actual color the distillate you know what I mean so don't really like just use that to judge the so yeah if you guys like to know just don't use that that's like your main source of like judging a car just like the color of it you know what I mean because there's so many different like things that could like affect that like so many different variables I could affect the color you know what I mean so so we got the trilogy no I don't know that is a little upsetting that doesn't have the THC percentage on it to be honest so but anybody from kind is watching this I mean I should say a little detail that I'll really cut like a lot more if you guys add it on your packages but like I said it's not too big of a deal but let's just turn this on and get our first couple hits I'm gonna preheat the battery up a little bit get it ready for us to hit it let me just uh voltage so I have it on like a pretty low temperature like just a little like 2 2 point 7 volts so pretty low so you guys are smoked if I didn't mention it I should have added it into the beginning of this video but if I didn't don't watch this video that's for 18 21 or whatever little you were ages Smokey's in the area or you have your medical marijuana card like I do oh yeah I just have to say that [ __ ] to cover my ass but you should hop back into this if you guys are smoking along with me Cheers um and yeah just get into this true OG client library and choose I definitely add that og wish taste oh yeah all right of it even though I'm not I'm not too old I'm not like a og I'm saying not how old I had a nuttin but I've been smoking for a minute um I haven't had a G cush for a minute so I don't know you don't really see too much like real OG Kush now anymore like in the area that I live there's so much like exotic [ __ ] and like I don't know I just feel like that's a new wave it's like exotic strains and that means you know you don't really see too much of the classic like Oh green crack like [ __ ] ogee curve like you know all the og [ __ ] you know what I'm saying you'd only see that too often no more you just see a lot of the exotic stuff so it's pretty like I'm nostalgic to say the least like the hidden some og [ __ ] like that it actually tastes like some fire oh gee it's some real live resin too which is really really like another nice thing about the car and just like the static of it like especially on this pen I mean you can put it even on like the average loss is my evo labs pan this is like a also one of my favorite pens I love this pin so much even on this pin like this [ __ ] looks [ __ ] badass like just black and white you know and this pen actually has on three temperature settings it has a low medium and hot so we're good I have it on the low temperature right now so I guess let's just move this we're gonna heat it up yeah it's preheating for me right now [Music] tastes Oh fire yeah the taste gets a five out of five right off the bat the way it smokes you see I'm barely ripping it I'm blowing clouds it gets a five out of five for the way he smokes it [ __ ] rips my smoked a little bit before I made this video but I'm definitely [ __ ] like I wanna hit this what two or three times so far I mean I'm already higher than I was when I started this video so yeah I mean it's definitely some [ __ ] hope we're not [ __ ] you know what I mean um so these carts should definitely fire but the price of them is they're cheap within the select parts that's a good thing but there's still a little pricey if they were about like 55 bucks I think that'd be a better price point but 62 was a little bit expensive in my opinion for a ground you guys ever tried on time live resin time we don't blow in the comments what you guys think of it and um I don't know if you guys are liking these like um Medical Marijuana reviews or like we train our views or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call these and you have any other recommendations or constructive criticism or anything like that you guys want to tell me time we don't blow in the comments read every single comment I try to reply to every comment I can or at least majority of them or at least like favorite them or you know let me do something I'm always trying to show as much love back to you guys as you guys showed to me because it's like honestly like without you guys that wouldn't really be [ __ ] I mean I'm not really the biggest youtuber right now but still without you guys I wouldn't be nothing you know I mean but so if you guys ever hit me put my Instagram you guys see I always hit you guys back and show as much love as I can so I mean yeah I really do appreciate you guys showing all the love and support you guys do like it honestly doesn't go like for like unseen like I really do appreciate it I'm not making that up but if you guys like really like these videos um the card reviews aren't stuff like that time we don't blow in the comments I've just been like [ __ ] so insanely busy it's been crazy working 40 hours a week trying to do this YouTube stuff keep my Instagram pages active like if you didn't know I have a page where I resell some FTP clothes in the street like that and there's some other stuff so I have so much [ __ ] I'm trying to work on at once while I'm doing [ __ ] 40 hours a week at work and then I figure I said I didn't know I got a [ __ ] DUI for medical marijuana so I got a I'm on probation for that so I'm doing dealing with a bunch of [ __ ] but uh so I'm just [ __ ] insanely busy right now but these videos are just kind of easy for me to record and get out like kind of fast you know what I mean that's what I've been doing them but um we'll have more reaction videos out soon hopefully so if you guys want to see them and you have any requests for us then we don't blow in the comments but definitely this car is definitely fires [ __ ] if you ever um if you ever see a kind live resin in your area I recommend definitely picking them up definitely if they are and if they have a buy one get one free deal like they have when I got these definitely pick them up because it's a [ __ ] steal I don't see why you wouldn't um don't smoke none of those fake hearts going around that's for sure we're all square I'll give this like a four out of five I mean what I said I meant to say a 4.5 out of 5 so like half a point away from a perfect score just for the fact being that they're like a little pricey like I said if they were around like that fifty five dollar mark that'd be a lot more like I don't know I just think that'd be like a better price point for them I mean I don't know I mean the worth is 662 dollars you know what I'm saying but just me personally I don't like spending that much money on just one gram because like I said I can get two grams of should have it for that price but I think 55 bucks should make it a better deal and I think they'd probably sell a lot more cards than they do now if they lowered the price a little bit but yeah that's just my honest review so four point five out of five that's the overall score pace five out of five the way it smokes five out of five I pretty much everything gets a five out of five except for the price point the price point gets a four out of five so that's the only reason it gets like a four point five out of five and I like I said I still have a couple other cards I could review there's a lot of other like dope dispensaries around me there's actually like a kitchen where they make like edible hamburgers and [ __ ] like that pizza so I can make a video there if you guys want um just really anything you guys want me to do is help me down below in the comments but yeah these carts are stupid fired four point five out of five final reading I know I said that a bunch so I'm in the video here let me hit this one more time to see if I have anything I want to tell you guys before in the video and then we'll just ended off that so the flavor on that is so good though like that it tastes so [ __ ] good just if you ever see them in your area definitely pick them up and if you ever tried them down below in the comments for you guys sing at them but 4.5 out of 5 like I said and besides for that it's been Ronnie ray give the video a big thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] it slides for that you already know peace out", "ZQImEJ1zG9w": "[Music] yo yo what's up guys it's your boy savage back yet again with another review for you guys if you guys didn't know every Friday we try to come out with the banger card tree bu dropping is what is the hottest on the market right now what am i using you know what's poppin what's not and usually we try out some of the best stuff and sometimes we get really really unlucky and end up with some crappy cartridges but for today's video men this video has been a long awaited video I've had a lot of viewers telling me go try this you need to try them they're the best in the market and you know your boy after long time in the works we finally got it coming to you guys so tell you boys without further ado we are gonna be reviewing friendly farms true full spectrum live resin cartridges true full spectrum boys you guys heard that right so for those of you that don't know or have ever heard of friendly farms they're a company based out of them it's where is it somewhere somewhere in San Francisco I believe and they started off just I think they started off from what I believe when I first started following him they were making these sauces and they were popping off man you know that was big and then they switched over to UM cartridges they have dabba related applicators you know all that good stuff and they're just killing it man they're just killing it so after you know having my viewers tell me you guys a guy that I needed to try this I obviously went out hit him up and they were super super nice and generous meant to be like yes for sure ma'am you work together we kind of want you to try it out because they even themselves believe that this is some of the best stuff on the market so I was like kind of happy you know it's good working with the company that that is so friendly you know it's just in their name so what they did though this isn't just a normal you know here's our product give us a good review this guy was like here's our product men give give the gift that make the video and give the people a real review don't sugarcoat it know that stuffin you already know your boy ain't sugarcoating [ __ ] so we're gonna get into this man way to be reviewing some of the best stuff so before we get into this video though they dropped the one new product it's it's not new Prada just a different style and it is hold on hold on one of the worried is that we're gonna lose in truck so it is this one right here so this right here is their cured resin cartridges so basically going to offer their Instagram this is what this is what their cured car cured resident cartridges right so our fresh cured liquid is just like our liquid live except this oil is made from cured cannabis plants rather than freshly frozen as with all friendly forms product zero additives zero dis list so you guys know for sure you you're not you don't have to worry about vitamin E may you don't have to worry about all this fake BS stuff that can possibly get you harm and when when you guys are smoking distillate I just hope you guys know that that you you don't know what's going on because distillate they're adding they're adding additives or added preservatives all this stuff to try to make that oil you know vapor Bowl dude and these guys what they're doing is just straight-up squishing the plant just adding it to a cartridge and shipping it out to you guys and of course your lab testing and all that good stuff so you guys know that you guys are getting some of the top-notch quality like in the game right now that's for sure so without further ado man all that rambling I think it's time we get into the cartridge tasting right so busting out a new battery full unboxing for you guys man so these are their batteries right here the this battery right here has three different heat settings it has a low heat as a medium heat and as a high heat all right so taking it out boo you get your charger in there all that good stuff but I think this is my favorite part right so hopefully this is focused in for you guys and give it a little second but when you turn it on a little rainbow colors so badass right so like I said the three different color settings I'm not really going to get in it's every every battery has has variable wattage at this point but this specific battery is you know prioritized for their own cartridges they give you the best temps and it actually it's actually pretty amazing dude because instead of just having one temperature like most [ __ ] cartridge batteries they switch it up with three and every single eight all three of them is a super different here I'm not even joking you could get a very very subtle hit with the lowest one and then with the high hit you get like a massive dab so that's something that you know how is very very happy with and actually you know what this is the cured resin we're gonna hop I have not tried the cure guys and I have not tried the cured resident all and I have tried the liquid life but I think I'm gonna try a new flavor so this one right here is dude these guys are killing also with the collabs man they've been doing collabs with connecting cannabis and they'd have been doing cold eyes with alien lab so if you guys are fans of those companies already you guys should definitely try out these man because it's literally just the the connected and alien labs cannabis just squished up and put into these cartridges man like friendly farms is doing their thing bro killing the cartridge game so look at this look at this packing around me show you guys the packaging because I feel like not a lot of you know what it looks like so hopefully that's focused in and yeah dude so in the fact that got the lab test results all that good stuff on the on the top they got the manufacturing date all that goody-goody and let's go ahead pull this sucker and then all this way to grow I need to smoke so white to all that good stuff and boom the black tip cartridge so before I get into the actual cartridge I'm gonna show you guys what comes in the box so in the Box you get this little paper right here it pretty much tells you how to use it how to get started with using your cartridge all the good stuff of how it's made why does it my cartridge to look full because as you guys can see right here there's a little gap but it has a lot to do with these cartridges and you know the headspace that it gives you and so this is the most important thing this is the most important thing that's cotton atten before but I haven't really looked into it and I think I might tell you the truth man because this is something pretty amazing I haven't really seen a lot of companies do it it says for every gear for every grand purchase $1 goes to a homeless or youth program in your community and it says thank you thank you you know what man thank you for any farms for being so friendly miss you got to have more companies like them and people who care about the community other than just make it a quick buck and that's something that you know says a lot it says a lot from a company so enough with the BS talking does it get this get the chief and boys so this one right here is the animal style if you guys have ever had the animal style but from connected cannabis it actually looks pretty [ __ ] crazy slap it on there so it's on the green setting I didn't even use it on the green setting right so first look into the animal style friendly farms cartridge Braille collab so let's get it boys hopefully you guys are enjoying the content so far go ahead and leave a like comment subscribe all that good stuff man it helps you boy more than you think and if you guys haven't already man go check these go check this company out if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over you already know that the oh man some of the best of the best in the game cheers boys don't fail not sure why they didn't work all right I don't know what was wrong with the other battery but I think it was dead so we put it on a new battery he got it fully charged all the good stuff still on the green setting so let's go ahead and boys first in first try of this animal style so I'm actually pretty excited tell you guys to choose so let's get into oh my goodness oh my goodness well that was like a dad boys oh we did a good thing I need to take a big hit because not that was gonna kill me right immediately immediately off the bat boys the reviews coming in hot get ready so me off the first hit I haven't smoked at all I haven't done anything so I'm already getting a head change in my eyes are getting low I already feel it that's something that you instantly want from the cartridge you don't want to be having to puff and puff until you actually feel something so off of the initial rip your boy is gone no I'm not going but I don't want to say so that taste of that taste was like a really really really like medium to low temp dab just really really tasty in the oil and not even I'm not even talking about like do you know how when you taste distillate you can taste like the oil like this is this is like a good oil man this is like something you really want to tell you so see it's fire dude all right all right let's take another hit and get a full flavor profile see what the effects are going on then what is this I think this is a hybrid right all right this is a hybrid I'm hoping that it's a little bit more indica dominant than any you know animal style seems more like a sativa by the name mmm all right boys Cheers oh man that thing just opens up the pathways bill that literally the lung expansion is immediate and it's smooth it's so smooth like it's smooth but it makes you want to coughs just because you know your lungs are so full your lungs are so full with the greatness oh man in the excel it's just like a relief of stress but when you're exhaling it just like exhale you guys ever heard the term of inhale the good [ __ ] exhale the [ __ ] someone probably was chief in this and made up that quote because this is what it's doing and oh my gosh I'm just in awe dude this is amazing an amazing feeling it went from straight-up head to a full body in full head and I'm just in straight-up chill mode man after a long day of work man this is definitely something enjoyable something I look forward to chiefing on you know with most other cartridges I'm not gonna lie it's like it's there you know you have it you could just have bought it the other day but do you want to hit it probably not what this literally as soon as you can you you're gonna hit it row as soon as you get that a single opportunity to hit this bad boy you will I'm in complete love man there's these days we're gonna have to taste another one so this is a hybrid let's move on to the I think we're gonna move on to another hybrid well no wrong with the sativa so tan G tan G is one of the og strains in the game if you guys don't know the hand she's been around for a while I think oh you remember when I started in here nothing but I'll see what the city was there about usually cities are a lot more like pungent a lot more flavorful I've never tried a sativa in you know in live resin form or true full spectrum light resin form some let's see how that how that tastes us this one's a little bit more full to the oil bro the oil is so crazy looking you guys a little close-up of the oil real quick hopefully that's focused in ya know and I know a lot of people are gonna be like oh I'm turned off by the oil the oil why does it look so dark to like do just understand the concept of what um you know marijuana is a whole man when it comes to making these products like people think people have this you know this natural we're not even natural it's probably just been a rumor that's been going around that people are like oh that clear it is the better when in reality that's not the case at all you know there's rosin and stuff like that that are like white and clear but that's a whole different thing room this is this is literally full spectrum light resin in a cartridge bro and this is what you want this is what you want I'm telling you 100% coming from cybg himself this is what you want in a cartridge you don't want distally you don't want oil man all the other stuff that people are cheating right now is it has it's nothing close compared to this if you guys are able to get your hands on this 18 and over 21 and over whatever it isn't yearly will say if you can even get these just try it just try it so we're going in on the tangi sativa see if it's any any different than the hybrid I feel I'm already fated you I'm showing them but we're gonna do this for the tube cheers boys Oh oh my goodness that was unexpected that is good bro oh my gosh I've never tasted @anjghie that tasted this good like I've tasted tangi before but this is [ __ ] phenomenal whoa in full spectrum mode it's literally like a whole different experience man I'm not gonna tell you guys like you literally can't go out and try anything like this is for this friendly farms cartridge is like something I've never tasted before it doesn't taste like plug and play doesn't taste like city it doesn't taste like wrong guard and this thing is so distinct and so good and my lungs are just so happy because it's like so smooth too and just like it hits the hits in every single aspect bro like the smell the taste the smoothness the from the from the inhale to the exhale everything about this cartridge is phenomenal definitely great so I'm gonna turn it up there you see or think it's premium as a preheat function to on it so this is purple setting I'm not too sure if this is lower hot but what's going on the purple side oh yeah the big boy setting boys that's that put you to sleep sending holy moley yeah that's that punch you right in your face whoo that was a dad with I was phenomenal oh this thing is kidding I'm not even a fan of [ __ ] sativas but this is a hit tangey killed it all right so I guess we're gonna end out the video with where the hell is that I'm tripping all right the blue dream right here so this is the cured resin right this is going to be their newest addition and their newest them yeah their newest addition to the lineup so this is um the cured resin instead of the librarian yeah the liquid live I mean right so right off the bat this is their that then this is their new um cartridge within you well it's the same tip and everything but it's just actually I think it is an encourage holy yeah definitely upgraded well I think it's the same one looks like the same one just a new tip they added a little I mean yeah let me show you guys let me get a little closer yeah so it has a new there this is our logo up here up on the top and the bottom if you I don't know if you guys can repo not because they're reflection but it says friendly farms and the oil and in terms of quality of the oil it honestly comparing your right right away it looks very very similar to their liquid life except this one the liquid live looks does look a little bit more thicker in terms yeah definitely their liquid live looks a little bit more thicker a little bit more um definitely something you would see from a squish plan this one this would like a fresh frozen pie if you guys I've ever seen different types of planets getting squished are like if you guys are into that stuff I know it's kind of weird for me to say this but you guys should definitely go google that in terms of how different types of libraries and suffer made and you guys would really get a really Indian detailed look of how how things look of how things can taste of their their flavor profiles you know their aspects of what what they bring to the charts in terms of TC percentage to body lock you know all that good stuff so I mean get right into it I'm gone I'm faded so cured resin coming in hot boys this is the blue green by the way that blue dream a blue dream when I saw that name it was kind of like you brought me back to like I don't know why Blue Dream has just been one of those things that you know one of those strains that have been around for a while even like I feel like I heard about that straight in like junior high so I'm gonna lie though this new cartridge with the logo on top is it definitely some swag hopefully that's what you're saying alright so cheers boys cured resin let's see if it tastes any different Yushu show you guys a whole difference right I always think that can be able to tell too much about the high I might save this cartridge after hitting this and make you maybe make a full review we'll see about that but cheers boys was gonna do it hmmm I honestly can't even tell the difference in terms of taste it tastes pretty good obviously I can tell the the flavor the length of strain flavor but in terms of like you know when you get a cartridge like even if it's different flavors you still get the same that same little taste like because it's the brand taste you know it's what makes the brand the brand so finally formants did a good job so if you guys want to know like pretty much the Cure they made the cured resin lion just in terms to appeal to more of the consumer base because people I guess were saying that it wasn't too budget-friendly their liquid live and honestly like you know and what I personally have to say if you're going to be doing you know consuming all these cartridges all these all these things you're gonna have to spend the bulk and if you're willing if you want to get some of the best stuff this is a right here man this is it like you you should go out and definitely get this because this is designer weight men you know this is that good stuff this is that good [ __ ] and they made this when the cured resin - like I said appeal to them to people with the lower budget you know people who only want to spend like I'm guessing like thirty thirty-five bucks on a cartridges instead of spending for like 45 so whatever the case is and honestly it's amazing like friendly farms is definitely doing their thing they're killing the game man if you guys are interested their Instagram is gonna be linked down below and you guys can go check out their product they've won multiple awards man definitely I can see why now I'm glad I got to test this out if you guys want to see some of their dab stuff you know these are their DAB sauces and we also got the the applicator we can definitely do something like that if you guys want to see some crazy ass challenge videos man like hitting for friendly farms at once or something like some something crazy man let me know in the comments below what you guys have as an idea and we'll probably do it so yeah get in the video I hear if you guys enjoyed it like I said leave a like comment and they", "9B7dLmpAxNw": "yo what is up guys welcome back to another video this your boy and Maddy smokes how is everyone doing today I know this is

anything like I want to do this TV but they don't sell cz here in Las Vegas oh well let's get back into this thing I'm not feeling the effects right now I think a lot of like pungent my like super pungent it's like the superest pungent when I ever had ever and like the oil isn't that like isn't that is clearest like hazy a little bit mmm it's a lot hazy than the other one like my great god this one is like a little hazy a little bit it's legit look at that that's a bubble don't move that fast that it's just creeping well right now like I don't feel the effects I think right now but you know we keep talking yeah just a lot of puns in this thing it hits the throat hard to like it's kind of harsh man kind of harsh bro this is probably the harshest one I ever had I think like I'm not even feeling stone yet bro mmm this even working hello like the with the great God man I like Filton already it is this is like I don't know man I don't even feel it nothing I think what the eyes oh the

I feel about this weed will I buy it again probably not but if you guys like that you guys like that feeling you know I mean like I'm getting like a little tingling in the back because I like back

peace I'll see ya next video peace", "ZzuxwwTKk5c": "oh this is not a plush toy to make me change I become like a castaway you know your page that you bought the color today game is goodie to get your voice mpg back at it with another fire waiting for you guys man so for today's review man I got a Corolla right here man yeah you heard it right kirova the comfy that makes I think they started off making edibles and then just the transition into making marijuana you know actual bud and then cartridges and things like that so they're branching out into the cartridge game I got myself right here it is a mimosa it is a Clement Lucie if I can go ahead and get that a little focused in for you guys one time so this right here is the momo mimosa it is a clement i'm / purple punch and men you know but most is is obviously one of the better sativas out there that i that i feel like you know they just the sativa that just gets you extremely baked but also lets you do your thing without making you feel like super super like your mind is running if you get what i mean which is something that a lot of sativas do so you got to be careful what you choose so yeah I got the memo so right here this one's sitting actually at a 78 point 81 percent THC so that's not too bad actually I was expecting a little bit a little bit more but honestly what can we can do right so open this up right away men it comes in this nifty ISO container I haven't seen any cartridges come in containers like these as of late so I uh yeah all you do is just unscrew this unscrew it all the way throw that to the side cuz you're only gonna need this cartridge so right here boys I got the mimosa from Corolla this is a full gram I think they do have it in half grams also I'm not too sure about that but I have seen full grams all over the place men on the bottom it says Korova unrivaled alright so we're gonna go ahead and test it out man see if it actually isn't rebel because I feel like with a lot of a let me mind you this is a distillate cartridge this isn't a librarian cartridge this isn't anything too special man so I'm not my hopes aren't too high I'm kind of hoping it tastes good I like my mosula it's one of the few teams that I like but you know when it comes to distillate not a lot of distillate companies can do good the only distillate companies I personally feel like I've been doing a great job with their product is dizzy and plug play those two distillate company - probably the only ones and wrong garden - just remember they're additionally company not a lot rather company so I want to take a ghost hit but I got the fan point I mean go ahead and turn off real quick boys here we go we got the Korova mimosa sitting on the raw garden battery I currently don't have any variable wattage batteries man I lost my favorite battery which was whose if you guys in a little slim twist one I'm trying to look for it I'm hoping I can find it soon but as soon as I find it you guys are getting Ben your video out of it man so before we take a hit demands go ahead and try to hit 500 likes on this video I appreciate everyone who's been tuning in lately man during this whole quarantine I've been getting a lot more subscribers and I just want to welcome you all to the GFN man so if you guys are over the age of 18 to 21 let's let's get to smoking boys chewed so right off the bat that first initial hit man I'm not gonna lie it wasn't to like like tasty I don't know if it's just the first hit that was like that let's go ahead and try to get the other wing quipped up and then because that's one thing that I wanna let you guys know to win and whenever tasting out a new code don't ever base off the first hit just for the simple fact that you know the coil takes a while to get whipped up and things like that you gotta burn through the oil and you gotta just absolutely taste the flavor so we're gonna be taking a couple hits and I'm gonna take a couple hits until we get into the flavor until we had super big so cheers guys mmm it doesn't all right after that second dish okay I did get a little bit more flavor I'm gonna go ahead and switch it to the dr. zodiac battery because I think that this one is a little bit stronger because for distillate cartridges the other ones for live resin so for that second hit though I did get a better flavor profile I tasted a little bit of a like a Clementine like a little sweetness sourness so not too bad not too shabby not too shadows go ahead and just keep going though [Music] the taste that I'm getting though is it is it isn't like a oh wow do you like you know just astonishing taste that you would like to get from a cartridge Billie like I feel like I'm getting more of like a dis elyda taste then I'm getting of terpenes like I I think this is lacking a lot intervenes as of now man after the first initial hits a man you should at least taste something you know you should at least provide a consumer with something that the first hit the first two to three hits man and you should just smack you in your face and want to keep want you to keep hitting it more and more right with this one I don't even feel like hitting it anymore just because off of those two three hits like I kind of don't even feel like I don't get that taste that I like you know I don't get that oh gee earthy goodness or I don't get that that fruity berry nasur I don't get anything it's just very very dissolute eat like if you know how desolate cartridges they just taste like like THC oil like just straight-up oil like and I mean that's that's one of my big issues with distillate companies you know you feel like for the most part you know desolate companies just don't get the the mixtures right when it comes to their disel is slash terpene mixtures it is just disgusting because you could either end up with a really really good dissolute like cartridge or pod like plug and play and dizzy where they kind of balance it out with the perfect amount of THC and the perfect amount of terpene and it also depends on what what you know dis lit you're using in the first place how refined it is how well process it is and what buddy used to produce that desolate and there's just so many steps and I feel like with this like they're not there yet they're definitely not there I'm sorry Korova but you're definitely not there yet I would probably just stick to edibles as of now man but I'm gonna go ahead and keep hitting it maybe it'll get better as we get along then so cheers guys like I am getting a little bit more of the mimosa now a little bit more yeah you like kind of more of the Clementine than the purple punch but like I said man just the ratio of dis Allah to Turkey mixture it's just like you want something and that's gonna be in your face you know you want to be able to taste it right here I feel like I'm just smoking straight of disel it like yeah I do get the little hints of Clementine in the back but it's just very very subtle like at this point I might as well just be smoking oil I just straight up this little oil with no terpenes because the terpenes then dilute it to making it less cheap see and then um damn a mother will just give us that you straight-up hardcore og dissolute man but I have nothing good to say about this I'm not gonna lie I have nothing good at all like these all right let's just break it down let me break it down for you guys so right off the bat I would say though I would say here's the upside of it they're packaging their presentation skills are phenomenal they post on weed maps they pose the pictures that they post the things that they post is just like oh [ __ ] that's the main reason why I got it in the first place this is the main reason why I got interested service because the presentation was outstanding just likes dizzy just like politically just like any other company that's doing big right now you know the packaging is on point that's something that I say is key in every single product because when you're looking at something you want to buy something that's visually it's visually appealing first then it is anything else you know because you're not gonna be able to taste the based off of a look so I'll based off of that that is another reason why I got it but opening it up like when I first saw this I liked I looked at the tip and it seems to be like not even a normal tip like some plastic [ __ ] so I touched it not even not a ceramic just a very very low grade and it's very very light though very very light compared to other cartridges not like I can I can barely feel like it's in my hand and then other than that man they that the oil quality it's thick it's thick I'm not gonna lie it's thick I've been hitting it this whole entire time and it's been it's been hitting it's been think it hasn't been moving at all definitely some good distillate but at the end of the day it all matters on how it tastes on how it gets you high it hasn't even gotten me high dude where are you going to take some fat-ass head see if it gets me home we go ahead and take a blinker for you guys if that boy here doesn't get me high I don't know what to say man so cheers guys go ahead and take a blinker with me [Music] he no longer expand me I got a little bit of lung stretch and just B's due to all this smoke go ahead but it wasn't like like crazy do you like with the plug play like I know I bring up other brands but it because it's comparisons you know you want to compare distillate brands with the distillate brands you want to because other other people who have tried who want to try kirova for example the chances are they already tried still Z plug play you know all the big names on marquee right now and this this is my job man this is what I'm here it's to tell you you guys you know what's good what's not that way yes don't go out wasting your money like I [ __ ] did pretty by the way that or cheat cart that I bought they didn't work at all guys so that's it down yeah nothing at all for that blinker I I feel a slight head change just off of that blinker but it's nothing like hot [ __ ] like I'm faded off my ass it's nothing like that at all and I'm kind of disappointed man like I feel like like people are just taking advantage of like the [ __ ] that they have you know the money that they have in trying to produce stuff that isn't good quality at all like I'm sorry but this these cartridge companies have to be stopped like these cartridge companies have to be stopped now because I'm tired of wasting my damn money on cartridges that look good look like they're gonna taste good but they're ass I'm [ __ ] tired of they do it alright so I'm from now on man I think I'm starting people I'm sorry calling companies out on the [ __ ] that they make because it's so disturbing man the amounts of money that I spend on cartridges and [ __ ] and still I am not satisfied with what people produce it's kind of like I thought that's just how it's gonna be man you know especially now with the inflation in the cannabis community if you were gonna be taking advantage of it but like it just sucks man so Korova you go F yourself I don't want anything to do ever with your product again you're trash get out of mind getting out of the stores anything don't ever caught this company and yeah I'm gonna go ahead and out the video here guys if you guys enjoyed today's review go ahead and leave a like go ahead and leave a comment so I could talk to you guys like calm me back to everybody by the way and most importantly though leave a subscribe it helps your boy out more than you know so gfm we'll catch you guys in the next one then we practice fifty shades of gray function on the ground buddy no goes obviously good money I'm some to the runaround are you sending me are you coming now cuz I'm post on I mean", "fsFMKz-OLBg": "hey what's up I'm just gonna be talking about a new strain of cannabis that I got from urban culture yesterday this is gelato by Verano and so I'll show you the nug really quick the pictures are probably a lot better there's actually a little bit of purple in this and the nut the flower is kind of like yellow with Keef and then it has some dark dark greens in there and a bit of light greens and not too many red hairs or orange hairs but a couple and they're curated really well they're cut really well and they look to be cured really well so that's good and I'll go ahead and read you the terpene profile potency THC is 0.92 percent THC a is twenty two point one four percent CBD a is 0.12 percent CBG is 0.22% CBG a is zero point seven nine percent and the total cannabinoid content is twenty four point one nine percent this is good because it has the CBG CBD and CBD a in there some of the other cannabis strains that i've gotten recently don't have the CBG especially in there and occasionally they won't have CBD as well terpene profiles beta Pennines zero point zero six nine percent limonene zero point two eight seven percent lean Ahlul zero point zero six one percent beta carotene zero point three eight zero percent human zero point two nine nine percent and total terpene content is one point zero nine six percent so what I'm going to do is um I guess we're going to go ahead and use this lo Luca piece and so we'll go ahead and load up a little bit of this and I'll just do a quick review of everyone's morning's going well by the way I did a little bit of house housekeeping housecleaning for my parents all right I've got my Ravens later so we're gonna be using that today Wow it's got like a really earthy piney flavor and like a diesel II flavor - its got like a diesel or the pining diesel flavor and oops yeah really diesel II and actually super diesel like scan them to the extreme and well I'll take this out later yeah that uh left like a really potent taste of diesel in my mouth not in a bad way but it's just like what it is and really like piney - um okay I'll have to sit with it for a little bit and then I'll come back and do a review on what I think of it all right well I had the urge to clean earlier after smoking this and I cleaned quite a bit so it was kind of an uplifting experience and um now I'm kind of coming down a little bit and it's more grounding and um I yeah I'm just like coming back down a little bit I basically cleaned the whole entire top floor and so I feel good and energized and uh but I'm just like kind of settling down a little bit more this is a good a good strain I don't know if I've ever tried the verrano products before necessarily but um yeah it's it's pretty good I'd give it a recommendation it's not like too overwhelming of a high or anything it's good a good mellow feeling

day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive what's up guys back here for another [ __ ] video and today you guys already know you can tell from the title today i'm gonna do another informative informative video um if you guys clicked on this video it's probably because you guys have bought a select card and you guys are wondering is that thing real or is it fake because select had a lot of fake cards going on back in the day but that's back when that's back before they had live resin guys back in those days they only had distillate but now guys man they faking they faking the live resin now guys so today your boy is about to put them on blast because um i recently got a select from flower co and um my friend he recently got a select off the streets and he came up to me with it and it was pretty much the same box but totally different and you could just tell it was fake and i felt so bad for him so he let me borrow the he let me borrow it i got the cards and i'm going to show you guys the difference between the real and the fake you probably could kind of tell already from the box which one's real and which one's fake but um before we get into this guys hopefully you guys can hear me it's kind of windy today actually but um let's take a freaking bong ring boys all right guys so to start off off the back we're going to do a little close-up you feel me so you won't see my face for a little bit we're going to do a little close-up talking right quick so check it out all right off the back this is the real one and this is the fake one and let me tell you guys why this is real and this is fake off the bat you can tell it's fake by the colors all hybrids are in the orange box and it's a dark orange it's not this light orange you see the lettering the lettering it's in light orange um the name of the strain the thc content and the amount in there is a lighter orange as you can see also let me get a little closer this color scheme thing right here the yellow orange red pink purple the color scheme is lighter than the one on the rail box those are off jump ways that i knew as well as you could tell by the print they're using different fonts as you can see it's more bold up here is more popping on the real one more plain it's more pop it gives it more of a pop like it's coming out at you you'll see the difference okay and then another way you could tell guys is the real one off jump a real one's gonna have a bar code there you go barcode fake no barcode no nothing sealed up nicely it almost looks almost looks real another way you can figure out that this is fake guys is when you push it out to open see at the bottom you could see that it just pushes straight out when you push this button in on the side guys that i have my finger on right here that i'm tapping you can just push it down and then push the cart straight out you can see from the bottom the box comes straight out on a fake cart it's just a flat bottom you just pop that off this is a flat bottom this has no use maybe after you pop it off you can slide it but it has pretty much no use as you can see the difference the actual box pops out from the bottom when you rip this tape off another way i could tell guys is also from the bottom it's a hybrid and it says indica on the bottom it could obviously be an indica hybrid but it just says hybrid on there and if it doesn't end like a hybrid it will say indica hybrid like this one says sativa hybrid it's a dominant sativa because most you know strains you get these days they're hybrids so um usually they're either sativa dominant or indica dominant this one's a sativa dominant as you can see but this one it just says indica on the bottom and just lemon hash diesel so that kind of threw me off that new that that's what made me know that it was fake basically a lot of things did but also you could tell by the font the font is different as you can see it's a light orange color just the real one's dark orange feel me and the font is way different guys this is a fake just look at the font you know give it a couple seconds make sure it's hd now look at this font you could see that it's much different font but it's very similar they did a good job on it but some of the font stuff is different like the warning sign should be yellow there's no yellow and you can see that the font is different boom boom all right guys those are the ways you can see just by looking at the box this is the real one the tropicana and this is the fake one it's too light like you can tell it's fake guys come on now um another way you could tell is um by the actual oil you see the lemon hash diesel it's a little too light you feel me you can see how light it is i'll take it out the package later but your oil is going to want to be dark like this like the tropicana cookies you see that dark consistency you don't want that you don't or no you want that sorry guys you want that dark consistent you don't want the light consistency you see that it's too light you want that dark because live resin is usually darker but yeah let's pop this open but yeah guys you know there's a lot of you know fake carts out there that are easy for you to you know realize that they're fake because they're mario karts they they got fruity pebbles on it they're named after some kind of cereal brand you know different brands that are trying to entice younger people to buy it basically but you know select it's a little harder to um just drop the box it's a little harder to tell because you know they try to make it look as legit as possible and select is actually a real brand mario karts and those luigi's and all those other carts that are out there the skittles and stuff like that those aren't real brands nintendo is not gonna let you put theirs name on a car guys let's be real so we're gonna open up these boxes real quick there we go so it pops right out guys the real ones you can actually use the button and it pops right out there's no cardboard on top it's just like a plastic thing you have to cut off and then boom you got a cart the fake one as you can see you have to actually peel back a box you feel me you have to peel that back and actually open up the box [Music] then you can slide it out after you already open the box [Applause] the real one it's already out you can already push it out the fake one you have to rip open the actual box bam so like i said guys look at the oil the real one is going to be much darker than the fake one as you can see the fake ones are super light it looks like fake wax usually fake wax looks like this looks like this or clear this is real it's a live resin this looks like a distillate this looks like this joy with this live resin baby so make sure you know what you're getting guys the last test honestly the last test to know if your cart is real or fake is to taste it but i know for a fact that this one's fake as hell so i'm not gonna be hitting it let's inspect the cart see the fake one the fake one sorry guys i'm not even done yet the fake one as you can see has no stickers or nothing a real one is going to have a ca sticker on it my guys as you can see let's see what kind of cartridges they use the c cells look a little different too hopefully i can zoom it in good enough the c cells look different [Music] way different but they're both cell i guess but the writing on this c cell looks more bolder as you can see the writing on the real season looks way smaller but either way we know we know that yellow stuff is fake in that dark stuff this is the real this is the real deal guys fake real you can just look at it and see the difference ca dark color no ca light color looks like a disc joy all right so thank you guys for watching the video though guys more content to come i had to get you guys another fake card review and i felt like select one of the biggest like companies out there other than raw gardeners dizzy so

don't smoke tsc very much excuse me i mean taste and flavor-wise yeah that's worth the money that's why it's worth any dollar amount you assigned to right up to i'd say 60 70 bucks i could pick me

nice i don't know pretty i mean they're up there if you were to buy that at let's say that dispensary right there how much you think they charge you for it they charge like 80 bucks for stuff like

break for a little bit you know it's good to take breaks you know get that tolerance down a little bit you don't want it to go too high so um and like I said you know stuff that happened I wasn't able to make some videos but I'm back and I'm back with some good [ __ ] I already know what studio that kingpin and a gelato hybrid get straight you straight into this check it out thousand milligram per gram seventy seven point 38 percent and zero point thirty percent CBD and that's for the THC to seventy seven point 38 CA at that CA stab cannabis vape cartridge world's most awarded cannabis vape got vents up a little bit cuz it was on my bag since aside this is the back looking check that out feeling a redeposit ingredients obviously cannabis oil 1 3 second draws a single serving GE 68 bros up with his hair this is just my person on my bed gotta get this [ __ ] out of there alright the manufacture date was February 18 2019 which was only a few months ago and the best body is February 18 2020 and the batch ID is GE 68 Howard a lot back so that's that these newer ones have the red sticker the older ones have the black sticker these new ones have the red sticker and when you open it up I've already used it you're gonna have this this black tube this is in it and then you can pop it open if I can do this with one hand did it and then your cart will be in there but I already have it ready on my own battery so let me go ahead and get that for y'all and see I've already use it a little bit let me take it out this is it it's not a Cecil it's like an eye crusher so it's like I crush your tank if you know what those are but it's different because of the tip look how short the tips are look how short it is this is something different you don't really see a lot of them was like a really short tip like this and check that out this symbol is on the glass he even has the red eyes too cuz he smacked my magnet on the bottom that's where you were wondering what that is look at this look how think that is this has been warm cuz I've been using it and it's been in my car that barely even moves this is the real [ __ ] right here this is none of those fake kingpins I see people half the bubble literally goes up and down within like 10 seconds like this is warm the car didn't like if I feel it right now it's warm and it's still thick still thick not moving at all so kingpin for consistency 10 out of 10 easily it's my battery right here T's for 20 bucks good as a battery put it in real quick all right may take me a couple puffs and tell y'all what it's like I got flavors just [ __ ] amazing the gelato flavor is just straight-up they're the Terps whatever going to call it the flavors they're like oh my god this [ __ ] just tastes like the bud pretty much all right that's what I noticed when I got this like I didn't think it was really gonna taste like this much spot-on like gelato I thought was gonna be like a little bit like gelato I don't really think it was gonna be this much really [ __ ] surprised my man so kingpin I don't some good ass [ __ ] man keep it up yeah that taste is there taste is definitely there [ __ ] is just so [ __ ] good I mean what can you say I mean this is a real one this isn't a fake one I got this [ __ ] from the [ __ ] dispensary so I mean if you're getting a fake probably it's not gonna taste like this so what I would say is make sure you're just getting it from a verified source really really good i really suggest it I really should suggest this if you're looking for example gelato this flavor right here I would suggest this flavor it's really good so for my rating for the review consistency I already said 10 out of 10 really [ __ ] thick oil it's really good it's real nice - real nice color you'll see that it's a really nice golden it's a nice ass color man flavor 10 out of 10 flavors good the UM this is a hybrid y'all can see the hybrid so oh [ __ ] my bad dropped the [ __ ] camera damn oh that's hot that's how that

it or you have a dispensary go get this man yeah this is the video like comment subscribe let me know which I want see you later", "Az3rNy3LDdk": "what is up world Chris dad's age 4:20 here the YouTube channel for weed lovers and cannabis patients alike today is the 11th I think the May I know I can't see very good but this is just a video of a gelada it's a lot of Kush vape tip by CG extracts so we're gonna do these I'd make these videos for the people of these 19 years or 21 years and older I should say unless they have a ballot card to possess cannabis matically and I just like to say I do these reviews in four categories looks smell taste high in effect but for the look since Melbourne I can't really do the greatest job because it's a vape so I look at it like concealing the the look of the concentrators bomb it's very clear it's the way it's supposed to be at last for a while it's not right runny it is very good so I'm gonna say it's got to be a 10 on look now on smell there's no smell at all to it unless you get right up here and smell the tip and then you can smell the citrus tree of the fruit I remember exactly what their tastes like because my friend had a sunset sherbert so it's right citrusy so I can taste that and it but I can also taste the maintenance of the cookies right so I almost think the two of them combined perfectly for a gelato taste the citrusy ain't over it very like I found the sherbert the sunset sherbert one was very citrusy and the mix with the cookies and overpowers that citrus so it's like you're just getting a little bit of citrus and the rest of the cookies so I really like this it's to honor I'm gonna have to say the smell you can smell the citrus worried away first thing is you can smell it's like almost like smelling a cleaner likes very citrusy right but you can smell the citrus right off the bat that's about all I can smell some give that stiffer smell its gelada it smells like Johanna 100% I'm gonna give the smell of 10 as well so now we're on to taste min Tina's I can taste the citrus very citrusy very loved bit of a mint taste which is the cookies it's weird how the Girl Scout cookies tips that were like minty not overpowering like menthol just a little minty so I really really really like that so I can definitely taste the mint and I can definitely taste the citrus beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful taste very said to see quite a good little view here they do gotta say he's a quite a good little view see the trees in the background I'm outside you hear the nature putting the vegetable garden in right over here I grow some watermelons and some cucumbers and some squash and some I don't know what else corned peppers or whatever we can very minty and citrusy to all the taste is nothing straight but I'm gonna give it for a gelato I'm gonna get it at an Italian taste I can't understand guys why all these are tens but like I've had a few puffs off this before I did this and I don't know here I know the first time I opened it put this tip on I imagine the first couple puffs one puff two puffs but I'm too what a third pop art Bank and so I'm gonna rate dot the high and the effect off that and how high I get right now each pot for two I just can't feel it more hands my eyes are like chain very citrusy that's the last one I'm gonna take you guys to look at me though I am fake G totally so we're getting right this high in effect on this product at 10 as well and we're gonna read it overall fact the fact that ends well so two thumbs up Chris tabs is 420 gelada by C G extracts roof you can see that symbol right there anyways wicked stuff beautiful beautiful product it's got to say all of it all of this distillate whether it's in syringes I got a little bit of bubblegum oh gee at home a little bit of bubblegum oh gee at home and that bubblegum oh gee I'm gonna do a video on it and review it not only is it bubblegum it's bubblegum oh gee that's why I liked it I never knew that bubble gum was bubble gum oh gee it's like Bruce Banner it's really Bruce Banner oh gee comatose is really comatosed oh gee bubblegum oh jeez a good stream tastes really really really a lot like hubba bubba and if I could find some polyethers likely or whatever to mix my distillate syringes into this stuff and you can put it in mix it in a little shot glass and suck it up with the syringe and squirt it in there you can get them on my site for two bucks one of my sites the clean little one CC insulin syringes I just use one of them technically I'd use one of the glass syringes I was using but I want to make sure it was cleaned out good first right I think I'd rather get a brand new syringe even one from the drugstore get a little syringe one for medicine suck it up because you can unscrew these tops right off so I don't go to buy new ones if I was just taking the gram of my bubblegum distillate and making it into a tip but I don't know where to get that stuff there's no dispensaries around here no more maybe I should ask one of my sites if they can get it trying to get him to make Terp sauce good Terp sauce I got good Terp sauce it's good get you baked but it's not the right stuff it looks like melted shatter so I'm not overly you'll see a review of that coming up yeah so yeah this is it nice little peaceful night here's some noises in the background no more at music playing this is just a straight up old school strain review no music just me and the outdoors this how I used to do it when I started I made a lot of my videos with that little table right over there set great here doing hooped I'm prominent a lot of people like I look at him they got v like like what's her name silence tippy I saw it was silent hippie it's silenced sigh lensed et hippie and she has like [ __ ] tons in her own [ __ ] her own temper box her own bongs her own pay everything and the truth that matter is I got way more videos than her I'm gonna get out from this summertime I'm gonna walk a lot with my iPhone walk a lot with my tablet I'm gonna shoot my videos outside I'm gonna probably have to do it with my phone so I can have Internet actually I could just record it on my phone's camera and then upload that to Facebook YouTube when I'm home but uh yeah it's nice to be able to sit here and man that citrusy and minty which makes a wicked it tastes just like to Otto just like the weed identical there right smack on when they make this stuff I've ever had such that sherbert that was that citrusy is this weed it is this this is sunset sherbert tips I just said regular sherbert it was probably oh somehow it got clicked five times and turned off oh so my family's home so I'm gonna end this video for now singing stay medicated stay high but most importantly stay safe ten out of ten cg extracts a lot of peace", "mhQK4MnZa_I": "what's up desert buds Rob here and today we went shopping at a new dispensary so I haven't been to this one but I think I'm gonna start going because it's pretty badass the deals I got it's herbal Wellness Center it's off of Indian School and like 43rd out I think got a couple stickers they gave us this cool phone wallet and when you're a first-time patient they give you these hemp rolling papers which i think is kind of cool and then we got a lighter too so now let's get to what I was really trying to show you guys today so they gate I went and bought a grandma wax right there's our grandma wax they pen extracts and I bought that for like $15 at Grandma wax and I got this for free with it badass vape and cartridge this is the King Louis the 8th og and it says nighttime indica you might be able to see it says each Bay pen cartridge comes prefilled for optimum discretion our discretion and ease of use simply screw the vape and cartridge on to the vape and battery and begin medicated so it comes in this cool plastic you know there it is so the only thing we don't have is a PHA pen battery but it's not like your stickers in there yeah it comes with a sticker so they have to buy one get one free deals because these are normally $40 for a half gram but I'll just wait till they up but I want to get one to go get one go get two so this is battery charger that the vape batteries look like just a USB you screw it in there and that's my battery this one's got a stylus on it and no button so let's try it what's funny as I dropped this battery in the sink where I where I work at I was doing dishes I pulled this out to rip it real quick dropped it right in the sink that day's good it's good like my face is melting instantly mind-fucked babe head and where you're using a different battery so this is actually for a different battery so you've got three products here we've got the bait charger for the move battery and their cartridges we got the urban green house stylus pen battery vape pen cartridge I think this vape pen stuff is like 10 out of 10 [Music] and kind of see the little bubble we already smoked out of there I'm taking four puffs off the same total apparently you can refill these things but yeah that is the vape n King Louie the eighth cartridge guys and stay tuned for more reviews we've got the Phoenix og shatter and that's an indica and we've got some chem dog and hindu kush coming out guys stay tuned", "8tOcvbcqIl0": "yo what is going on youtube welcome back to another banger by your boy savvy g guys man today getting straight into this because this is this is gonna be one of the craziest videos that i've done in a minute okay guys so i have seven disposables right here okay disposables not cartridges all seven different flavors um varying from you know sativas hybrids and indicas we got them all man these are all by a company called lido i have one open right here let me show you guys real quick this one right here is the skywalker og okay this thing right here man is phenomenal i've been using it if you guys have been seeing my videos i have been puffing on it for the past couple of like i want to say maybe two or three weeks almost coming up on a month now and man do these get me faded every single time that i use them okay so what we're gonna do man what i have planned for today's agenda guys i got seven of them so i was thinking man why not go ahead and taste test every single one of them but with a blinker okay yeah we're gonna be taking blinkers off of all seven of these and we're just gonna be giving you guys a taste test alright so we got blue dream we got straw anna we got gelato we got maui wowie this hand we got strawberry cough skywalker og and purple punch so it is quite a variety of flavors boys and damn i'm ready to get into this okay so the first one that i have actually popped out right here for myself this one is the skywalker og i've actually been puffing on it so let me just go ahead and take one blinker so i give you guys the full rundown on this cheers yeah that is so good dude this premium distillate is just so far you guys know i'm a fan of distillate just because i like the flavor mostly you know when it comes to live resident things i'm not really too much of a fan of it but when it comes to discipline i always feel like companies especially as this one litto they do a fire job man i just being able to provide you some high quality distillate and man this is one of the newer ones in a disposable i usually rock cartridges but now the disposables are i feel like they're the new wave man they've been a lot more convenient to me than a cartridge and a battery just because i mean it's just one single-handed device you know you don't got to be carrying all that other stuff but all right so too much rambling let's get into the flavor review okay so the skywalker og phenomenal you get that earthy tones you get the smack you in the face og and it's just phenomenal man off of the first blinker yeah it's just so good i could probably keep hitting this skywalker og for me is one of my favorites of all time so yeah skywalker og tastes exactly like skywalker og next up on the list we got the maui and go ahead and open that up for you guys pull this sucker out so this one right here is a sativa if you guys don't know so i haven't smoked a lot of sativas lately and i'm kind of excited to try this one so cheers [Music] oh that one is so smooth bro holy crap usually sativas are a lot more smoother than indicas and hybrids but this one was flavorful it tasted let me catch my breath for a second and it tasted i can't really pinpoint um describe what it tastes like but it tastes kind of like a fruity cocktail nothing fake it just comes it just smells it smell all right it tastes like a bowl of fruit loops that's what i'm kind of getting an apple jack something like that i'm not too sure but you get really really fruity notes in this and it's actually a smackers man that just got me a little bit more elevated so maui wowie a little bit more on the fruity side but fire next up on the list we got another indica guys this is right here the purple punch purple bunch for me is one of those flavors that you just cannot mess up man and if you mess it up it just says a lot about your brand but purple punch you always get those sweet grapey little fruity notes and that's what i'm hoping for today so third blinker in man we're only three blinkers in and i'm faded already like it's not a crazy faded but yeah i could definitely feel the head change okay so number three we got purple punch indica uh you guys know me i love indigo's cheer um cheers dude i felt like that that that blinker took a look a little bit longer holy crap the flavor profile literally i just died after that blinker right there but it's all good i just had to go get some water because my throat was dry so that flavor profile guys it tastes it kind of reminds me like a stizzy purple punch it kind of reminds me like it they give it this hawaiian punch taste i don't know if you guys know the drink the red one the hawaiian punch but that's kind of what it tastes like to me without a doubt the high on this purple punch is it's smacking me i'm literally still recovering from it so going in on number four guys i'm literally just getting so baked right now we got the gelato this one is a hybrid so hopefully it doesn't smack me in the face too hard you know just pop it out the packaging give it give it a little sniff this time try to see if it smells like anything it doesn't really smell like anything yeah you can't really smell anything so let's just go in on the fourth hit a gelato hybrid let me give you guys a little bit of more of a close-up of the battery i know some of you are probably wondering yo that design is freaking sick bro why haven't you showed us a close-up and i'm just like man i was just trying to get high bro so there goes another little close-up for you guys very very sleek you can see that little that little line in the middle that's the oil it's very very sick so going in number four or five i don't know i don't even i forgot i already lost count so we got the gelato all right guys blinker time baby yo if you guys are hitting my bad my bad if you guys are enjoying the video so far let's try to smash over 700 likes okay we got seven different pods right here seven different disposables i mean so 700 likes just kind of seems you know on point so going in on gelato cheers [Music] okay okay that that was actually really freaking good that was super milky and cloudy i got a fat rip i remember guys with every different strain i feel like you get different hits because with different strains i guess the yield output the oil how it is it's not always going to be the same so sometimes you'll get you know less milky clouds sometimes you'll get really milky clouds it all depends on the strain but oh my goodness that was fire that literally tasted on point gelato like literally topped it and that was smacked me in my face i'm literally gonna die right now but i'm trying hard not to i know you guys can hear in the voice but we're gonna keep our cool we're gonna keep our cooler after four down we got three left boys we're going ham we're going him so next up i think i'm going with the sativa because i need a little light break from the heavy-hitting indigos and hybrids because honestly i feel like sometimes when they say hybrid or this one by the way is the blue dream sometimes when they say like hybrids i feel like eighty percent of the time it comes out to be a little bit more heavy on the indica side all right so a little bit run down so far we're four in and so far all the flavors are pretty smacking man i can't really complain that there's something that i can't smoke because so far i've been able to smoke them and at ease and i'm pretty sure if i continue to smoke those flavors throughout the day i wouldn't even mind it so next up on the list we got the blue dream sitting in at number five how many of you guys like blue dream let me know down in the comments below old school strain cheers boys hmm i'm sorry if you hear me smack it but i'm just trying to taste this that actually tastes phenomenal i can't i can't describe what it tastes like but it tastes like what a blue would taste like [Music] well that's so weird to say guys but it literally tastes like if the color blew like like just gave out a taste like that's so weird to you know kind of comprehend you know how do you even taste the color but like like a blueberry i guess you can say man it has like a blueberryish taste to it it's it's very very subtle but it's fire this one oh my goodness it has a very earthy taste to it too but it has the blueberry hint of sweetness and wow that actually surprised me so number five blue dream blinker fire literally see it in my eyes dude and my expression in the way that i talk that how faded i am i have not taken like this many blinkers in a row in forever bro like literally this is some [ __ ] i used to do when i used when i first started you know chief in cartridges it's crazy so i feel like a kid again i feel like a kid again so next up we got the straw nana hybrid i'm i'm i'm powering through this boys so quick little insider on this these actually are one gram pods okay they're not point fifty point twenty five you know usually disposables i don't know why companies put point 45.30 like bro like what am i supposed to do with point 30 like what am i supposed to do with that like take like three freaking hits and i'm done like you know like at least give me like half a gram but i don't know companies are wilding so first time i've ever seen a one gram disposable which is pretty freaking dope so straw nana man i am faded guys i am sorry i am sorry here man i got the dab sweats i don't know if you guys could see it on my shirt maybe in my armpits but i'm literally not drenched but i'm almost there guys because of these these dab sweats guys that's how hard these are hitting okay so straw nana enough of the stalling let's go okay so right now i think the issue that i'm having is that my mouth is very very my tongue at least you know my taste buds are just filled with so many different types of disposables that i can't even tell at this point but i did get a good hint of straw like strawberry i didn't get a hint of like banana too much but you do get that strawberry and now that i'm exhaling i'm getting it in like my like the back of my nostrils i guess you could say i get a get a strong sense of like strawberry but it's this is definitely a hybrid you could tell this is a perfect 50 50 because i didn't feel like i got higher but i also didn't feel like i got like you know like jittery so this is a good this is some good stuff man so next up i'm actually glad that i that i um i'm trying this so uh next up last one but not least guys i'm faded off my ass six blinkers in we got the strawberry cough that's that's all on this last one man strawberry couldn't have ended it with a better dessert guys while i personally love strawberry cough it is a sativa for those of you that don't know but i don't even think it matters at this point because i'm just so high like in my eyes like i don't know how i'm even gonna edit this video today probably gonna have to wait till the next day that's probably you guys probably aren't gonna see it upload until the next day we'll see we'll see so going in on number seven okay oh by the way i forgot to give the review to that one i just forgot it was oh yeah actually i did give the review you know that's how you know i'm high guys i'm forgetting about doing things that i already did so going on the last one we got the strawberry cough okay [Music] cheers dude what was that that thing did not stop i don't know if it was just in my head but i think i counted more than 10 seconds but i was literally power lunging it i had no more air in my lungs i promise you that was more than 10 seconds either way we killed it it actually tasted pretty good i i did taste strawberry again didn't taste too much stuff because i was dying but for the most part that was just a hitter bro seven blinkers in a row guys i'm gone look at my eyes i can't believe this so we're gonna go ahead and edit this out here we actually did the challenge all flavors were phenomenal i if you guys enjoyed today's video do me a favor leave a big like it helps push out to the algorithm and you know comment i try to respond to everybody if you guys have any questions let me know and last but not least hit that subscribe button alright i'll catch you guys on the next one", "PvqNwla4YIc": "what is on canna fam and welcome back to another product review video so check it out guys for this video I have here a 1 gram cartridge here by Northwest kind and this is a 1 gram cartridge distillate I believe it's a distillate it actually I can't find anywhere on the package to confirm this but I'm almost like 99% sure this is a distillate ok so let's just go with that anyway so this is by Northwest kind this is gorilla snacks alright the gorillas hungry and this is his neck ok and this is coming in at a 88 percent THC so not [ __ ] bad that's almost in the 90s that's pretty damn good ok I had a little to know CBD ok doesn't say anything here about terpenes so I can't give you guys that information unfortunately but hey 88 percent THC not bad I'll take it alright so the gorilla snacks 100% cannabis extract and we're gonna go ahead and pull this out here does it say no it doesn't even say on there so I was just checking to see if it said distillate or co2 or something like that alright gonna set that in there so we don't lose it and this is our cartridge what do you guys think I pull that little rubber end off there let me see if I can get up a better view for you guys like this come on there we go look at that there we go nice shot there BAM very nice cartridge if I don't say so myself very nice color got their logo on it got the Cannabis thing on there I'm gonna say right off the bat before I try this and get into more of the review I kind of don't like that that kind of throws me off already the fact that this has got like that's not a sticker usually it's a sticker you can peel it off and whatnot but I mean I guess you could I guess you could sit here and kind of scrape it off see how I'm doing right there you can kind of if you really want to my only issue with that when they actually print it on the cartridge like that is one of the main reasons that we purchase these carts is for the discreteness okay this is because it's discrete people you know we can have these out kind of in public even though we're not supposed to and kind of just you know take our hits kind of get our medicine and stuff like that as we need throughout the day but when you have something like that that's like permanently printed on there it takes the discreet away you could be sitting here hitting this thing somebody looks over sees that logo and they're like oh oh oh you smell good way oh my god get him you know what I mean like I'm just saying like I just one of the big things about this for me at least I know for a lot of other people is the fact that you know they're discreet okay so and that kind of takes it away from me so I'm just gonna throw that out there that's just kind of my one negative so far with this but anyway this is a normal 510 thread okay so it's gonna fit most standard batteries okay which I have right here nice battery here this one screws in it's not a plug in at the bottom it's got the different two different temperature settings on it and we just screw this on ever so easy just like that we'll pay mo all right so here we go now off for me I usually do to hit hit too long hits off this okay so I'll hold the button down for 10 seconds until it flashes then I you know hold it again another 10 seconds so about 20 second draw okay that's what I like now for you I don't recommend that if you know you're somebody who can't handle a good amount of smoke then I would recommend maybe just doing the 10 seconds just the normal one time draw but for me I have to do it two times so here we go this is the gorilla snacks by Northwest kind much-loved guys thank you for watching my video [Music] well I say wow because I didn't have to actually hold the button down twice you see that cloud this this is good cart this is a good cart good cart a little bit of a cough to it but hey good cart tastes good I definitely get that gorilla glue that kind of like stinky gorilla glue you know what I mean like that it's really good I really like it it's not super pungent it's not like mouth watering turps okay it's not gonna mmm - so good you know it's not like that okay it's just mild it's a mild flavor on the terpenes you get it it's not all there like it could be but you still get something okay highs pretty good we're gonna go for round two on this now really quick I have my temperature setting because this has three different temperatures on it Green being the lowest blue being medium and red being the highest temp I have it set on blue so this is a medium temp it gives me a good enough hit without that you know if you put it on red and you kind of get like a nasty taste to it it kind of feels like a burnt taste you know what I mean and so I feel like blue is the safest bet because you still get a good big hit and yet you still taste the terpenes you still all that now if you want to get the full spectrum of those terpenes if you want to get the full flavor then I would recommend probably going to the green setting if you don't mind sacrificing a little bit of your smoke you know cuz it will be a smaller cloud of smoke that I highly recommend going to the green set okay but anyway I'm on the blue set we're in the middle all right here we go [Music] [Music] that's pretty good got a little kick to it I like it I'm a big fan of like guerrilla glue or guerilla snacks or Scooby Snacks or anything like that so this was right up my alley this was $36 recreationally here in the state of Oregon for this gram cartridge this is a full gram cartridge for only $36 here in the state of Oregon of course if your medical you're going to get it cheaper and I highly recommend it I really do I mean I really really do this gets two big thumbs up with me and let me tell you why even though even though it was lacking on the turkeys it was still there it's not like there was none you still got them they're just not like super pungent okay the fact that it's $36 for a full gram let me say that again $36 for a full gram okay that is amazing the fact that it's eighty-eight percent THC you can take a hit or two off this thing and actually feel it it actually feel it it's got a good high it's got a good nice relaxing high to it I could definitely see me like taking several hits of this before bed or something like that or before I need to like relax because it's definitely making me like just one eye just chill just just chill so I like it that's why all right the only thing the only thing that I really don't like about this is the fact that that's printed on right there I don't like that I really don't it takes away from it being discreet okay if I'm like somewhere you know outside of somewhere do you know a weight and smoking my [ __ ] bait pen and somebody looks over somebody who's not cool with cannabis or whatever you know some uptight [ __ ] sees this and then BOOM oh he's smoking in public you know what I mean and so I feel like - should be taken away okay part of the reason people buy these carts is because they're discreet you know they're easy to use they're discreet if you're somebody who travels a lot if you're somebody who's on the go if you're somebody who likes to go out and see nature while they get stoned stuff like that then these carts are gonna be perfect for you they're easy to handle they're very easy to maneuver they don't really have malfunctions most of the time okay if you get the good carts anything like in my opinion anything thirty-five dollars or so and up here in the state of Oregon not speaking for other states but here in Oregon and they say anything thirty-five dollars and up should be a good cart and I'm talking about the actual cart not the product inside should be a good cart okay anything lower than that you're gonna probably have malfunction problems okay I've had the $25.00 carts and I ended up sucking the whole gram through it got all over my teeth and mouth it sucked it sucked okay I tell you guys you don't want dabs in your mouth and on your teeth it sucks so just keep that in mind okay that's just a little bit of a advice when you go cart shopping and I would highly recommend picking this one okay that's what does the videos about so check out the gorilla smacks by Northwest kind let me

guys all have a great day or night wherever you're viewing this video from much love [Music] this potion oh thanks prey dumb [ __ ] go away how we salad clowns around it", "n5ROJIhOLUA": "[Music] all right here we go guys a little delayed this time i wasn't feeling the magic uh when the box arrived and i wanted to come in and give you guys my uh full enthusiasm so to speak but here we are this is my august box uh you notice from the outside it's back to the sort of default uh nut club box design unlike uh pride month which was the last box okay so you know nothing unusual here we've got our no club box arrived with all the items in it and along with that came my add-ons so adam's at the end netflix box right now let's get into it [Music] okay rolling tri-related puns staging okay enjoy the goodies meet the brands cute angelic music um i i love ned clubs cute little semi-psychedelic halfway to a cow sort of vibe um and thank goodness got all the cards this time if you watch my last video you'd know they um only included this guy their social justice initiatives card uh talking about their donations to campaign zero and critical resistance and uh transgender district in sf so good to see it uh some people get their boxes every other month so included it again love to see it um they've got a sweepstakes this time if you have a nutclub box you can enter uh by posting a picture to instagram and tagging them and some friends and then you get your next box for a dollar so that's fun and the last of the boring stuff uh hey sexy math squares what the prices speak for themselves so this is an advert for their add-on program this is once you've ordered the box and bought your membership then you have the chance to add stuff on that will be delivered with your box in the following month but you get that wholesale discount of like 50 so um for instance they've got an eighth here magic lemons uh retail price 75 48 off 39 so yeah close closer to the kind of uh you know prices you'd expect to see discount at a dispensary uh they even have a 19.8 on here i believe um so those are great i love those if you purchase a high volume of stuff um in any given month that's a real key feature because this can save you some serious money all right now without any more ado the products in the box this box um feels like it has less stuff in it i know it doesn't i think it's just they're all more compact containers um kind of give you a view of everything in there i'm gonna take it nice and easy but vape cartridge battery disposable vape pre-rolls an eighth and an eighth walk through one by one um i know a lot of people keep asking me to be more explicit about the flower so i'm gonna start there and we're gonna take a real close look at it so strap in first up cheech's stash all right in this really cute purple container because it's an indica the strain is wetting pie and it is clocked in at 29 thc point two percent cbd so this is really pushing the limits of how strong you can get flour without treating it after the fact with any sort of um additive adulterant that kind of thing so before i open it up let me just get my hands off of it let me take a look at it alright so pop this guy open [Music] so the first thing i noticed about this besides it's really potent uh sort of dank not quite gasoline more like cheese sort of smell to it but you have to reach in you know pick out the big nugs well there's only big nugs i got one two and then the third one i pulled apart when i first opened it up because i was taking a look at it a little bit closer look at this now if you guys can see there it's got really well defined fine orange hairs and they're coming out of some dark greenish um leaf structure with really really really frosty undersides i mean it literally looks like it's coated in sugar or something um no hydration pack in this container i mean just clear glass but it's really nicely cured i mean this stuff is uh see if you can hear this look there's no snap or you know uh crumbling it's it's sticky i'm getting i'm getting stuff all over my hands trying to break it apart here so i think this should be good for a while to come and at 29 um it's going to be really something i'm looking forward to trying it i might even end up sort of cutting it with uh another strain that i have some leftovers of that's a little on the dry side so that's a tip for you guys if you get stuff like this which comes so fresh that it's it's it's on the moist side and it seems like it's hard to spark up you might want to mix it with some of your older flower especially so anything you've left a pre-ground in the grinder for a little while uh play nicely with this child safety lock there sorry about that all right so that's cheech's stash indica keep a clean workspace here we didn't get any info on those guys um so i'm gonna assume it's actually associated with cheech marin of cheech and chong but i don't know that for a fact so i don't know two tbd and then our other one was just the one that caught my eye because it's enormous um tradecraft farms from los angeles with this really cute um minimalist sort of design right like it's like a like a pig or a dog or something i don't know it's adorable but as you can see it's kind of an oversized packaging and inside of that is a normal sized container um it's got a really nice wooden top seems very custom um i mean i'm sure there's an easy way to make those but it's different i love seeing things that are different um and it's a really intense tamper-proof seal but as you can see i already tampered with it and the seal's still there so take from that which you will okay um information's on the outer box right this is spray tan number seven clocking at eighteen percent uh thc and twenty 21 total cannabinoids 0 cbd so they're measuring a higher percentage of non-cbd cannabinoids you know i don't know if that's like thc delta 8 or that you know whatever the new hot ones to have are but that's interesting that should lead to uh less of a tolerance effect with other strains right thc tolerance stays pretty consistent but the chance to try different cannabinoids means a chance to experience some new and novel effects all right let's open this guy up all right wooden top and this was actually um tamper sealed as well when i first opened it um so once again first thing you notice compared to this other one no attempt to keep it uh big nugs all right it's trimmed it's a good product but lots of small pieces all right so there's one we'll sort of shake some out over here all right so you can see this is much darker in color than even the indica um over there it doesn't have the same kind of really developed orange hairs at least on the outside i don't know if it's a product of how it's trimmed or the actual flower but very sticky very frosty visible trichome kind of stuff super fresh smells a lot more like pine salt earthy kind of what you'd expect from a sativa despite its really really rich color so break that open for you guys alright so this is um i mean they're bad in a thousand for me with the flower product they deliver i have enjoyed every single strain they brought me i'm pretty easy to please because i'm mostly using the vapes for fault something really strong but in terms of the product showing up being smokable and of good potency uh every night club one has been great i like them a lot so i'm gonna trust them on this one um [Music] interesting like i said about the relatively low thc percentage right 18 here 29 over here all right so very strong very high quality product nothing wrong at 18 but it just goes to show you the range of stuff you can get this guy back in his house okay now the last flower-based product before we hop into the vapes we have these adorable tiny little containers lola lola which is one of my brands that i have materials for we're here to help you feel good contrary to what some believe lola lola was not in fact created by two women named lola in actuality the bran was born in 2015 from the minds and hearts of a father son and lifelong family friend who shared a deep rooted belief in the healing power of cannabis and a desire to tear down the stigma associated with its use um they don't actually go on to explain why it's called lolu lola um which i wasn't curious until they told me why it wasn't um but yeah healing power of cannabis um feel good live inspired very positive very cute um good colors you know pink sky blue bubbly uh makes me happy makes me happy to see all right let me move this aside for now so you can see here i got two of these and they're pretty short they were i don't call them flavors but they've got varieties this one is rated as transcend and this orange guy is trance and they also have your typical uh stickers with qr codes on them with all the deets so i already tried transcend um i popped this guy open smoked this maybe a week ago they're .65 grams they're very small um i'll probably open up this other one just so you guys can look at what i'm talking about normally the pre-rolls that come in the nug club box have been your sort of industry standard one gram long cone looking uh pre-rolls on like king-sized papers they varied in potency but they've all been the same size now these guys aren't as big like i said they're 0.65 grams so a little more than half the size but but their hook here is they're infused with cold water hash now i don't actually know if that's a technical term in terms of production or origin um sounds pleasant all right no chemicals cold water hash i don't know um you can see here it's got the variety and the brand on a nice little sticker trance in this case child safety locked and a real small little guy right like that's that's a third just a crutch there um but like i said i sparked this up last week and it hit me as hard as any one gram pre-roll ever has between the hash and what i assume is a pretty high quality product in there they're actually only listed 26 thc so that's less than we're seeing from this really potent indica we got but very high in general for cannabis so sort of interesting balancing act to bear infusing the hash instead of using maybe the most potent strains i'm sure they have their reasons uh like i said the transcend one excellent i've no reason to expect any less from this one trance um but both of them purporting to be very active creative good time spacey high uh the sort of sativa vibe right not a not a couch locked sort of moment and i certainly felt that with uh the transcend so we're getting closer to the day where they can really tell you what it's going to be like when you smoke it because if you've been smoking for a while you know what they say it's going to do isn't always what it does and that's just individual and product variability okay let's look at the last two things which are all vape products i'm just going to pop them out and get this box out of my way [Music] okay okay okay all right here we go first one's easy buy good vape an all-in-one vape pen with what they call full spectrum amber oil um i assume that relates to its color but uh as you can see it's not translucent so i'll have to take their word for the amber portion of that now this listed on the box as a hybrid for focus and inspiration and on the legally required sticker it's gelato half gram 73 thc 77 percent cannabinoids so we've got like four percent other cannabinoids nine percent terpenes one milligram cbd so with the exception of i talked about last month like this basito disposable which is i think 20 cbd this is what you're more likely to see from these all-in-one um these all-in-one vapes right it's very straightforward you can't see into it if you could there'd be a battery and then some sort of small tank here um you just draw on it to make it happen and the key with these guys is not to inhale too quickly they don't have a lot of juice and they need all of it to last as long as possible so you want to drag nice and slow off of it to give the heating element time to actually vaporize stuff until you cool it by bringing more air over it um so ease of use i mean 10 out of 10 design nothing game changing i mean it's sort of like what they used to call ciga likes um it just looks like a long skinny cigarette that's blue but the product's good i really enjoyed it um it's the first one i went to that would be my tip for you if you end up purchasing a box or any kind of similar bulk order like this these all-in-one vapes they uh they're just limited in the size of battery that they can actually you know hold so the battery is racing against the clock it's dying on you from the minute you get it um and storing it when it gets too hot or too cold or not using it for a long time like there's a lot of things that can wear down its life and in my experience if you don't get to these pretty soon after they're delivered you run the risk of them maybe running out of juice before you've used all the product and without doing some serious reverse engineering it's hard to get the product back out even if you have another device that maybe could use it so that's my only thoughts on this style in general this one i mean i really liked it it's still chugging away two two weeks now after i opened it and i'm definitely more than halfway through uh the product so working well so far working well so far and then the most eye-catching of everything i got a battery and a cartridge by zofo all right take a look at these they're really attractive packaging right it's orange it's bright it reflects the light and has these sort of like whimsical clouds moving on them and both of these are very inviting packages just to pick up and be like how am i gonna open this this one had a sticker on the bottom which already peeled away but it's locked if you'll see by the sort of twin mechanism on the back and it says press so press these two pinch this inside here voila slides open i already put this guy together so it's not resting in there but that's the packaging um it's pretty cute first class cannabis um the taking flight metaphor is continuous it literally says take fight on the box and they don't let you forget it this is listed as jack herrera which is a sativa and i don't actually give a percentage they just give the amount that's fun uh 455 milligrams of thc plus cbd okay so that's the cartridge this guy here it's got a really cute little tail a ribbon pull that open it up and here is the product right it's a battery like any other but it uh it's definitely like metal aluminum i would assume it's got a usb charger and it's got some you know clear channels cut in the side that are for looking at the cartridge itself which is very attractive clear cartridge jack hair on one side warning label on the other orange tip just protecting it that's that's a rubber all right so this guy and it buzzes i don't know if you guys caught that there is a button down at the bottom which also lights up buzzes at you now on the box they give themselves credit calling it haptic feedback which it is but i mean let's not get too excited it buzzes uh in response to things uh so like i said the button's right there it's very small if i touch it a light up and this is just an on off button uh your typical five clicks then it blinks and it's off and now yeah no light up no smoke safely stowed away kid safe all that thing um you want to use it again five clicks power powers up don't touch the button to make it work just inhale now this uh jack hair they have here very very um lemony citrusy pine um i gotta charge this i think it's it's uh undercharged it just came straight out of the box uh i'm surprised it even turned on but uh yeah it's it's a really easy to use vape it's it's got all of the functionality of one of these just inhale you know and go no buttons click every time but it can also be turned off and of course it's rechargeable it's really slick looking size wise it's a little oversized compared to something like the uno by chemistry right put it side by side um but but only by a little bit right like these are very very similar in size now um hook is ultra premium thc oils in their purest form right industry experts years of engineering unrivaled hardware full spectrum thc oils zero additives zero cutting agents zero bleaching agents um that's sort of funny i haven't heard of that before i don't know if that's a thing that could really happen or if they're just trying to scare me but um purity over everything is their slogan uh it looks like a race car so it's certainly not uh discrete right like you're not gonna throw this in uh with some pencils and pens and it and a usb drive and it disappears this guy uh this this stands out um but like i said it's it's weighty it's made of metal it's nice it's it's a nice little thing so that is the final lineup right we've got two pre-rolls two vapes two eighths that's a symmetry this week very nice like i said it it feels like less than previous weeks um because i don't think there's much difference between the items and i'm getting used to seeing these and maybe you guys are too um but at the same time it's a good haul it was you know 100 dollars tax 120 and then i get my add-ons and the savings on my add-ons start to really increase the value of this for me because just by itself i mean this isn't a game-changing amount of product for the price but the chance to find new stuff try new stuff uh play with these cute little boxes i mean that's worth it to me uh now some of you want to get your own your first box eighty dollars hundred dollars after tax twenty dollars off use my code and then i also get one for twenty off and that starts to get fun so you haven't considered it do you've already considered it maybe it's time to pull the trigger i don't know um okay so that's everything from the box that they curated for me um let's look at some of my add-ons i curated for myself let's do this brown paper bag delivered same day same time same person as my nuke club box which was first friday in august actually a little ways ago now i picked up three products this week um all of them vape products i mainly vape at this point um easier you can do it inside you know there's a lot of reasons to go for it that's what i do so that's what i focused on all right one of these seen before chemistry cannabis oil pod for the uno device right one of these guys now nug only stocks two of their flavors i don't know if they make more flavors um or if these are the only ones that they get the bulk discount on but circled back i got huckleberries which is the first one i ever tried i tried the other flavor last time both of them are really nice they're cute with the rainbow for full spectrum they have a very very detailed list of terpenes cannabinoids and you know who knows what else going on there um as i learn more about what these mean maybe that will be more and more exciting to me but for now more interesting information it is a hybrid from humboldt paradise punch x z oh skittles um yeah so i like this one i like the product a lot i like how um easily it's delivered how good it tastes and how rapidly uh it can give you sort of a creative head buzz right so i'm probably gonna be ordering this almost every month as an add-on uh these two are new i haven't tried them before this one i've tried this brand before saunder and i uh it's a 510 threaded cartridge um i don't know what special thing they do to it but i really liked it it felt good it felt uh sort of balanced i didn't get a lot of anxiety for the amount of euphoria i got using it very very happy with the way that went also listed as full spectrum a lot of these are listed as full spectrum rainbow flame is the strain it's a hybrid you can see the package is this sort of like delightful yellow the one i tried was an indica and it was a sort of dark blue in the same way um really fun textured multi-textured package yeah we've got our legal requirements on the bottom but slide this guy open there's no child safety sort of mechanisms on this one just sun grown in mendocino brief instructions on how to screw it in to your battery and our cartridge it's very dark colored oil all right a california sticker on there an s for saunder one of these nice white uh hard plastic tips uh i like these a lot they don't seem to attract as much grime as some of the cheaper ones yeah so half gram of that got it for 50 off tried a different flavor of this previously and excited to give this one a go all right and last but not least is this refined live resin by raw garden in a really really tiny tiny uh container here i mean it's the same size as this one from saunder but um it's almost like a little tiny like cigarette carton it's got a it's got a nice rectangularity to it um i already popped this open to give it a try and put it on this uh 510 put a battery by eureka that i already have so if you see this one it's it's um a really bright yellow green compared to like the saunder was like dark and brown amber almost i guess which is probably what that uh all in one vape look like i don't know what the definition of live resin is what they did to it that's different listed as 100 fresh frozen whole flower terpenes in cannabis oil and strain is key lime cookies 82 thc less than 2 percent cbd so i've already given this one a try i like it a lot a lot a lot i almost wish there was more cbd in it because like any heavy strain um if i take a puff too many off of this it can sort of throw me for a loop and end up in my head a little bit more than i meant to but in general as something that uh sort of lifts up your creativity and mood and you know brightens your day so to speak it's it's good for that it's it's very light it tastes not strong at all it's very neutral i would say actually so those are my three add-ons um two that will work with you know any 510 thread battery and one of the pods for this guy uh these come in kind of a cute container that looks like a little pill container i'll hold that up for you guys um it's child proof to the point that if i try and open it in camera i never get it open so i'm not going to all right so this is what i chose for my add-ons and like i said i saved 50 on each of these um you can't get the add-ons unless you already got the box so obviously the savings skew towards higher volume purchasers but if you're the kind of person who likes having a variety of apes or goes through stuff really quickly or even smokes a whole lot of flour i can't recommend enough the chance to like try out all these like fun new products and you know open the box and and see what's in it um it's been a good time every time it's been a good time knowing you guys are watching so thanks for making it this far take a look at the link in the video description if you'd like to get your own box for some discount and like or subscribe my videos if you want to see me keep doing this or maybe you don't want to see me keep

to do it so there it is so I have two honeycomb car cards cartridges and um yeah I spoke these a couple hours ago and these really didn't I thought hey you should probably review of these so let's start off with them the packaging right here so this is what the package looks like and as you can see this is its THC level and I think each of these cartridges had the same THC level eighty-three percent THC and 32 percent CBD and I would definitely recommend you to check out their Instagram they post um everything there and yeah I have indica zoo keys just do this one I'm just different flavors um sorry I want to say it Maui Wowi sativa and like I said same THC please follow their Instagram the show they always update their news and cartridges and yeah so let me just open them out

are really good yeah how'd you smoke this like a couple minutes ago I'm not gonna smoke this but ya get the idea these are really good and um actually before I go like I said check their Instagram

right they'll do the deed over one gram too so yeah definitely keep in mind in that this is um well should I just drop but um it's just my review and um yeah in conclusion I think these are really

"_vGVnBIqGV8": "[Music] hey guys Phil here from got vape when I first started vaping I would always leave my batteries and cartridges inside of my car because I couldn't take them to work and then when I came back from work I would always have leaky batteries leaky cartridges and that was really before I looked into proper maintenance of my oil cartridges so today I wanted to share a few tips I've learned along the way that I'll help you get the most out of your oil cartridge oil cartridges are great great for my producing they preserve your contents for a lot longer like most devices it's the small things that go a long way save you time save you money frustration but you don't want to take advantage of this by refilling new oils in the same oil cartridge do not fill your cartridge more than twice why is this bad to do well if you keep refilling the same cartridge over and over again it can cause leaking clogging lots of paper production thick oils will begin to harden on the wick and you won't be able to vape new oils properly stuck in an endless loop pulsing for good drawls and there's a special circular inhale for things like that especially you'll burn the cotton and the oils and once that happens even the best tasting oils they won't be able to mask it I like to think of it like oil in a car you wouldn't want to change your oil too often without changing your filter and the cotton inside of your atomizer is like the filter in your car you can go and get new oil but without changing the filter you never really have clean oil don't do what I did and leave your cartridges inside of your car or any hot place for that matter I know it might be convenient but for most you out there a good rule of thumb is heat bad cold good high temperatures can not only degrade the oil taste and potency but it can cause leaking the best places to store your oil vapes are cool dry dark places like a desk drawer or a refrigerator put the rubber plug back onto the bottom of the cartridge and start it ideally in a dark place around 70 degrees Fahrenheit or less but don't go too far to the extreme to the other side when stored in the freezer because that can create moisture inside of the cartridge so avoid heat and avoid freezers but now when you take your cartridge out of the fridge the oils gonna be thick and all thick oils need to be primed first priming your new oil cartridge is going to make the difference between the first hit being smooth and magical or dry and burn the nasty teetsi oil is thick so you need to give it some time to soak into the atomizer here's how to do it make sure your oils are at room temperature if they're fresh out of the fridge pull the cartridge in between your palms for about two to three minutes to warm it up if you're loading an empty cartridge only fill it with a small amount so if you run into problems you don't waste all your oil take about five polls on the cartridge without the battery being attached what you're doing is simulating vaping and pulling a little oil from the atomizer then attach the cartridge to the battery and give it a try I recommend pulsing the battery here it's the best way to ensure that you're not burning your oils if it's still too cold go back and warm it up and then try it again so there you have it guys those are the main ways to get the most out of your oil cartridge dont refill it more than twice always prime your new coils and always keep them in a cool dark place to prevent it from leaking on you keep in mind that not all cartridges have wigs some only come with ceramic or glass cores it's your responsibility to know what you're buying it's always smart to clean the bottom of the cartridge before storing it with cotton swabs or alcohol wipes that way when you take the rubber cap back off you can see if it's leaked hopefully these tips helped you guys where do you personally store your cartridges if you have any other questions leave them in the comments below let us know subscribe to god vape for more videos like this thanks for watching peace", "J39T5d0_-pI": "[Music] all right guys what is going on you should boil Serena's back I

yeah [Music]", "Bk1KABHZhgA": "hi moaners welcome back to my channel if you're new here my name is rose today's video will be about my very first vape a review and yeah CBD FX vape kit so I ordered it it came fast delivery was kind of fast I did receive this on Friday the 10th so I've had it for almost a week now this is the kit it came in just a regular brown box very discreet it didn't have CBD or anything like that on the outside packaging which is good in case you know you didn't want anyone in your business but yeah so let me go ahead and tell you what came with the kit it came in this box again like little magnetic so this is the vapor the charger and then the cartridge it came with two magnets and this is what it looks like I absolutely love it it's very small it fits in like the palm of my hand perfectly I love love how little it is yeah and it's it's heavy it's it feels very solid and high-quality I do really enjoy that so again in the package it came with the vape and then this cartridge here pulls out it does have that magnet that came with it on the bottom in the USB cord to charge it just plugs into like your computer or like laptop or something to charge I did get a free hand sanitizer okay and I actually really enjoyed this hand sanitizer it's very lightweight like it doesn't make you sticky or anything it smells real like alcoholic like clean so I do actually really like this little freebie here I keep it on my desk and so that's what came with the kit I did have to order actual separate CBD oil and so this is the one I chose just a regular 60 milligram and this is how it looks it comes with like a little dropper which is very convenient because when filling the cartridge there's a little fill line that you would have to fill it up to so the dropper makes it very easy again since I've had it since the 10th so I probably have used it almost every day except for today probably like five six puffs a day it does definitely relax me and again I only have a sixty milligram I'm very very new to all of this vaping and things like that stay tuned to the end of the video to see exactly what kind of persuade me to get a vape and try it again I'm not a smoker I don't smoke cigarettes I don't smoke weed so this is all new to me so yeah let me go ahead and set some out of oil let me go ahead and show you on camera how easy it is to fill it so I'm gonna go ahead and open the oil and it's so like the taste of this oil it doesn't have this is not a flavored oil they do have a bunch of flavors and I'm definitely going to go ahead and order them now that I've tried this I've watched reviews and I'm gonna I'm gonna list below the guy that actually did the review that um he was so dope I can't remember his name humble smoke stay high something like that but I listed below he was amazing he did a review on the same kit and he was part of the reason why I was like you know what I'm definitely gonna try it but back to this oil this is not flavored it's just I don't really know what it is I guess it's original but um it's 60 milligrams it does they do have different milligrams let me slow down it they do have different milligrams 120 to 5500 in them like a thousand I heard the milligrams make it stronger so again I'm a beginner so I started with sixty but this oil here it's so light on my mouth like I don't even know this it's so light in like it's like kind of refreshing um yeah it's kind of refreshing and it doesn't burn my throat which is a big plus for me because that's part of the reason why I don't smoke weed marijuana just because it burns my throat usually I don't like it but anyway so with this oil it's really light and refreshing it definitely does call me again I will be definitely ordering some more flavors as well as higher milligrams just to test it out so let's get back to go ahead and refill this again it does have a fill line real quick tip fill it under the fill line because when you insert this back into the glass here it it you know expands so it will overflow if you fill it too much so tip is fill it under the actual fill line so here's the dropper just gonna go ahead and pay attention to the fill line and it it smells it smells real clean like I don't even know how to explain it I absolutely love it so I do do recommend this here alright so I filled it here and then you put this the mouthpiece right in here and screw it on it's that easy and when I first got it all I had to do was add the little magnet and do the same thing so you go ahead and screw it add it back in here and there you go so with this the reason why I got the handheld versus the pen being a beginner you would think you'd want to start with the pen I don't like the way I hold like blunts or cigarettes I've you know as a young young kid I tried one sticker in my life almost died I've smoked a few wraps with you know friends and my husband but I don't I don't look right like let me show y'all like I look like a [ __ ] fool trying to hold the damn blunt or cigarette like I just feel real like it's not steady between my fingers like ha like I'm gonna drop the ash and burn my leg like no we're not gonna do pens even though the pens don't have ashes you get my [ __ ] point I don't look right I don't know how to do it so the handheld was much easier for me this is the on and off button you've got to press it five times consecutively fast to turn it on and 5 to turn it off and then it lights up like this and you hold it to heat the oil I guess I might have turned it off so now it's on and the blue light is is on can you see it and then like I love it I might have filled it a little bit too much I can feel the oil but then again that's right you got to be careful how you fill it but yeah so I absolutely I love it it's so clear as you see on camera I suck at smoking I suck at it but this is my first time and I wanted to come and share this because again as the first time they smoker anything finding videos that are like beginner beginner friendly is very difficult a lot of people are very you know good at they that's what they do they smoke they'll do CVD they'll do THC they know how to do all of these things so being a very beginner I was like it was really hard for me to find a video that was my level so I thought that it would be really good for me to make this video and plus I absolutely love the product and I want to share so yeah just real quick in like it does smoke a lot more and better than that but again I suck at doing this it's my first time but I do highly highly recommend this I actually was telling my friend about it she went and brought a whole bunch of stuff that she's a beginner smoker as well so you know I definitely recommend this so let's see what else do I have to say here yeah so refill it's discreet press it five times on five times off it is relaxing it's so light like I don't and I just learned how to blow it through my nose literally I just learned that I know that's real stupid like really you didn't know I never knew how to blow get the smoke to come out my nose never my friends was like just swallow I swallowed my throat starburns and I'm coughing I look stupid and get a headache like oh that's why I don't smoke this here is a lifesaver I absolutely love it so yeah highly recommend that I'll go ahead and leave the link below so you can check it out as well the price it was really inexpensive I think the whole entire kit which came with the vape the the cartridge the magnet and the charger was like $39 and then the additional oil that you had so supply yourself with I think was $19.99 but again I did get the original flavor with the lowest milligrams that was $19.99 but I was just on there today even like the flavored one that I want to get in 250 milligrams is only $29 so yeah it's definitely a deal let me go on and share what persuaded me to even start to look at vaping and smoking again I am getting older now before I was so against it like I know people that smoked all their lives I have nothing against it I don't it's not that I don't like it it's just isn't for me I've also seen the side effects of addiction I know that sounds weird with marijuana everyone's like addiction but addiction to the point where it takes over your life where you spend all every dollar on it you're not the same person without it things like that all of that kind of like made me like oh [ __ ] I don't want no parts of this but now that I'm getting older I do feel that I would I want to enjoy my downtime I want to enhance my downtime so whether that be smoking marijuana vaping CBD even edibles I do enjoy edibles occasionally I wanted to go ahead and expand my knowledge on it so I bought this book y'all know I bought a book y'all know I bought a book I'm in the red robe did you think I wasn't going to mention a book come on now ya know me better than that so I bought a book I bought this book way before I bought my vape but this is why I bought my baby a Woman's Guide to cannabis using marijuana to feel better look better sleep better and get high like a lady so this is the book that I bought that actually made me start to even think about buying myself something so let me go ahead and tell you what got me the reason why I was like you know what [ __ ] all it is forget what everyone thinks forget it all the negative right let me do what I'm gonna do for me and yeah I'm a little I'm a late bloomer I'm 30-something 30-something you feel me and I'm starting late but that's okay because this book here really helped me put it into perspective so it says here oh and the author is Nikki fur do not I'm sorry Nikki if that is not your last name third her Fuhrer Nikki wrote it but anyways she says before I begin working the legal marijuana industry I was an independent bookstore owner now I am working as hard as ever but my shoulders are relaxed my back doesn't hurt and my depression is a distant memory now that I am in my 40s cannabis makes me feel prettier and more relaxed than I ever was in my 20s or 30s I am still a bookseller at heart and I didn't have a book to recommend to new cannabis patients sure there's a lot of books out there marijuana cookbooks gardening books and such but I couldn't find a book that I could give to my mother for her first trip to a dispensary so that her saying that she was in her 40s and just now started smoking I was like yo it's never too late to get high but yeah so this book I definitely recommend this book as well this is like a two and one and two and one for yah um yeah I definitely recommend this book it has hella information about cannabis again I am a very beginner I am still on the CBD and that's okay because I read in here that CBD let me read you what it says here it says THC the queen bee CBD the valedictorian period Pope so yes CBD was like the wanna be high but now that it's mainstream the way it has it is so much more enhanced and so much better and it just has so many benefits that a lot of people didn't recognize because they always thought it was like the bootleg kind but it's not so she is now crowned the valedictorian let's see so she goes in to say she does have things in here about CBD but again most of the book is about THC campus it has some recipes in it so here she goes on to talk about vape pens and all types of vapes the handheld vaporizer if a vape pen is for beginners the handheld vaporizer is intermediate-level they can be used with flour or concentrate they still fit in your clutch vapors do baked vapors do not smell like smoke so it is very discreet and perfect yeah so she goes on to talk about what kind of vapors she uses yeah and like I said she has edible extractions cooking with concentrates she has some stuff in here about the different types of cannabis like I had no idea there's like bubble hash dry sift shaker shape I don't know what that says see I'm a beginner I have no idea wax crumble live resin like she goes into hella detail like I absolutely recommend this book even if you are like you know major smoker this is still like very educational because I'm sure you don't know everything but yes so that is my wrap-up for today let me show y'all what I keep my vapor in in my purse but yeah like I said it's so little it's so little I'm coming back to this I have to it's so little it fits in here with my oil and the charger when I'm on the go all they're gonna just pop this out and just show like I went by the water the other day read my book and I was vaping I absolutely recommend it right so thank you for watching peace and blessings peace and blessings I hope you enjoyed the video give it a thumbs up and make sure you subscribe hit the bell so you can get notifications when I upload and I shall see you late thank you again thank you [Music]", "zCefsDMbWUo": "[Music] hey everybody so check it out for this review video I figured it would be awesome to do it outside alright man it's a beautiful day out today it's nice I mean I figured nature would be the best place to do this review video so for this video I have here this is a gram cartridge by buddies this is one gram distillate with no added flavor alright this has got no added flavor so this is the buddies and again no added flavor alright I got to make sure that I make that very clear for everybody so this is coming in at 87 percent THC this is royal dog-walker alright it is the Royal dog walker it's not just regular dog Walker its royal [ __ ] okay you better bow down and recognize alright anyway it is a beautiful product first off let's see if we get a good view on that look at that that is a beautiful beautiful nice product right there that's a nice distillate so this this cartridge cost me twenty nine dollars for medical here in Oregon and for recreational that means anybody over the age of 21 with valid ID you could pick this cartridge up this buddy's cartridge with no added flavor for about thirty nine dollars recreational so that's not bad either anyway I got my om extracts battery here that I'm using really cool battery just because it's got the the charger right there at the bottom you can just charge it use a regular phone charger whatever kind of you know LG charger and we're going through this nice little I want you guys to see this really quick for my stuff there's a nice little area it's nice little walk path this looks like where somebody would get murdered in a scary movie like hey let's go through the forest yeah oh man but it's nice it's nice out today and so like I said before I figure we do this review video outside so um right here's a good area there ain't nobody around so let's uh go ahead and try this bad boy [Music] [Music] not bad man that is really smooth and that tastes really good it doesn't taste too much like dog walker though if you've ever actually had dog walker it's got that diesel that really gassy diesel taste it mainly because of the chem dog in it but man not bad it's got like a fruity sweet taste to it with a little tinge of that gas eNOS at the end that's how I describe it not super fruity more sweet but like that you know sweet fruity ish with a little gassy Diesel at the end that's how I'd describe the terpenes on this and I don't know does it say make cannabis deprived terpenes you see that peep it because it's very important when you get these cartridges all right very [ __ ] important I can't tell you enough please guys please please please please please try to stay away from the flavored stuff now I know that I've done a few review videos on some of the flavored stuff but that doesn't mean that that's what I personally smoke okay this is the kind of stuff that I personally smoke those review videos are just for reviews okay they're nothing more than that anyway so this buddies I don't know if it says it doesn't say the terpenes on it but it's pretty tasty alright this is a hybrid distillate 1 gram vape cartridge distillate alright I'll make sure I say that again because I want people think and it's BHO or anything else but this is a distillate I love it this is a perfect item for somebody on the go this perfect item very discreet easy to use if you're out somewhere like this you know you know what I mean you're just out enjoying nature maybe you're taking a trip somewhere it doesn't matter these are very easy to use and again they're very very discreet alright a lot of people that don't smoke mistake these for actual vape you know mods and stuff like that they think it's a juice I don't know we come to a fork of the road here I don't know which way to go it's either that way we're that way but hold on let me let me show you guys this this is the other side of the entrance this isn't a nice little walk I don't know if you guys caught any of that walk through there but does a nice little walk so anyway let's go this way all right check it out it's really hot out here it's like 93 degrees or some [ __ ] and it's only getting hotter summer has just begun out here at Eastern Oregon a lot of people think that I'm in the Portland area or Salem OR Eugene or something like that now I live out here in Eastern Oregon Hermiston Oregon good old harvestin out here in the damn desert as you can see mostly everything out here is dead just burning up out here in the desert man it's kind of shitty to grow out here because if you don't do your if you don't amend your soil right if you don't make sure that you know everything's on you know the up and up and legit you'll end up with that like desert hay tasting weed man and that sucks Oh God does it taste like [ __ ] alright so if you're growing out here in the desert man remember to amend your soils correctly man because you don't want that nasty hay taste [Music] so my thoughts on this one gram cart bye buddies I have to say I highly recommend it it's something that's still somewhat affordable it's not going to break the bank but it's exactly what you want when you're looking for carts okay the cart gives you a big massive hit which is always you know what I'm looking for because I want to feel like I'm taking a DAB you know what I mean I don't want to feel like Joe I'm just taking like these little nothing cloud hits I want to feel it I don't know there's a lot of you guys out there that are the same way but I would say this is it like I said exactly what you're looking for when you're going shopping for a cart you're looking for a cart that functions well it's not you know a cheap cart these carts are actually really nice carts you're looking for the product itself to be really good okay you're looking for those higher numbers especially for distillate you want those high eighty 90s and I mean that's just beautiful distillate look at that that's just beautiful distillate you know what I mean there's nothing I could say about that you could see yourself just some really nice you know very see-through golden distillate which is very beautiful all right no arguing that and again eighty eighty seven eighty seven percent THC almost ninety that is some good numbers those are some good test results right this doesn't have any CBD in it or at least it doesn't tell me but oh wait it does it does have a house three point five fifty three percent of CBD in it so that is a little bit of a bonus in there so nice I didn't read the side I'm a dumbass but anyway seriously no I like that though so the breakdown tea 85% is a total cannabinoid okay so that's the overall total the actual breakdown of it is 75 percent while 75 point 69 percent THC if we want to get technical about it then again three point 53 percent CBD so that's the breakdown of it nice nice nice nice not bad it's hoping that the THC would be a little bit higher than 75 to be honest especially when you're dealing with distillate a lot of distillates are in those higher numbers you know what I mean but hey as long as it tastes great as long as I'm getting a good hit as long as you know my cart is functioning because there's a lot of carts that [ __ ] up there's a lot of carts that you'll end up sucking the oil through or they'll just burn out and quit to stop working and you're [ __ ] with half of your grammar if not more in there yeah so you go you you got to add that in when you're shopping for these babies so big shout out to buddies again the Royal dog walker which if you ever get a chance to try dog walker itself it's one of my favorite strains a highly recommended man that that Terr pee gas diesel skunky oh.just musters the nostrils and I love it I love it I love it I love it look at these boulders they're very big boulders so I don't drive my car into that Lake I guess if I'm like crazy on crack or some [ __ ] oh there's deer over here I think I scared the deer by yelling too loud I just saw him take a you know beeline it straight for the woods over here that's some crazy [ __ ] he's like oh no not these [ __ ] again look at this white boy out here talking and getting high I can't take this [ __ ] anyway I want to go down here that's nice if there wasn't like fish hooks and all kinds of poke and [ __ ] from people fishing in here I'd probably be like let's go swimming in here in fact then again I don't know they they these are the pawns that they stock every so often so nothing but just small trout oh nothing big for all you stoner fishermen out there if you are a stoner fisherman let me know in the comment section below there's a lot of them out there you know getting stoned and going fishing is a really relaxing fun thing to do I'd have to say I'd do it from time to time anyway so I got to get back to a buddy's good kart recommended if you guys are on a budget can't afford those 50 60 $70 cards if you guys you know need something that is trustworthy none of that added flavor [ __ ] known on cannabis deprived terpenes then go buddies man they're your buddy all right they just want to be your buddy all right they fit in your pocket very discreet easy to use 510 thread so they fit almost almost every [ __ ] battery out there and like I said man just they're trying to be your buddy be their buddy follow them on Facebook and Instagram so you could stay updated with all the product they got all right and the different flavors and everything just everything amazing about buddies all right guys if you guys like this video if you guys like nature if you guys found anything I said at all

"alright what's up everyone UMaine home yet EF forgives me as just a quick little smoke out I went to the dispensary today I went to go check out connected and they had a deal going on for tree-based clear it was buy one at $80 get another one for two bucks so I'd end up getting two grams of carts for about 82 bucks it's still a little bit expensive I could have gotten you know two grounds for 40 bucks if I had gone with a much different product but this year I'm kind of excited about because I've never gotten up so high in pricing yeah I'm trying to see if it's worth the tree baits clear we're gonna test you out uh-huh this particular one is the gelato as you guys have noticed it's at an 87 point 54 grams of total cannabinoids but the THC is 83 point 54 let's go ahead and taste this bad boy out Wow definitely you get into thick clouds out you can't even taste how thick that cloud is when you're inhaling though it's so smooth it's so gentle but once you start letting it out all you can just see how much you took in I could feel it in my chest it's really heavy in the chest it tastes great I could feel it I'm not too crazy but we're gonna go ahead and let it simmer for about a minute or two check it out if I was sweating like a pig it is because it is a hundred degrees in Long Beach but you have to hit it as hard too you could take it in like five six seconds and be on a good one and that's what I look for in a product I do look for the quality and the pricing if you're gonna buy a product that's really cheap then you know what you're getting but if you're gonna be paying eighty dollars for a gram cart it better be something amazing I've only hit this twice and already I fill it up here I'm calm and relaxed I did decide to go with the hybrid and the reason I chose that is because I wanted something that was gonna mellow me out and not push my anxiety further but at the same time I'm not looking for that couch look and finding that balance is a little difficult and hybrids are pretty close to it but I just feel there there is no perfect strain but this right here this is definitely something that I feel that I could take out and with those two pops I'm chilling you still can't control you're not too too high where you can't communicate very well I like this this is a really good product we have to test it out throughout the day check it out see how it hits tree base clear this is some good stuff I would definitely say try this is it worth the $80 so I finally had time to try out the tree base clear and I just got to say this is a whole different ballgame this is definitely not for beginners and at the price range $80 per gram this is gonna be a lot more expensive but you're gonna taste the quality you're gonna get the quality high you're gonna get that long-lasting feel I mean I was high for over like two three hours and if you go into cartridges thinking that they're all the same they're not sometimes it's not worth buying the extra expense but with this one you're going to what you pay for and it is nothing but goodness so try it out this is definitely like I said not for beginners if you are spending a hundred bucks a week or 100 bucks every other week and you're into cartridges this right here is one of the greatest options it's strong and it's just long lasting I've been hitting it and hitting it and it just doesn't seem to go down as fast as the other ones who are a lot cheaper because when they're a lot cheaper they're using a lot less quality cannabis so you have to hit it more and it just goes by so much faster tree base clear I gotta say you guys really outdid I'll did a lot of the game I'm very happy I think that you should all try this and if you got the money I would say keep this as backup always but nothing like flower flower is always gonna be the top notch but if you want to be discreet you want to get high and you want to enjoy the whole cartridge ease this is worth every penny I'm telling you guys try it out tree base clear I'm out", "mb6YNOqZH5E": "hi I'm so back again on another video I know it's been a minute but uh let's get into so before I start this video I know I

you have a good idea of what you're getting into next time you make your oil cartridge purchase all Auto draw batteries need a cartridge with the airflow hole at the direct bottom of the tank if you're wondering why the new vaporizer you purchased won't vape your oil cartridge this is usually the reason cartridge tanks with solid connective bottoms will not work with buttons vapes this is the ex1 plastic wit cartridge with a flat head tip not really known for its big hits and good taste but it's a tried-and-true tank that's lightweight with the leak proof design and they easy to feel blue plug system be sure to preheat properly with this system as sticker oils can build up to a semi solid state on the wick so if you're looking for a cartridge that won't shadow around it though this is the cartridge for you the ex3 is a glass cartridge with a surco me of fiber heater similar to coils this cartridge gives a unique taste it feels heavy and very well made the big glass surrounding the heater allows for durability and will give you a truer quality of flavor this tank has been known not only to vape oils but ejuice to this tank features two dual Inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and because of the air hole at the bottom this can be baked with a south draw device the ex4 is a glass tank with ceramic heater it's great because of the rounded base the round base is great so that no oil or wastage get caught up there it has a wider mouthpiece than most cartridges so you'll be able to get more vapor production it features two inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and yes it's Auto draw friendly as well next is the only tank on the list we need a push to fire base and will not work on buttons as vaporizers or batteries the ex5 ii need each pilgrim or epub done for inlet holes for mediums against viscosity the egg v improves on the cartridge game by allowing you to control the amount of airflow you get great for heavy hits and with the mouthpiece being the largest of the bunch the vapor production is completely customizable to your liking but if you're not going to use the cartridge for a while it's best that you completely close the air vent even more amazing is the baseless center post assuring that you get the most out of your cartridge and that no oil is left behind and last but not least the e a fix-all cartridge this ESL style cartridge is the best fit for even the thickest of oils it features four large two millimeter inlet holes ceramic oven thick glass housing and ceramic mouthpiece and yes it is Auto drawl compatible this glass cartridge is a ceramic oven so you know what's going to give you a greater taste than any whipped cartridge out there all these cartridges are no wider than any CSL cartridge on the market and can fit into any vaporizer with the bore of ten point seven five millimeters or less please keep in mind that the thicker your oil the wider inlet hole that you'll need so that the right amount of oil can reach the heater to be vaporized without getting burned keep in mind that you shouldn't refill the cartridge is more than three times to assure you're getting the best vapor production

of filling 12,000 cartridges in an eight-hour day with next to zero waste an absolute minimal clean-out required for the next minute or so we're going to give you a very quick look at this remarkable new system to include its speed precision and flexibility you probably have questions and may wish to see more so will follow with a detailed step-by-step guide to the installation and operation of our new 810 hotshot systems for openers you're looking at the number one reason you need our hotshot 1500 speed at the rate you're now watching you can fill this entire tray of 50 carts in a few ticks under 2 minutes without removing them from vendor-supplied foam blocks we'll show you how in the demo for now let's do the math 50 carts in 2 minutes 1500 carts an hour 12,000 filled cartridges in a single eight-hour day from single a 10 hotshot system reason to control and precision fill any volume cart from point 3 3 grams to one full gram with total volume control in point 0 1 gram increments point zero 1 reason 3 flexibility use our Hot Shot 1500 to fill any oil viscosity use it to swap out batches mid-run use it to quickly and precisely fill almost any style vape cart pen or syringe speed precision flexibility you're 100 percent card filling solution our new 810 hotshot systems are available in two models and both are detailed at hotshot cool jars comm check them out right now however there's a lot to know about the new a 10 and you probably have some questions so here's an in-depth up-close very detailed look how to put our new hotshot to work let's start with system setup this is the super speed 810 hotshot 1500 the fastest of the two models cool jars offers it weighs around 15 pounds and takes up about 2 square feet of table space just make sure it's on a stable level surface to start find the 16 ounce bottle of blue heat transfer fluid and pour the entire contents into the blue reservoir now slide the Innova stainless-steel immersion heating element into the reservoir twisting slightly to make sure it's fully seated positioned correctly you'll see three dimples level with the top of a reservoir next mount our black nonstick oil tank onto the a10 to ensure proper connection align this white cam with the slot in the a10 press down firmly until seated then turn clockwise to lock in place here's something that will interest you our oil tanks features self sealing one-way check valve so you can swap out tanks and batches mid run to remove the tank turn counterclockwise to unlock then pull straight up model 1500 comes with two oil tanks and you can order additional tanks as an option more about swapping tanks later next install an a-10 oil injection needle our component kit contains needles of varying sizes which gives you options to fit style cards your filling we suggest you select the shortest length you can to lessen pressure on internal piston assembly and thread the needle into port and use the blue plastic thumb socket in the kit to tighten being careful not to over tighten now install your selected fill switch in our high-performance model 1502 options are available our new button activated speed tray plus our foot activated fill pedal both options plug into the USB port on the left front side of the a10 we'll use our new speed tray for purposes of this demonstration next connect power source plug the round mail and the power transformer into the rear of the a10 control box now plug the transformer and the Innova heating element into a switched power surge strip that's rated for at least 10 amps that's it for system setup let's talk about operation first activate the a-10 system by powering up the surge strip now power up the Innova heating element by pressing the red button on front of the display panel the button will display white when activated quick note press and hold this button for a few seconds to switch readings from Fahrenheit to Celsius press and hold again to switch back select whichever scale you prefer now pour desired amount of batch oil into the nonstick tank it will hold any amount up to one thousand grams per tank cover with lid next adjust system operating temperature using the thumb wheel on front of the Innova display rolled up to increase roll down to decrease you can adjust the Nova in 1/2 degree increments an initial setup adjust he's set into 170 degrees Fahrenheit to fully heat the a-10 system and set the onboard heat switch this is important when the a-10 system is fully heated actual oil temperature will be anywhere from twenty to thirty degrees lower than the Innova setting depending on viscosity of oil use a heat gun to determine the actual oil temperature then adjust the Innova as necessary to reach your desired oil temperature once the a-10 system is activated the main touchscreen will light up the screen will not show operational controls until a system and oil are fully heated if attempts are made to operate system prior to heating this waiting for heater message will be displayed when operational controls appear on the touch screen the a-10 is ready for use use a test screen for all inputs first select this casa t from one of three options available on the model 1500 olive oil glycerin and honey select the option that best describes the estimated miss custody of your batch at fil temperature now select shot size from one of three options point three three grams point five grams at one gram a custom setting is also available volumes are adjustable in point zero one gram increments next select speed using the up and down arrows on the five bar graph each bar represents a 20% increase or decrease in fill speed finally select end count to input the number of fills you wish to perform once desired fill count is reached the a 10 will stop flow of oil to reset press hole to reset for a few seconds to zero out the reading with these few settings in place they're ready to go following initial setup first prime or purge 18 system by holding a container under needle and pressing fill switch several times until oil is dispensed returned priming oil to main tank so you don't waste it next test cartridge fill volume using a very precise scale weigh the container you're using to prime the system inject a shot then weigh container again the difference will be the shop volume repeat as necessary adjusting volume on touchscreen to achieve desired amount adjustments can be made in point 0 1 gram increments as an alternative volume testing procedure way an empty cart before and after filling and make any necessary adjustments once made these volumes will remain consistent throughout the batch now let's fill some cards the a-10 model 1500 features a new high volume speed tray with a button activated fill switch it is really really fast to use it cut a typical vendor-supplied 100 card foam block in half and place a 50 cart block in speed tray this lets you fill carts directly in the block instead of removing and filling one by one now position needle in corner cart inject pre-measured fill using onboard switch and move on to the next cart you will be absolutely amazed at the speed you can achieve with our new 8n hotshot with speed tray once comfortable with the process you can typically fill this tray of 50 carts and something under 2 minutes even a 2 minutes per tray that's 1,500 carts an hour and that's 12,000 carts a day if you prefer to use our foot-activated fill switch there's no need to cut a hundred cart foam block unless you prefer to fill smaller quantities so you can cap them quicker simply position the foam block under injection arm insert needle in the corner cart depress foot pedal to inject each shot and move on when you fill 50 cards on one side reverse block and Faure it could not possibly be quicker and easier incidentally flow rates will depend on a number of factors including viscosity of oil heat of oil size of carts etc you can fine-tune your fills by adjusting viscosity speed and shot size settings to achieve optimum flow rate finally we'd like to show you a few quick procedures that will keep your oil processing operation running smoothly first a quick needle change demo use the blue plastic thumb socket in the kit unscrew the needle and return the kit insert new needle tighten lightly with tool and you're good to go next a tank change if you're changing in the middle of a batch run the tank will be warm so make sure you're wearing gloves turn tank counterclockwise to unlock and pull straight up a check valve will stop the flow of oil though you may have a few residual drops to wipe up now insert a fresh tank it can be empty full or partially full twist a lock and you're ready to rock fix maybe 30 seconds since we're talking about the tank if you wish to do a total clean-out and would like to replace oring in the valve first remove tank as previously described and empty remove valve with three-quarter inch socket using six in one tool in the kit without the bit push up spring-loaded valve to reveal Oh ring remove old ring with a single edge razor blade replace the spare o-ring in the kit we install valve with socket and you're done additional earrings are available on our website if you're having problems achieving a consistent shot size it may be a partial blockage of the upper or lower valve due to oil residue here's how to replace both for the upper valve remove tank as previously demonstrated and use supplied socket drive to remove valve model 1500 comes with replacement valves so look for one in the kit screw into place tighten lightly with socket drive replace tank reprime system is described previously and continue filling procedures finally here's how to replace a lower valve remove tank as previously demonstrated using Philips screw bit on the 61 tool in your kit unscrew the 90 degree bulkhead on front of the injection arm next use the hex wrench to loosen the two screws on either side of the arm and slide injection arm straight out using the six in one tool without the screw bit carefully unscrew the lower valve reverses procedure to install that's all there is to it as mentioned early on our new cool drawers Hot Shot cart filling systems deliver the speed precision and flexibility you need to achieve optimum profitability from oil product lines and here's something else to consider if you're like most current 810 users you have at least one filling system gathering dust on your shelf because it just flat doesn't get it done enough you've tried the rest not ordered the best the all-new cool jars a

cartridges with vape and batteries this episode is brought to you by New York vape shop you can find all the devices that were using in the demonstration today at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with the code rough 3 first we're going to take it look at the anatomy of a 5-10 cartridge first I want to talk about the tip and the tips are pretty much a up to you like however you decide which is your preference is they come in all types of metal they're come in ceramic and they come in wood so the tips are pretty much straightforward next we're going to talk about the tanks the tanks themselves are what holds the oil and they're usually half a milliliter to one milliliter and sometimes the really big ones like the two gram or 2.2 gram heavy hitter cartridges can be really long but referring to the tank is the actual part of the cartridge where the oil is inside of it the two part and then there's the oil inlet and sometimes they come in various whole sizes you can see the one at the top there has a little bit larger hole size than the cartridge there at the bottom and generally for the thicker THC oils you probably want more of a thicker hole then there's the airflow if you can see at the very very bottom this is a bottom airflow and you can see that the airflow hole is right there in the threads at the bottom of the device other devices sometimes have them at the top near the tip and so generally one is either a bottom airflow in most cases sometimes a top airflow and then there's also what they call a variable airflow and you say the case here the airflow is adjustable at the top there so that's the one one thing to consider as well as part of your cartridge and the last and perhaps the most crucial part that we're going to talk about there's here at the base and that is the atomizer and the atomizers are usually either wick or ceramic and the wick they're okay but preferably you probably want to use ceramic today's you get a lot better even distribution better flavor and you see the ceramic heats the oil as it passes through now let's talk about best practices one of the most important things when it comes to using your 510 cartridges with a pin is to use the right voltage setting and you can see generally if it's a variable voltage for these kinds of pins that will vary somewhere between three and five volts and that's the appropriate range for most 510 cartridges but if you're using something like a box mod like the steam cloud that you see here that goes up to sixty watts it's going to be way too much so you're going to want to bring that down to like five watts or to the lower settings and to make sure that you're using the proper voltage or wattage another thing that you want to make sure is that using the proper airflow type you can see this is a bottom airflow device but used on this box mod if you pull it all the way in there there's no air inlet and so for this is the type that you'll need a top airflow so there are types of devices that may not be compatible with certain types of cartridges so that is one thing you want to make sure that for instance of this case you'd want to use a top airflow device and a variable and would be even better and you can see here - this is a bottom airflow and on the bottom airflow there will be a little bitty notch where the air would be allowed to flow through at the bottom of the device so you just want to make sure that you're using the right kind with the right type of device another thing is that when it comes to your empty device you probably just want to throw it and not throw it away but you want to refill it and not just keep hitting it because you're going to burn it out so when you get done with it either go ahead and toss it it's done or stop hitting it until you're ready to refill it or you're going to burn it out another thing is when you're putting in your pocket you really want to be careful with the tips especially with the ones that have an exposed tip and rather than sitting down into a sleeve because if you leave it in your pocket you can do something like this a lot of times it'll bend the tip over one way or the other can expose the electronics and cause you some problems so if you're going to be putting it in your pocket you might want to go with a device such as this where the cartridge sits down inside of it like a sleeve and the last tip we're going to go with here is to make sure that you keep your battery charged or keep a backup battery so if you have a nice pin that you like to use you might want to keep a little cheap on the side that you can have always kind of have as a backup by your charge in the other and that pretty much brings me to the end of my tips and best practices on

that quick little test yup stuck no one oh [ __ ] so you know we're not smoking a hot dog water cuz we smoke that [ __ ] once the one like oh oh the state just like decorate honestly it really just tastes just exactly like the [ __ ] like distrain to be honest with you guys like so little piney some five sativa 81.4 six percent THC so we're getting to the low where the low 80s right here so it's just cool you know it's a nice little wake and bake I did actually smoke a little bit earlier this new dish with the foot I did actually wake them back using this and I got a man the high is not too strong you know it's not like crazy you're not crazy lit you're feeling it but you know you're definitely so it's cool you know especially like for like morning jobs and sure you don't want to get too baked but you want to kind of get baked just to kind of like you know go on with the morning you know does that make sense it doesn't matter because I don't I don't make sense you know but you know

cloud 22 have you guys ever known as I hit this is it like a blast I'll grab the shell be that she kind of packs a punch the taste tillow piney little bit you know little piney come out with like a lot of new cartridges and stuff like that and I to be honest with you guys and I'm gonna be real with you guys man I don't think cartridges are healthy for you whatsoever I mean if you think about it hers has you know some flour that shit's been around for a minute and wax and all that shit's been around for like would they see like 3040 years or some [ __ ] you know like 40 years I think so it's like with all this new [ __ ] coming out and all these like chemicals are sick of man I you know what this is 100% cannabis you know it's 100% but sometimes when you guys buy certain brands I mean these are cool these are cool these are all like you know I think they're they're they're FDA approved you know they're like they're legal you know 100% legal it's been tested all that [ __ ] so I can't do like no crazy arm obviously smoking wax can cause like can cause harm over time you know I can [ __ ] damage your lungs all that smoke no matter if it's bait cigarettes whatever smoke [ __ ] I suppose being your life mashup fuk so but as I was saying like I feel like a lot of there's probably a lot of companies [ __ ] [ __ ] there's a lot of companies out there a lot of wax cartridge companies right we're gonna sell you some fire [ __ ] you're gonna be smoking that [ __ ] but little do we know man that has some type of chemical that could cause cancer like 30 40 years down the line yo and that's what a lot of people are saying to like when you guys are smoking try not to like over smoke trying to get all crazy with them because again these cards bro we're smoking them these

had in my entire life always had you know it was always thing but again you never know so it's just like I think about it somebody that smokes cards I can tell you guys a story right now man the time I apply some fake cards I don't even know it one time I bought six cards right cuz it was like a deal was like a hundred and something for like six like six cards right so I'm like [ __ ] it right

especially when I would I would wake up in the middle of the night in my throat would be so itchy I had to take off medicine and I would always cough all the time bro all the time and I was like look bud and I stopped smoking Carson are like you know that bro mm-hmm to be honest with each other I think I was smoking them fake cards all right but uh bless my health right bless my lungs and I was like [ __ ] dude but anyways like stuff like that right I'm thinking about that there's still [ __ ] little fake cards being sold out to like a bunch of like high schoolers and [ __ ] like that like people who shouldn't even be smoking in the first place it has like it's batch number and all the shit's like it's manufactured the company their license you know it's just snatched and it's just all natural you know it's like natural cannabis you know and it even talks about here so what's the company has a license and all that [ __ ] then you should be pretty [ __ ] good you know you got a as our license you know but a [ __ ] man has a lot of warnings out here man I would just say my advice is try not to smoke a [ __ ] load of cards you know limit your self to like two three quarts [ __ ] a month you know what I try to do is I try to limit myself to like I would say maybe like a half gram cart this is me halftime cart like every like 12 to 14 days so like a week we can have two like two weeks you know around there you know that's what I would say I'd give it maybe like two weeks sometimes if I if I another notice when I caught carts I caught maybe like three a month to be honest with you guys and they're not even four grams you know this month I would say let's see what did I review I've reviewed probably one 1/2 gram of select 1/2 gram of bra garden and then a full gram of all pounding this thoughts about like teen Rams and a half you know I'm not bad I guess [ __ ] I'm telling you guys man I know hello people that bro no [ __ ] kill a [ __ ] half Grammy today and I'm like although [ __ ] me eyes imagine you know so that I'll be here bro and I'm puffing a [ __ ] Sasuke I just can't take big hits bro my the way my body to my lungs whatever the [ __ ] the way something going on whatever is inside my body man like I don't know if you guys know this about I washes when you guys watch these videos I do not take the fattest drags ever like I take little tiny kick back drags um cuz if I'll take fat drags man I'm [ __ ] dying like I'll take a couple minutes for me to like recovery shake you know song like look you know but honestly how I you know how I see it is I do I'm taking just normal-sized hits bro my tolerance will not go super high cuz again I got other friends man and they take fat ribs and they're like bro my tolerance is so high they gotta

anyways everybody again I hope you guys are enjoying these videos man these are all just reviews you know there's literally just educational videos like I'm not not convincing anybody to go smoke or anything like that this is just for people that already smoke cannabis users you know cannabis patients just for the knowledge you know just a relaxing perfect high you know I mean I hit this [ __ ] by like seven eight nine times already and I'm [ __ ] bait you know but one thing I do gotta give it to you guys man is I like your guys as a design man this even design is dope I like it like it doesn't even feel cheap it doesn't at all like the car is a little the carts pretty heavy now Cano I mean all carts are heavy but this car just feels like I just like the material of it you know and I feel like you could screw this off you could refill it you know I think you can do all that [ __ ] and eat and I think Eden's new to let's see if it has three that it's next to the company name no it doesn't show it apply online but I'm Way too [ __ ] lazy to get my phone you know so Eden so far you guys is regular cards okay I enjoy them especially this one and right now I feel like I feel creative you know I feel like I could go on my computer in shock I start getting down I start writing down ideas I start editing videos cuz again I do have a main channel go down to my description it's called I'm crunchy one we're at 120 one case ups or 120 cases around there you know um but the next step is gonna be your guys as you guys is diamonds cartridge second it's a soft diamond there's something like that but I saw up close and I was like oh [ __ ] this looks like some sauce divers it filled with diamonds little tiny diamonds and just like sauce no Mike I think this is some sauce to this is something I was just like [ __ ] here we have it everybody eatin fire I'll show you guys I'll for sure get the Diamonds cartridge because that's gonna be like the first honestly that's like the only cartridge I've ever seen that has diamonds inside I'm like oh [ __ ] are you gonna be able to smoke this but you do need to buy a eating battery that comes with it you can't be using I guess the ordinary you got to use the battery that they give you see that means you gotta buy that [ __ ] so I'm like okay I'm down I'm down you know depending on like this one and I like this one this one's far you know it doesn't get you like extremely [ __ ] like oh my god I can't function high but it gives you like the [ __ ] right high like it's just as cool as to this fire I like it looking everybody we do not condone the usage of these products I'm Marti warning you guys and shit's not healthy for you even though you know it is it is approved you know it is government approved and all that [ __ ] but I do not condone the usage and I'm not promoting any sales or I don't even sell anything on this channel it's literally just a personal review and a review that could be used just for an educational purpose you know this for someone else you know for like a cannabis patient a patient a new let's you can see like a new cannabis patient they don't really know much about cannabis and they don't really like smoking smoking but they do like baby you know there's like you know what it's [ __ ] crazy man it blows my mind how there's so many people there's another like a good there's another group of people that are older they're like you know London late thirties in [ __ ] and one time like it's like kind of I got a family party right family friends all that [ __ ] right and one time I was just like we're just drinking whatever again everybody this is all an educational you know we're [ __ ] we're inside we're in the backyard you know cousin's backyard I take out a pen and I'm puffing on actually I'm like and I started coughing like I'm like I had a heavy hitter I think yeah I was like a heavy hitter right and I was like dude I'm like oh I'm [ __ ] I'm like damn so lately my cousin hit it again he's older than me he was like at the time he was like 26 and I was like 21 or some [ __ ] yes I said he starts coughing and one of our uncles like he's hella cool whatever you know he's cause dude he comes through he's like smoking his cigarette and he's like he's like what is that and I'm like oh this is a he's like he's like is that babe and we're like nice it's teach it's pretty much teach THC vape 16 C babe what the [ __ ] Hey they have [ __ ] like that and he's old school you know so I'm just like am I like Dan you never had this sheen there he does you know that he's like yeah and that we're like ganna try this [ __ ] out and he takes some red Bull he takes a rip oh [ __ ] [ __ ] man but think about it this was a Stoke head this guy loves stones anyway he's like this will [ __ ] um he rips that [ __ ] right he [ __ ] starts coughing all that she's like - his spies I would you get that she's I just go to the club you know go to the campus club he's like oh she's like I just and they're like oh we just like looked out of mass and [ __ ] were telling the Machine run and what's the crazy part about it is that now when he has like little get-togethers or some [ __ ] you see this fool with the [ __ ] battery like he doesn't really suck cigarettes anymore I'm like oh my head I'm like down we could have potentially like saved his [ __ ] life that day literally for him like this would like see his [ __ ] body because he says that you could smoke these anywhere and you get like a head high and my head I'm like oh my and I had were like no that's you're literally just high you know he said well it feels like it feels like you know I've smoked a cigarette but it's like the beginning the beginning feeling of the cigarette which is the head high he's got but I feel like that for like two hours and in my head when I tell you know he's sick he's like fallings an animal you know we're like we're like down but technically shoes go from smoking cigarettes every day to smoking this [ __ ] and he doesn't in any sense doesn't really buy a lot he says he only smokes maybe like like three or four of the big ones at a month big ones so it's like a gram you know he smokes like three four grams I'm like you know what back there needs to smoke like two three cigarettes a day so I'm like you know what that's cool I mean [ __ ] it's still unhealthy as [ __ ] this [ __ ] but hey you know what better than smoking tobacco right it sounds like damn dude we could probably we just [ __ ] expanded his life his [ __ ] life right there dude like who could've who knows [ __ ] crazy man 20 30 years from now bro he could have had lungs all [ __ ] up brooch and but then again you know 20 40 years from now bro [ __ ] knows what kind of what what what the what the wax would do to us I say you know I'm just I'm just trying to speak the truth you know it's like who knows you know in reality like getting it go good or could go bad you know hopefully it goes good you know cuz this is all tested and all that [ __ ] but hey sometimes man some companies bro the labels you just can't but then again if you buy it at a club bro then it's you should be fine you know just don't abuse it that's it it's gonna be zit because I used two views that [ __ ] and I would wake up like three four in the morning cough my lungs out it was everybody I hope you guys enjoyed this review makes you guys drop a like a comment subscribe click that Bell so you guys get notified every time we upload let me know the comments I'm blowed done when you guys click the Bell I give you guys a shout out anyway I mean Hayden and here we have this [ __ ] ro it's kind of dope huh yeah I'm not to take the pic like this oh nice and I approve this is far tastes good too", "U_Ka0JKesCY": "[Music] what up y'all said [ __ ] Academy ha yeah big man [ __ ] today we're just gonna answer a question the question is how long should a cartridge last you and how many hits should you get out of it but before we get into that sure the question I'm asked you [ __ ] a month I guess please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always Sega's always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that things you can get a notification anytime I post some [ __ ] also make sure you go over academy.com get yourself some terpenes shirts get about 10 11 13 [ __ ] I also cuz the contest is still going on you put in cold [ __ ] get 20% off in your whole [ __ ] order and again sirs you into the contest to be able to get yourself a terpene ball I send it out to you no charge you don't be paying shipping and handling under that [ __ ] I take care of everything and I send it out to you so [ __ ] man can't a mink on get your Terrapins o-obviously go over instagram academy kind of underscore me so all right the question of how long should it last and how many it should you get out there [ __ ] I give that [ __ ] all the time i'ma keep my honey with you if you talking about just a free-range like if you get a cartridge and put it on a free a free-range battery meaning that you kind of have up to seven seconds or 13 SEC's something like that's a hit the [ __ ] bait cartridge that's going to determine how much you're getting out of it so it's no way kind of that I can tell you how many hits you can get out of a [ __ ] cartridge so like when a person comes up and says how about a little 1 gram cartridge less I'll keep it 100 with you there's no such thing as a 1 gram cartridge it's a one milliliter cartridge because liquid is Mac [ __ ] measured in grams so it's a 1 milliliter cartridge with an X amount of grams InSAR milligrams inside of it so let's take for instance if you look at the back of a cartridge and it tells you that 3 milligrams is a serving right and then it also say below it the package has 450 milligrams of THC in it okay so that means that theoretically you would have 90 servings if that makes sense you would have 19 servings out of that that that half milliliter cartridge because that's probably what that will be if that if that's the number four right however how do you know you had three milligrams worth of eight and I'm not dissing it I'm just more so say how do you [ __ ] know this meaning it's kind of really hard to answer this question and then I don't know how often you smoke [ __ ] don't to [ __ ] you me how long does come in every two days getting the same [ __ ] I got my burgers coming in every three weeks every week like everybody got that you old [ __ ] habits and they [ __ ] that's like if I gave you a [ __ ] glass of water and on my a man how many sips is it gonna take to finish this that's just stupid right so at the end of the day you got to get the [ __ ] on your own and figure it out so companies try to give you a mindset of what it is but I got I got batteries that I could take a 13 second hit you know long 13 seconds is to be inhaling [ __ ] vape [ __ ] so come on spot it's it all depends on you man if you do like I think it's this matter like oh you didn't help for like two seconds or some little [ __ ] like that that's like a standard but just like I say it also depends on the force of how you inhale for that two seconds you can inhale like little B actually you can [ __ ] hit that [ __ ] up you know so it really just depends on how you [ __ ] hit you as well so those are the things that have to be taken into consideration when you expect someone to answer a [ __ ] question like that it really just depends on you see my life flashing man yeah peanut series it's yeah but it just really depends on what your habits are how you actually smoke at how long something is gonna last you I personally say have more than one method of consumption so don't just have one vape that you just constantly hitting on and then wonder why is going down that's like having one pair of shoes and heel shoes just get [ __ ] up you know versus like man like 27 pairs of kicks that's why my shoes usually all look new because I got so many so I can just switch them out you know so much it lasts longer so I say I've never met this at some edibles that's Mars so yeah I mean admit you [ __ ] I have some real weed my admission up and I think you'll see that the cartridges will last longer but if that's your only source that motherfucker's gonna be here it's gonna be how for like a month okay you have a graveyard of all these [ __ ] cartridges just laying there there's a little bit of [ __ ] oh you know there's no way of saying it now there is one I know some companies that they'll give you like don't dose it out to you it's actually a company called OC and then it's a okay you get 50 hits out of this pin so when you inhale it cuts off at what the proper dose is and you just inhale until it cuts off so think you know aren't exactly how much are the dose you're getting and you're knowing how many hits you get so I would say like if you can try a company like that just so you can kind of have our idea your mind just for shits and giggles I don't mean like all of that gotta make you be in the right place but just for shits and giggles like just think about it and see like man let me see how long this pin lets me hit and how much of a dose this says it is and that might help you out a little bit I don't know that's just theory of mine yeah me but at the end of the day that's what it is just read the back of the package and you'll see what the milligrams are inside look admit it should tell you what's suggested those are some companies do that so anyway that standard [ __ ] I'm out this [ __ ] y'all make sure y'all keep the log or I love each other keep the peace gon be peaceful to each other go over it kind of mean get yourself turn t-shirts I'm out this [ __ ] another one I want to hit the seat blow we in the jungle smoking we in a jungle smoking legal", "H-BJCJZ1mLI": "you're what up issue boy reefer rule and welcome to the [ __ ] site make sure you're 18 years or older to continue the video if you're not 18 years or older you can get the [ __ ] off this page this video is for patients who enjoy the use of medical marijuana like your boy referral so without further ado make sure this up to the site like comment subscribe follow your voices one on me I'm gonna see what's going on with y'all you know it's lovely at the site baby all 2020 we did a chairman I'm super hyped about today stupid stupid stupid like let me tell you why but I've had my eyes on alien labs for quite some time with quite some time I've been eyeing them but my only issue with them is that they're AIT's is so [ __ ] pricey so I told myself when I would have the money I would go purchase some aids and then we'll take it from there so I purchased baklava and the shahbazi oh and the planet dosing that was enough for me to be like you know what I gotta get something else that's alien lab so what else is out there luckily our friends at family farms collabed with alien labs and connected and made all of their best strains in liquid form so I want to shout out friendly forms and making this possible secondly I want to shout out stingy downtown still a because they had this they had multiple different strands of this collab and the connected lat connected cannabis coal friendly farms is collabing with them so I'm gonna go back to Susie and find out what they got what other ones they got they had the gelato 41 they had the junkies and they had this one I had to get the Shabbat Co because I felt like it was something I needed to have right so man I just going to stay and just looking out around at the products have so much different [ __ ] so I saw this and I was just like I brought one of these days I'm gonna come to Susie I'm gonna have the deal the daily deal for the vape cartridges so this was originally like $65 right at $60 and with the 20% off it came down to like 48 or something like that and then with Stacey if you keep going to downtown stadium you'll accumulate points which is like discount so I had like 8 points which equal to $1.00 so guess what I did so get right off it is I left out of that pan like I couldn't even tell you hat fit at least 50% off on this when it was all said and done so I made sure to catch dizzy out of right time because this is expensive this is a half gram for $60 that's right I said half so leads me to think one thing one this [ __ ] is fat but we all know alien labs they're pretty pricy anyway so of course that vape purchases would be pricy to full gram would be 60 so half I guess it kind of makes sense that it's $60 so the labs on this are 15% CBD in sixty eight point 47 percent THC was manufactured when I was still in New York 917 20 19 I was September 17 2019 it was packaged on 92019 and expires 9 17 2021 so this is the alien labs shahbazi or hybrid [Music] Shabazz Neil alien labs I'm boxing full [ __ ] of you brought so tight finish it you have no idea because not ever again could I ever see myself purchasing a 0.5 card for $60 unless I was able to get like a good discount on it which I was so you know we'll see I might just get this again and if you guys want to see more of it and you know why would I ignore y'all so y'all left this is a first for both of us this is the first time I'm having this lesson if this ain't the first time y'all having this I want y'all to be able to experience this [ __ ] with me I'm super super super look I even got the little alien on the side I mean what so a lot of packaging and a lot it's just it's a lot of just packaging and Brandon so one thing for me I'm a very out of the world kind of dude sometimes I believe in like paranormal supernatural so me in aliens like I have like I love just the thought of them possibly existing so just to see a company go so hard to make it like they're there then their mascot is this little alien guy it makes me just draw to them and just the alien just all it eyes everything about it um so yeah that's what really got me hooked onto alien labs well got shot guys have done to it because it was more so the packaging me like packaging is key with everything alright like wow I'm super high so friendly farms powered by friendly phones liquid live resin so this is totally live resin this time hi I don't even know what to say bro like this is reefer Reuben right and I'm one do you ever see me speechless never so this is I'm super hype about this I had a [ __ ] door opens box I'm gonna open it from the bottom you ain't getting in this [ __ ] I'll tell

friendly farms collab with alien labs go with me on this trip to outer space so I love you [Music] Lakers on me Wow Wow Wow holy [ __ ] man that a little alien hung up it's looking at each other right now Wow as soon as it as soon as it came it's like you tasted it right there and the fact that this is no add it is this is all no artificial flavoring this is straight this is nuts Wow bro that tastes amazing dog that absolutely takes me man oh yeah this was so worth the time I mean don't get me wrong the fact that it's 0.5 bothers me but I'm the addition beautiful but what I mean this [ __ ] could be trashed and I'm not gonna lie to you this is like a part of me just just because a little alien is there it's like yo this should be whack but I'm still gonna smoke it because of that but putting that [ __ ] aside Rome missions higher tastes amazing [Music] [Music] Wow salut chip [Music] [Music] [Music] Wow it ain't kickin like it's not like her okay cuz I'm not sweating right now y'all know the subs know once I start sweating do something right I'm sweating but it ain't nearly that sweat which does it doesn't not [ __ ] on it definitely the best-tasting car I've had in a while not a while let me stop this suburb is definitely good but super being live president likes Dizzy's live resident and even on this one dizzy I like I've had one live resident card and no - I'm sorry - no wait because the raw garden internet live residence okay so three stevesie raw garden in this out of these three out of those three it would be scheduled at raw garden and then I'm not even gonna even keep it to live resin this is honestly crazy compared to although I didn't have too much it doesn't have too much of that and what it doesn't have that I don't maybe I'm gonna have the chill sensation is pretty soon but my high though and my stupor stormed off in his hair oh man give me a prolly after this video like a little bit right now that was I thought taking it me that's right [Music] see you know what and we want to know what else on most big carts to the sea ace it's like usually a sticker this is actually on yeah they did they're doing a good job oh whatever that friendly farms they do not you know what because alien Labs is like one of those companies that are just super alike I don't I want to use the word Bujji but I don't want to use a word foo here there's a couple of boozy brands in California which is not a bad and I don't want people to look at that as a bad but it's like Oh overpriced but you know company you know what I mean like alien labs they're a little overpriced and I'm sure they will even say the same you know I mean like an eight is there's no way I mean there's no way bro there's no way an H cost sixty I mean maybe top top flower I mean maybe they are that super just premium quality bud that is just worth that but economically I mean people are still gonna buy it so what the [ __ ] am I even talking about the point of me saying that was is that a brand like alien labs and connected wouldn't take some [ __ ] company forever you want to mean they picked from a farms for a reason and I'm starting to see why because production is everything and production is good everything about it so I suggest you guys give it a shot you have to try you have to try this this is something you have to try most you guys have a 5-10 thread battery anyway so you just pop that [ __ ] on there and give it a whirl you know this isn't something where you need your own specific battery you know what I mean so give it a shot man and if you live in my area of LA then you can just go right to it just downtown City on a Wednesday night get that [ __ ] with 20% off and if you have credit like I do you use that credit and you get this [ __ ] for like 50% can't beat that with a bat beat that [ __ ] what did that hmm so before I leave you guys we're gonna take one more for the roll like I said this is friendly farms collab with alien labs shahbazi Oh salud chisel make sure to LIKE comment subscribe since a baby telephone Telefunken", "PxL8RgmvK3I": "hey what's up guys what did do is you boy mr. bling see I'm coming back at you with another video I think I just cringed after I said that but uh anyway today I wanted to just talk about some carts uh in specific fake carts because like I've been watching a lot of other people's videos on like your views of carts and [ __ ] and anytime they review something that's like a dank vape or a dab wood or like a cereal cart all I see in the comments are over you smoking home to fake cards oh you've got no food carts oh that car doesn't have the holo graphics on it so I think that fake um I would like to just say shut the [ __ ] up cuz like I'm pretty sure everyone who smokes carts knows that all of these aren't real carts because I mean it's pretty obvious if you smoke them yourself you can get different packaging which are like fake our carts from a fake cart in general but just starting off this video all of these carts are fake these two are real though I'm just gonna show you the packaging on these real quick so first off they have the California label and that's something only some of these fake car companies can write or copy onto their packaging but uh anyway you have a sticker that clearly labels your total THC and CBD content your strain how many milligrams you're getting and what type of weed it is you have this sticker label on the top that seals the box you have this sticker label on the back that lists your THC and CBD again and a government warning all of this information is on this legit kingpin packaging even the way the packaging it comes in obviously I mean like these are long since weak but uh you get a nice little kingpin cart it looks very nice it's all high quality you can open it in case you want to take the wax out it's a legit kingpin cart it even has the like the label a you can't scratch off I just hit my camera mess up my then I think it was a shame all right so you have all of these other companies that are making black-market cards all of these are black-market cards the thing is it's just some companies do it better than others and I don't know why some companies decide to lie about what they're putting in the curt's like trap house they put a rough percentage of your THC content they put all natural high percent organic no PG VG or PE d and they even copy the California sticker the thing is trap house is an alleged company and so these aren't real cards they're fake cards but they're high-quality fake cards if I would say so myself I just finished their Venice og one and like the waxen this was just as good if not better than the wax and these kingpin cards don't hate to kingpin though these were nice um but yeah so like just because it's a car is fake doesn't mean that it's not gonna work the thing is these are full of harmful chemicals not full of them but like Oh some more but these are pure wax they're not gonna harm you these though even though they say they don't have PG or VG they do they're mixed with that it's real wax but it's mixed to dilute it in therefore you get more use out of it the way you can tell if it's a higher quality fake wax is if it moves slowly and if it's like a deep golden color or like yeah a deep golden brown um I think out of all of these carts the worst one I've had was this chronomaly skittles cart obviously the packaging is fake I never seen Khurana play anywhere else it doesn't even have like the fake California label on it oh yeah it does but it's like an even weirder one they always say lab tested on percent organic but they're not like it's very obvious when you're hitting these cards that they are mixed with something some of them here really harsh dank babes as you can see his had to change sorry about that I had to fix my camera back because I'm sort of hit it while I was trying to talk about these dang babes packaging um what I was trying to say was dank babes has had to change their packaging three times since January because other people are now taking their packaging and putting fake tarts inside of already fake cart packages which is such an insane thought to me but it's kind of good that dank vapes likes to like at least change up the way that they're selling theirs think their stuff so that people are at least getting somewhat higher quality wax under thinning that I like another thing that I like about dang vapes is that you can't open these see cell atomizers that they use for their wax they're stuck closed and that's a good thing because the fact that all of these companies mix actual THC like weed wax with VG and PG it makes it harmful for you if you take it out of the cart when you're smoking it in the car it'll make you coffee cuz it's kind of harsh it might taste really good but it's still not that great for you imagine that but worse if you take and open these car packages and then you try to actually dab the wax from them Auto break some of these companies make it so that you can unscrew the top of their carts you can refill them obviously but then you can also take the wax out and that's where you can run into problems once you burn the wax that's mixed with VG and PG on a rig it can be super harmful for you because we're not supposed to be combusting those chemicals they're used in actual vape juice that you would mix with nicotine for people to stop smoking they're not meant to be used for THC cartridges obviously you can use them and people are but I feel like people should just put out the information that yes these are fake yes they do work but you have to at least also be careful with them and know what you're getting yourself into before you start trying to like just smoke cards out of the blue and thinking that all of these these are legit I'm pretty sure even exotic like their wax is around the same quality as dank vapes I'm not sure if they're super legit but I know that their wax is not like an amazing quality wax it's decent but it's not great these trap house cards they are pretty good I would suggest them just as highly as I would suggest at King pen but only with the information that these are mixed with VG and that they can harm you and I think like my basic opinion is that these cards while they are fake are just as good as legit carts as long as you know hey I'm sort of damaging my body by using these and you just continue with the information in mind if you can get legit carts I would highly suggest doing that because while they may not like get you as high as these like immediately you might take me need to take a few more hits but these also last longer they're more healthy for you and I mean the smoke is super smooth so it doesn't feel like I was harming myself at all when I was using these cards these carts are probably cheaper and more available to you so if that's your like only choice try some of them out but like try to figure out what brands you prefer over the ones that are like sort of harmful um I feel like this video ended up being a bit of a ramble I'm sorry about that but I also hope that if you did watch you enjoyed and um yeah I'll just catch you all next time see you", "2CdBAScteUQ": "what's up guys and gals welcome back to the dell'Amore show I'm your host one more we're gonna be doing another clean curse review before you jump into that I like to say let's come to it's not created for or intended for children so if you're chill skedaddle get up body it so I'm not quite done with lemon tree although I'm almost Elementary and my girls ready to try the gelato so Ruby trying to gelato 33 July of 33 from clean carts as a hybrid its THC is only 75 point 46 but the CBD is their point 33 percent so it's really high on the CBD side so I'm expecting this one to be really relaxing I'm also X every rendition of gelato that I've had tastes delicious tastes just like gelato ice cream and with my experiences with the flavors with clink Arts so far I'm expecting this gelato not to fail on the taste side I'm expecting it to be yummy so with that being said let's go ahead and pop that in we're gonna screw off lemon tree which was delicious by the way and we're gonna crank up in this gelato brand new if you guys have had this flavor let me know what you think about it in the comments section let me know what your favorite flavor is and if you want to leave even more information in the comment section you can rank your top 3 flavors Frank your top 3 flavors all right so this is gelato from Claire clean carts sorry so I'll clean carts here we go smells good it tastes amazing but what's wild is I feel like it hit really hard so I felt like I'm gonna have to turn the chap down which is wild cuz the last couple months oh yeah that's max last couple ones one two three there we go oh you never feel it like like right here you feel it right there that's when you know it's smacking three one two three when I'm blue I'm gonna try it on green so using a hybrid but I do believe that I'm gonna have a new a start in the mail here soon and when I do I'll definitely do it unboxing for that so make sure you subscribe for when I get my new vase dark one two three one two three we're on green that's the second level second highest level I'm gonna try and take another stroke off of this these clean carts be stroking it's literally like hitting a burner you get that that it's good yes so what I recommend gelato 100% it tastes really good it bakes on a lower temp which is great because that means it'll last a little longer it's really yummy I want to find out what my girl thinks I'll let you guys know in the next episode so with that being said

"kz1nVMODQ4o": "oh my god you guys hey guys how's it going so thanks for being here in my bedroom and i'm going to do another dmt trip so i said i was going to go for a big one so i think i'm just going to go for a big one and i also said i'd do my next one in the park but i don't think i want to go for a huge trip in that park so i'll do the big trip here now in my bedroom and then i'll do like a milder trip out there in the coming weeks i got some music playing but i'm gonna you know cancel it out of my video it's um carbon based life forms i don't know if you've ever listened to them but they play pretty mellow electronic music and i got the lights fairly dim as you can see and i got this really nice video for visuals that i put up on my screen in case i end up leaving my eyes open which sometimes i do and i will link that in the description if you want to check out what i was watching and i'll link the carbon based life forms album 2 which i'm listening to anyways i'll be using a dmt cartridge which don't ask me how i got it or where to get them guys i've been getting that that question a lot in the comments i don't want that stuff in my comments or not you guys i mean new viewers probably if you're new to the channel that's just keep that in mind just you know do your own research where there's a will there's a way get get resourceful i had a friend who who had the cartridges so i got lucky with that i don't really know where he got them all right so i'm not really like in a very talky make a video mood but i wanted to document my trip so uh if you don't mind i'm just gonna get to it and then if i feel like speaking about it later i will speak about it later but maybe i'll just do that tomorrow or something i just wanted to film the actual trip itself because i just wanted to trip tonight you know you get it you know what i'm trying to say so so we'll see or i might end up talking afterwards i don't know sometimes i have a trip and it's just so like intense i just sort of feel like waiting a bit like i said in my last video i lost the mouthpiece the tip just the tip i lost and um so i have to like make sure my lips go around it you know so that's why i'm hitting it funny if it looks like i'm hitting it funny and i'm gonna lie down i prefer to lie down usually sometimes i sit up but usually i'm like taking a hit or something and i got to deal with that so it's nice to have the pen i can just lie down and put it in here after i that's why i got this because because the tip is missing it will leak out if i hold it upside down so i gotta like keep it upright that's not quite small enough actually i'll put this cloth in here there we go genius such a genius okay guys thanks for watching the video i do lots of videos like this so check out my channel for more trip reports and stuff like that and um there's music and there's just you know okay boys and girls i bid you farewell is that that's that is that what they say it's an old english thing right i bid the i bid the farewell okay i think that's about it i'm ready i'm tired i find dmt is good if you're like tired and getting ready for bed if you're relaxed skip you're in a relaxed mood for sure i'm stalling i'm stalling [Applause] here we go [Music] uh [Music] huh [Music] [Music] so [Music] sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep [Music] um [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] um oh my god you guys oh my god [Music] oh [Music] oh my god [Music] it was pointing at me it told me oh my god you guys [Music] the coordinates tracking my like eye movement i'm just saying this so i don't forget later sorry if it doesn't make sense the coordinates it's pointing out to me what the fuck it's trying to decide whether or not to close my eyes it's always something i struggle with and when i was doing that it felt like the trip was getting mad at me and then when i just and then i decided to leave them open and i think i was telling it was telling me like it doesn't matter it doesn't matter like nothing you say or do matters really it's in control always and my god the further i get away from it the less ability i have to describe what i just saw fuck still really high i wasn't blacking out at any point but like i still can't it's like it's trying to make me forget like i saw how the universe worked there's some being that can just do whatever it wants whenever it wants it can move wherever it wants and just you know i saw different reality different universes multiverses and just oh my god maybe the details will come like what the fuck i kept saying too like i should talk about this because i'm gonna i'm gonna forget later but i'm like no no i'll remember i'll remember it all makes sense and then just every minute that goes by makes it's less and less sense but i just saw what the fuck [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] watch i wasn't recording this whole time i'm still recording thank god well that was cool i just saw the universe work to you guys and it looked like it was like okay hear me out it's not gonna make much sense but this is the best i can describe it like every universe was on like a string and it was like sort of moving they were sort of moving towards me like they're all connected but when i was trying to decide whether to open or close my eyes this like entity came it was invisible an invisible entity but i could sense it was there and where it was it suddenly moved like through the realities and was getting mad at me it's like it came from wherever it was all the way here to tell me that sorry let me just mute my music i came from wherever just just to tell me like just to tell me where was i holy fuck this is so hard to talk about i came oh yeah i came from wherever was just to tell me it doesn't matter like when my eyes are open or closed like stop thinking about all that stupid shit and i didn't see any entities as usual i don't see entities sometimes i do they're usually robots but uh this time it wasn't except that that that entity i guess you would call it but it was like invisible and then also when it was telling me not to um it doesn't matter if your eyes are open and closed it wasn't telling it to me it was telling it to something else i don't know what that was and i was just like obser observing that that that message what was it talking to like maybe my brain and i the observer like the soul i guess you can refer to it as or whatever was the one observing that you know which sort of like lends to the idea like the separation of body and soul you know like two separate things like you and your life aren't the same thing look at this pose i'm sitting in this very i don't know it feels right though okay i'm not a two-year-old sit like a man oh where did this come from was i holding this the whole time i don't know i don't know i just don't know um the visuals are very cool like yeah i realize now definitively i know now it doesn't matter if your eyes are open or closed people always have that debate if you smoke enough um like maybe it will vary the experience but it not the intensity of it or how good it is necessarily you know like if you smoke enough if your eyes are open it'll take whatever you're looking at and transform that into whatever so like i was looking at you know my room became all multiple universes like on a thread like reeling past me and then this fucking being darting around it was like this that was like the master i don't want to say god because it wasn't that it didn't seem benevolent either it didn't seem evil but it just it seemed like it was getting shit done it was busy and it didn't it seemed a little angry that it had to be there to tell me like deal with this trivial shit like it had better things to do i got the sense and it's like you know tell this idiot whoever it was talking to he doesn't need to or he wasn't he didn't call me an idiot but i got the sense that he was frustrated like short he she whatever it and um it was like yeah tell tell him it doesn't matter you know or it wasn't even saying tell him it was just talking to him it was like it doesn't matter and i was just like observing it and i didn't hear those words it was just i got the sense that's what uh it was trying to communicate to my body or whatever it was talking to um the visuals like afterwards and then before that seems like a short trip also i start talking like while i'm still tripping and i think that's what sort of takes me out of it because i'm like aware i wasn't for a second or two but i'm aware that i'm recording and doing a chirp report so i start like i start talking sitting up while like most people still probably have their eyes closed i don't know or maybe it wasn't short maybe just uh that's my perception of it that was fucking intense though it's funny the visuals i had on my screen oh yeah another thing too the audio went it muted itself i'm gonna have to check uh the playback and see like if my actual audio muted because i have music playing i'm just i'm gonna cut out the parts when i'm not talking um i'm going to check if it actually muted because that was weird because at one point i was hearing the music and it just cut out completely it was silent for a few seconds which is a weird hallucination like canceling out your sound that's pretty like intense like it has some like pretty high permissions in your brain to be able to like access that that sort of shit like mute all sounds you know that's like administrator privileges you know like you can't just mute the fucking sound in my brain like what are you doing it's crazy it did though and then well oh yeah when i was closing and opening my eyes i don't know if i was or not but i think if you if you look in the video they'll show a part where i'm like sort of like opening and closing them i was like going back and forth at least my memory tells me that's what i did during that part like all the effects were like flickering on and off like i mentioned in my when did i mention that i think it was in my live stream i don't know but i was talking about how sometimes the effects they just flicker on and off like an rgb cable being wiggled in the back of an old computer you'd see the colors just flicker instantly right and what was oh yeah that was happening when it's opening closing the eyes with everything all the effects it's just like very computer simulated like themes of simulation here but not not totally this time that that entity seemed beyond beyond like a computer simulation you know uh it's weird too when that's happening it's like oh my god i have the answer this is crazy but so that's like a delusional thought obviously but i'm still there i'm still conscious because i remember thinking like wait till i tell my subscribers i got to see her to the universe like this is going to make a banger video you know meaning of life and i'm at for a good 30 seconds 20 seconds 30 seconds i thought that i'm like i know i know everything i know the answer and uh i can't wait this can make a great video isn't that funny and then slowly it starts you start realizing like wait a second that can't be true and i know it's not true because every trip is like different like last trip like something else was the answer now the answer is this you know there's several meanings to life apparently but this i've never had a trip where i imagined something that it's like beyond like something i couldn't come up with myself you know so i'm not convinced that dmt is um anything supernatural just yet but i don't find it any less poetic or beautiful or spiritual or anything like that you know it's just to me it's a testament to how complex the human brain is and how incredible nature is you know in life itself life is the trip as i say dmt is just like i made this analogy to someone earlier in the comments life okay dmt is like a program and life is like the operating system you know what i mean like psychedelic trips are just a small thing that happens within life oh my shit's about to shut off i think or no i just split the recording so part of it might just cut out so i'm just gonna repeat what i just said i forget what i just said fuck am i scratching my nuts geez okay ignore the last 10 seconds i'm probably going to keep it in for comedic effect but ignore it that was a really cool trip that every trip has a different vibe to it there's like a few main categories each one is unique but there's some broader categories too like some of them are funny some of them are very spiritual and uplifting like my two live trips one and two those ones were very spiritual and uplifting and afterwards i felt like at peace with the world i don't really have that this time although i do feel good but um i this one was more like the ones based in outer space always have the same vibe to them and those ones are all about like how the universe works and god and stuff like that and higher powers and those ones are fascinating not necessarily positive or overwhelmingly positive or scary just it feels like it's showing me the truth so it's it's not trying to be anything it's just the truth right and it's those ones are like awesome not like awesome like you know like awesome dude like it's full of awe you know awe inspiring like mind mind-blowing and just i don't know i'm going to have to look back at the tape but i'm pretty sure i was just like oh really good like five minutes not that long three or four minutes maybe i don't know it's funny i'm like the visuals on my screen ended up being like the least interesting thing ever i'm like looking at universes suddenly i'm going to watch i want to watch this youtube visual oh i've had youtube visuals turn into amazing things before so that's why i throw them on sometimes thing barely went down too how many hits that i i tried to take more hits but i couldn't feel the pen anymore it felt like it was over here and my jaw was like disconnecting and like it was like numb and shit you know when you don't know like where the pen is or how to hit it or and this thing's easy to hit when you you can't feel it you know that's when you're good to go this is a pretty strong pen or the liquid i think both um seems to work really well compared to most anecdotes i've heard about the efficacy of these pens a lot of people say it's really hard for them to get like a breakthrough dose that was like borderline breakthrough so that was like a low-level breakthrough dose i would say i don't like the term breakthrough but for those of you who go by that system i would say this is like a barely breakthrough barely i broke through barely it wasn't like uh as intense as some breakthrough trips i've had and it doesn't definitely wasn't sub breakthrough i was yeah i was out of here and when that fucking entity started beaming around i felt so powerless like i felt like oh fuck like this thing is boss whatever you i couldn't see it i just sense where it was it was invisible i'm wheezy okay that was great guys i think i'm gonna play some video games smoke a big bowl of marijuana and um maybe have it no no i gotta quit drinking fuck for real for real i gotta quit drinking i gotta stop masturbating snow not november is not going well guys what is it it's fucking february i think i need another extension i failed again i failed every day every day i failed no not november in february so the ninth extension this thing is dope as fuck i hate smoking empty even if you're doing bong hits which is like the easiest way to smoke tmt it's still kind of like a bit of a process to get the lighter to pull the ball out you know just it's it's hard on your second or third hit to do that this thing's fucking easy though i took double poles like someone suggested to me in the comments whoever what that was thank you good idea because this thing cuts out after five seconds so but if you just stop and then start again it resets the timer so um i could take two hits in one that that way essentially that fucking second hit i took or was it the third i don't know that was a huge fucking hit and i held those in for a long time you guys i have a pretty big lung capacity so i think it's easy easier for me than most people to get the dose in you know like i imagine for someone who doesn't smoke weed every day um it would be much harder much much harder to take hits like that because dmt is pretty harsh it's harshly different way it doesn't burn because it's vaporized but it's it's it's spikier you know it's got a i don't know if you know what i mean by that but it spikes your lungs more than weed weed is like it's hot obviously because you burn it and it can burn if you take a big hit but i don't know vapor has like it's like the initial feeling when you you take it in is harsher for the empty for sure but then once it's in there then it's fine work weeds the other way around it kind of burns more and more the more you hold it in uh no nausea at all which is good okay guys i'm sorry if the camera just uh changed angles and it was jarring i apologize but i finished the vlog then i went and got a hot dog which i would which i can't wait to eat but but a couple more details came to me and i will forgo eating this hot dog i'm not foregoing it i'm putting it off i will eat this hot dog but a couple details came to me while i was in the kitchen that i forgot to talk about so during the trip i talked about i think i mentioned i blurted out like eye coordinates or something like that that was supposed to be a reminder for me to talk about it later because i couldn't explain it at the time but i knew i'd be able to later i want this offering so bad this happened to me in at least 10 trips before and in a couple of my last ones i keep forgetting to mention it though but at the very beginning when i'm coming up and i'm looking around i'll see numbers in the corner two numbers and i'll see like a crosshair in my vision like tracking my eye movement and it moves wherever i move my eye and the numbers change depending where i'm looking like they're coordinates tracking my eye movement like an x and a y coordinate it's very weird another thing too is in the trips where like it's the universe being revealed to me how it works in those trips like in outer space at the very beginning often it's like you've been chosen we're selecting you it doesn't say that but i it's like i hear i sense what they're trying to say without hearing the audio so it would be like you know you're chosen like you're special basically we're showing you how the universe works and you're going to be the messiah you're going to be the one to like tell everyone about this and i i get that sense and i've gotten that sense in several trips probably at least five before where it's like you've been chosen almost like a lottery like uh out of like trillions infinite number of souls they chose me to like give me the secrets and then i'm gonna go and tell everybody apparently that's how it works and that's weird that i get that but i've gotten that yeah several times i just wanted to mention that okay back to the video or maybe the video is ending now i don't know where i'm going to insert this clip so maybe bye i love you guys or maybe back to the show i don't know i'm leaving my options open it's hot talk time i deserve this hot dog pro tip pro tip if you're microwaving a hot dog throw the bun in there for a good 10 seconds the water molecule something happens to them in the bun in it it gets soft and like reinvigorates the bun especially if they were in the fridge microwaved that bun i had a couple drinks too and um smoked some weed not like pretty much right before the trip i broke the rules guys i broke the rules that pro pretty much is a rule though i would say if you do if you don't have a tolerance to weed or alcohol oh that's black that's black that's not a good color no weed you're smoking weed yet um i guess it's essentially resin building up in your in your in your in your phlegm i'm gonna say it no one likes that word but it it is it's phlegm you guys that's fine though doesn't mean anything bad it's just black you know black doesn't necessarily mean death you guys doesn't mean it's bad doesn't mean it's evil you know it's just but it's black there's a little blackness okay okay you know guys i've been feeling good in the last few months relatively speaking and [Music] i pretty i pretty much attribute that directly to my channel and how it's been doing it's been doing good and i just want to thank you guys again really thank you thank you so much you guys rock and i hope you enjoyed the video you know more to come more to come this thing hasn't even gone down that much so i feel like i got a good i don't know 10 10 videos at least out of this pen so that's that's gonna be great for the channel and it's great for you you guys like it right so everyone's everyone's winning i get i get what i get charlie sheen now that's it i'll end the video here like i said i didn't want to make a video tonight right but i think i got everything i think this will be a good nice easy edit i didn't stall too much so there's not too many cuts and that's it okay all right thank you guys for watching peace out uh i love you cheers much love be safe [Music] [Music] alright [Music] you", "F1Gj0gPR_Lk": "hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day today we're gonna be answering some questions that you sent to us through YouTube or Instagram and yeah everybody's gonna be anonymous for privacy purposes so here we go question number one new to vaping what factor does voltage play in to vaping amazing question first of all I would say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than that I would say you know give customer service a call I'm sure we can take care of it for you that'll do it for today guys hope that was helpful let us know if you want to see more of these send in your questions I want to know I want to answer them but yet peace",

"if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand new video today I got yet again another select wax cartridge I got you guys man you guys been doing these like wax cartridges I went for the hybrid I went for the cherry pie and so a little bit about this it's a hybrid I believe it's more than a sativa science I'm pretty sure because sometimes when it's yellow it's kind of like a sativa hybrid you know so it is cherry pie and I've tried this only like once or twice just because I throw this and I I bought this and all we're having at me and some of the guys were having a sesh so we just kind of threw this some rode oh and man like this man I only have it just a little bit enough just to kind of show you guys look at that all right right there so like always everybody we got to select you guys see that right there we like it that I just like that 83% zero six eighty three point zero six percent THC and it's some cherry pie you guys know was good I'm completely sober right now so we're gonna see how many hits it takes for us to get lit so cherry pie everybody again welcome to another podcast I hope you guys are enjoying these also everybody makes you guys drop a like the comment subscribe 18 another educational purposes like always everybody make sure you guys once again actually let's take let's take the first shrimp so on there's if we got a brand new pen this pen is actually a little bit different the red is actually the lowest setting the blue is like the medium and the green is like the highest so I'm just like wait what cheers everybody see if I could get like a taste okay so it does kind of become like a bit like a little cherry like a little cherry aftertaste like a little punch like a little cherry punch hmm see the cool thing that I like about select cartridges and regarding cartridges is they don't really be adding a lot of flavor sometimes when they be adding flavor that shit's kind of like a bad chemical you know I mean I'm pretty sure it's a pretty bad chemical you know if they were to add some flavor on it might be not too harmful but I mean if you guys are damn [ __ ] you guys are heinous [ __ ] all day you know it's just definitely bad for you but these happens man these are coming these be coming and going like crazy so look at that we got the little select logo um I think there is a couple pink ones bro like that strip tap fake select I feel like nowadays man they could probably make anything bro literally anything for example like again you guys know this I already tried on fake brass not though I seen fake King pens I've seen what other fake it's mainly brass knuckle I've seen a couple fake heavy hitters and it's just like damn people are thinking like man I'm getting the jug but in reality you guys are just can that custom that home that custom made oil could be a little bit cheap who knows some plugs can potentially make some good fire stuff so who knows but let's take another first hit select does not disappoint I mean out of all of them out of all of them I feel like select is top 3 I gotta admit top 3 when it comes to like actually getting lit again select does have like a little meaning like a point 3 cartridge which is like an ax it's in high 90 percent THC and oh my god roll you take a rip of that 1 or 2 a deer man but it's not around like 40 50 bucks just for that little piece of like super concentrated THC it's crazy but a cheers OH I think now I feel like I can probably tell the difference from a lot of wax cartridges like this definitely has select I'll written all over like all of them have like different tastes if it's crazy the raw garden one you can tell right away like bro if I were to close my and I woulda hit a wrong garden and if I were to know if I were to hit a rock garden I'd be able to tell it's like you know chewing out a piece of leaf you know piece of tree piece of bush and that's the leg type I got that it's so weird I'm not I'm horrible at explaining especially explaining a taste but it has like this let me see if let me see if I can explain to you guys definitely I think select cartridge is a lot better than a Moxie but the Moxie does have a really great flavor but again you know that's what a lot of people say you know when it has a good it has like a good candy type flavor and yeah it's definitely not good for you you know because they'd be adding stuff for the flavors because in reality it's like okay if they were to press a certain tree huh you know what there's just so much to it man I there's so much learning to this to this industry you know like I just I just keep thinking about it like it doesn't make sense because sometimes when you don't taste something I'm just like okay cool it's legitly the concentration you know it's literally the oil from the flower you know it's nothing else added to it which makes it just taste like like literally just one single taste which is kind of dough same with raw garden that's what I figured you know Rob garden it always has like the same flavor that same strong flavor with like maybe a little hint of something and you can tell but it depends on the flower like the natural flower you know but sometimes we have like for example I'm not saying heavy hitters brass knuckles and all that stuff sucks or anything like that I'm still gonna cop some here and there but I'm saying like the flavor is too artificial like it's not artificial but it definitely for me I feel like they could potentially add some something to it just so I could get that flavor you know but I could be wrong you know I could be wrong that's just my thought but again everybody I'm not saying to not buy those brands you know because in reality they are you know proved as long as you guys are like like legitly getting them from like the club or the you know the dispensary and stuff you guys aren't really getting them from your local drug dealer cuz your local drug dealer listen to this you guys I talk about this in all pretty much all my wax cartridge videos because sometimes you know these guys they could probably make the wax you know the oil pretty good and you know what hey you got yourself a good cartridge homemade wax you know but at least it's like nothing crazy you know but then there's also other cartridges you know for example like in my experience what I had is like you know I poked out in a couple times and they just turned brown and I'm just like yo this does not look normal yeah it was like a thirty dollar brass knuckle you know like it was definitely fake it was not it was not the real brass knuckles of faith it was a fake brass knuckle but that's one way you guys could see and sometimes let's chop the other sensitivities 1 2 3 I think it's just good 3 oh wait a minute green as the middle one look at that that green is definitely the better wood yeah green is definitely the middle one tastes a lot more made-up fatter cloud and I do see a couple people sometimes like there was this um I had a friend that they came to visit me during my lunch yeah my old job right and they were like eh like you smug and I was just like well I mean sometimes you know not all crazy she's like they're like oh I got a I got a wax pen right I'm not gonna call them out or anything but like yeah I got a wax Maran I was like yeah that's good so they took it out right and I looked at it don't like have a halfway smoke and I was like what is this it was like some off-brand you know wax cartridge right and I was like I like bro you're selling your smug on some fake ass [ __ ] didn't it was just like so black the oil will you see this right here the oil it's like halfway through maybe like they smoked it like right here no no maybe like right there like literally get halfway and I guess what they said was that it just started turning black and I was like dude you know that's like when that's when it's fake and I was like what kind of car is it was like some designer brand not a designer brand I come it was some type of brand where I'm just like - right off the bed I'm just like yeah man you got to turn me little your local drug dealer huh you know my head I'm like why you know 1 2 3 all right let's try it off in the in the max um setting well I have your cloud the taste it's not too gay Don the highest win oh not too good this pen is to spit it's $50 pen don't get me wrong it's a nice pen but definitely not for Lake we tried a couple well we tried a couple um we tried a couple of these select cartridges already I liked select so it was literally like the first one to go to like this is the one that I wouldn't always like gay you know it's really good brand you know but right now the brand that I've kind of uh have been buying lately there's a lot of regarding rocker and is really nice rock garden is a good one but don't get me wrong rock garden and select are way different and they're both good so you know you could either go this router this round or you know cop one of each but definitely switch off you know mine I'm definitely gonna cop another Moxie cart I really like the flavor I mean it's some light resident in a wax cartridge you know and it's it's only $25 1/2 gram this one was about $35 1/2 gram I believe or 25 no no no I think this was 20 bucks I think $20 a minute there look at the thing dude half gram was like 25 I believe 25 um so it's not that bad whatsoever you know I like it it's a hybrid it doesn't have me all slump or like super awake I mean I like that super awake feeling you know the sativa that way I could be very productive but right now it's almost gonna be 9 p.m. so might as well you know just hit some in because and stuff like they're you know such it's pretty good oh one thing that a lot of people do not know and then my dumb ass just remembered especially here right here let's check this out so the directions or suggested serving a suggested serving which is one serving is three seconds so this is one serving I think I went a little overboard at three four seconds but three to four seconds is one serving and there is a hundred and twenty five servings so it's so let's see so let's start off it says right here look one three second draw and close cartridge contains 125 servings so what one three second draw is a so three times 125 so if we were to drag this it would take 375 seconds and if we were to do that and be around six or seven minutes so wait a minute so six or seven minutes of you pump that makes sense because if you're just gonna go sir like four minutes you'll smoke the whole thing hmm six eight minutes of hitting and that's why I love having baby hits - oh okay now that - that was just like a little fact that I just like read from the back a lot of people don't really know but yeah usually it's like a three to four second scene and I'm different once I'm pretty sure it's for all of them it's for the 510 thread the the pens or whatever but um um so three to four three to four seconds is one hit yeah but you have around 125 settings so if you were to take at least one serving a day that's literally a 125 1/2 gram of this but that means you have to be like super lightweight you never had any type of th in your blood whatsoever you know oh and another thing too that I'm just spacing out at this point what at this point pretty much what you want to do is I guess one of my boys put me on actually shot up oil yeah shout out chicken but pretty much when you hate when you have a pen you want to hit it right you hit it and then you have to wait I think maybe like 30 second I believe I freaking forgot but he said 30 seconds or more you have to you want to wait like 30 seconds in between that way it kind of cools down you know because if it's too hot the coils it might not burn right you know you might not get the best like the full potential of the hit you know so you want to make sure that you wait at least 30 seconds let it kind of cool down is that way so you can get like the best you know now I'm gonna try to tell everybody that because he told me that I'm just like dude I see people just rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out past I see a little person rip it blow it out and I'm just like damn maybe that's all the wax is being over burnt and it's not even like I mean at the same time it's it's gonna get burned you know it's gonna file but if you want to have like a perfect hit that's when you have to wait at least like over 30 seconds that's what he told me you know and in my head I'm just like yeah it makes kind of sense but let me know in the comments down below what do you guys think crazy stuff man but I just said bad but man but if you say man isn't but right out it just sounds like Pampa that's crazy so there we have it everybody we have some elite select cherry pie hybrid wax cartridge I hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure you guys drop a like a comment subscribe again this is the podcast thank you guys

fire", "HN4QHsTUdCk": "[Music] what is up y'all p2 peeps back with another live resin cartridge video and this time it's the cart comps friendly farms edition that's right we seem to be on a roll with these kind of things for car comp so i wanted to make the next episode another live resin one so well i mean this one's a resin episode i guess because we're doing cured resin not live resin sorry cured resin so this is the friendly farm secured resin comparison here we have the gelato 41 in my left hand and the oreo cream cured resin in my right so we'll go into how the initial tastes are how they feel and then place them into our rating slash tier system based on t-e-s taste effect and satisfaction yeah this one's a little different we're doing a live one don't really do this too often but yeah so uh gelato 41 and oreo cream they're like parent strains i'll put them up here here some you know somewhere there but uh yeah so let's get into the initial hits and how they taste so i know you guys uh already know how they might taste from the other videos that i've done on them but you know let's let's go take our hits and discuss yeah for those of you who haven't seen them so this is the geelong gelato this is the gelato 41 and uh yeah we're about to take a hit so pack yourself a bowl pack yourself a dab all that good stuff get your pen ready you know because we're about to get cheer boys so very much like i said in uh the original video it's got the gelato for one's got a very terpy kind of piney ish taste a little citrus neatness in it too but um it's mostly like it tastes like actual gelato when you smoke it in like a joint or a blood especially like really really really well grown indoor gelato so the flavor on this thing is out of this world it's definitely capturing the buds natural flavors and we love that so uh we'll move on to our next one the oreo cream so yeah like before pack yourself a bowl dab wax cart pen get that ready all that good stuff cheers [Music] like i said in the other videos doughy creamy very light not as thick as some some other live resin flavors but that's very very light so now we'll move into the next portion how do they feel so uh i get an instant smack with the oreo cream you know i have lower back pain so i felt the high concentrate in that area it's really soothing really smooth you almost forget you hit it sometimes because it's just it's just that smooth i really cough when i hit this thing gelato 41 gets me in the eyes that's where i that's where i feel at first you know i start feeling like they put on some pounds you know they get a little heavy and then i get that nice little happy feeling in my head uh like like a little light bulb just turned on and then it just flows slowly down to the rest of the body um surprised because i thought it'd be the other way around uh in terms of effects so i mean you know that that's that's how i've uh experienced them and um yeah so obviously i can't really uh comment on how i'm feeling right now because it's just a mix of both of them right but as you can tell from my other videos you know i i have a little bit better of a understanding from from you know hitting them solo and doing my own experimentation on how they you know how they feel so i i get it so now we'll move into doing our rating and tier list i guess uh maybe not the tier list but the ratings so for our cartridge comparisons and our cartridge reviews things like that we will be assigning ratings based on grades and then eventually place them into tiers for the cart comp season finale so ratings like i said before are rating grades i'm sorry i'm sorry are done by taste effect and satisfaction so before we get into this i do have to say guys this is arbitrary you know this this the taste and the satisfaction and effect stuff these are really hard things to actually measure right so i am measuring this with you know my own thoughts formulated opinions et cetera et cetera so there might be some inherent virus biases and things like that i try not to be biased in any sort of way so you know i try to think of it from the lower level consumer level you know people who just want to get high and just don't really care people who are kind of in the mid range where they they do their research but they don't care as much and then people who are in a higher range people who do a lot of research or care a lot about where their products come from and where they're made so that's the kind of consideration i put into all the gradings without that being said you know the grades are a b c and d and yeah so jumping right into it the oreo cream here for taste i'm giving it an a for effect i'm also giving it an a and a satisfaction i'm also giving it an a gelato 41 same thing taste effect and satisfaction all a's so which did i like better and why and since i gave them both all like you know straight a scores you know they both have the same ratings but if i had to pick a winner i'm going with the gelato 41. i'll admit this is solely because of bias and i know i said before i try to keep it unbiased and all these things but in this situation where things are evenly matched yeah where things are evenly matched then i guess i gotta go for you know the preference my internal bias i'm in more favor of gelato and cookie type strains because it's just it's just what i like it's what i um it was what i kind of grew up on i guess you could say for my stoner life but yeah although i will say though that the oreo creams flavor is unmatched see i like the overall um feel and taste and things you know that i get out of this the gelato 41 but the oreo cream is definitely just that it just tastes so good i think this is the best like flavored cart hands down that i've tried so yeah like i said before arbitrary ratings based on my taste buds preferences and yes you know the average for me is a c here highest grade is an s but we won't be giving out any s's until we get to the season finale so yeah i hope you all enjoyed this uh kind of live cart comps episode normally i do like a voice over with some footage and stuff but yeah we're doing it live this time yeah let me know what you guys think about the format down below and if there's any segments or improvements you'd like to suggest please do so yeah thank you all for watching and don't forget to like comment

cart cartridge review some cheaper cartridges going around adding two weeks in a row now Keene cartridge got a lemon and a Bluegreen 1/2 gram and a 1 gram legally completely different cannabis oil me inside of these two different size cartridges I have no idea why I'm glad I tried the second one is it was night and day difference I have no idea why that is a half gram cartridges or I found this one little dispensary Nirvana not my favorite just been three but they just print three as well you know they they have good prices on car projects especially if you buy two i got the half gram king the lemon i don't think it's a lemon OG anything like that i think it's just dad living food terpene it was a really really dark oil pretty much empty you can kind of see how dark it is in the bottom there compared to that [Music] but the Blue Dream you know it's a cannabis strain terpene or carpet lease boy that I don't know lemon 1/2 gram OG get it out of here crap you only got 20 bucks both taxes what that was hey you get a buzz you know just a taste wasn't the best $20 can't can't beat cannot beat the one gram here get them at the same place there are a lot of other places I'm sure mr. 17 may be dropping some around may not I don't know if he's gonna even go that route maybe just better ones definitely try the one gram the last one I had was a wooden ship it was really good this was a black porcelain tip it actually says something signature on the it is some kind of a brand name cart if you can see when it does have on the stem their signature lol of something signature something I get over but it's been a good one [Music] I found this you can get these at that same shop I'm the cheapest I've seen him as 30 plus tax for the one gram and that's I take 40s a more normal price own but you know go to that one shop buy two you get them for that along tons are my one you can get them for that so it's definitely a budget budget cartridge but I am on a budget so that's good that's good I might actually probably be rolling with these quite a bit let's see if I can keep the people in they keep the quality up and the price of that same price but that one dispensary I might be on me [Music] you don't know about the damn care that's the white V to fix this king cartridge amazingly you get the v3 pretty soon probably when they hit town all right I'm gonna make this quick little download over 420 already though so everybody have a good one big shout out to the man here up and get great medicine all over this town so see you guys later take er easy keep it growing up twisty twisty OKC Thunder seed mmm I like that started to stretch I got it fixed she's doing great so twisty coming along and the other one didn't do so well but it was a random I got all my faith in these twisties everybody have a good one and take her easy again", "2J2RJBMJoSs": "hey guys just wanted to show off this raw garden i just got i didn't even know that they made little batteries for

THC man I'm back at it with the banger now look you guys this is gonna be part of my cheapest versus most expensive series where I go to different dispensaries and I try out different products right so last time I tried out flower I got the cheapest eighth and the most expensive eight in Washington State today I'm in Las Vegas so I visited planet 13 which by the way if you're in Vegas and you have to choose between reef and planet 13 I highly recommend you go to Planet 13 I felt like it was a way better dispensary they had a lot more options it was a lot more open and you were able to really move around and look at everything they had I went down there and this time I decided that we're gonna be reviewing their cheapest versus the most expensive cartridge now before I show you the product I just want to give him an understanding of how much everything came up to okay so for the half gram the most expensive half gram it was priced at $100 before tax right now I bought let me see how many items you got we got one two three four or five how about five items here that I bought and it was $55 in taxes so let's just give it you know let's just say that every item had $10 tax to it right just the same so that means that that $100 half gram is now 110 dollars because of the tax not to mention that this half gram didn't come with the battery so I had to buy a 15 dollar battery now the fifteen dollar battery doesn't really have a ten dollar tax to it but just because I'm dividing up the total tax that I was charged for everything that I purchased I just thought that I would throw it in there and had another $10 to the battery to substitute for the tax so now we're at a twenty five dollar battery and that a hundred and ten dollar and a half gram so that puts us at a hundred and thirty five dollars in total tax included battery included cartridge included with a half gram which is really pricey if you ask me and for the cheapest cartridge it was fifty five dollars which was a disposable cart which means that he already came with the ability for you to use it you didn't have to buy the battery on this I was fifty five dollars but now adding the $10.00 tax that I might need to all the items it was about it $65 cartridge right there now this is pretty expensive this is a Las Vegas prices I know Cali would have been wait jeepers like never in my life have I paid over $100 or even a $100 bro for a half gram of distillate like what the hell because I'm pretty sure this is just a little right I don't think it doesn't say anything about like live resin oh it is live resin my bad so not for distillate its life resin but still man this is an expensive cartridge right here you guys so this is what the expensive one looks like right here it comes in this fancy box which I'll give it to them I mean at least they you know they message some of that money that they're charging for this product into the way that the box looks now I'm gonna break down for you guys the whole entire like THC percentage etc etc you know what I'm saying so so the THC percentage test at eighty two point 61% CBD is zero there's no that there's no CBD and there there's cbn 11.1 total terpene so the terpenes is actually like the flavor profile to your product right it's gonna determine how the product tastes and all these flavors and aromas also play a role into how the high hits you so the terpenes are actually really really important this has an eight point zero five percent terpene base which is really hot especially for a live resin so this is supposed to be really gas that's actually what you're paying for when you're buying this product you're paying to get more trips to get more flavor and more quality out of your high and since it's life present it's gonna give you a way better higher than the distillate I personally hate hitting distillate man like when I first started I just I didn't know any better so that's just what I would do but after trying like the life resident I was just like all bro you can't go back to just regular distillate now look I'm gonna open it up and show you guys what it looks like when you open it a little box in here you see that boom Wow what look at that you guys it's like sick now they have their logo right in the front it's crazy because the guy at the shop was like just smell it smell it oh my god it smells so good it just smells like strong strong concentrate now if we look at the back of the box once it opens up that's how it opens this is what the inside of the package looks like so they're talking about the philosophy provide only world-class cannabis products for customers our state-of-the-art production process utilizes THC distillate and cannabis derived terpenes coupled with premium hardware is simply unmatched this technology consistently delivers an unparalleled vaping experience where elegance meets perfection hmm okay so again 110 dollars right here after tax 15 dollars but since we divided the text evenly do all the five items that I purchased we're gonna add another ten dollars to it and just say that it was a 25 dollar battery after tax 135 dollars right here now I was told that this battery was already gonna be charged and ready to go I believe this is Planet Thirteen's like the branded batteries that they have there we're just gonna go ahead put this on here and take off this top rubber piece now before I go ahead and try this project I'm actually gonna open up the other product that we got and talk about the cheapest wax battery that we got so this is roots I got the cush mango and this one I have a believe all the testing for it I got all the testing right here so mango Kush oh you know what I'm so sorry on the last one oh I did tell you guys the TC percentage tripping I'm high you guys I'm already late alright so for the mango push this one tested really high in THC percentage so THC tested at ninety one point ninety seven percent again this is the cheap one this is the $55 sixty five dollar after tax cartridge right here okay um let me see CBG which I really don't know exactly what that cannabinoid is and test that twenty four point forty nine milligrams look at the terpene percentage though the terpene percentage is at one point zero three so basically this one has eight times the terpene profile than this one so this should make for a way more better quality experience and high but this was more convenient you know this one is just you open up the package right pure and simple you got everything right here in the back okay now when you open up the package this side right here is empty I don't know why but everything is on this side so you can just like use your finger to you know slide bad boy out there oh now it comes like this right you just pop this open and you're ready to go wow that feels good at the finger okay is this what is this what is this okay so roots this is I know these are disposable but why is this like this I don't think that you guys is logo this is basically their local you guys look look at this I don't think you guys just logo should be able to come off that easy I mean I'm pretty sure it wasn't meant to happen like that I'm gonna just put it back for sure it's meant to look like this but first impression mm-hmm you know but yeah guys here you have it to my left side we have planet 13s cheapest babe cartridge that's disposable so you'd have to worry about buying a battery and to my right side their most expensive premium $100 bro 110 after-tax 135 after we add everything up with the battery 65 over here on the Left what do you guys think would you spend over $100 on a oh you guys say [ __ ] that I'm spending $65 after tax out the door and now I don't got to worry about the battery I'm just don't listing away what I'm doing I don't know hey guys we're gonna have to taste them and really see how we feel about them we're gonna go ahead and start off with the roots all right let's go ahead and give this thing a shot now we're gonna try to complain I really want a good to flower look we're gonna do a blinker out of them and if we're gonna do like you know shorter pause and we'll do longer pulls we're kind of play with it a little bit to try to actually get the flavor flavor you know put it down for a second I was like what does it think don't blink Wow dude the room just got foggy my eyes bro my soul left my body okay that was strong that 91 percent THC dude it's different however though it reminded me of like when you hit a dirty Punk no offense I'm not trying to talk [ __ ] you know what I'm saying because wasn't that bad okay hitting a dirty bomb it's a lot worse but I still reminded me of just like when you take one of those rips that just leaves your throat oh you know tasting all nasty and [ __ ] I think that I got really hot too like the disposable battery it took a really long pull so I kept I was feeling like the mouthpiece getting hotter and hotter so maybe it was a little too hot for the product so now we're gonna try small pools medium pools and longer pools to get the flavor out of those but I need to get some water bro god damn alright so there's been a solid ten minutes right off the bad guys the flavors wasn't there dude like I'm sorry you guys can improve on the flavor you know what I didn't write this thing just to lit oh this is hash oil posh this side of that let me see and this is the mango cush I believe is what this train is called the other strain cold it's called medicine Chloe I believe is with this one here is called a hundred percent pure cannabis oil no additives no fillers no synthetic terpenes okay so maybe that's why it has that flavor because it doesn't have faked our booth actually it's obviously pretty good cuz fake Terps or [ __ ] you know you don't want a bunch of fake Terps like dis lis it's just a bunch of fake chirps but it says it's hash oil I don't know is that like I really don't know all right but this is its hat it's premium hash oil so the other one is like resin let's take a short poll and see I'm saying a couple straw polls and just see how like it tastes and stuff yeah I mean now that I hit it more the flavor isn't really what's off-putting I think it's more like it's just a very dry throat it tries to throw up quick we take like a medium part of it man but you know what gets you so bad bro I started to explain something to my go downstairs and now saying all kinds of things well always like do so look the highest am i high is no joke this is not this isn't for rookies right here bro still knock that ass out you know you guys $65 brothers a good bang for your buck for real now I want to take like a longer pool just to see at what point I feel like it's you know it's too much or it just makes your throat too dry or whatever yes definitely with like the bigger pools that it leaves like that burn and your throw afterwards you know maybe it's just like the temperature because I'm just something that longer you're hitting it the harder it's getting because it's just on and more consistent you know but median to small hits on this thing is to go to to enjoy and if you're just trying to get like super medicated I guess like you know a long a long rip will do it for you oh I am eight to 10 out of 10 I'm out of 10 for real and I was the cheapest one now we got you guys the medicine Chloe and the medicine is spelled like M EDI Zi it's full of fun easy all right I guess we gotta turn it off with the blinker just like we do the other one so cheers you guys Wow there's some of the cleanest I've ever tried I'm hurt I'm hurt I swear by the end of this video I'm being so sleepy hi guys so the flavor was phenomenal it's like when I coughed it didn't burn my throat so I kind of like thought it was like what what my throat didn't burn it tastes crazy I don't even know how to explain the taste it tastes like when you hit a really really clean joint with some good flour you know and you just hit it and you just tasting the flour me like damn this flowers clean and the flavors on point that was crazy yo what the hell damn I'm up to highs on for myself don't be like here babe you have this one it's kidding all right let's take a small rip a medium rip and then a long rip I'm really excited for the small ring because it tastes so good Wow you know it's crazy and I don't know why this is what it tastes like to me but it tastes like a lemon raspado which is like just Google that little hemming dress bad I'll put a picture you you know what I mean that's what it tastes like it is delicious who this TT is crazy I don't know I mean this is more for like the premium smokers you know I guess this is more for like the people that are like I need quality every single Hey which I understand yo cuz even though the THC percentage is lower you're still gonna get just as bait you just gotta hit it maybe a little bit more but every hit can it be more enjoyable so it comes out to like some people might rather be like buggy I don't really care if the taste isn't as a1 as long as it gets me more late which I'm not saying this one won't get you more loot to this because you just got a pie smoked out of this a little longer but the quality of it I mean you're ingesting into your body so I guess at the end of the day you gotta make decisions sometimes young but I think it would be worth paying a little extra to go for like quality but that's just my preference medium pool do like the flavors still consistent and it's crazy how these trips like play a role with your mouth huh pause right they like they don't dry your mouth up you know I feel like this is over the battery it would get hot really quick and dry my mouth up now I'm not sure if it's also because it's a disposable that the quality might be a little different on the battery I'm not sure you know but dowsers my experience I'm gonna take a long pull out of this I'm so baked I feel like all right it's gonna pull down this fire this fire so I would definitely say they're both really good products because at the end of the day even though this one doesn't have like the best flavor in the world it gets you so big I was like baked out of my mind earlier what this was like uncomfortably be do you know what I'm saying this one however gives you a better experience like it's more premium it's probably way better for your lungs and it just tastes better all around I feel like the high is really good and the more you hit it too higher you're gonna get so it's really up to you what you want but yeah your boy mr.

lemonade yellow fruit stripes cartridge sart sars the [ __ ] is sars you guys saw what it looks like we got a yellow fruit stripes sauce cart powered by cookies by the big man himself and look at the card obviously i've smoked on it a little bit first of all i want you guys to look at this color of this because i'm just telling you right now just want you guys to know right now this color is very light for this being a sauce cart because if you notice it is a lot of sauce cards not live resin cards sauce cards are always very dark or not very dark but a bit darker than most like if you get a sauce cart and then if you go and buy like a live like a raw garden cart but go get a sauce cart from like field or something or basil because they're usually a little darker and this is a very nice color for the sauce which i'm not honestly i'm not that surprised burn bro come on let's be real when the [ __ ] is uncle burn never steered you wrong when the hell have any of uncle burns products [ __ ] had you tripping or got you disappointed for you none the flavor profile in that is so so like lemony and honestly i'm [ __ ] loaded holy [ __ ] i feel hella hot no cap that was the lowest temp where's that it was at the lowest temperature right there and that's the hit i just took it was at the lowest temp it was and it was a nice tasty hit and it still killed me so i can't imagine you know taking a monstrous risk imagine it like why why even imagine it when i can just do it and i'm about to take two massive hits so i can actually tell you guys how i feel about this cartridge first i'm gonna take a normal blinker but i'm gonna kill myself i'm trying to make a double blinker bring back something we haven't had on this channel in a while because we haven't had cartridges in a while we're gonna bring back we're gonna take a dab cap dab and then that'll be it double blinker yellow fruit stripes powered by cookies lemonade sauce cart ask [Music] turn down for what [Music] wow i

from a cartridge and god knows how long holy [ __ ] i feel stupid high i mean think about it oh my god oh my god crazy like i was saying if you think about it i've said this in a lot of videos each consistency of wax gets you a different type of a high including wheat as well cannabis gets you a different high from wax you know what i'm saying that's getting to my point this feels insane like i feel hella high like i just took a dab but not really because if you guys notice it should just give you a different hive from dabbing but since these are sauce cartridges or live resin cartridges they get you a different high from a dis from a distillate cart like it's a different high everything's different and right now i do feel like i just took a [ __ ] dab i'm not gonna lie it's just that i feel a little different in the sense of like i don't feel to knock the [ __ ] out you know compared to a dab you know what i mean but i'm about to feel like that right now because i'm about to [ __

here and in this video guys I want to be doing a review on my Tiki yogurt and to be honest guys I like it I've tried it already um it's pretty good I love the taste and I know it's not fake I know it's legit cuz I did hear that some Takeo Kurtz could possibly be fake but you just got to watch out where are you getting it from you got to watch out you know you got to watch out who you're buying it from you know but there's a hybrid I don't know it says hybrid I don't know if it's indica or sativa but it says hybrid and I don't see that THC percentage but it says extra strength and the flavor is gelato it's a real fire guys if you live around this area guys like if you live around the area where they sell tequila cards or live East Coast get one get these get those cards because chances are they're legit and you can tell if the card is fake just by the taste of it just by the way how it hits you know but um here is my battery guys this battery wasn't cheap guys this was 26 bucks I paid 26 bucks for this piece of [ __ ] I mean it's not a piece of [ __ ] but it sometimes is because some carts don't actually fit on this [ __ ] but kikyo's some life cards actually did fit on this [ __ ] but most life carts didn't fit on my battery because the bottom part was too thick so that's why it doesn't it won't fit um and if you guys if you guys um screw around with dank vapes I don't recommend you guys buying dank beeps because there's like 90% chance that those carts are fake or actually 95% that they're fake because um people reported that um the air they tested those carts and they lab tested it and they found pesticides so you guys please be careful on what you're spending your money on because people some people can just be screwing you over and they don't care about you they care about your money that's all that's all what matters for them they don't care about your health they don't care how you risk it but it's up to you if you want to buy those cards but make sure make sure you guys know what you're getting unless you don't care but hope you guys enjoy this little review if you did make sure you guys leave a thumbs up and if you're new guys like please subscribe and turn on post notifications by clicking on that Bell so you got notified from my every upload so thank you guys so much for watching I appreciate it leave a like like I said share this video with your friends cuz guys just cuz alright guys thanks for watching again and I'll see you guys in the next video guys peace out be safe", "erXpR_x6YzI": "what's up YouTube it's your boy mr. bling seed back again with another video today I'm coming at you with an unofficial dank vapes comparison and review the carts I have in question are pineapple express an ace of spades OOP I move the pineapple Express so the reason I'm making this video is because I know that dank vapes carts are all illegitimate but there are still some that are better than others and some that are more healthy for you to smoke are at least more safe for you to smoke than others um and if these are all you have like availability for it then you should at least know which ones you should buy and which ones you should just stay away from altogether because that way you don't waste your money and you're also at least being an informed consumer and you're staying relatively safe so today we have two different cards as you can see the packaging is also different the strains are different but they're both say tank faiths which is wild and you can see like if you look more closely there is a lot of difference in these cart packages you have this one which shows the card from this side it says 1.1 grams and DANC on the side it has raised sort of like background art I guess I could call that and a holographic dang face logo on the top the front the bottom and the side except this side on this side it says dang clips official account all organic no propylene glycol and on the back it says Ace of Spades is a creation from TGA sub cool seeds that takes advantage of the popular sweet and sour combination that never goes out of style a crossbreed of black cherry soda and Jack the Ripper this strain has an earthy berry and citrus smell that carries over into the taste with distinctly lemony flavours Asus blades pants ace of spades plants grow fast and need a lot of space because they will get both bushy and tall flowering occurs at eight weeks and they are generally large and heavy see the funny thing about Danks vapes is that on the back of all of their carts they just have the leaf Lee articles written right there which I mean I don't hate because it's easy for reviews because I can just read the back of the packaging but like it's also kind of lazy what do you think about it anyway so the Apple Express card we have raised letters but flat background art we have irregular art on the front and Danks waves on the front you can't see the cart from the side but it still says dang faves official account all organic no propylene glycol on this side it says the same thing and it has a holographic tank on the top and bottom the description for pineapple Express after I drop the cart and focus pineapple express combines the potent and flavorful forces of parent strange trainwreck and Hawaiian the smell is like into fresh apple and mango with a taste of pineapple pine and cedar this hard-hitting sativa dominant hybrid provides a long-lasting energetic buzz perfect for productive afternoons and creative escapes so there is the packaging review of these cards now the question is which one is real and which one is fake so after doing a bit of research online you can find that there pretty much four major ways to see whether your dank babes carts are real or fake and that would be looking at the packaging itself which I just showed you guys but now I'll go more into detail with that the Instagram account that's on the side of the packaging the C cell atomizer itself and the wax quality so I'm gonna go over each of these cards one by one and just show you like the different points to look at and then uh I'll go ahead and review them and show you guys how they both hit and I'll give you my opinion on which one tastes better so after doing a bit of research online you find that they're pretty much four major ways to check whether or not you have a legit sort of official tank vapes cart versus a knockoff that your dealer just kind of put some snake oil in the four major ways would be looking at the packaging itself the Instagram account on the side the there are signs on the bottom of these C cell atomizers that'll tell you and a wax quality so in this review I'm gonna be going over each of those four points with each of these carts and showing you which ones are more trustworthy and which ones aren't but then I'm also going to be hitting both of them to show you guys the wax quality and I'll tell you how the hits feel if they're chemically and burn or if they're like sort of smooth and tastes good um and then finally I'll tell you guys about the highs based off each of them so yeah let's get into this review I'm actually pretty excited for starting this recording I did do some like light sort of examinations of these karts to see which ones I thought were real and fake before starting the video and I'll just tell you that right now I'm pretty sure this one is legitimate banks vapes carts and this one is not so let me show you why I think this so according to my research and I'll link all my sources in the description below but first off it says that the dank vapes packaging that is legit has the cart shown on the side and that's kind of funny to me because I've had a dank faves carts like this before which was the strawberry shortcake one and it had the same packaging pretty much exactly except a sort of like red theme because it was obviously strawberry shortcake and that being said I've also had carts that are like the pineapple Express ones I'm going to this more in a little bit let's go back to the Ace of Spades anyway so online it says that legitimate dank babes carts have raised lettering for the stream but like lowered lettering for the actual date vapes logo and the back art should be raised and that the theme of these carts are basically all black secondly on the side it should say dank vapes official account because that is the only actual dank vapes official Instagram account that exists some fake carts will just say like dank vapes official or like dank vapes account but if it doesn't say if it does say tanks beeps official account then usually it should be a more legitimate current than others I say that because as you can see on the pineapple Express it also has the right thing so next up if you open the packaging and you take out the cart first you can look at the wax quality and see that uh this one is a bit runny it's not slow it's sort of uh the air bubble transfer is really fast in superfast which is not really a good sign for wax quality so I would definitely watch out for that oh when I actually hit it I'll be able to tell you more about if the wax like is good but for now I'm not very like excited to try this cart um if you look at the bottom let me see if I can get that to focus okay yeah so you see this K you see a stamp number and you see C so though that shows that this is an official C cell cartridge or atomizer at least zoom out there we go looking beautiful um so yeah as you can see this is a real C cell atomizer with some lower quality wax in it which is kind of funny to me because well I go through the process of like getting the best packaging getting good like atomizers and then putting late some kind of crappy oil in it obviously I'm saying it's crappy just based off of these like visual tests but when I actually get into like tasting it maybe I'll be wrong who knows umm another fun thing that I did look into or my old C cell cart or atomizers so we have this one from the serial curtain they see that this is a real C cell cartridge as the C sell the CA and decay on it if it's a fake it could still have all of these but the font will be um kind of stretched out and big and not like actually etched in to the cart like it is with these um on this traphouse Curt atomizer that's supposed to also be a C so you can see that it doesn't have C cell on it it has like another brand so this would be one of those knockoff sort of atomizers that are sold from China and that's on this trap house card so a lot of companies have been using DC cell cars because they do hit nice and they give you good flavor but some still use legitimate C cells and some also still use like knockoffs so this is the ace of spades one final look before I go on to the pineapple Express and I'll be right back alright so with this pineapple Express cart you can see that you can look at the wax itself and the atomizer from the front of the packaging which if you look online and will say that this would be second-generation tank vapes packaging which I'm not really sure how like believable that is but I mean everything else on the packaging checks out the Leafly description on the back it's got raised lettering on the front and not a raised deck vapes logo but those dang capes logo is still holographic and gold um it's got raised artwork it has the actual like tank vapes account on it and the packaging just feels like it feels quality and premium which i know sounds weird but like if you're getting a fake packaging you can sort of feel that the Pat the paper would be like kind of shitty and not like good quality and thick like this is let's go ahead and open up the packaging and look at the sea salt cartridge itself now looking at the sea solid cellphone this is what leads me to believe that it's a fake because as you can see it checks out it looks fine um the bar in the middle is not thick on some fakes that bar will be hella thick but uh when you look at the bottom of it its it will focus it's a sea cell but it says M 208 when you look up see sell em 208 on google it'll bring up the Jupiter Cecil atomizers and in case you didn't know Cecil also owns Jupiter so like the liquid 610 or batteries and any of the lake Jupiter atomizers are also legitimate Cecil atomizers except for the fact that Cecil atomizers always have to have three prints on the bottom it'll have either Jupiter or that little K C cell and then a a lot number or a serial number this only has two so it can't be an actual C cell cartridge so it's a fake atomizer bought from China but if you look at the wax quality you can see that it's sort of good the bubble is small and it's moving very very slowly so this needs me to believe that the lacked quality itself is either very good or it's mixed with something very thick to make move slower which is why you have to like look at all these sort of uh signs that I'm trying to show you guys versus just like one or two of them so what I'm gonna go ahead and do is throw these cards onto my C cell m3 battery and I'll just show you guys how they hit um just so you can see a bit of like the wax quality and like the clouds you can get but I'm not gonna do a full review until tomorrow because I'd like to have a day with them to actually be able to test the wax quality and the highs because when I'm doing a video on something that could be like like health risks I'd like to at least give you guys a real review that's comprehensive so I think having a day to test like if the wax gives me a headache or if it makes me feel sick or if it just burns and tastes bad like I can tell you that better based off like a full day of using these than just um like a little five-minute review so let me go ahead and take these first hits and then we shall see tomorrow what my final verdict on these cards is I got a new sort of filming spot for now because it's summer and oh my god it is [ __ ] hot as hell in this house anyway so we're gonna be taking our first hits off of these dang babes carts what I'm probably gonna do is I think I'm gonna hit the Pineapple Express one first than the ace of spades second because while I think the Pineapple Express could be a fake I really want to test out this max quality more than anything because really that's what matters when you're buying these carts too is wax quality so let's go ahead and screw it on with the C cell I'm three let's just take a rip cheers guys so as you can see that's a pretty nice cloud I think especially for like a first hit off of a cart that's not even like preheated yet so let me take another hit and then I'll talk about the taste and like how it feels but so far I'm having positive opinions on this it tastes really good it actually tastes like like a bit of mango and pineapple so I'm already becoming a fan of this pineapple Express cart I'm gonna hit it one more time and then I'll go ahead and switch over to ASA spades Cheers yeah yeah I'm definitely a fan of this right now plus as you can see like I'm not coughing right now and if you watch any of my other videos you'll see like Ike off like a [ __ ] with baby lungs so positive opinion on pineapple express tank vapes let's go ahead and check this Ace of Spades over the next we're gonna hit this ace of spades card let's see how that goes okay packaging go ahead and screw it onto the seesaw 11 3 let's take our first rib Cheers okay so it tastes kind of bad and like I don't even think that was a very good cloud from it so let's try again I'm not sure how familiar you are with Indian food but this current sort of tastes like cardamom which is a very big seasoning in Indian food and I'm not a fan of it um it also just kind of burns the back of my throat when I'm hitting it so I'm not really feeling too confident about this an ace of spades card from dang babes let me hit it one more time and see if my opinion can change yeah it is really spicy not spicy but it just really tastes like cardamon and I was expressing a sort of like sour sweet taste so I'm kind of disappointed but either way I don't think it'd be a true mr. blinky review if I didn't hit these cards out of the dab cap just to test them out even further so I got the daily high club piece from a a blue dab cap in this cart let's just hit both of them through the dab cap for today I'll see how they feel then tomorrow I'll come back at you with like a full review so Cheers on the Ace of Spades so late even ripping it out of it to have cab it took forever in a cloud of the piece and then it still just didn't even taste good so hazel speeds right now I definitely have a negative opinion of it it could change you to eat today and tomorrow but for now I really think this pineapple Express is gonna be the better card let me go and load it up and then I'll take it through the top cap and they will end for you today all right so we got the pineapple Express on the dab cap let's go ahead and hit it through this piece and then I'll catch you guys tomorrow Cheers okay so I cut out the coffee but they ain't very nice you could see the cloud it was very uh thick and dense and it tasted amazing it made me coffee lot that was because I think it was just a really good hit so i'ma go ahead and review these carts in like my personal use and then tomorrow come back and tell you guys like which one is better or not I can tell you right now though I am fried as hell so one of these carts are maybe even both of them who knows they definitely work so yeah I'll see you guys in the next day I've been vaping on to ace of spades which is this current and the Pineapple Express since yesterday evening and I think I have an actual good review for each of them so my ace of spades review would be that the atomizer itself doesn't nearly hit as hard as the Pineapple Express won which in retrospect isn't necessarily a bad thing because it means this wax will last longer then the pineapple Express wax but it'll also take you considerably longer to get high initially when you're trying to smoke in um the high on it lasts three and a half to five hours which was really cool and the way I can describe the high for me at least was that it made me feel kind of tired but relaxed enough and like it also helped me focus enough that I could edit like this video as well as do some studying so that was really cool I really like that so I'm a fan of the high for that the negatives of it would be that it did make me feel a bit paranoid which I'm not a fan of because like just having like general anxiety this cart made that a bit worse so I would definitely only smoke this car at night and if I'm trying to actually like either just go to sleep or maybe get something done at night other than that I would not smoke this during the day simply because it would make me paranoid and it just doesn't seem worth it especially when the Pineapple Express makes me feel pretty like energetic imma go into it more in a second but like my overall review of the Ace of Spades would probably be a 6 out of 10 it would get a 7 if the atomizer hit a little bit better and if it didn't make me paranoid but uh I would recommend these dang babes carts pretty much only if you don't have any other choices or if your other choices are like exotic carts or Mario karts cuz these are at least a bit better than those but they're not like amazing so yeah that was the a subspace I'm gonna take another hit as the final review hit of this cart so cheers guys hope you're vaping along or smoking something let's get it so ya didn't cough so that's nice it's a nice smooth hit this is a fully charged C cell m3 so yeah Ace of Spades six out of ten would recommend only as an alternative for like worst cards now let's get to this pineapple Express find out will Express if you guys can remember is the fake cart which is funny to me because it's my first cart out of the two um the wax is definitely thicker and it hits better than the ace of spades cart but like I said the ace of spades cart is definitely gonna last a lot longer than this one um the high off of this cart makes me feel a bit energetic helpfully focus on my tasks and one of my favorite things is that it makes music sound a lot better and more clear which I'm always a fan of when I'm smoking because I love listening to music um well I was a high off this drain I went on a walk I cooked dinner and I cleaned my room so definitely a very very like good day stream especially if you have some stuff to get done I'm about to edit or finish editing this video on this high so I'm very excited for that which is funny to say because like editing is boring but uh now this card makes everything feel a bit more like interesting and definitely just helps me focus better um a negative of this cart would be that I sort of felt maybe a little bit aggressive at like when I was coming down from the high so I'm not really a fan of that but other than that it's pretty much all positives this car I would give like an 8 out of 10 it's better than a lot of other like brands that I've had like chrono Polly is not as good as damn boots but it's uh it's as good as most of the other dang babes I've had so it's funny to say but I kind of almost prefer this little fake packaging on the pineapple Express card just so y'all can see it hopefully it's in frame like this is packaging that you can buy generically but the wax ended up being better quality than the real dang vapes so I guess what I would do if I were you guys would really be to just test that wax quality by like flipping it because it seems to me like that is what is like the biggest indicator of if your wax is gonna be good quality versus like if it's an actual see saw cartridge looking at the packaging really all you got to look at is wax quality because all of these cards are fake although they're not fake but like all of them are illegitimate and they all have the pesticides in the loop so at this point you just gotta like choose which is the biggest bang for your buck and the biggest like risk you want to take and I really don't think this is bad quality wax like it tastes fine to me and it doesn't really hurt let's just take a hit so I can show you guys it takes so amazing I really can't express that enough but uh yeah so eight out of ten would HIGHLY highly recommend the pineapple express if you ever come across it um make sure to stay informed and try to stay safe guys cuz like this [ __ ] black market card business it's kind of wild I'm learning more about it everyday and I'm just gonna keep like showing you guys what I learned I hope you enjoyed the video welcome to the channel if you made it this far please subscribe and like and I'll catch y'all later stay warm lacet Cheers", "GGGW1xP3Uyg": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video and if you couldn't tell from the title this is overall garden video I mean got the sweater on as well and I got the cartridge as well and yeah like the title says this is basically like a video just letting you know that there are fakes when it comes to raw garden it's it's so stupid in the cannabis industry once you've been like once you become like an established company people are just trying to like make money off your name they're trying to sell fake products under your name and basically with your heart the hard work that you put in for your company is just easily easily used for another person's gain you know and that shit's not the business you know and we're gonna be talking about the fakes when it comes to raw garden I have a few pictures that was taken from raw Gardens Instagram let me just pull them up right here so I'll also be putting it on the screen right here so you can get a better look of what I'm gonna be talking about and another thing I'd like to mention is that I guess my packaging is a newer packaging so it's not gonna be I don't know like here's a thing with raw garden and with other companies that do the same they're gonna constantly keep updating their packaging because like I said people are onto their [ __ ] and they're they're gonna just keep you know they're gonna keep at it so you just got so we're gonna bring it up right here and right off the bat you can see that the font is different and actually the color is a lot different especially the the font on here it says like I'll post on the screen don't worry but basically you could tell from the font and where the positioning of the flower is I guess so right here I got the tray clip good I bought this from flavors I'll post it right here I mean they have it on their website as Walt rock garden if you go it on raw garden the raw garden up farm you can actually search up all the dispensaries that have it there legally so I bought mine at flavors as you can see right here all that good stuff let me just so I'm guessing that they had to update this because they just pulled over the QR code but I mean you can go and check all these I actually don't have a QR code like scanner oh I just download one real quick so we'll see this [Music] basically running the same but the numbers are a little bit different I mean it says right here eighty one point zero three zero five and then this one's eighteen point eight six so I mean you gonna have to take my word for it I bought it at flavors I do not have the receipt on me but if you didn't see that video previous from this I showed the receipt in there exactly not bad just gotta be careful with the raw garden you should go on their Instagram also to basically check out how to tell the real from fakes you know this is it right here very very clear stuff and yeah I mean I've been hitting this already and it tastes very very good it does not taste like it's some fake [ __ ] you know and you guys know me I've been I've been getting raw gardener for years now and honestly like I would know if I had a fake [Music] good stuff this is the chill battery very very good battery for itself for what but like I said check out the photos or the pictures that rawr and put on their Instagram yeah it's a little bit different actually it says four right here it actually has the percentages right here as well but I guess they switched up the new sticker so yeah I don't know they just keep changing a [ __ ] every time so at the end of the day like unless they update those pictures it's gonna be hard to tell you know because they gotta keep switching their packaging because each time they [ __ ] get settled in these [ __ ] people just trying to fake the cartridge fake the packaging and all that stuff another thing that I've noticed from the pictures is that that ever should be on its own column or its own row so the other ones they actually has no additives ever in one single line so that's another that's like the biggest difference that I can notice just by you know looking and scanning at the box ooh and if you guys haven't seen Shaka x4 20 video on the subject already please check it out it's a dope video I posted it online community posts so if you guys haven't checked that out already you should really check it out does good content similar to that of mine so you know if I don't upload you know I'm saying you got more other content creators to go and check out them you know so shout out to you Shaka X 420 shout out to you your boy should be some cool collabs if that were to ever happen but yeah I'm gonna take one more hit and we're probably gonna end the video here be careful with the roll of iron cartridge you know I like when they was first brought into my attention that raw barn has fakes or had fakes and stuff I was really like hesitant like I was like no I'm gonna copy raw garden you know because like I don't know I just I just didn't think that they would and sitting here now knowing what we know like anything can be copied it's crazy so if you're an upcoming like cannabis company [ __ ] I don't even know how to like avoid this you know maybe like some really intricate into your kids ass packaging that is alike cost a lot so therefore they wouldn't buy it because it costs a lot I don't know who knows but I'm gonna take a million hit for you guys and we're gonna call it a video and uh I just had plumbing service at my house and one of the plumbers actually watches my videos so whoever you were I forgot your name but it's a small ass world and it's crazy like he came up and he was like it simplistic you me what you do videos so I was pretty interesting but yeah shout-out to you thanks for doing a good job on our plumbing you know I'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and we're probably gonna end the video here [Music] these are guys [Music] [Music] you", "hnnaYoVUoZM": "roll roll roll your blood full of cbd break it down roll it up light it up hit it no more anxiety hey roll roll roll your blood full of cbd break it down roll it up light it up hit it no more anxiety [Music] um what up cut up okay so how to get a response so this might be your first time here now the correct response when i say what up cut up is what it do tennis shoe so let's try this again and then you can just respond in the comments what up cut up welcome to smoking legal or welcome back to smoking legal if you've been here before if you're one of my subscribers um salute to you i really really appreciate you if you are in the notification gang gang gang gang you got that notification build it up then i salute you um with both hands get it i appreciate you now what we do here is oh i'm sorry how rude am i not to introduce myself i go by the name taz and i review [ __ ] mainly hemp um and today we have a product coming from one of my favorite companies i saw this little team i saw this little team it's really a two-part review i saw this little team uh and i've used it in one of my lives and i had to crack it open for you guys in this review it's coming from one of my favorite companies which is called black tie cbd uh you may have heard of them oh oh something that doesn't mean a lot to you can mean a lot to someone else like one right there and hitting that subscribe button so what we have here today is the jupiter c cell palm power supply that was a lot and that is my rosary hitting my whiskey decanter that little ting ting bell you heard um this is the palm uh power supply it's like let's just open it up let's slide it open it doesn't make a magnify magnificent noise when you slide it open and here is what you have they put their logo on it black tie now what this is let me show you what all you get in here i'll turn it around so you can see the back side see that see that now what you have here is uh this is something that you can use for your cartridges um what i've learned about this thing is also that the battery on this when you charge it up last a lot longer than the uh your average pin you know how you usually just put it on top of your little pin uh but the battery on these last a lot longer in fact let me show you how to use it i'm gonna put that right there and i'm gonna try to open up this right here what we have here now what we have here is a little something special a little something this also comes from black tie this is the cbd delta eight vape cartridge so this is not just straight delta eight by itself it has cbd mixed with it which is my favorite way to consume my delta eight uh some people say that delta a kind of gives them a little bit of anxiety you know similar to delta nine uh but i've noticed that when it's mixed with the cbd it's tends to be a little bit smoother and less anxiety causing so this is one milligram and this is not the kid so it's just going to be the cartridge by itself and black tie again they gonna they gonna put a logo on there i do like that um it's child proof so you gotta push this little button and pull now i will say this i've never hold on oh this is the first time this is the first time that i was actually able to push that button down which makes it child proof and slide this out now this is the pineapple say it with me pineapple did that pineapple this is that pineapple this is what your cartridge looks like when you take it out see that voila good and thick good and thick lightly golden lightly golden now what you do is first you take off this little part down here at the bottom wow voila and see this right here oh [ __ ] okay so your palm power cell comes with these two little screw devices so let's get one of those out they give you two in case you lose one so what you're going to want to do is you take that put that down you screw that onto the bottom of your cartridge like so screw that onto the bottom of your cartridge like that now now you're ready to insert it into your palm which it'll just go like this see that little slot made perfect for it you put that down in there like that and it has a little bit of magnetization to it i don't even know if that's a word but it's magnetized so you put that down in there look watch this again and now it's in there will not come out or anything the next thing you got to do is just simply pull on it you just pull on it so um before i take my first pull let me say this salute to health wealth and self self love is the best love if you haven't heard the words i love you today then please please get to the closest man tell yourself self i love yourself because you can't love anyone else or expect anyone else to love you if you don't love yourself that's some serious [ __ ] my brother would say that deep little bro and i like it when they do that salute okay and this little thing is tight it's tiny and comfortable i don't know why i like this more than the pen i don't know if it's because i can grip it like that and it's wrong it's gone you know i can be you know at work stepping out on breakfast like huh what today no no no i'm listening nothing rather what's in my hand nothing i have nothing in my hand nothing at all i let the smoke out on the side like so the pineapple flavor is amazing i feel like spongebob squarepants oh my god the pineapple i thought i loved the banana excuse me yeah i thought i love the banana and i do i do love the banana don't get it twisted i do love the banana but the pineapple oh my god it tastes beautiful this is beautiful this is gorgeous i like this a lot i promise i don't know why i like this so much better than the pen but i really do and i feel like it gets more airflow excuse me what i really like about is just this little square design it's easy to just slide down in the pocket i'm good to go and like i said the battery lasts longer in these than in your average pen now when you pull on it there's a little light let me see if you can see that no you can't but anyway oh i'll show it did you see that little light that lit up when you pull that's how you know you're good to go oh my god oh huh okay now to me the effects of the delta eight for me oh if i get my breath from coffin it is a focus type feel um you i feel focused when i'm using delta a creative um i don't have that frontal lobe like blurry feeling like delta nine gives me it just gives me that focus feel and then i get the from the cbd i get the relaxation the drop in the shoulders i get the i can feel the anxiety begin to leave and then i just i it just genuinely makes me happy one million trillion percent gives me the money though i can tell you that right now uh but genuinely just a relaxed feel relaxed and focused feel and in the little palm palette i said the palm palette they used to be a phone i'm showing my age uh but in the palm power supply i really really like it now the pen gives me that feel you know it goes between the fingers so i can but it's a little heavy i don't know why because this forces you to grab it like this or like this it's just like second nature and it's just easy right i'm i've been literally going back and forth in my mind trying to decide if i like the banana or if i like the pineapple better i was so so so impressed with that banana the first time i had it i'm still impressed with it but this pineapple is so on point like i don't know how they're getting these flavors to be so on point the way they are but this pineapple it really does not taste like some artificial fake pineapple type candy type thing it literally tastes like a fresh slice of pineapple it tastes boozy like pineapple not pineapple pineapple that's what it tastes like listen uh black time i gotta give you two thumbs up again man i gotta give you two thumbs up i've tried the banana delta eight i've tried the delta eight card that just had um it was not flavored at all it was just mixed with cbd and it was not flavored and now i'm trying the pineapple and you guys have not let me down yet man and i'm just i i'm sold on the on the palm power supply it's a must so far black tie is my favorite place to get my delta eight and i'm gonna tell you why it's the only place i've gotten delta eight and i trust them as a company that's why i go to them i know it's not gonna be no bs product and sometimes things can you know you get let down so when i want certain things i go to specific companies because i know i'm not going to be let down and this is one of man shout out to aka mr copius i appreciate you and shout out to you guys the pineapple is definitely worth checking out this little contraption this pawn power supply it's definitely definitely a win for me um thank you guys for stopping through as i like to say on smoking legal keep it positive we'll keep it pushing get it keep it positive or keep it pushing if you have any questions for me uh ask them down in the comments if you know anything about the channel then you know i try to take time out every single day it's actually part of my morning routine i drink my coffee and i go through the comments when i get in the bed i go through the comments and answer questions and just respond to people because yeah my people it is so salute to health wealth and self i like you", "Eai80SaJXPs": "[Music] i woke up today said i wanna be a star walking down the street into a foreign we got right there bear woods bear wax cigar so um i've actually already used a little bit um they came you know plastic covering so when i open it it's not gonna look like it's new so don't be trying to tell me it's fake or nothing disposable electric strain is a gelato and uh it came with a torque at the top so i think it's pretty premium got this on sale it was 44 bucks with delivery and tax it's usually 65 plus that but now there's the gauge um it tells you how much wax is left in there and it looks like a full ass coil right there logo i guess it came with a few rips i don't give a [ __ ] and then yeah there's the mouthpiece and i'm gonna tell y'all how those gelato's hitting oh okay now for a disposable it is rare to get hits like that um i'm talking about disposal bulls not not with this one that's the thing this one is crazy with the voltage it um from that you know a little mouth hole you might think it's more prone to clogging or it's not going to hit smooth you might need to pull too hard this one's literally perfect um i really do like the effect that uh the backlight gives it i definitely say in comparison to other wax cars this feels more like a dab pretty intense the terpenes are there interesting oh yeah now you can tell no no blinking in that particular instance it does appear to have like smoke coming from it that will ever focus but i uh be honest about this i off the jump did take a blinker which is never smart to do with any cartridge ever should have primed it or something so i may have slightly burnt it but at the beginning but it still tastes like gelatin that's what's crazy even though my earthbound sleeves could have damaged it and low-key something like this i don't think it needs to take any blinkers it's a little powerful flavor the terpenes i like it um it's very obvious another thing very obvious this isn't this is at least 80 like 85 percent thc but why is that using this is premium um jesus christ um um pretty sure most people know what happened though just the sheer fact that nothing happened it's full as for my high um this thing is smacking saw a funny comment on one of these someone thinking that it was mixed with nicotine and this 100 has no nicotine in it at all that'd be very irresponsible i've never actually seen someone mix this with nick juice if you've done that please let me know because i would literally know that you are on some other [ __ ] um well i mean this is a video so i'm gonna push myself for this one gelato hodge is interesting as i can see i'm getting stuck on the when it comes to psychedelic and relaxation i it's a heady um kind of radiating through the body i have some indicators where if i hit it the first thing i feel is to my body but this one is definitely my balance my head is going nuts i'm gonna keep i'm gonna be hitting this guy you know huh huh i think it's a little obvious i'm getting higher than i would have originally anticipated i kind of hated my videos prove that you know there's kind of a way that my people talk about the end of my videos i always start talking differently and i talked at the beginning hi i'm sober yeah that's never gonna work ever i am i am [ __ ] yeah i think it's a little obvious i don't know i think i can do this one i could do three different scales efficiency is a 10. never like we let me my girl literally we were snacking all last night i haven't seen a difference in anything so version season 10 the pull is a 10 battery design is a 10 quality oh my y'all god hold this it's literally like an extra durable cigar so yeah but it's a 10. everything about this is amazing i got it for a deal i would if i you know there's going to be a price of value minus 10 because i got it for 44 when i could i've seen this for like 80 75 but that's from my deal because i was about 65 i'd have problems i might even have judges differently but 44 bucks for a whole gram with the whole battery with this design that's like cheap there are fifty dollar one gram carts dime moon rock uh alpine vapor and i've tried them all they're great but having it all it'd be cheaper i can't deny it this is five stars [Music] perfect into masterpiece three round bursts [Music] i'm", "C2ko0fFeXaY": "what is good y'all good morning it is zoody patoot you already know back for another cannabis review on the baked boys you already know what it is if you don't definitely look into these guys definitely look these up these are the best thing on the cannabis market right now for vapes carts whatever you're looking into just for portable dabs this is freaking it uh freaking rechargeable tastes amazing better than any cart that i've i've come across personally uh it's just like taking a dab it even you know tastes like freaking mango this is what the whole box looks like and then you pop them out of the box and then another another baked bar packaging just so if you guys are getting these make sure like they are double packed and if they're not they're probably not real but these are a brand new brand new uh company uh straight from cali and uh they are just getting started so if you want to go ahead and look them up on instagram they're on instagram i don't think they have built their website yet but you know i've been talking back and forth with uh the person on there so uh definitely a good brand definitely quality quality product right here and that's what people are looking for especially in the cart game right now some people are scared of additives being being put in there it already says right here you know max strength lab tested and solvent-free to stood so uh it's got all the little markings don't throw it away you know recycle it properly it's a disposable so you know don't don't just be tossing it in the wrong or california they got big recycling laws and all that stuff so that's up to your discretion um 21 and older what is this right here probably not for pregnant women i mean just just basic stuff that goes on on cannabis products out in california but uh just guys go try one go try one because these are probably my new favorite thing in the world right now like you know i love my dabs but just having a portable portable little it's just like a freaking it's about the same size of a jewel or a uh a puff bar you know it's the same thing as a puff bar but it's just it's distillate so and they hit so freaking hard like you're just sitting here pulling it and then like when you exhale you don't even realize like you're blowing out a cloud because you barely feel it inhaling and to me that's that's how i tell if it's good distillate or not you uh it's not rough on the inhale but it's rough on the exhale and that's just a rule of thumb for all carts if you're experimenting with carts right now but you know thanks for watching y'all go get you one the baked bars bake the bar official on instagram go get into the hype you already know zooteep appreciate", "SLihlyzlkHE": "hey guys new cat discount vape pen and today we're gonna help you answer the question what is the best voltage for my cartridge [Music] alright guys so here we have two different kinds of batteries for you as well as two different kind of cartridges to kind of meet up a couple different scenarios and you could kind of just get a good idea for yourself what might be best for you to hit your cartridge at so I think the more important part of this is actually gonna be the batteries um so you can see here we have a spinner type battery and for those of you who aren't sure what that means is if you look here you have a little dial with varying numbers um so you can see start at 3.3 volts that's that's your power selection and you see what I did there how I could spin this little dial on the bottom you could increase the power up to different settings or come down so as you see I'm scrolling up to 3.8 this would be 3.9 ok 4 and so on so you could just keep increasing it decreasing it and go into different settings in between pretty much exactly what you want to do make it very customizable the alternative method would be a battery like this which doesn't at first look like it has any adjustments but what these are is gonna be a click style adjuster so we turn it on which is already on you can see that the color is green that's gonna signify a set voltage if we do three clicks just see the color flash and now that's an it's next setting so you have three three three presets of voltage increase all right so now just more - talking to that Oh like we just saw this guy is gonna have your three presets where you know you can scroll between three point four three point seven and four which is nice to be able to adjust but again with this spinner battery we can we can really change the dial and do the in-betweens of those settings so it's a whole lot more customizable and if you really want to pinpoint on exactly where you want to be this is gonna be your way to do it you know here you can see three point three and three point you know look that would be like consider to jump but here we can go in between I really do what we want if we want to settle it down or turn it up a little in between those presets of this guy that's what's great about the spinner batteries now how that's gonna affect your cartridges as you can see we have two different cards is here this is gonna be a ceramic type cartridge and you can see the heating element with with the way the wick holes are versus this guy which is gonna be one of your more old-school wick cartridges now the ceramic is gonna be able to take more power these are gonna be better at higher voltages the very low force is where you're gonna want to cap these out at so like you know four point two really should be the highest you're gonna consider going with these there are a few out there on the market that'll need more and at that point I would say just keep it at four point two and then if you feel like you need a bump turn it up just ever so slightly you know possibly with a spinner battery cuz that's gonna be your best way to do that and just come up and don't be afraid you know but also you know don't go too high can't start and then we have the alternative which would be your your cotton wick cartridges these guys aren't gonna be so good on keeping a higher power setting you're really gonna want to try to stick to around 3.6 3.7 3.8 I wouldn't I really wouldn't want most of these into the pores I have seen one or two in the past that have needed a little bit higher of a power setting but it's very rare so yeah just to kind of realize your bit your best way is gonna be keep it low see how it feels take a solid hit and then if you feel like you need a little more turn it up ever so slightly whichever way you may be doing that whether it's with your spinner battery which would be a little more I'm coming up in the small lengths or you can do it with your click button adjuster which that guy is gonna bring you to the next preset hopefully that next preset is gonna be in them after that close up hopefully you have a better idea of what the proper voltage to hit your 510 cartridge job would be um like we said it's really gonna depend more so on the battery um if you have one of the ones that has an adjustable adjustable slider on it like a spinner type battery it's better for finding exactly where you want to be because you'd go into the in-betweens that a 3 click wouldn't provide you so for example like we said this guy you click 3 times and it goes into one setting and the next setting in the next which is great because you can kind of take high medium low depending on what kind of cartridge you have but if you have a spinner battery it's really gonna allow you that freedom to go in between all those different sights you really find the perfect setting for your specific cartridge now the cartridge also does matter to like you know if you have ceramic which is going to be you know you can tell that it's ceramic if you look at it to see little Whipple's in the bottom that can be hit at a higher setting those are okay the low fours you know three point eight four four point two those are all going to be okay for most of the ceramic type cartridges if you have a conduit cartridge like this guy where you can see cotton exposed to through the center that's going to be on the lower head where you're at you know 3.6 3.8 maybe 3.9 again different company different cartridges by different companies they're gonna have the power requirements so there's a little bit of play play wiggle room on you kind of just figuring out based on what you have but either way these batteries will also provide you with the perfect hit depending on you know what setting you want to keep it at that's the partisan brand other than that I mean you just kind of use a little bit of common sense - depending on if they hit feels like it's enough you know that that's it you don't need to go any higher try to keep it as low as you can know what that being said that should really give you all the employee to know about that if you like the new these products they're available for

gonna post this up yesterday but I enjoyed it too much and huh I liked it anyway so today's strain is a Thin Mints Girl Scout cookies and the cartridge is a distiller 1/2 gram and it's made by Burano I believe that's a Maryland company that's one from and it's a hybrid so THC percentage is 80% and I don't know how I think CBDs got 3.11 and yeah so it's got a good taste yeah unbelievable I mean I after like through two seconds I'm coughing my ass off like this is for all the people that said that my cookies cart was fake right but i'ma show y'all this one right and y'all gonna see oh hold on hold on why I said look the same okay so this is the box right y'all and that's right yeah Girl Scout cookies yeah 60 bucks four or five or you know for a half a gram and here we go right here so look

highlighter Plus this is about a 80% or more THC right next to it is our rose gold highlighter that's pretty it's pretty right yeah it's beautiful it's a it's a one-to-one CBD to THC ratio and then on the right side here we've got our highlighter uncrate special edition we only made a few thousand of these things a nice matte soft touch finish it's also a one-to-one CBD THC ratio [Music] that's

"hello my name is Kip and I'm the account executive for Northern California and Alaska here at Jupiter research and on this week's episode I'm going to teach you how to take apart to C cell cartridges the first type of cartridge I'm gonna demonstrate for you is our glass cartridge the glass cartridge has a twist off or a threaded mouthpiece which is really easy to take off all you do is unthread the mouthpiece from the cartridge and there you have it we do not recommend refilling our glass cartridges or our plastic cartridges due to the fact that the refilling may compromise the integrity of the ceramic and therefore compromise the experience the flavor and the taste the next cartridge I'm going to demonstrate for you is our ATP or a plastic cartridge the plastic cartridge comes with a press bit mouthpiece which is camp very evident and extremely difficult to remove removing the mouthpiece could result in damaging the cartridge the mouthpiece or result in a loss of oil I'm going to try to demonstrate this by taking a pair of channellock pliers and twisting in a counterclockwise motion you will notice that it is a very difficult process and you can hear the cartridge actually being damaged and there we go it's broken the next cartridge I'm going to demonstrate is actually a pod that fits into the uno and the dart device you will see that the pod is covered by the mouthpiece and in a way that the pod fits into the mouthpiece is flush and is press fit which basically gives you no way to remove it I know a lot of you had questions regarding the refilling of C cell cartridges and the removal of the mouthpieces in conclusion C cell cartridges are not designed to be refilled in the end acade compromise the flavor the taste the potency and overall paper ization experience if you have any further questions shoot us a DM or comment below thanks for watching", "FGTP8FVp00c": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another buddy's cartridge video you know i'm saying but this one's special this one's a bit special because if you can see from the title it is the highest percentage of thc that i've seen on a buddies well uh that i've seen i don't know if it's the highest but it's 90 thc as you can see right here 90.42 and yes this is the distillate one so that's why it's high in thc but as far as like other buddies distillates or other live resins that i've had from them this is probably the the highest in range that i've had and uh the other two percent is some other stuff other than cbd but as you can see from the back right here it is 6.5 or 6.45 percent terpenes so pretty decent you know i've had some which were like 2 before so i'm happy that this one has ninety percent thc and six percent terpenes i can only imagine how it's going to taste um but i do have my tronian with me where's that and also the little adapter piece so let's just uh get to it and let's see i haven't had a buddies in a while actually i haven't had a cart in like a week or two because it's just they run out pretty fast for me but i've seen uh at authentic that they had buddies again like new strains so i was like okay [ __ ] it this 27 out the door the green box which is the live resin is 32 out the door so one of the best prices in town is going to be authentic for buddies so let's just open this i don't really care too much about the box and with this it's going to be a a very raw raw garden color yeah you see right here yeah very very nice let's just uh since uh since i do have my camera let me just take a picture real quick for the thumbnail you know that right off the bat it's very sweet very lemony is the most prominent yet lemony [Music] let's try this i'm excited i haven't had a buddy's car in a while so i can barely keep the excitement contain it you know what i'm saying so boys [Music] [Music] for some reason i taste the peanuts like the initial taste is the peanut and then it gets sweet pretty weird oh there's the lemonade there's the lemony taste okay it's a lemony slash orangey slash very [Music] so like i said the initial taste was like a peanut and then it gets sweet like a lemon sweetness maybe it's just the cart or something or maybe it's just 20 years a very different taste that i've had from previous buddies uh i wouldn't say i would compare it to a raw garden cannabis derived terpenes with this lid it's it's its own taste it kind of tastes like the cure company um tropicana cookies towards the end a very orangey very strong orangey taste but nonetheless very very enjoyable i didn't know gorilla glue terpenes tasted this lemony or this citrusy but not bad for 90 thc it's definitely gonna smack me but with gorilla glue it's a hybrid sativa or sativa dominant hybrid so it's definitely recommended to use you know during the day afternoon you know i'm saying but i would probably not use this as much towards the end of the night because for me at least when i smoke too much sativas at night it's very hard for me to sleep i don't know if it's for you guys as well but nonetheless a very very great part from buddies i like to address them some stuff people say about me always reviewing buddies or something but i spend my own money on buddies and that says something i i don't like when a person spends their money consistently on a product that means that that product is good just because you haven't seen buddies lately doesn't mean that i don't like them anymore i just bought all the strains that they had available to my dispensary when i drove monty and blake to the dispensary yesterday we went to authentic as well and i saw that they had cartridges at least new strains from buddies and uh you know i had to come back the next day and here we are making this video right now so like i said it's a very good cartridge very very different from what i'm used to tasting from buddies but nonetheless still enjoyable high percentage of thc and there's six percent terpene so you really can't go wrong with that i'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and we're probably just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed it you know what i'm saying um but yeah cheers three blinkers i barely move you do see a bubble in here though i don't know if that's peanut exactly but it's like if a peanut and orange mixed that's the taste no i like peanuts and i like oranges i just don't like them together but this is enjoyable i'm not saying it's battery it's just you know it's a weird taste but like i said uh if you get past the peanut taste it's a very enjoyable citrusy flavor towards the end but other than that hopefully you enjoyed the video peace out [Music] way back in the days",

go look at the intro you gonna see a couple Oh tell me which one you think I should do next mr. Hodes out yeah [Music]", "PHBjXxK06NY": "what's good y'all this is starting main 180 and we're here for another review but it wouldn't be your typical review it's going to be a shake review today but the stream is going to be worth it though so i went to my my favorite place to go to ascend that's why i guess where i love to get my recreational products until i get my medical card out here got my new york on deck still but today was definitely a good day so today we got a strain called jet fuel gelato jet fuel gelato is a jet fuel cross breeding with gelato number 45. it's turpin flavors are based off of herbal peppery and piney this stream really brings back the classic og smell that most people would love to smoke but it had its own distinctive like smell like you could really tell there's some jet fuel in here like damn oh this is some fire right here has 19 tac has zero three percent th cbd excuse me and this is an indica dominant hybrid it's a good it's a really good one and believe it or not it's shake you can see it right here so we're not doing the buds today we're actually going to be working on the shake so as you see here you know the high supply this is the limit that you know you can buy for a day and today we're going to use papers because it's shake we're going to roll it in papers got my raw papers on deck got my raw filters on deck you know we got to be prepared all the time all the time bro so in this case i'm going to just throw some here because this is going to be a quick roll this is going to be a quick one two guys gotta smell it ah gas right there i'll probably do a video smoking it with the gelato i'll get it in the back wood when i don't do some other ones it varies it varies when i first tasted this this this hit me like whoa because it's something with gelato cross breeds oh man they just they stand out they really stand out to what the policy is the flavor the taste everything i i'm a fan of gelato crossbreeds i was never really a fan of gelato by itself that's just me because of my i i've had bad experiences with july that's what it is you know what i wouldn't even call them bad experiences i had low quality experiences because it did its job medically the taste was just horrendous i just couldn't bear with that taste i see the good thing with the shake all you have to do you could you could throw it in your vaporizer you don't have to grind it or nothing this is for the lazy people you know the lazy people that just want to just throw it in there and roll this would be a perfect recommendation for you because when you buy a shake from a cannabis dispensary you're getting the same quality as well it's the bottom of the barrel but just taste wise you're getting the same quality it's good the taste is there you're just losing maybe 10 to 15 percent thc depending on the strain and how much shape they give you but personally i would recommend shake to beginners i'll just throw this straight to the beginners thc content isn't high they wouldn't have to worry about freaking out anything it would work out for them so they'll be able to enjoy medical cannabis the way it's supposed to be because he has enrolled me a basic average joint you know something like something quick for this review because we're not we're not necessarily here to get fully loaded we're just here to you know dose enough to medicate that's just what we're here for but don't get me wrong i smoke up all day but as a medical you as a one for medical use it's not it's not really you know we need to go ham that first hit all out this is a pure essence right here wow it's very clean it's a very clean taste you could definitely the terpenes definitely did the herbal the peppery that's why i had to take some water because i felt that that that's that little spice it's not as smooth as the other strains but it hits it definitely is so if you were to get the actual nugs of this it would most likely be 29 30 thc this is pretty potent for 19 and that's rare and i think that the harshness behind it also plays a role in that i was going to use a high hem but i haven't used april's for a while so i figured hey let's do a review and papers but the high hips are always going to be there but one one one brand i will not i will not recommend is real size this is speaking out of personal opinion i'm not a fan of these one they smell funny doesn't smell like hemp it smells like some whole other nonsense this would be like an equivalence to an actual blunt wrap you don't taste it you don't taste the herbs i would rather have um those palm cigars those king ponds i'd rather smoke that than use that because at least with the king palms i'll get a really slow smoke out of it i'm not even a fan of king palms but i will do a review or two with them because i have friends that like king palms so i'm pretty sure they would like to see someone do a string review with king bombs so i won't discriminate trust you i don't because got the backwoods on deck wear them bad boys at got plenty of the high hemps all of that so now this is going out i relit this i don't taste any burnt any burnt tree it's still clean and harsh if that makes any sense um it's really is really like a down to earth classic og kush in a sense but uh a higher end fragrant lg kush but these are just the og other toads don't listen don't don't don't bother me on that one the taste reminds me of an og kush so much jet fuel is a great strain it's definitely very strange i've only had it once it was just one of those quick live moments girl you have to smoke a whole eighth out of it so i didn't really get to fully enjoy it plus i had a couple drinks so it's just one of those couple drinks some smoke boom good i'm still waiting for the g purpose to get back to stock i'm definitely going to do a review on that that oh man that's a good one jeff it was that g perps is purple punch and jackfield if i recall correctly yeah it's one of those two um yeah that's that's actually the crossbreed for it halfway through this birthday nights this burning slow you don't have to always stuff your joints rip some of your paper off if you're trying to roll a smooth tray roll accordingly you just level it out i put just enough to roll me a nice little drink but overall stripe wise on the review on the stream i'm gonna give it a nine nine nine and a half the taste gets a nine and a half i mean because it definitely it details it brings back memories it brings back memories off rip and so that being said you can really taste the essence of what it's like between uh jet fuel and gelato it's fruity it's definitely a fruity it's not a dank this is not a dank stream this is fruity so that's why i scored high on the taste run overall quality i feel it i feel the effects i'm halfway in here so i know it's going to do its job even for a 60 40 on indica dominant hybrid i'm still good i just love me some indicas in the condominium hybrids i need some granddaddy purple in my life the taste and culture tongue nice make sure you want some sweets if you're if you want to think about it that and i have to go for something to eat too got me just got me yeah it's burning nice i haven't had to really re-light it because i know mostly out there i'd be smoking joints yeah i'll be relaxed every five to ten seconds this whole video i probably had to re-light it maybe twice oh this is pretty nice about to have me waste smoke missing all of that but overall yeah i could definitely say the strain is a nine and a half i don't necessarily have any fond memories or any flashbacks with jet fuel or gelato because i've had nothing but bad taste experiences smoking gelato and jet fuel only had once what are we talking about the crossbreeds on the other hand that biscotti yeah gelato 25 in south florida oh gee that's a good one there's a few there's a few other um cookie crossovers that um that cry involves gelato i i tend to forget um the names of them so i really like i said i don't really come across gelato strings like that i do have a video on gelato shape regular gelato shape if not uploaded or i'm gonna drop it soon either way i already have it on deck so this will be the jet fuel gelato version the upgrade is literally an upgrade from regular gelato and the regular gelato from mr from what essentials that's just gelato there's no numbers to it or nothing it's just a lot of them and what gelato is isn't gelato with zito's crossbreed my show is i'm not sure what exactly frustrated with but i know it's cross rated with singles that's for sure this is this is definitely good i can i would recommend jeff which allows anybody who's into hybrid let alone this so i'm going to go finish this up though and as always guys until next time stay [Music] high", "gVRdnEq4in8": "[Applause] today an alarming breaking news report about vaping it's a new piece of the puzzle that may explain the mysterious vaping injuries we've been covering here on the show from double lung transplants to even death I mean big complications is the culprit black-market THC the chemical in marijuana that gets you high and listen products are being sold to unsuspecting customers that have no idea what they're buying may be lethal senior legal and investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden brings us this as an NBC News exclusive our investigation took us to downtown Los Angeles where in a 12 block radius we saw dozens and dozens of storefronts advertising vaping products we're in pursuit of what black market operators come here for the empty packaging and cartridges that they fill with cheap and often tainted substances sold as legitimate THC products within minutes we score we were able to go in one shop one-stop shopping by these dank VAP containers the packaging and a hundred of the cartridges into which you can put whatever you want there's no ID no tax no nothing and it's counterfeit marijuana babes like these that may be making people sick I do believe that I was given black market stuff and I do believe that had a had an effect on me Fabian says his lungs were slowly beginning to shut down he ended up in the emergency room I couldn't breathe I couldn't talk I really couldn't even move my hands so what is lurking in these black market vapes and are the legal ones even safe no one not even the FDA or the CDC had tested the actual vapor people are sucking into their lungs until now we revealed those results Cynthia joins us what exactly is marijuana vape and how do you compare it to the typical East cigarettes or tobacco baby ok so a step backwards vaping is just taking a liquid of the compound heat it up and then that vapor is what you suck into your lung so if it's nicotine like a Joule which has 80% of the market that's tobacco THC the active ingredient in marijuana it's made into a liquid form and then it's heated up and then you suck that into your so again the cartridge looks like this that's what we were buying that's what we were buying on these are the ones we bought on the street so we bought for a hundred bucks we bought a hundred containers and a hundred of these so if I'm a black-market manufacturer of THC oil I'm in business when you walked into that store yeah what actually transpired what was the conversation like you said I got a hundred bucks when you got for me did you have to sort of lead him along how'd you hook that the fish well the first thing I would say is that we had our choice of dozens and dozens and dozens of stores in downtown Los Angeles all of them selling these kinds of illicit products and so we said hey we want to buy some containers we rolled off a few of the illicit names that are popular dank vapes is one you've got it right here dank vapes it is associated with many of the people who got sick it is not a legitimate brand there is no company called dank vapes so the black market on this which is what's concerning to me seems to be dominant there doesn't seem to be any way of digging taking them out less consumers are unsuspecting well even more insidious there are legitimate brands that aren't contaminated of THC oil that you can buy in states where it's legal and these counterfeiters make boxes and carts that look exactly like those legitimate brands so the consumer has essentially no idea what he or she is going to get so the Mac market operators fill empty cartridges with their own substances and then they're selling them as legitimate tested products but what exactly are they putting in there and is it dangerous Cynthia brought the stuff to a lab to find out if the chemist a flabs in Los Angeles considered one of the top marijuana testing facilities in the world can a safe executives Aaron Riley and Antonio Frazier explain they've come up with a brand new test we wanted to design a system that would be able to provide reproducible results to do something they wish the government would do analyze the vapor produced by illicit THC oil Canas they've tested seven THC cartridges from licensed dispensaries and six from the black-market we come back the shocking results from the lab [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I'm back with NBC News investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden and for the very first time a new lab test is able to tell us exactly what is in the vapor produced by THC oil when you vape what's actually going into your lungs to remind everybody what you tested okay we tested seven legitimate products these are licensed brands from licensed dispensaries and then on the black market we tested six black market these are listen what did the kind of safe lab testing show was in the vapor coming out of it okay there were no contaminants in either the oil we also tested the oil previously either the oil or the vapor here if that was used at the temperature that's recommended we can talk about that let's say that the lowest temperature or lower temperature lower temperature because guess what when you crank the thing up which is what kids do because it makes more vapor Oh carcinogens yeah so not safe anymore not safe anybody know what happened to black market cartridges even when it was turned at the right power setting on the low side okay under the best set of circumstances this stuff is dangerous it's contaminated this is just you're asking for it you vape this stuff you're asking for it well they're stealing your money it's not surprising they would steal your health well what percentage of America is given products that are counterfeit yeah you're asking questions really hard to answer because this is the illicit market the black market it's underground law enforcement is having a really hard time getting a Tanz around this think about it I mean the FDA isn't testing this stuff why it's not legal across the country so the FDA doesn't have the authority to test these brands but you know states are doing the best they can but the best they can it's not good enough in my opinion because we've got a population doesn't appreciate I just the things I've read maybe it's a quarter maybe it's half of all the stuff is counterfeit it's being brought basically from a drug dealer all right the THC oil let's go through exactly what kinds of things were found in your testing by the way it's state of the art and I would applaud you for doing this because our own government is in doing this we've finally got the answers from you well some of the things none of them good carbon monoxide formaldehyde pesticides well we're in the counterfeit stuff the ELISA stuff for rat you find a couple things that surprised you yeah it'll surprise you to cyanide yeah you don't want your kids breathing that stuff you just don't or yourself and vitamin E oil which is a little bit confusing it really sounds healthy but what they want though is the consumer to think it's real THC oil so they mix it with vitamin E oil why they pick that one because the viscosity the thickness is the same as vitamin E oil so these are really crafty dastardly criminals so let's talk a little about vitamin E because I think it's exam it's emblematic of the problem here we all know substances like pesticides and sine are dangerous let me talk about it but vitamin E sounds healthy right but when you inhaled the vapor with vitamin E in it it goes into your lungs right at the high temperature it's converted into an oil to a grease in your body once in a long some say that it coats the Airways and when it does that then coats the Airways it starts an inflammatory reaction making it really hard to breathe the information in the oil get into the tiny little sacs these little sacs alright of your lung they're not hard to treat now the CDC thinks vitamin E is that big culprit behind these marijuana vaping deaths and injuries but we're no unsure and if these black markets your products are being sold like this the question I'm having everybody is what can people do to make sure that they're getting something that's safe well don't buy illicit products buy from a licensed dispensary is one thing I just want to add a little bit to your vitamin E oil here's so the Mayo Clinic as you know did a of testing on 17 patients who had that vaping illness and they discovered that the lungs of those patients looked like someone who'd been exposed to mustard gas so it's why it's important they're only state regulated marijuana dispensaries in states were its legal right to your point the government won't regulate it because it's only in these states so when you look at the country if you're in a red state maybe you're buying marijuana from a legitimate place right if you're in a great state guarantee or not then if it in the red states from Cynthia Stella me is there more of the illegal places illicit places than illegal ones which means you're buying the stuff from drug dealers they're not legitimate sellers I don't see a difference between two groups so you've got another big warning which I wanted to point out which is the temperature warning just make that really clear to folks so when we tested the legal product that didn't have the contaminants that are horrifying the cyanide and other things cranked up higher they produce what the lab told us were carcinogens but you know if your kids are doing it tell them making those big vapor puffs is just not worth it it could be killing them so if you're not buying THC cartridges for a licensed dispensary in states where they're illegal here's the picture again right you're buying them from the drug dealer don't do it and if your vape pen is an adjustable temperature setting don't crank it all the way up because it's dangerous lots of data support in this now use the low power setting Cinthia wonderful reporting thank you very much you can catch Cynthia's reporting on today and NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt

smoke to that ready but this is from regulator and it is gelato not only that I'm gonna do another one from these guys as I said I bring you guys from constellation this one is pretty pebbles to half grammar and this is a hundred percent peers silent this hash oil vapor cart looks like that's where it comes in but let's do you read this one so they said gelato I was trying to get some fire it but that's close I can get ammo crap so let's check it out okay like yeah babe and I'm using a Lewbert battery puts out so get to from the shop I work at also with the regulator's wow that's pretty good this is a hybrid I say it's just a team a hybrid because you can really feel it in a head but pretty good not bad now check this for now like I said this one's free pebbles made from constellations they say it's solving this hash so pretty cool little package they come in let's check it out this is on medium template can searches to low medium and high attempts on air so Wow that's a difference between that you really can get the earthiness out of this get that little fruitiness from it and it tastes a lot cleaner for sure man that is some awesome stuff yeah solving this hash dudes so yeah these cart half gram but man they're worth it for sure yeah these guys did good man for you fellows like I say get that real earthiness that but you do get that fruitiness taste it but dirtiness when you exhale get that bread taste at that and let's say like a piney taste after an X out of Javad oh yeah yeah both carts are awesome this is distillate like I said this is made out of solid massage from constellation you see that this one regulator a grand cart so that's my review on both carts so they're both awesome so anything let's do a combo here we go man oh and the flower I'm doing the combo is with blueberry headband that's it is popcorn nuts for green vault and I I did a video with the other one this and this is penny wise and also popcorn eggs from Greenville and you can get this at the shop so all right man let's do it Wow there you go that's what we teach different arts man hey from cousins have a dink there", "bD6ACtDcGSQ": "[Music] today we're gonna focus on how to fill the transferring a3 cartridge this is a cartridge that features a hidden silica wick heating chamber as well as an all glass and metal exterior construction to begin disassembling this cartridge to prepare for filling it's very simple all you have to do is unscrew the metal mouthpiece with a few twists you'll see that it simply disconnects with a simple pull up from the cartridge itself leaving you with just an empty cartridge and the mouthpiece now to begin filling I suggest that you use a blunt tip syringe and with all transferring USA orders one is included and the reason it's blunt tip is so that it's safe to use it cannot pierce skin and features a 15 gauge needle tip gage refers to the actual thickness of the needle and you don't want to go any bigger than 15 gauge or else it won't fit down inside of this cartridge to begin filling now the one special thing to note with the a3 cartridge is that it does not have a center post to fill through this center post right here is actually the air channel what you want to do is fill to the side it is a side filling cartridge so to begin filling you want to place your needle to the side of the center post but but inside the glass once you have your needle placed correctly to the side of the center post simply begin pushing your material inside don't go too fast cause you don't want it to overfill and as you approach your desired volume simply withdraw the needle and this is very important as with all cartridges you want to make sure that you cap within 30 seconds of filling and to cap simply place the mouthpiece on push it down and begin twisting in a clockwise direction to tighten it once it is completely tightened you now have a filled cartridge and there's only one more step if you have done a hot fill meaning that the material in your syringe is actually hotter or has been heated up hotter than the outside ambient air temperature if you're performing a hot fill what you want to do is immediately after capping and filming flip the cartridge upside down and store it in that position for the next two to three hours what this will do is drive the air bubble that normally would have been on the bottom and you can see this one rising here up to what is now the top which is the bottom of the cartridge here this allows the air bubble to vent to the outside atmosphere and expand and contract without pushing back and forth into the heating chamber again this step is only important if you have done a hot fill if you have done a cold fill or you've injected material that is the same temperature as the outside atmosphere this step is not necessary you can then just place your cartridge right side up and begin using it however if you have performed a hot fill it is very important that you flip your cartridge upside down after filling for two to three hours to let it cool down and that's it [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "dgNd9l3kwSA": "[Music] hi my name is Kevin and today we're going to be looking at a CBD rich 18 to 1 disposable vape cartridge from care by design CBD is a chemical compound that has significant medical benefits but it doesn't leave you feeling stoned so this particular ratio and this product is considered non psychoactive which makes it ideal if you are new to cannabis you have a very low tolerance or if you're just looking for relief without the hype the packaging is minimalistic and clean it shows that this is an eighteen to one CBD to THC ratio CBD dominant or CBD rich means very low to no psychoactivity to be even more precise you see there's only 3.6 1% THC compared to 60.1% CBD opening the box the cartridge shows 18 to one so you don't mix this up with your high THC cartridges if you swap them out also try not to lose the cap if you'll be switching cartridges as it does prevent the oil from leaking out this cartridge will fit any 510 thread battery [Music] and it really is that simple this cartridge has a very easy draw it has no marijuana flavor just leaves a slightly sweet taste in my mouth now vaping is actually one of my favorite ways to medicate with CBD because it's fast-acting the effects normally come on in five to ten minutes and they generally last from one to two hours this eighteen to one ratio in particular is really good for helping with mood disorders for mood elevation for busting stress or because it's mildly anti-inflammatory for helping with pain to some extent as well you can pick up this cartridge or any others at hello and be calm thanks for watching catch you next time [Music]",

they're just like kind of new to the market as well but these these are like alright these are game changers you know as you guys can see the on the side that says it what's a sale man it says less than the 2 v battery you know you don't to burn it and it says distillate free guys this is not a distillate cartridge this is a straight liquid diamond sauce car I've never had a liquid diamond sauce card I've never seen a review on YouTube there was only one guy who did a review there IRS's it's an ice cream cake and yeah this should be pretty bomb you know the it's full gram I don't know where these guys in their Humboldt County so yeah guys we're gonna get in straight to so you have this little button here press this button hey let me show you guys a little close-up ice cream cake and it's a 76 percent THC what I think yeah 76 percent so yeah guys this is pretty dope you know the everyone that the shot was telling these are pretty far and we're gonna go ahead and see I'm gonna I'm gonna let you guys know I love rock garden and [ __ ] but I'm gonna see if these are better than raw garden so you know I've never had a liquid diamond sauce car which it says there is pretty dope you know so if you guys ever see these be on the lookout so as a little button there and you got impress it and you gotta twist it off slow sticker pull out I don't break the damn thing oh [ __ ] Wow looks pretty dope guys so we're glad mom how do you do this do you just pop it up just pop it out and bam down this is a pre feels pretty good no nice and heavy the oil looks pretty decent you know it looks kind of different from what other cartridges would look like gots nice little day in there but you get a full ground because I I was reading their information on Instagram as well you know if there's a big day is because the Okoye in there has a nice big koala as you guys can see you know it's a pretty nice big coil in there so it's what it does is the coil sucks up some of the oil in there so that's what put some damp but you guys took it you're full ground you know I'm saying yeah I ain't getting ripped off or nothing like that so like I said these this is probably like the second Ursula review on YouTube guys there's gonna be you know these cartridges just hit the market so I don't know how long they've been out but I heard they taste like exactly like [ __ ] like if you're taking adapt hey you know what I mean like straight really it's it's is it I'm think no distillate so I'm gonna flip it over hold it for a little bit this is a distillate free cartridge guys it's just gonna be fire as [ __ ] it was like 55 bucks you know out here 55 bucks for cartridges it's kind of expensive you know and with tax on top of that so we're to be him I'm going to try hit those imma see if I have some flavors but I'm sorry you do get a little clean taste like a live resin like what's it called like a raw garden would taste like so you don't really get like in a specific flavor to it now I want to let you guys know um I just hit that criteria for for YouTube to be for my channel to be monetized so I'm not really really excited you know I'm really hoping you know the channel pays off that we can help the channel grow buy more products and [ __ ] like that so you know for you guys and as if it wasn't for you guys I would never got my channel monetize you know it's [ __ ] crazy so if you guys ever see ads on the videos don't [ __ ] skip them guys watch those ads watch them all please it really helped me a lot in the channel but thank you guys you know you guys are awesome so we're just gonna go numb we're going to hit this and I'm let you guys know if it's really worth it or not you know what I mean but cheers guys if you guys are smoking out with me go ahead and do so take a little hit just to get some flavors I could taste it oh wow the flavors guys I would describe it is if you guys took a literally a [ __ ] DAP it oh wow that's crazy so it literally tastes like some real real wax guys they don't taste like a cartridge you know this thing is amazing the flavor I would describe it like if you would take like a literally a dab of the raw garden taste like waxy clean taste to it it's [ __ ] bomb but you don't really get like an ice cream it's an ice cream cake strain so you don't really get the ice cream cake in it but you do really get this like I could cushy like a clean taste cushy taste it is so good it tastes so clean I'm gonna go ahead and hit this again I might hit it a little longer and try and kill myself at awaken Bay but cheers guys hope you guys are smiling on with me mo oh wow most definitely I will be getting some more of these this one's only flavored they had it was a ice cream cake I'm not heard they had like a banana oh gee they have a lemon tree but I'm I shot the only Hodgins ice cream cake but if you guys ever see this ice cream cake you guys got a copy I'm not [ __ ] around with you I'm over-exaggerating it sings fire I'm not playing it tastes exactly like [ __ ] dab it tastes so like that's so real like it's crazy I'm sure you guys the packaging again so you guys can see you know it's distillate free or 100% cannabis which is pretty dope you know the thing these are game changers right here you know liquid diamond sauce cards these are actually liquid diamond sauce cars not no [ __ ] and the cartridge itself you know they got to it's really cool they got the nice new ceramic tip on there everything's ceramic on the cartridge I'm pretty sure cuz it looks pretty dope guys so if you guys if you guys want to go on Instagram and look up Ursa to get some more information or you know just to check the cartridges out for you guys itself and I also seen some cartridges that had like some fuzziness and they're like they actually know like I had some actual accidents so it just depends on the cartridge you guys get well but hope you guys are ready for that Super Bowl if you got a Niner fans like this V no comment you know I'm a big man of fun as well hopefully we win it probably just a barbeque that day tomorrow you know drink some beers and [ __ ] watch the game that's on this Saturday morning he has plans which you guys smoking on but I'm gonna hit this guy before I cut the video short guys and I'm I'm gonna be coming up with the for-sure for-sure this week I'm gonna do like a strain review you know hotbox I have my barn with me as well gonna be doing some bond ribs for you guys you guys stay tuned you know maybe later on today or tomorrow morning I'll be coming up with the new videos so guys I'm a end the video imma gonna hit this again and I'm going sad because it's cold as [ __ ] these things rip like a [ __ ] rock garden as well [ __ ] alright guys but thanks for watching guys you guys stay tuned I'm gonna be coming up with a new beat as I said and yeah", "4OlmQRxY3QU": "hey what's up everyone it's your boy mr. blinky back again with another video today I'm gonna be looking at this fake heavy hitters cart and showing you guys the signs to look for when you're buying your own heavy hitters carts to see which ones are fake and which ones are real so let's go ahead and get into the video all right so there are five big signs to look for when it comes to identifying a fake over a real heavy hitters cart so I'm just gonna quickly go into each of those first up we have cold filtered at the top real heavy hitters carts that are sold as one gram cartridges do not say cold filtered at the top they just simply don't have that they just say all of this stuff so that's already a big red flag second red flag would be that California label on the inside of the box that I'm trying to show you guys that should not be there that should be blank and it should just have the hh4 heavy hitters on this silver foil type thing or the silver foil type paper on the inside of the packaging that California label that you see right there should actually be right here unauthentic heavy hitters packaging the third sign is right down here where you see the 2019 fluids manufacturing ink and all of that other [ __ ] that should not be there which should be there is this push to release embroidered into the Box where you have to tear it to open it you should not be able to open real cart boxes this easily because obviously that can make it easy for anyone to just put whatever they want into these boxes so the fourth sign would be right here where it says instructions that should actually say suggested use and then finally you have right here where it says Bubba cush that is not a strain that heavy-hitters offers in there one gram cartridges I'm gonna link the heavy-hitters website in the description but you can actually go there and see a list of every strain they offer so if your plug is trying to sell you one that's not on that list on their website then you know he's bullshitting you those are a few very quick signs that you can look at to see if you're gay faker a real heavy hitter skirt now I'm gonna go ahead and plug it into my battery take a few puffs on it to see how it tastes and see how it hits and I'll go ahead and come back tomorrow until you guys how the high is how it makes me feel and if these are even worth buying so yeah let's go ahead and get into that all right so the 710 carts that these heavy hitters are using are not DAB cap compatible unfortunately it's the same kind of tip that you can see in exotic carts it's sort of like a funnel but it's too small to actually clip on or not clip on but like attached itself to the dab cap so unfortunately I can't show you guys a rip through a rake but if these carts are actually decent I'll figure out how to do that for tomorrow so for now let's just go ahead and take a few puffs see how these cards taste and how they rip and I'll let you know my thoughts so cheers guys [Music] so off that rip I'm getting a bit of earthy taste it tastes kind of like dirt if I'm being honest it's not very pleasant but the smoke is really smooth and it doesn't really hurt my lungs while I'm hitting it so that's a good sign I'm gonna go ahead and take another rip and we'll see if I'm starting to feel the buzz off - so Cheers [Music] yeah I'm getting good cloud production on it I don't feel a buzz or anything but these are so it doesn't feel like a chore daf-2 puffs on this cart I'd actually definitely hit this thing all day so I'm gonna go ahead and do that I'll come back tomorrow and share my thoughts and we'll see if these cars are worth buying so I'll see you guys tomorrow all right guys so I'm going through so much [ __ ] to get this video done right now this is my third time recording this part of the video because the first time I recorded it I didn't press report the second time I recorded it I had a Miranda sings hairline so we cut that [ __ ] out I'm gonna leave the other half of this part in simply because like I don't want to re-record that I do not want to get that high again you'll see I was super fried during this F um and I look terrible but anyway so things I went over in the part where I had the bad hair line so I've used this hurt for two days now and I used it for two days because I didn't think one day was enough to get like a good read on the highs of the potency and all the other good stuff I like to review oh and what got cut out was when I was talking about the potency it's really good four to five hits gets you a nice buzz six to seven hits gets you high and then if you get to nine hits then you might be slow to order in space like this current really does hit heavy even if it's not like a legit heavy hitters cart um and yeah now I'll go back to myself in the past um to finish off the video so see you guys oh yeah and the camera angles suck right now because my tripod literally just broke while I was trying to finish this video so you know we're just having fun it's a it's a great time book ago or I'm right but uh yeah so I'm ordering new tripod so I can fix my ankles again we might have to go back to the old recording area yeah so channel updates yay next up we have how long these cards last I have been using this card for two days now and it's about 1/4 of the way done so that means I would probably last around eight days if you're lucky um I've also been sort of with this cart not gonna lie but it does get me high for a long time so like being sparing is also easy with it my next point is the flavour and wax quality I know in my initial review of it I said it just tasted like straight dirt but after hitting it a few more times I can start of I can sort of start to taste more earthy tones like when you taste coffee um it doesn't taste exactly like coffee but it does taste sweet and earthy like a coffee beverage would um I would highly recommend getting this cart honestly like the wax quality is decent it's very slow-moving which was it like a good sign for me and unlike what the TKO cart even though it's slow-moving this one actually does hit really [ __ ] hard um if you guys have these around you and they look around the same like quality as these ones I would highly recommend picking them up I would set these up like right there with tanks and dab woods um easily an 8 out of 10 um I already filmed this review and I'm really high right now so it's kind of hard to like keep a steady train of thought but I think all I have it done for the second half is take hits on camera so let's go ahead and take two rips out of the battery then we'll go and take two rips through violet and then we'll end the video so thank you guys so much for watching if you made it this far please leave in the comments what your favorite cart brand is right now because I'm trying to find new brands to try I already have dragon's breath on my list um and I really want to try ROH soon um but yeah and please in the comments stop telling me to try likes dizzy I can't try Suzy's even though I really want to so every time you all tell me to try as dizzy I just died a little bit more inside um where I live we don't have like studies all right so I cannot try though thanks for the suggestions though I really appreciate it and if I do ever find its dizzy the first thing I will do is record myself dry again so um yeah let's go ahead and get into these rips guys Cheers yeah it just tastes really good and the hits are actually starting to be pretty smooth off of it too um when I first recorded it I coughed like a [ __ ] after all of my hits but now that I'm already high all these sets just feel smooth and it tastes really good so let's go ahead and take another hit Cheers my throat bout dry as [ __ ] so let me go ahead and drink some water and then I'll take another hit I hope y'all can see how high I am right now cuz I believe is [ __ ] fried right anyway so Cheers [Music] I tried I tried to do a ghost I don't know if it showed but yeah but we tried all right anyway let's go ahead and take a few ribs through violet and then I'll end the video so the hard part is trying to figure out how to smooth these through a dab cap so I'm gonna get behind the camera and just show you real close-up like the easiest way to do it so that in case you guys have a dab cap in these kind of tips you can smoke them through rigs too so to get this with a dab cap this is so hard to hold with one hand you have to like put the dad cap upside down and then you just have to like hold the car on top of it see if it'll focus and then you just have to hold the car on top of it like that and that way it funnels into the piece anyway I'll go ahead and show you guys I hit yeah so just for the record real quick this will be my third hit through violet off off this cart since I've started my smoke sesh um and I've probably taken five hits of the cart like on just trying to do this review and I'm already like this fried so that should just speak for the like potency of this cart alright the pink incident I didn't realize all right I know this next hit is gonna send me so I'm gonna go ahead and say peace right now thank you so much for watching and I hope you guys stick around my next video is gonna be sort of a channel update I think and I'm gonna be talking about this giveaway that I want to do but yeah leave them in the comments some ideas of it keep it kind of like under a hundred bucks or around 100 bucks cuz I'm just having to pay for this out of pocket so thanks again for watching all of my content thank you guys for subscribing and commenting and like my videos all of it means a lot to me and I do my best to respond to as many comments as I can but if I ever miss your comment just like comment again or something or like if you want you can hit me up on Instagram and Twitter like y'all are chill and I like having a community here so thanks again and let's get this last hit out of the way guys I'll see you guys later I just realized I say guys a lot guys and gals in case I have any of the lead he's watching me yeah in case I have any like women watching me then welcome to the channel as well thanks cheers guys [Music]", "LogNScDsdhI": "it's gelato be high so you use marijuana they tend there's a oil right there uses a pattern and when it runs out just blow it away not bad right [Music] [Applause] [Music] tastes like gelato ice cream bacon thing [Music] [Music] anyways thanks for watching this in the short video one more time [Music]", "76etd8Ye6BA": "[Laughter] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another nug product video so yeah we got an authentic bag right here i paid 41 out the door for this shopping mall so yeah let's just see how much should i pay yes 40. 40 99 you see that for a full gram cartridge not bad not bad so this is ambrosia this is their nug live resin line and uh yeah as you can see in the back all that good stuff the the percentages i believe it's uh eighty percent exactly well not exactly but that's what they put it and also the manufacture date and all that stuff is uh fairly new about three three months old so not bad date of manufacture is a bit older i think april so but got the nug family i haven't had a nug cartridge in a while i've only had one of their cartridges i forgot what strain it was but i just remember that it was a actually a pretty pleasant experience um i did enjoy it and it lasted pretty long so i'm excited to try this other one and uh let's just see if i can find my battery all right so if you didn't know by now i lost my chill battery i dropped it in the hole when we went to sf you should have seen that video by now but it's unfortunate but we got the press slide right here so you just okay well it's a ceramic heating core as well so that's pretty dope and also nugg.com if you guys want to check them out so just pull it out to use attack wow okay you got the logo right there let's do a little box little thumbnail action hopefully it's getting it go up go down right there so we're going to be hitting it in my dash vape retro you guys already know the deal and uh yeah this is looking pretty good i'm not gonna lie screw that bad boy in let me know if you've tried nug before like i said i've tried it only once and i really enjoyed it it lasted really long compared to these other cartridges so uh i'm pretty excited let's see i haven't used this battery in a while i've been using my chill one so cheers boys oh very very smooth you can you can tell that ceramic heating oil works because i do not taste no burning sensation very very smooth hit it's very very comparable to an erza i'm not gonna lie wow let me take that hit again this is the ambrosia by the way cheers boys that's a blinker for a blinker it's not as fat hits that i'd uh i'd normally see from other live resin cartridges um but the taste is there wow i feel like i could probably like do a five second hit and then a blinker and that will do a pretty decent size hit which is what i'm gonna do so hold on oh there you go wow that is really enjoyable so would i like i said what i remember from the other nug is that it lasts longer than other cartridges so i'm hoping this one lasts just as long because i'm really enjoying the flavor here uh for 41 dollars is generally the price of what you get from typical live resin cartridges uh except for the exception of urza which is like 55 to 60. but this is good i'm not gonna lie like i'm honestly it's one of the better tasting live resins that i've tried lately lately and uh i don't know where i'm gonna be placing this but i know it's on my top five nug is definitely on my top five uh from my last top five video i said i believe it was four or three um i just feel like maybe buddies edged it out a little bit because they had more of a selection and it's a bit cheaper but this taste like i've been on a bad roll right now of buying products and not liking it and honestly i'm kind of happy that i bought this uh this was like the only one in the display that they had left that authentic so i knew that maybe out of all the strains that they had of the nut cartridge that this one was the one that was chose the most and honestly i'm glad i chose this wow i'm really enjoying this and look at it i think i barely even touched it and i just did maybe like two three blinkers maybe two let me take another hit for you guys so like i said the hints aren't going to be as fat for you know blinkers on other live resin cartridges but not [ __ ] bad not [ __ ] bad i'm probably gonna take two more hits off of this and then and then we're just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed this video if you haven't tried nut cartridges i've tried two out of i've tried two of them so far and it's been two out of two [ __ ] a hit so uh i'm gonna take two more hits like i said cheers boys enjoyable so also i'll post the link to this battery if you guys are interested in that i believe the cheapest that i've seen it was like 15 to 20 i don't know and then there's obviously uh shipping involved but nonetheless very very good battery from daz vape shout out to them always supporting me um yeah just uh i don't know i'm happy about this cartridge right now i'm ecstatic that i bought this cartridge i was gonna buy another buddy's cartridge because i did lose my buddy's cartridge i was gonna buy another train wreck but then i was like let's just try something new and a nug well it's not totally new because i've done a video on their their uh i forgot what strain it was but it was a good strain i'm gonna take another hit for you the last hit and then we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video you know like it subscribe if you haven't already if you want to and yeah i'll take this hit cheers boys all right guys peace out [Music] [Music] you", "bXJfXSECsZ4": "[Music] as mad at ruff house studios and welcome to my review of the steezy premium concentrated vaporizer cartridges and pens before we get started with the review I would like to thank the guys at steezy for sending out the cartridges that we're using today and setting up this review if you'd like to learn where to purchase them or to learn more about them please check out Steve's e-comm or find them on weed Maps now let's get started here's the unboxing of the steezy starter pen kit this is the pen that you will need if you're going to use any of the steezy cartridges inside of the box with the pen you have an owner's manual instructions warranty information you also have a USB charging cable and the steezy vaporizer unit itself and you can see we have a real simple kit there nice-looking little vaporizer unit but of course you're also going to need a cartridge that we're gonna unbox one of the indica biscotti and inside of the cartridges you will find also an owner's manual to tell you how to use it as well as the cartridge itself and you had you can say this is where the magic happens with this product here and we'll get it and talk more about the oil inside of these cartridges in just a second but first let's take a closer look at the pen and the cartridges themselves the pen is actually metal I thought it was plastic but upon inspection it's actually a nice metal pen there you've got the microUSB charging cable in the bottom and at the top you have the elements or the connectors that will connect it to the actual cartridges it's a really nice shape and design and it's very very small and stealthy it fits right in the palm of your hand and it's very light and you can see at the bottom of the carpet cartridges there's a little cap that comes off and that shows you where the connections is that'll connect it to the device you plug it into device the device flashes a couple of times blue there's also a light at the bottom on the heel of device and I'm not sure if it's intended but that cap that was on the bottom makes a perfect little dust cover to keep the land out of it and so yeah that that's pretty much it on the device list now to get to the most fun part of it at this little usage and the testing of the steezy concentrate pin first you're gonna charge it up that blue light there will be red while it's charging it once it's fully charged it turns blue you know it's fully charged and then comes the hard part and isn't making a decision we had 12 different flavors to choose from we had a for each of the indica as the hybrids and the sativas three or four of those were actually flavored as well but most of them were just strained specific and I tell you what they taste spot-on this is some of the best taste and cleanest wax I've hit it's a very very enjoyable experience the taste is smooth you can get a big hit if you inhale for a minute it does after about 10 seconds or so it will automatically cut off but believe me you'll have plenty of big enough hit for maximum head this pin is really great it's so easy to use the taste was incredible on all 12 of those different strains believe me I've tested them all and they're really amazing they're a distill it so they're out 90% THC and man you can really feel it let's go to the pros and cons oh the pros are that is so super easy to use it it's very clean of all these cartridges I had there was no leaks no breaks or any kind of problems with any of the cartridges the taste is amazing you can get big hits or you can get small hits and it's very strange specific no additives and the extract themselves cons are the battery life is a little short and the packaging on the cartridges tastes a little bit like or smells like on the issue anyway I still think it's great I'm gonna give it 4.5 stars out of 5 it's amazing so if you are in the market in California you can please check out Steve's EECOM that's st III is UI comm and you can find out where you can purchase those and you can also look them up on weed maps under

Shawn here I hope everyone is well and staying safe amid this whole Cove at nineteen pandemic hope everyone's doing their part practicing social distancing we're trying to flatten this curve and anyone who's using cannabis to just get them through these unsettling times or medicinally I hope you've got plenty of stock today I'm reviewing the Aurora drift vape cartridge and that's for the 510 thread system so this is a THC indica blend it retails for thirty four ninety five on the ontario canada store so a good price that's a lower on the lower end of price points for vape cartridges it has seventy six point nine two seventy s sorry let me correct that sixty seven point nine two seventy six point five percent THC so this is a strong two very strong THC level and there's zero to one percent CVD so negligible CBD in this one it's an indica dominant strain and the terpene profile includes Mersin pining and this one I have trouble pronouncing it's spelled GU a IOL GU al if anyone knows how to properly pronounce that please leave that in the comment section so my experience with this vape cartridge is first of all I like the price because it's relatively cheap the vape itself like the vape quality is smooth it's not harsh and flavor-wise you know nothing outstanding about the flavor it kind of just tastes like most of the other oils that you would find out there there's nothing you know specific I could pinpoint about the flavor of this one the effects come pretty soon after vaping and the effects are very one-dimensional like definitely doesn't have the full-body effect that I have experienced with the Zen Berry cartridge that I reviewed previously it's more just kind of a it's a little it's relaxing but it's very sort of stays in one place like it's really just in the head I don't really feel this throughout my body and it doesn't have like a very it doesn't pack a big punch it's kind of just in the background if that makes any sense so you know you're gonna get a little bit of a relaxing comma feck from this one but in terms of like a multi-dimensional type of effect you're really not going to get it from this this oil so that being said you know taking into consideration the price the experience the flavor I'm going to give this one a 5 out of 10 price is right you will get you know a bit of a relaxing response to this but it's in no way close to some of the other more encompassing oils that I've tried so that's the Aurora drift vape cartridge if you like these reviews please subscribe leave comments and I'll be back with another review shortly", "Y3vRyew74g4": "[Music] what's up Isaac Lucic here back with another new Intel entitled this is going to be another cartridge review and this is a pretty new company I've never heard of but this smell free cannabis company and they were kind enough to give me a voucher to purchase one of these for $2 and they actually let me try some of their stuff to they have live resin cartridges and they also have cured resin cartridges and her cured live resin cartridges mind you man from what I remember when they let me sample both of them I definitely remember that the cured lie breath and tasted so so good I believe this one's going to be there their live resin one another thing that they mentioned to me which was surprising was that that they're live resin cartridges also has distillate in here so I'm not too sure I mean I'm pretty sure they said that about that but I could be wrong so correct me if I'm wrong the free canvas company but we're gonna be using the pocket you guys already know I will have the link and the one description below if you guys are going to check that out this is a pretty expensive batteries so please check your other alternatives or other options before you finally decide on this because what I like does not mean you like it you know I'm saying I like it because it's a very I it's just a smooth sleek design and build it has a nice feel to it but it is pretty pricey so like I said please just uh know what you're getting into know what you're buying I'm checking all other alternatives because this channel is cool about cannabis content and all and stuff but it's also you know save you a few bucks let you know about the products and always trying to save you some money guys always at the end of the day money is how you gave [ __ ] so I'm trying to hit you I'm trying to help you guys get the best [ __ ] that you can possibly get but not to talking this is going to be strawberry [ __ ] guys very very good stuff [Music] yes I do in a car cut and yes this is the new bandana I'm actually washing the other one so like I got sick of the skull the skull is actually better than polka-dots only have this one because it's black and a black bandana is less is non-threatening at least the gang members you know if I wear a red bandana I could get a shot blue shot black maybe not so much you know so I'm going to open this by the percentage of THC is 86 percent guys you can see right here I'm going too fast and I am sorry right off the back they use the same as select you can see very similar to the select plastic kit from iceless leg and right that kind of smell strawberries so this could definitely be mixed distillate [Music] good yeah [Music] before I get into the review or talk about that hit you might be noticing a faint man noises because I got a fan outside the window so it mentally it's better my room has been getting hot lately it's just because there's probably a lot of electronics there's a lot of people in my room constantly so a fan that attaches to the window is pretty good and it's actually going outward so it's sucking all the hot air out and uh yeah getting into the cart it taste like strawberries not too much I can say about the flavor other than if it tastes like strawberries not too overly powerful you know I do it does fade away quickly just like this lid does you know you but this Li exhales you get that full flavor boat it goes away pretty quick I'm not sure if it's just this lip [Music] so free cannabis fun so like I said earlier there live present and then have cured live resin and their live resin is mixed look a little bit of distillate is what I remember them saying and let's be real like come on this is the way and it tastes like strawberry I mean like live resident tastes like strawberry there's got to be some sort of like terpenes or strawberry terpenes in there that they put in there you know that's definitely not from the plant that I feel like you know some people like the discreteness of oh this guy's just smoking strawberry vape or whatever you know but yes it is good but yes guys this is a legit company okay I actually went to come all the flowers and picked it up I will post their information right here also in the description below and I'd like to mention you know guys just be careful with the cartridges that you were smoking I've been smoking cartridges for a while and nothing has ever happened yeah I always buy cartridges from the dispensary never have I I mean I've tried a few but I don't really buy them like I've tried my homies he usually goes to the sessions and I'm not gonna like I've tried you didn't really like it but I've tried you know yes free cannabis company guys I really really am enjoying this cartridge I'm not gonna lie but you guys already know me I like that I like the cartridges that taste like so but like I said they're cured light resin has that taste so if you do see this company try their cured live recipe try both it does matter try them next to each other and you can actually tell the difference because that's what I did at the booth and yes hopefully you guys enjoyed this video this brand is not bad I don't know the pricing of this I actually have not seen this at my local dispensaries or on weed maps and malls are selling it pretty cheap at the Hall of flowers by a walrus it won't reflect what you're going to be seeing at the dispensary so I can tell you the price $20 for a program $15 $15 I believe it was $15 for the regular live resin cartridges this year and then $20 or the cured live resin but like I said these prices won't reflect what you will see at the dispensary but I am liking this definitely like the cured resin better but I'm not gonna clean about this one if you guys like strawberry taste water looting stuff I really really would recommend this we'll take one more and then [Music] [Music] and there's cloud Stephanie cloud but yeah other than that I'll see you guys [Music]", "Wcx2GCs8YHA": "you know guys what's going on we are back with another review today's review is gonna be on select I could poke of gold or however the hell you say that first things first I just want to say if you are not over $18.00 fee here I'm sorry it's against the rules I don't know what they do but you know they can't so with that out of the way I want to say welcome back uh I wasn't postponing this video in any way whatsoever I literally this is this is the state of the cart as of last night so I uploaded that video the night I started using this and I'm gonna upload this the day I start using this so that's how long it took me to smoke that for comparison when I used to post videos on like the regular League on every other day or so my card videos I'd go through a half gram and about a day and then a full gram in about two to three if I was like really try and trying or if I was just having like a rough day or whatever I would puff through them [ __ ] I couldn't do that there's no way I would be able to do that this [ __ ] is a lot in this I don't know how little of a tolerance break two weeks is or how big of it tolerance break it is but that [ __ ] really stumped me so I think it was almost three weeks actually I'm not sure two to three weeks but I still have some in this I'll probably keep this around just to get one random time or whatever but that courts out it's old news today's card is gonna be a select card here I ripped off if you're wondering why it's missing I ripped off the sticker this is coming at ninety point five seven percent tha this is a sativa it was made on September 17 2019 so that's pretty cool here you go with your sweet-ass select carts your full grams they come with this cool little like in inter pamphlet hearing I'll try to let that focus if it will maybe nope select leaf flavors your medical marijuana enjoyment to a higher level wig with luxurious 13 infused cartridges Wow alright so obviously all saw a cool nice little kind of popped out no you don't gate so you just kind of pop it up there you go that's gone it's old news doesn't come with a little cap unfortunately all no big fan of the caps big fan of keeping [ __ ] clean that's just me you know I don't like dirty dirty anything um comes with a little bottom cap crazy I know your jupiter-c so standard whatever all that good [ __ ] the only thing I don't like so far as I have to fat ass Bobo's right there at the bottom because I think this was laying sideways the box and they just kind of sat there and said so hopefully a hopefully the ventas will pick up off that side we have the dr. zodiacs moon rock a moon rock a moon rock battery I have the other one charging back here but they don't think it wants to hold a charge for some reason so we're gonna kick it back with this bad boy are you go ahead and screw it on here this is gonna be the first high to date it's only let's see 9:01 a.m. I just woke up you know took care of my dogs I like my cats right here on the floor by the way this [ __ ] ah right here we got homie he doesn't want to be here up so we're gonna let it go uh yeah so this is a wake and bake session we're just chilling we got some good ass cold cold liquids here so you already know it's gonna be a nice time all right all right let's enjoy this chill Saturday you guys go cheers let me know if you're smoking anything down down there you all know you already know the deal just keep myself over and over again all right trigger okay yeah this is definitely no [ __ ] there's no flavor whatsoever when it comes to this except for it's just like cook so [ __ ] [ __ ] yep there it is hydration break yeah I know that's a very strong taste out [ __ ] I'm is very strong very good though I do like push sometimes not all the times it's it's like a hit or miss with me so this one's definitely a hit I like it I don't like it at the same time no I'll say that so that's something to look out the oil of this see if I can tell the difference looks to be pretty consistent with the last one color wise if you can kind of tell the Lighting's a little hard to pick up on the smaller one because there's not as much so we hold it this way baby so it's pretty much the same consistency it's just hard to tell because there's so little of this one same same color maybe maybe this one's got a little bit more of an amber ish tint looks like came straight at a Jurassic Park like there's a [ __ ] mosquito in this [ __ ] or some but these things these ones are both very thick oils like they they don't they don't move pretty easy they gotta be sat there like this one has been standing all night and there's still a still small divot right there that it's still trying to fill so select is definitely putting out some top ass [ __ ] some top [ __ ] you know I'm saying so I'm not recommending anything cuz you know I would never do that I would never recommend anybody but wait no you know they're alright let's do another one guys tooth slightly smaller one we're gonna take it slow here we're gonna just chill see what happens yeah yeah actually uh after the first head the the taste that weird weirder taste of you know the better just doesn't want to charge for somebody's and that's weird um the cliff tastes definitely like tones down throughout the next hit I'm sure it keeps going obviously he was get more acquainted to it but that first day it was really [ __ ] strong it was like hydration but but no that [ __ ] was [ __ ] that was like I was inhaling push just so whatever the [ __ ] you know right off the plan dude you know so [ __ ] it's already covered one of the little holes again it took it out of that hole so it kind of got close to that but that's alright that's right ah it's a nice Saturday Michael bite we might go do an adoption event I don't know it's full of eventful ideas Michael see little pump at the State Fair because why the [ __ ] not I probably won't I don't even like his music anyway how's y'all Saturday's going hope it's going good or whatever day it is cuz ya'll watching this pratically hope you all are having some good days Monday through Saturday Sunday so Roy's just a [ __ ] day I don't personally like Sunday's that's just me but I hope every other day the week's good for you let's do one more hit here and then we'll probably call it a good video there she was guys weird-ass cat but oh yeah yeah that one's gonna get me bro yes sir oh [ __ ] yep that's what poke [ __ ] wow that's [ __ ] good I'm pretty stoned right now guys I don't know if you can do you can definitely tell there's no way you can't but dude I'm just staring into my eyes or announce the loot oh I already got another video up and coming before did I say I dream right um I already got another video up and coming for the next one I'm gonna try to do it a little bit sooner I'll probably do it when this parts like a quarter way done or a quart away from being done or like halfway or somewhere in there that way you don't have to wait as long but I do have like I said another carton this is from a different brand it's from pure earth so there's a little camp for you guys so

today we are reviewing gko karts yet again and we are using a lot of apart which is a hybrid of course for ping it off the wall same canal a background nice will you kind of darker then the other ones but that's just probably because of the flavouring that they added to it sometimes the flavouring can counteract with [Music] the outers and then he did dry hit I already did before I got it it's a llama Hyjal I've had geladas and things NGOs and other flavours 50 parts yeah with dads the scene sometimes the Durban poisons and the berry lemon I never tried that will be a third video this is preheated nice huh prominent teeth first thing off bet you can definitely teeth the July the difference nice and smooth a little bit of coughing but not as much because it's a hybrid hybrid don't usually cause you to cough but they do good I overall experience before I'm feeling hyah buds coming on sensation do you know I mean it's smelling good originally I wasn't the biggest fan of gelato much because it's a basic flavor it's very good I though more indica based I believe I think then the Kadam in it hybrid by indica dominant I think I really do because it gives you more relaxed chill the Barry lemons was away more sativa wise and the Durbin poisons definitely sativa Shia's pen likes to give me problems right I'm just a pen or if it's a cards but sometimes it doesn't want to hear to going on I would just think I regret more of a hit there which I really did like for example I would hate this which is their poison I will pride you so much yeah maybe my tender oh [ __ ] sorry about that guys um pretty good hi I like it [ __ ] wait yeah the any suggestions on any videos that you would like me to do let me know if you'd want to be in a video let me know - totally down to do

to but think of something tough alright peace out and it was good seeing you guys again", "6fux4Z6HhBE": "Hey guys, Liam from Killer Ink here and today I\u2019m going to be showing you\nthe Cheyenne Capillary Cartridges. Cheyenne cartridges are some of the\nmost widely-used in the industry and the German manufacturer has now\ntaken the evolution of its carts\u00a0one step further. So let\u2019s take a closer look\u2026 These Capillary Cartridges have all the qualities\nthat you have come to expect from Cheyenne while offering tattoo artists a new\nand improved working experience. Inside the tip of the cartridge are\ncapillaries with ink reservoirs which allow them take in and hold\nmore tattoo ink than conventional carts. The result is an ink flow\u00a0that lasts up to 10 times longer than\nusual before\u00a0you need to dip them back into your ink cap. Colour mixing in the cartridge is still guaranteed and\nthey are also easy to clean out with water\u00a0between colours. In addition, Cheyenne\u2019s Capillary\u00a0Cartridges offer improved\nneedle guidance\u00a0for ultra-precise work in any direction thanks\u00a0in part to the colourless, transparent tips.\u00a0 The Capillary Cartridges ensure that tattoo ink\nis evenly distributed on all individual needles even in large magnum configurations. This\u00a0results in better tattooing results\nand less\u00a0trauma to the skin as surfaces are filled\u00a0consistently, reliably and more quickly. As with other Cheyenne cartridges, the Capillary\u00a0\nversions feature an internal safety membrane that\u00a0will protect your tattoo machine and client by\nstopping any fluids moving up and down the tip. The Capillary carts feature long taper needles and are compatible\nwith grips and machines that accept\u00a0Cheyenne-type cartridges. They come in one of\u00a0three configurations:\nLiner, Magnum, and Soft-Edge\u00a0Magnum each with a different coloured cap for\neasy identification of the needle configuration. We offer the Liner versions in 03, 05 and 07\u00a0needle sizes\nwith diameters of either 0.25\u00a0or 0.30 millimetres while the Magnums and\u00a0Soft-Edge Magnums come with\nneedle sizes of 09,\u00a013 and 15 with 0.35 millimetre diameters. The\u00a0Liner and Soft-Edge Magnum configurations\nare\u00a0also available with textured needles.

today with another video and in today's video we're going to be reviewing the uh colorado hemp pineapple express delta 8 disposable cart um we tried a hit of this in the uh stimulus check haul video but we didn't give it like a full-fledged review um so now i've smoked it a little bit i haven't been smoking it a ton though because i wanted to kind of give you guys as much of like my first half of the cart impressions so go ahead and grab whatever you guys are smoking on and cheers get a nice blinker hit on that so starting with starting with the flavor on these it is fantastic the pineapple notes aren't too [ __ ] heavy but they're there um and um the delta eight in this is very very decent uh the quality of the oil is very nice um just from the few hits that i've taken from it um not like right this second but like over when i did hit it a couple times i did feel it very much so and that's why we're going to go ahead and hit it again so cheers big shout out to lucky smoke shot for sponsoring this video um this pen ran me 25 um not very bad not very bad at all and it's pretty quality it's 95 percent delta eight oil and five percent terpenes as well as if you get delta eight liquid it is refillable now i don't know in terms of how refillable like how many times you'd be able to get a usage out of it but you can take the top off to it and put oil in there and it doesn't come with the charger but it takes a standard micro usb charger for your typical android not a usbc it is a standard charger um go ahead and hit whatever you guys are smoking on and cheers again huge shout out to lucky smoke shop for uh sponsoring this video quality product very much enjoyed it so far um and taste is good price point is good most of the delta eight carts are running around like 35 to 40 for a gram cart and this one runs you 25 the only minor inconvenience that i've experienced is the oil is really really thick and the bubbles are really hard to get out and uh but other than that i mean thick oil just means it's quality oil so we never have a problem with that you know um and yeah that's that's pretty much the review so thank you guys for watching this video um if you guys haven't already make sure to hit like and subscribe and hit that notification bell so you don't miss any more videos like this one and uh until next time [Music] stay blaze you", "kX_Q94myqoQ": "what is up YouTube fabric boy baskets you're gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys and then a Saturday morning today it's time to wake and bake so I really hope you guys are really having a good day hopefully you guys staying blessed the world's kind of [ __ ] up right now but it'll it'll be over soon guys so everything will be back to normal so I really hope you guys are doing good and yeah guys last week got posted like two videos I usually post like on a Friday or Saturday so you know my bad had kind of been a little busy you know with all this [ __ ] going on but today actually last week I have picked up this moxie these are actually new you know I've never seen them before I had gotten one before it was super super fire you know they taste like an Ursa cartridge like actual actual like resident and I had a like a question you know if you guys ever know like don't you guys think like why is raw Gardens live resin so lighter than other live resins like like this one right here for example this was like a dark amber color compared to this one like I'll show you guys right now like live resin for the raw gardens are really really like you know which there's a lot there's some people I'm a comment section that say like regarding this fake like fake life resin so I don't know I just want to get your guy's opinion on that and that's a couple people already telling me you know but we're going to take a hit others before we get in the cartridge just waking big guys Cheers but I want to appreciate my new subscribers and those who are new here you guys are awesome for watching my videos you know I really appreciate you guys but let's get into this Moxie cartridge these are called MX brand but I had gone in there um on their Instagram page and it says they have to do something with Moxie so I'm guessing it is Moxie cuz it's like the same letterings everything this one's a yellow og this one's of life as full spectrum life resin so THC on this is 80% so it's a pretty good cartridge for some live resin there's some licenses that don't really get that high THC you know but this one's around 80 so it's pretty good cartridge I paid like maybe like 40 bucks for this so it wasn't too bad you know so we're just gonna go ahead and pop it open guys I had had one before it was like the it was like watermelon OG it was really really good you know it had tasted like an actual dab you know it tasted like really weed and it is like no discipline and intake and I like a really really different flavor than like what a raw garden would have like that clean like rock gardens to me that kind of tastes all the same you know they have all that fresh clean taste to it which is I don't know it's pretty good I'm getting wrong but they all kind of do taste the same here you have a cartridge it's a seesaw I really love these seesaw cartridges right here you know they're like the dank dank vapes how the tips are I really really love these tips now this is what I mean you know raw Gardens this one's life resin and this is my resident as well so and this one's a Moxie and this was a raw garden as you guys can see this one's way lighter than this one this one's the darker amber color so a lot of people been saying raw Gardens fake live resin so let me know what you guys think about that and that's just coming from couple people not just one you know so let me know what you guys think about that oh I thought about it as well like it is kind of lighter than what this one is and on this is real dead live resin so guys let me know on that so this one's it's really really thick yellow oh jesus was the indica hybrid I'm guessing so I'm good and dry hedges let me see what it tastes like you know flavors off it so the best way to try to just to [ __ ] hit it so we're not going to take this off I didn't do a cartridge you'd be on this raw garden I was just too lazy and I got a like on a Wednesday or something Wednesday night so I just started puffing the [ __ ] out of it so we're gonna gonna screw this on the cartridge battery hopefully I was smoking well wouldn't you guys plot you guys vape pens whatever you guys got to get [ __ ] high mass waking day just around 7:00 in the morning before I hit this let me get up Oh Red Bull sponsors we may get sugar-free Red Bull but besides that guys oh hopefully got a smoke along with me work on ahead and try this [ __ ] this one's the yellow og moxie I guess MX brand whatever you want to call it so cheers guys oh wow right off the bat if you guys ever had a if you guys ever had a Ursa cartridge these cartridges taste exactly exactly like them they taste exactly like weed you don't get like that raw garden like taste to it you know it tastes actually like dad and that's one of the things that I was wondering like why does this taste more like dab you know and like the raw gardens taste like a little chemically you know I don't get me wrong they're pretty good but I don't know that's kind of weird to me but these cartons are pretty far guys are like 40 bucks for some actual life resin I said these taste like an oyster cartridge the taste on it it's like a strong dad taste you know really really good you definitely get that OG taste like a strong cushy taste at the end but it's mostly like a clean fresh oh gee tation well it tastes really really good like when I tried these cartridges like last week it was a watermelon og cross was something and I was really amazed by the turf shamash it was crazy I little smoked the coke cartridge like in two three days you go back-to-back that's how good it was but this one it tastes kind of the same but it's just had like a more strong cush taste to it now I'm feeling like a little good high right now I know like a really good buzz you know there's my waking bag I'm gonna take a bigger hit to see if you know I [ __ ] get a big cloud for you guys I hope you guys are smoking along with me and I'm also having a vaporizer I'm going to give away I don't know if you guys had seen my review I had done on these belief goes if you guys want to go ahead and check out my video I did on these but I would appreciate it and I'm also gonna do a giveaway because they gave me two of them so I'm not gonna use the other one so I'm gonna give it away I will personally share to you guys his doorstep I'm sending out to UPS wherever you guys are at so you guys let me know and guys she got something loaded already I'm glad and hit it again she'd like to take a blinker man [ __ ] it never tried to blink on these [ __ ] arm pen cards which is only like on Stevie or like a plug-and-play but we're going to try it blink on this [ __ ] I'm already loaded this card you just smacked guys if you guys ever see these MX brands Moxie cartridges like presents they're pretty fired they have a lot of flavors as well you know just as you guys can see they say Moxie on there so they say MX like I don't know it's it's weird but yeah that's just like a MX for like a little short you know we're for maxi but really appreciate you guys watching my videos you guys stay tuned for more I'm gonna be posting maybe smoking a whole cow gram cartridge and one sitting or if you guys I see you guys really enjoy hotbox meet us through I'm gonna be having more hot bugs video soon you guys stay tuned for that and well if you guys in

also would really appreciate that as well so you guys have a really blessed day and these guys", "X02JHdTdoPE": "all right hey guys what's up uh I'm gonna start this video off with a rant I'm honestly kind of done with kingpin at this point I'm getting endless hate for hit and I talk about fake hearts because apparently my kingpins then were fake and recently I just bought more fake kingpins honestly the ones I got before they were the best quality like vapes I've ever had they like they tasted amazing the reason I didn't finish the wax and those ones was because I literally couldn't I hid them until they wouldn't produce any more vapor so like that's just a bit of wax that's stuck in between the metal and the glass and the atomizer this time though and you'll see it in the video that I edited originally I was gonna do a video on like how to fix when you get like fake kingpins how to like transfer the distillate from one atomizer to another because I thought it would hit smoother and taste better but the thing is even after doing that and trying to give these fake kingpins a chance if you can see it I don't know if it's gonna show really well but uh the wax or the dissolute term Brown it started to taste terrible in this and now I can't even hit it without like hacking up a lung it made me green yesterday which was like a bad sign from the start because like I don't green out when I smoke unless it's like really shitty carts so like that sucked and I'm just gonna show y'all how it like hits so you can see like why I'm saying stay away from it from my own personal experience this shit's kind of this shit's not kind of dangerous this [ __ ] is dangerous I would just not buy kingpins if you're on like looking at black market dealers like just don't do it this shit's dangerous for you it's not healthy and the high isn't even good all it does is give you a headache and if you smoke too much you'll get sick so like [ __ ] fake kingpins [ __ ] this fake wax and yeah go into the video if you're like if you don't care about this ranch at all and if you still want to try these fake kingpins but like I'm telling y'all it's really not worth it it's a waste of money and if you have Danks or like even exotics they could be much better than this fake [ __ ] that I got at least so I'll show y'all how it hits and then we can go to the video but my message to y'all is just [ __ ] stay away from fake kingpin carts they're [ __ ] so yeah [ __ ] tastes terrible it tastes so disgusting if I took a longer rib I probably would hack tup a lot but like I've been smoking for the past hour not on this I'm like an actual decent card so yeah so lucky what we have here what we see in front of us today are two King pens a Skywalker og and a King Louie og you see I bought these because I wanted to do a review on them and show y'all why King pen has such a good reputation while it's great but look at the [ __ ] that I got the [ __ ] is this what the hell is in my cartridge is it meth is it meth cuz like I better not have a meth part I'm very upset cuz like y'all are on the internet you see that King pen has a great reputation but this is some [ __ ] this might be a fake it probably is a fake but it's a bad fake a terrible thing and usually your boy would be like oh well I guess this is an L I guess these parts are ruined let's say movies better open it still looking like someone dropped a [ __ ] glitter bomb in my cart I don't understand how this is passable this is some [ __ ] [ __ ] like for real so uh I'm not gonna take this sitting down i'ma show y'all what to do when you buy cars than the end of being [ __ ] [ __ ] like this all right okay so you may be asking why is he so angry about a fake kingpin card well not only am i angry because this [ __ ] is so crystallized and it looks like someone pushed it out of their urethra it's like you it doesn't hit watch [Music] okay that sort of looked like a good hit but hold up I promise you these suck [Music] okay see it's showing some clouds but y'all are gonna have to trust me on this it tastes burnt and it tastes like chemicals and it hurts my throat plus the pull is terrible from this 710 cartridge which is why my plan is to transfer it to a C sub cartridge also it's hot as [ __ ] in this room so it's probably making me angry but like I'm still really upset about these stupid kingpin cards so just to show you all real quick that I'm not like just bullshitting and complaining for no reason I'm gonna show you how it hits out up a tab cap just so you can see like it barely hits at all and it's still gonna taste terrible [Music] it tastes like [ __ ] I [ __ ] hate these 7/10 cartridges like I feel like even if the wax is fine after the crystallization which I don't even know if you can fix like it still just tastes bad so I'm still gonna put these in a CSL cartridge and then bake them through those so like let me show you all what to do or how to do that what you have to do is you have to steal your girlfriend or your sisters hair dryer and you just gotta try it on low and hit the cart with some heat so that the wax loosens up and becomes like a bit thinner so let's do that real quick all time laughs how long it'll take okay so this car is hot as hell but now that it's super hot and it's not super hot but it's hot enough that the liquid is a more loose and workable all you got to do is I like to keep a container under it you got to pour it in now let me see if I can get that egg you got to pour it in to a seesaw cartridge it is not showing and now my cats getting into the frame oh my god prints get out of the frame pants get out the frame anyway as you can sort of see I'm not trying to waste any of this wax otherwise I try to show you better but all you gotta do is heat up the wax and then pour it in to another cartridge that you would have if you smoked carts regularly or you can go ahead and buy a CSL cartridge offline I'll set I'll put a link in the description for y'all if you're trying to do this but like it's so easy to just transfer your wax this way look at that it's already like filling up the new cart and if I heat it so more I can probably get the wet the rest of the wax out of the 710 cartridge but I think what I'm gonna do is try to save a little bit so that I can show you just the difference and why I'm telling y'all to [ __ ] throw away these stupid 7/10 cartridges and just switch to see cells Oh try and get this little less drop of wax into this a new cartridge so I can just like Hey more of this waxed better you know what screw it it's not gonna come out I'm just gonna go ahead and let it drip back into this 710 cartridge but look all of that wax transferred to this brand-new seesaw cartridge in under a minute like that is so easy and you'll see how much of a difference it really makes in a second so I'll be right back so just you know can see that I'm not just like off my [ __ ] right now i'ma show you how like a Skywalker King pen hits versus like the same exact wax in a seesaw cartridge all right here's it from a seven-time kingpin cartridge [Music] I mean it clouds but like I said before it tastes bad and it's definitely not as good as through this C cell 510 cartridge I'm not even sponsored by C cell I'm just a consumer that really prefers how C cell does their business with their from their batteries all the way to their cartridges or at least their atomizers like see some is just really good that was off a small drop let's do a long one it's gonna kill me but for the point you'll see that we now have two new and improved kingpin carts and would tip the seesaw atomizers I think that would tip C cells are just better than the kingpin seven tens because the seven tens on these fake kingpins came from China so when you hit the wax it kind of turns it black and you can taste that it tastes chemically or like Burt so just switching them to any other cart that you have that would early any other atomizer you have that would be better than leaving them in the seven tonnes so yeah if you found this video helpful just leave a like um it's sort of a mess so I also understand if y'all like hate in the comments I'm ready for that bring it on my [ __ ] anything um yeah I hope you enjoyed the video I'll catch y'all in another one I'll see you later peace", "ZCkNfKLYP0Y": "hey again everybody this is Ken eccentric films and I am back at you with another legal cartridge review here today in Illinois I have my hands on a phenol 51 250 milligrams high supply vape pen by Cresco this is a disposable I thought I would review the Cresco high supply line of products check one out to see if it's worthwhile again this is a quarter of a gram and it's gonna come out to like 35 to 40 bucks after-tax still which should be like full Grande prices as far as I'm concerned but prices are not good in terms of quality this one really smacked though it got me very high with just one hit at a time it was like a one-hit wonder very potent good medicine packaging says it's like 75 point 8 percent THC so does pack a good punch if that is an accurate measuring I don't know if it's a Fino 51 specific strain thing it doesn't say that name on the packaging so I'm not entirely sure how that works but overall this has got a really skunky cannabis smell - it smells like flower got a nice taste to it kind of citrus and skunk overall very much so like chirpy flower doesn't really taste artificial at all but the high is very good so this is good medicine it's a little cheaper than the regular liquid live resin so if you're looking for trying the Cresco experience but don't want to spend this might be a good option for you that's all I got a safe today yeah let me know what you think and if you've tried these in the comments stay safe", "zXvIqpVzO7k": "[Music] thank you for watching ganja runner TV I'm Jake Gloria and today we have Lauren from heavy hitters here with us and she's gonna tell us all about their vapor cartridges yeah so heavy hitters is an awesome cartridge company it's all a distillate so these are distilled eight times total and on the 8th time they actually take the temperature almost to the point of freezing what that does is really just takes out all the plant fats and lipids that don't need to be in the product it just makes it a Lord clean and compact hit for you guys so would that be why is very clear yeah basically the clarity is a lot better it's also a little bit more fluid so you're gonna pull a larger hit a lot faster so how do I use this ah so we did just introduce the button battery just for a heavier hit we actually did invert the button so you're less likely to accidentally use it so how does one get a heavy hit what constitutes a heavy hit so to get the heaviest hit we actually do suggest holding down the button for five to eight seconds just to warm the cart just so when you pull it's immediately pulling the concentrate not warming up the cart the first one is Jack Herer this is our most uppity cart it's gonna keep you the most awake and kind of buzzing so it's actually five times to turn it on and then you would just hold down okay [Music] yeah so these don't automatically turn off say about that amount of time would be good the test actually you really taste like what yeah yeah so that's definitely a string specific one FARC we use all natural flavoring nothing artificial so the strain specific cards are going to be flavored with specific strains from the plant the plant champions and then our flavored ones will actually be using the fruit dripping Wow all right we can do a pineapple express this is on my favorites because it's fruity as well as string specific so I just feel like it's overall you have like it's a good hybrid good for any time of the day and it just strain I'll never get tired of [Music] and almost tastes like a like a little bit piney yeah so I just think it has a little bit of everything in there do you want to try it yeah okay this is one of my favorite self yeah it's kind of like excuse me oh man okay so we're back just a pineapple express and that was pretty heavy there's no 104 it's a button so just hold down in here [Music] Wow let me think very very sweet doesn't hurt my throat very smooth tastes great irritation this is Malibu og so it's super fruity fruit salad [Music] oh yeah let's taste like face like boysenberries it's all going to my head quite different I feel good Phil yeah definitely high but still like I can take on the day alright so now we're moving more towards the fruity into cos pink push I love this one just say like like pink lemonade or what is that fruit maybe game fish so diablo super strain-specific has a little kick to it like almost peppery yes button [Music] I think that would go great with like a burrito - no yeah really am diabla okay so meet at the end and I really enjoyed all of these vapes thank you for coming out and for telling us all about them I think it's I think that you guys are doing an amazing job of an amazing products tank it taste is amazing it's really potent so please come back in some other time let's try some more so yeah I'll be back with our new products okay guys thank you for watching we have heavy hitters available on at Cod return calm you can order that in California and have it shipped to your door so check us out [Music]", "GDgj4zVNub0": "so we are going to be doing a uh cbd versus thc delta 9 versus thc delta 8 blind test we're gonna have my friends try out these drugs and see if they can tell the difference between them uh this is purely for entertainment uh so let's get right into it by the way if you don't know who i am i'm chris with cbd extract and if you haven't tried our hemp flour before do me a favor and hit the link down below and you can grab an eighth of our hemp flour completely for free it doesn't cost you anything all you got to do is click the link down below to claim the offer let's get right into it we're not going to tell you what's what okay oh we're going to we're going to tell you at the end but for now let me ask a couple questions okay uh how long have you been smoking like a year and a half year and a half okay about six years six years quite a while yeah that's quite a while how experienced would you say you are with weed but i am not good at knowing types quite a lot of experience so i'm a big dabber so like um i get a lot of different profiles like i tried to switch up my strains and stuff and switch up like in because of a hybrid so okay i like to get a lot of different like experiences so i'm pretty well versed and he's from the uk by the way wheat is not legal there at all so he has [ __ ] weed [ __ ] weed in [ __ ] england they don't even have cbd weed there if they do they have to label it as tea because they they don't even allow cbd weed there so this is the first cartridge uh you're going to have to guess if it's delta 8 delta 9 or cbd and also you know just feel what you think about it tastes like ginger um it's interesting like it tastes like a flounder tastes like actual planters i could do your own i feel nothing it just tastes very like not strong but you can tell the flavor no but that just tastes like the ground it tastes like the ground yeah what cannabinoid would you say this is um it tastes a little bit different from like most cards i almost want to guess that's delta nine i really don't know i don't know cbd i'll i'll say this is cbd for now but i might change my mind so okay i don't know i get like a certain like throw hit off of the actual thc and i felt like slightly different but i almost can kind of notice some effects i could just be liking a placebo so this is the next card [ __ ] tastes a lot more like what i would expect a cart to taste like oh there we go right off the bat i noticed it's super clear i'm just looking at it it looks pretty concentrated and i can i feel like i can almost kind of feel it off of that suit and by the way on these parts we're doing a curveball because not only are some some of them delta 8 or delta 9 or cbd we're also some of them are botanical terpenes and some are going to be cannabis derived terpenes so we're going to talk not super vibrant flavor like if there's any terps in this i would guess it's you know minimal what do you think about the taste this is um this is delta eight would you say it's an indica or sativa i'm never gonna tell you that all right yeah whatever i get in the currency but it's just for like the flavor differential not really the effects i never noticed anything different [ __ ] does it hit strong though like i smoked delta 8 before but this is kind of different this is like that tastes very strong in the back of my throat i can feel that [ __ ] just yeah it's definitely there um this is delta a that's delta a i think the last one might have been delta nine because starting to fill that a little bit i'm gonna guess delta h [ __ ] i don't like that one like nothing like i can't taste anything really just tastes like is there a throat hit to it nope no throwhead okay it's fruity yeah i don't know and it hits good like very smooth it just tastes like him like i'm chewing grass taste reminds me a lot of like actual distillate like um delta nine still i like this one it seems to look a little bit like it unless it's just like terps although it does look really thick i don't know it's good though i like that one so would you say cbd delta 8 or delta 9 on this one um i'm pretty stuck in between delta no no no this is delta a not cbd i don't know that was delta nine which one the one that i just did was delta nine the first one cbd because this is way weaker than the last one right i'm not tripping like this has to be delta a i don't know you tell me man i think there might be like some cd in there too you think there might be cbd yeah yeah i think like the last one is more like pure delta eight if i had to guess and then like this one there's like some other additives i don't know it could be completely wrong but i don't know how you know the difference between [Music] [Music] okay hmm is that one clogged too they're all i feel like all cars wow that one hits more it's in the bathroom oh that one is like peaceful this is like taking him right before getting to bed i don't know whether it's thc cbd abc this is like not the strongest thing it's not the strongest like the second weakest in terms of like first impressions right but this is like i could smoke this like a lot you know like i could wake up a lot of bed and take a hit you know i have to prepare myself for this i don't need a big breakfast [Music] this is very casual this is delta r that's delta all right uh yeah or delta yeah delta nine here okay i always get it mixed up then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah interesting i don't know i don't know what this is but it's not dealt to mine not about the man no okay so final verdict finally uh which one would you say was the strongest out of all strong ones one two three or four probably two two three two two no i lied three was this one yeah three okay interesting and so and out of the one two three four which one is cbd which one is delta eight which one's delta nine [Music] cbd was the one with the little white cartridge uh delta nine was the second one and the first one was whatever okay cool am i right nope you're completely wrong so out of the four which one do you think had like the best flavor to the worst flavor um i would say the first one had like the most diverse flavor like i could just like pick up like those things going on in it and i think that one would be the seemingly one the very first one i had um and then the second one there wasn't a whole lot of flavor but uh it seemed like there was a high concentration of thc in it whether it's delta eight or delta card and then uh the third one you gave me it was a lot like the first one but it just had like a little bit more flavor okay cool and then what about the and then the fourth one we just talked about that yeah yeah yeah that obviously tastes like almost any card up there interesting all right well hey that's you were actually spot on that everything was right oh okay then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah and then this the third the middle one was dr eight and then the last one was the first one yeah okay we got that right i did she got everything right yeah oh my god yes so there you have it hope you enjoyed the video if you want to see more videos like this subscribe and hit the like and you will see more videos

and we got a good one for you today so if you keep up with my channel you'll know that I review a few different cartridges well in the last week I planned on going hiking so I picked up a couple that seemed to be good quality I picked up a pure which is premium ultra refined extractions limoncello alright this butane processed 89 percent for a total of 90 so it's a 90 percent THC cartridge or you know basically alright it's all it says and I also picked up a brand that I'm really happy with this is a Jack Herer this was a sativa from canna clouds hashtag kin of clouds 502 and this one here ninety one point seven percent THC or cannabinoids with the THC of 83 and TCA of 7.5 worked it out that's good cuz point twos right there alright this is persue stand produced and processed by eh farms this was done by eh o alcohol solomon extraction okay so we've got these two different oils we've got a butane processed oil we've got an alcohol processed oil both of them seem to be good there's one ever the other difference this cartridge right here is produced by C cell this is an M 528 Jupiter okay now this came from the can of clouds very nice this particular cartridge here this came from the pier this one as you can clearly see is an AV D cartridge I think we can see the model number underneath it looking at AV d 0 6 to 9 RP 1-800 - okay now well I was hiking I was utilizing both of these cartridges as they have different flavors and different effects and I was enjoying them immensely however I noticed before too long that my AVD cartridge which you can see right here this actually has a little bit of oil on the end right there and see it's actually caked all the way around the base of it here no for comparison we can get the C cell right here no oil in any of the pores the draw ports very clean very nice no you may think that this one was used quite a bit more than this one and therefore that may have been the cause that's not true I was utilizing them both through this vape mod battery it has a very simple magnetic connector you screw onto your 510 thread cartridge it is draw activated works very nice big clouds battery stays good most of the day not to worry now this cartridge which is only my second AVD cartridge that i've gotten recently has started to leak this of course is a C cell cartridge if you watch my videos you will know that I get C cells regularly for an example there are some of my cartridges from the recent days this is my only other AVD as you can see something is inside that cartridge I don't know if that was done when it was filling by the processor or if that was something left in there in the construction of the cartridge I'm not sure but this is my only other AVD I decided not to utilize this because that is an unknown factor it could either be from the processor or from the manufacturer but that being said these are all C cell cartridges they all work exceptionally well see cell C so C cell C so C so so that being said a VD I'm afraid I'm gonna have to buy another one and see if it does the same thing I am very happy with the quality of the can of clouds cartridges there were no massive temperature differences maybe 2025 degrees they were not sitting in the Sun at any point in time nor sitting in a freezing area this is something that does happen and it does occur so shop around a little bit watch some more of my videos and don't just watch my channel watch some other channels to see what they have to say about different cartridges that they've had experiences with because not all these companies are available in all the states that being said this is John with C&C connoisseurs you guys have a good day and I look forward to seeing you again peace", "tpRjCsSQ0Do": "by the title the video as you guys can see man I'm be telling you guys how to bring in either your pen how I got it in I'm gonna tell you guys what I went through why I brought it I'm pretty much like this is gonna be a little story time because I wanted to make a video and while I'm out here so when I get back I could just upload and you guys could see something while I'm out here so yeah today guys we're gonna be ripping on the West Coast curd I'll take up close a close-up after this yeah very very nice man I'm like I'm a little bit more than half no a little bit less than halfway he's done with it but I've been trying to use this so scarcely but we're gonna take a quick rip before we get into the storytelling stuff like that oh so cheers boys if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over you guys know the deal [Music] man it's nice to being able to smoke outside dude my tolerance has gone down a significant amount surprisingly cuz since I haven't really really been able to smoke all day how like I usually do or at least every couple of hours like literally the past week that I've been here has only been like maybe two times double so if you guys are coming in from any legal state flying out you know it's an illegal state I'm gonna show you guys what I'm not gonna show you guys I'm gonna tell you guys what to do cuz I'm already over here there's no way I can do to him so the way I did it first first and foremost let me show you guys the way I did it so if you guys are have a girlfriend a wife girl that you're going with on a trip this will just make things a hundred times easier so what you can do is just obviously attach your cartridge to your stick and then just all you do is it'll just pop drop it in her makeup bag and then that's it dude you're good to go you could probably do up to two or three cartridges I don't recommend doing a lot of them and I don't recommend compact inch if you're gonna take we do not compact it because I learned a few tricks over here my uncle he works for the airlines and he knows a bunch of tricks up his sleeve and stuff like that he was telling me like what they live for so I mean let me just boss you guys up in a little game right now so we're usually in airports what they're looking for is in drugs that's not what they're looking for like you guys making like oh they're looking for toys and looking for my wood and my weed you know things like that but that's not the case even though it's not gonna be hard for them to know who has it like just don't don't overdo it don't be stupid don't just go in there thinking like oh they're not looking for drugs so I can go in there and go ahead and walk in with an ounce that's definitely not the case so all right they're looking for obviously explosives guns anything that can pretty much cause any damage or danger to anyone inside the airport like if you guys don't know lax is one of the biggest or not well this isn't only lax but I'm referring to LAX abuse out to the airport that I flew out of so yeah and LX are looking for explosive guns et Cie things like that so drugs is it's not one of their top priorities so as long as you're not overdoing it man there should be no issue to be honest like he was telling me as long as like one thing that you have to do if you're like I'm not advising this I'm not telling you guys go do this and go like try it out but if he has you know I have medical issues if he has I have anxiety like me personally I have so much anxiety dude like that day that I was flying out I had so much anxiety that I literally [ __ ] was crying bro like once I landed it was horrible I mean I'm not ashamed to say that I cried cause it's just anxiety man it's where humans everyone feels it specifically you know and cheers to them here I remember take up a trip for you guys so yeah like I was saying oh yeah this car is so amazing by the way by West Coast cure if you guys can see it hopefully you guys can very very amazing and yeah let me just get back to my story so one thing he told me if you're gonna bring weed um weed in general cartridges don't really matter because it's a liquid usually everything scans through liquids you can tell very very hard to detect and yeah so I'm not saying this isn't me saying like oh you can take as many cartridges you want I'm the same be smart and take one or two three hemos you know you don't really need to have more than that unless you're a fiend bro so now on to the weed if you don't like cartridges and you guys are more about weed them he said he went from what I know he told me that all you have to do is just you can carry in there just make sure it doesn't smell and make sure you just like wrap it up stash it you know but don't compress it too much because usually what comes up on the RFID readers it comes when they're passing it through the little readers what they're looking for is compact compressed items so basically because if you guys don't know that's usually how bombs are made you you compact what it is whatever the material is and then that's what makes a bomb you can't have a bomb with a little super piece of [ __ ] you know material it has to be very very mass amount compact until like it doesn't have to be a ball but you guys know when I'm referencing to so that's a little trick and then honestly you guys there's another one that I've done it at like shows and stuff like this I've never tried this at an airport I mean I don't recommend this type if you guys really are trying to get through when you can do is just hide the cartridge on the bottom of your plastic piece of your shoe and when you're passing through the metal detector just slide your foot like walk put left foot over whichever isn't carrying the cartridge and then on your right just slide slide it down you know just fairly you can barely lift it I think it's like an inch from what I've done before so yeah no more than an inch so you should be good after that and yeah I'm just sorry if I keep you looking away there's just so much scenery around me and it's just catching my attention so we're gonna take another hit and just keep talking keep ranting seeing what what this day is about man so yeah I brought this on here I left on Monday it's currently already Thursday it's Friday tomorrow man I go back on Sunday so which means I have two more days out here and this pen has been coming in clutch because like I said my anxiety dude my anxiety was kicking my ass since the morning I had a good on the plane like it's not that I'm scared to fly or anything I've flown before I've flown to Mexico I've flown to other places but just the anxiety of being away from home it's just something that I've had you know there on my whole life so wait to whatever this is this is something that has helped me a lot throughout my last couple years I'm dealing with anxiety and stuff like that so and I'm gonna show you guys this one I know I already made a video on this with a West Coast cure cartridge I'll go ahead and post that in the link in the description below if you guys want to check out that video but I've made a video on this um battery before and it's called the X tube so basically what it is it looks ugly right it looks ugly like this and okay whatever you're not supposed to have a beautiful battery but that's just a [ __ ] thing in your head for if you if you're one of those people that likes things that are aesthetically pleasing I don't blame you man I'm some sometimes I'm like that too so but this battery isn't for you so this value what it does this little detachable piece right here so as you guys can see I have a little a little oil bubble right there right little air bubble I mean so what this does I'll screw it on there click it twice and then what it does it'll start preheating right you'll see it oh it's already dead because I've been using all week so I can't use a preheat function but what it does it'll heat up the outside of the cartridge and then it'll make the oil warm enough for it to move up and so how good that is is because most a car batteries that pre-heat your [ __ ] they preheat from the coil within so basically what that is it's burning the oil that's why when you take hits you can still puff like with this if I were if it was charged and I were to do that you wouldn't know smoke would be coming out at all like sometimes the only downside is the tip does get hot sometimes because it does get heated up a lot so if you guys are looking for a cartridge that I mean for a battery that does it all now this is my favorite one for sure the only bad thing about it is I don't think you could fit like a tank of apes and [ __ ] like that it's more of that just the regular - really really slim cartridges so yeah man I'm gonna take another hit hopefully this battery still yeah so we're just gonna oh no it's still it's still going you just can't preheat it because the preheat function does I think that's what takes up most of the battery life because it preheats it for like a good 20 to 30 seconds because it wants to get all the oil out obviously man this West Coast cure is amazing yeah I'm gone man I'm just gonna go ahead and end this video here enjoy the rest of my time here I hope you guys are enjoying the rest of your week you guys are gonna see this on Monday so enjoy your week from now on you know and for all the new people here thank you for conforting me and for the people who have been here for a while thank you for the continuous support you guys are gonna be seeing some big things coming within the next couple of weeks so look forward to that and yeah if you guys enjoyed today's video go leave a like comment sub and we're out you can", "rgqgZdW0-nM": "what's going on guys welcome back to the channel so we are looking at something different today this is the fx 1000 milligram or one milligram no one milligram yeah anyway it just says you get the choice between a five and a one milligram bottle but it's a a cartridge this one is actually strawberry and it says it's from savage brand if you look on the back here it says natural ingredients no pesticides gmo free and it says that it's lab tested all right these are about 50 bucks a piece they're not bad they're i think they're 78 thc or higher these actually come in three flavors grape orange and strawberry i have strawberry here and then this one over here this is the orange that right there is about a week's worth of use so a full one will come about that high there there's about a week's worth of use now the only problem with it is let's see here go ahead and open it mine actually came leaking a little which i thought was a little concerning but that that happens from time to time this is how it comes new you can see this one's fairly full especially when you go to compare the two c how one's a lot more full and then the other one's a little emptier so this one i just got yesterday and then that one right there i've had for about a week now my only concerns with it is this big opening piece right here um if when you put it in your pocket stuff can get in it like lint and like trash and dirt or whatever so sometimes you'll have to wipe that out clogging um every once in a while it will clog so what you do is you just blow into it until it pops or until it releases and then you can use it and it's really good actually i quite like them these are the chive 3 delta 8 vape cartridges these seem to be more potent but they don't last near as long as these do although there are these come in several different flavors and only one strength these come in only three different flavors and at one strength now these are not meant for you to be sitting on your couch all day chiefing this is meant for you to take with you like if you want to go to work or if you're going out with buddies or you're going to a movie just somewhere where you can very discreetly get high as a kite and no one even knows the difference i will warn you though this [ __ ] you'll you'll just find yourself sitting there staring out in a space and you'll be like oh my god i'm like i'm stupid high but it's not an uncontrollable high although it's like one or two puffs of these is like hitting a blunt smoking a whole blunt to yourself i mean it just it just rocks you the effects last pretty pretty decently about a half hour or so sometimes you can hit it and it really won't kick in until about an hour later so you do have to be kind of careful with that now these all fit a 5 10 thread battery so you need something like this to use it and all of them come with a little screw in down there and it just screws in like that and then what you do once you have it screwed in hold the button let it charge and then hit it and do it nice and slow it will gag you out and you will cough your ass off that is a guaranteed especially if you get a good hit but um like i tell people this isn't for sitting on the couch burning all day like if you want to do that get you a bong or a pipe this is great for i'm on the go i have to go to a theme park or i'm going to the movies or i'm going out to the mall or i'm going to work or wherever and i'm on my lunch break or something and i want to get a quick buzz perfect and a quick buzz you will get i mean it'll light your ass on fire i'm telling you especially if you get them over 78 thc yeah these things are potent they do last for about two to three weeks depending on how much you use them i know some people that'll say that these things will last them a month usually what i do is i try to buy two at a time because they will go out of stock and when they go out of stock they stay out of stock for at least a week or two sometimes longer for a good instance the three chives here they've been out of stock for almost a month now so it's either three chive delta eight cartridges or i use the fx cartridge which is uh what it says right there fx good brand this is how it comes like i said there's only three different flavors that you can choose from but the potency is is quite powerful uh one hit could be like you know smoking a joint of like some good kush or something it's just it's really powerful and the flavor is good like i got strawberry and orange perfect flavor not too strong very subtle but also very there and these things will cough you up that's the only problem with it is that you'll if you get a good hit off of them you'll call for like a good five minutes non-stop people think you have the damn coronavirus because your ass is coughing so much but like i said it's great to get you there i really like the product if you guys are into this kind of thing maybe you should check them out they also make cbd vapes as well so with that being said i hope you guys like it if you have any questions just leave me a comment below and i'll tell you what i know about them 50 bucks a piece lasts for about two to three weeks if you're a stoner or a pothead and you're looking to get stoned these will do you they will keep you right it's not the quite the same as a dab or smoking bud but um it is a good alternative so with that being said i'm out of here i hope you guys like the video subscribe share comment you'll be cool", "MeVzVvDGnOI": "[Music] hey guys today we're going to take a look at the number one most common problem that you'll have with your vape pen and cartridge and how to quickly fix it so what you want to do to start is unscrew your cartridge from your pen and take a look at the two connectors there sometimes they can become too recessed of whether its packaging or being screwed down too tight and it's really easy to fix to bring it out so you'll want to grab a paper clip and just gently catch underneath the edge of the connector and tug on it very gently to make sure you don't pull it up too hard you can damage the cartridge that way so be careful and once you catch an edge you can work around the entire lip there so that it's in a nice proper position for it to emotion correctly with the battery next we're going to move on to the battery and repeat the same process we're gonna work underneath the connector here and ring it up nice and gently you don't need to apply much pressure again and once you catch that same edge just work around nice and slow so that you don't have an uneven space for the connectors that you're touching [Music] so it should be all ready to go here and we're gonna grab our cartridge and screw it back in the cartridges don't need to be screwed down too tightly for it to work once it's there you should have a green light ready to go all right guys thanks for watching [Music]", "j4CcpqgcBVQ": "[Music] okay [Music] foreign [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video it is another buddies cartridge video and uh if you didn't see that beginning clip that was the homie austin you know doing his thing you know a little freestyle it's good to plug in the homie once in a while but um another thing is they're actually still doing it right there but i figured i'd do a review while i'm here you know i'm saying so i could show them or at least give them a hit so but yes this is the peach flame flambe peach flambe crossed with pineapple upside down cake and why i got this is because as you can see right here you can zoom in if it's not focusing okay it's 13 terps and that is the highest i've seen when it came when it comes to a buddy's cartridge so um i haven't tried all the buddies cartridges so i don't know if this is the highest testing but to my knowledge the uh out of all the ones i've tried so far this is the highest percentage i've seen so i'm definitely interested and excited to open this and try this so let me know if you tried this this is definitely a long name too like i didn't even [ __ ] care to name it they were just like peach flambe [ __ ] upside down cake so whoa [Music] really good usually with these ones it's a little bit darker i mean look on the cover right what the [ __ ] that's a good thing right no it's not i don't know [Music] i don't know guys i don't know but we'll try i gotta i got the nug still right here as you can see put that in here don't get it dirty stand it up so also i'd like to give a shout out to ben or be legit for always you know insane helping out he will be taking a hit of this even though he's high so damn that tastes pretty exotic okay it's not quite like any live resin i've tried before honestly it's like wow it's like a lightness to it but it's [ __ ] flavorful at the same time it's almost like um oh yeah he has a better palette let me let's let's hear what he's going to describe to taste that it really tastes like tea to me tea like a sweet tea [Music] all right let's just see what the the highest uh tert profile it is b cara cara filling with lemon lean at three percent as well and it's uh i i forgot i didn't mention the manufacturer date and all that is uh 8 11 20. so it tastes like tea to you mm-hmm i'm gonna try it again hey nikki come out here hit this for me let's see how it tastes we got my homie nicky as well aka ben's cousin but we got the hum [Music] let us know how this tastes i feel like this is a kind of it has like a burning sensation that this lit does give off but it's very terpy i don't know i'm guessing i could it could also mean that maybe all the more tastes like yeah it more tastes like weed yeah the 13 terps maybe made it lighter is what i'm assuming um but austin come out here give him that do that get that get away from me with it your mouth [Music] tastes good that's it that's all you gotta tell me what it tastes good it tastes all right tastes all right okay well his his taste is kind of distorted from the the smoke he's actually getting from the backwoods so his taste buds aren't all there i'm laying on that black i swear you smoke something and then you do a dab it's not gonna taste the same yeah so uh but yeah i i really enjoy this uh i did buy this at finos i usually buy it on authentic for 32.50 but i bought this here for 35 out the door and honestly like i'm kind of sick of the the strains that they had at authentic so it was dope that i seen new strains at fino so if you guys are interested in more buddies strains like i am and you are located in the 209 area you know i'd suggest going to finos as well because i honestly didn't know that they had it uh any final thoughts on the cartridge itself ben how much was it 35 35. i'd say there's better options out there for 35 right yeah no no really they're distillate well yeah like taste wise not even well taste wise distillate is a lower quality when it comes to oil because it's not all the original plant is mostly not there right yeah but i mean they could taste better because they could taste like strawberry or some [ __ ] that you like i don't know it's not going to be as strong as what i'm saying yeah i usually don't buy carts yeah i don't even know why i asked for your opinion but yes i really do enjoy it i'm i'm a little bit thrown off by the color of this oil but uh nonetheless still pretty good so if you like the video if you like the videos like it i'm pretty [ __ ] stoned um but yes if you liked the video please give me a thumbs up subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next one peace out after all arms this hurts you know tell me that this isn't for sure [Music]", "bVzGx2sC1j8": "all right so we're doing a review here of select elite live and what we got left of it really and this strain was cherry a Kay with lemon tree and I thought it tasted great tasted way better and then select regular carts the hardware is still the seesaw m60 which is the plastic see so I prefer the glassy sell but which is the th - but still this is good it still performs well taste is really good strength is pretty good what do you think about it yeah I think those really good yeah how about strength and just you know to compare from stuff from the same week would you say kanji is better yeah we just these kanji just came up the other day and these were 2 for 40 and of course these were at a different location even different state these are at the dispensary and I just thought that was better than the Select alive and I thought kanji was better than a lot of the cartridges we recently had that's really an excellent quality thing but just as a comparison if you happen to hit the to slightly live compared to the West Coast cure live resin which one did you like better you liked this bed in the West Coast care so we got the West Coast cure live resin and yeah I would say like this better a little bit too it's a it seems a little bit stronger right yeah taste is pretty comparable maybe taste barely a little better but strength seems to be a little bit from out more pronounced on that and so I'm go ahead take a hit that saw and see if it's on yeah really light and smooth huh and the effects were energetic and you know this is another thing like this is 94% THC but we had a car early that was 80 that was better so it's like the THC percent is not everything but I've noticed is the icing carts in the 80s tend to be the best there's some of the great ones in the 90s usually the 70s ones do feel a little weaker but I feel like the 80 seems to be kind of like the sweet spot for the right mixture of things for the most part and this seems good you had another Daggett half-life resin I mean it's good it's just not the absolute best I think the strength on the distillate the the effect the hit the stone eNOS was a little more in the distillate have you tried the Select leave distill it Stan I thought the the silat there's a little more stony than this one but especially people to like them additional effects they tend to like the live resin more so select live great product not the absolute best not my absolute fave buy resin I would say better than the West Coast cure live resin MPX live resin was better use live resin was better and but it's still a really good product and I think it's better tasting their distill it but I think they're still it is stronger and still one of the strongest ones out there so that's it anything to add would you give it two thumbs up yeah me too alright thanks for watching and you'll have a great week", "Eu3uyw6e-08": "Hi, welcome back.

working man's hands all right cartridge looks good looks official I never took the rubber off yet check that out it's just like your regular Bank quarters a/c cell with the K tastes good you feel it

youtube this is shabazz and i'm back with another cbd hemp flower review what's up tomorrow can of sewers welcome back to another shabazz short today i'm reviewing something that i know a lot of y'all are going to be excited about it's another delta 8 product and specifically delta 8 vape cartridges by effects delta 8. now effects offers granddaddy perp strawberry cough and cali orange kush or calio they have one gram cartridges and guess what i have one of each cartridge so i'm gonna try each one let you know the flavor profile and by the end of taste testing all of them the effects should be kicking right in i do have a couple concerns right off the bat in the package i didn't get any paper test results and most importantly i didn't get a notice to law enforcement now when you're dealing with cannabis product and even especially with delta eight products because there's such a thin line between legality with delta eight there's such a thin line of legality with delta eight i feel like anything like this needs to have a letter to law enforcement what i did get in the package though is this absolutely massive effects sticker so here is the cartridges themselves one gram each says effects delta eight savage brand you got the granddaddy perp the cali oh and the strawberry cough they do have percentages on them so granddaddy perp has 82 percent d8 the cali o has 48 and the strawberry cough has 65.5 percent so let's start with uh the lightest and going up to the heaviest which works out for me too because of those terpenes so here goes the cali orange really nice packaging by the way i really like the packaging this packaging it's you know this is premium looking packaging it looks professional here we go pull the cartridge out the rubber caps on each no branding on this cartridge i don't know what brand it is i don't know where it comes from there has been a big issue in cannabis community lately with people using off-brand cheap carts that have lead and other things in them i don't know about this but it's always a plus when you're using good trusted name brand cartridges like c cell anyways so this is the calio i'm gonna get the screw right on here remember these carts fit on any 510 battery so any little battery like this if you're a stoner if you're in the cannabis life i'm sure you have a couple of these laying around [Music] i really like the terpenes on that really has that citrusy orange wow this is really citrusy and really orangey yeah 48 percent we'll take a couple hits of each one really smooth i mean it's a vapor it's it's it's it's a smooth i mean it's the smoothest vapor gas [Music] cali oh all right i like that one that was really cool and right here on the top i didn't even notice it says hybrid so this is going to be your hybrid smoke and i guess the hybrid terpene i probably should have started off with the sativa which i think is going to be the strawberry cough but that was cool now here goes the strawberry cough sativa terpene profile 65 d8 same packaging once again no really nice premium packaging okay now this one is a different cartridges this is one of the clear top cartridges i've had these before from a different vendor all right got that strawberry cough on there it tastes like strawberries [Music] very smooth the great thing about things they are super convenient they leave no smell you don't have to burn anything smoke anything pack anything clear anything out carry around a lighter go somewhere because the smell no vaporizers you could literally if you're at work you can literally go in the bathroom hit your vaporizer and walk back out no lingering smell nothing nobody will ever know so if you enjoy cannabis whether that be hemp or high thc flour and you are in the interest of being discreet definitely check out vape carts i think this is a good time to to warn everybody about delta eight delta h is very potent generally it doesn't come with the anxiety and the rush and the racy heartbeat and everything that delta nine thc does but that is only if you use it within reason do not overindulge on delta a because delta 8 is still thc and it will mess you up if you are thc sensitive and you cannot handle a thc high don't go crazy on the delta a it is far better than delta 9 far less anxiety but still it can get you there i got overzealous one day i was doing tiny little droplets of delta 8 distillate you know every 30 40 minutes and i was like uh you know this is nothing so i took a bowl of hemp flour squeezed a big old glob of d8 on there smoked the whole thing 10 minutes later i felt like i was dying if you've ever had cannabis induced panic attack you know what that feeling is you feel like you're gonna have a heart attack you can't stop breathing fast because if you breathe normal you just feel like you're not breathing enough racy thoughts you're worried you're paranoid that whole terrible thing that happened to me granted i did take a huge amount a very potent delta ate this to it but still don't go crazy with the delta eight take baby steps and just be cautious with it delta eight can be a very great time but if you overdo it it can also be a bad time all right let's move on over to the grand daddy perp which is the indica coming at 82 i'm gonna take a little bit more light on this one because i definitely feel the effects coming out from the other two same packaging this cart is actually branded so interestingly each cart for each different flavor is slightly different i actually like that because it's easy to tell them apart all right here goes the granddaddy perp and i'm gonna go easy on this because i'm already feeling crazy oh that's extremely creepy i think they might have overdid it with the terpenes on the granddaddy purp that tastes like purple kool-aid straight up it's good it's smooth but i'm gonna have to end that there all right vape cartridges d8 it's convenient no smell no odor no smoke i mean with this product i'm gonna definitely give it the shabazzle of approval good vape good terpenes my only concerns is no letter to law enforcement and they didn't appear to be name brand cartridges so i noticed while editing this video i got so faded i didn't even talk about the effects i don't know if you could notice if you go back and rewind my eyes got super duper red this is what i mean delta 8 is super strong a tiny bit goes a long way and it is extremely easy to overdo it needless to say the effects on these cartridges are very good they're very potent they're so good that i think i need to warn everybody that just because it's delta eight if you are prone to paranoia or anxiety intrusive thoughts you've got to take it easy but yes effects are very strong the terpenes definitely do make a difference whether it's a sativa hybrid or indica feeling afterwards a couple puffs go a long way so don't overdo it but within reason with the delta eight yeah i actually really like that that's a much more convenient way of getting the delta eight rather than smoking or dabbing distillate anyway so y'all that's the review make sure you go down in the description check out the merch hit me up on ig here here i appreciate everybody watching my videos if you liked the video hit like hit me up down in the comments subscribe to the channel and turn on post notifications so you can see when i upload new content i hope everybody has an amazing rest of your day or night and please stay tuned for the next video peace you", "ivRTpxFMtmE": "so what's going on guys we are back with another review today's review is gonna be on another kart the venom X this one is the pomegranate paradise sativa so with uh with that intro already done let's go ahead and let you guys know that this channel is a smoking cannabis channel only so if you're not 21 and older 18 and 21 depending on your state you can't watch this video it's age restricted or some some some I don't know I don't know YouTube doing me dirty with this but sorry so well now we can start the review like I said so it's the pomegranate paradise it's the venom X this is the first venom X we've reviewed on the channel I did like a week or two ago have two venom X's they were actually the same exact one they were supposed to be different but the girl gave me the same ones for some reason so that was whatever but I just didn't make a video and I explained why in another video so go watch that one um but this one I don't think it says anything about like what percent it is oh no it does this is meeting with 100% all-natural terpenes C cell technology but bought 85% - you see right there in the middle marade there we got it on the doctor's odx battery here it's pretty well charged when I was when I got this it was supposed to be like really fruity that was supposed to be the flavor like a fruity kind of earthy taste but after hitting it for like the last few hours like a day like I've had for a day I notice that it's very very cush it's just straight clutch taste so if you like those go for it but the high on this thing is probably the happiest ha I think I've ever gotten out of any car especially or out of any sativa especially any card this thing just smacked me like in a good way and I was like fully chilling the whole time but I just felt really good I was in some good vibes you know I'm saying so I got like hair they're mangroves if you guys like sativas um and you really want to get like a really good happy high like feel great moment I highly recommend this car venom X pomegranate paradise it is solid for that I haven't felt that that like great high in a long time and this one definitely did it so let's go ahead and take one one good couch off this bad boy and yeah let me know if you guys are smoking anything down in the comments melesa interested to know so twos guys yeah I mean it I I will say there is like a little bit of a fruity taste maybe like pomegranate maybe a small hint of it but it's very cushy maybe a small hint of erythema like that that like weird you know the taste I don't want to say it's earthy but that's how everybody describes it but y'all know what the taste is but it has a little bit of those too but it's mainly cush to me that's at least my personal taste you guys might taste a little something different right sorry to me here like little noises in the back I just got a puppy I'm fostering and he's a little Brad so it makes a lot of noise I mean when yeah this thing's I'm already feeling a little little hot and body I already for sure head high a little a little bit I'm gonna feeling chill you don't here's the wax it's a really nice golden color beautiful background huh 10 out of 10 it is pretty solid they're pretty thick pretty damn thick no there was a deal it was a to 440 the homie uh-uh he the big the big homie got ice play with me so we went 20 20 and he got a cart shoutouts to him you got the same cart and I don't know how to say let's just shoot you another one guys cuz that's all I can say Oh yo so real quick so it's October right Oh in September Jesus Christ but it's September so it's almost Halloween to you that means that Halloween serials in season Nash it's the best so let me know which one's your favorite there's like Count Dracula or whatever the chocolate one a cocoa dragon track you cannot what it's called there's Franken berry and then Boo Berry let me know which one's your favorite I'm personally a Franken berry I think Don's left I think I was like tops for sure and then boo Berryman choco vampire [ __ ] whatever told mm-hmm but that's just me that's just me those are some bomb-ass cereals oh for sure for sure well well [ __ ] there is a little bubble right there and one thing I have noticed after hitting it when you do create a bubble like that inside the card it kind of hits off that bubble again so you kind of get like the weird battery like fume taste so it's kind of ideal if you can let the bubble move a bit that would be I that would be a bad deal but if not you know you can still get a pretty decent draw off it for sure for sure well let's take another one you choose yeah you know what I want to do for you guys I want to do a for one of the strings Saturdays or screen Sundays or whatever it is his move his battery's getting all my little one well for one of the streets after it is do like a Keith pre-roll or something like that like a full like Granberry Keith line or like a 3.5 grant that would be dope the I I'm not really ever smoked a chief joint at all I don't even know if Keith blunts it really made it often but I'm more of a joint kind of guy anyway but definitely man wow my lungs right there I definitely really want to smoke occasionally they look so fired or a moon rock a Zodiac moonwalk one of those those pre-rolls are expensive but I'm definitely found if you guys lend me one and see one of those I gotta find a dispro that hassle near me but I'm sure that'll be pretty damn easy I think that was three is that three yeah well I think yeah here she I'll kind of show you there's the bubble right it's just it got bigger it didn't like Oh to any other one I don't really know if he can do that maybe if I switch switch it a little bit if I open it a little bit more like not so tight no I'm saying it might be blocking a little bit of airflow let's see well I wasn't I feel like a lot more smoke and normal for sure Richard Oh ma'am that was interesting I don't know if I that was a good good idea or what I just I've always had it pretty tight so I just kind of loosened it so there's like a little bit more air fall but enough connection to get a hit yeah definitely hearing more air flow going through for sure well what interesting I'm gonna mess around with that a little more see how that works and see what happens there but I think that's a wrap for this video guys I hope you guys had a Wow Jesus Christ I am stupid I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did go ahead and give me a like or subscribe that would be awesome comments are always dope I always reply to all of them you guys are super dope on all the last ones you guys pretty much left comments on every single one except for like one which is totally chill for me but yeah I love to love the feedback so it's always good to hear with all that done and like for kids there's on them feeling feeling a real nice here real nice so I'm probably gonna put on some music by about some games or you know YouTube whatever maybe but yeah I'll see you guys in the next one deuces have go", "DMdIS3YSdwY": "hi my name is Peter I'm with transferring USA and today I am proud to present to you the transferring bait cartridge autofilter this machine is designed to fill small disposable vape cartridges such as this quickly accurately consistently for long periods of time if you're currently filling these vape partridges by hand and looking for a better way I invite you to keep watching as I break down this durable and affordable piece of machinery first let's start off with a discussion of exactly what this machine will not come with that you're going to need to make it work number one is an air compressor you're going to need to buy an air compressor separately and make sure that it is at max 125 psi with at least a 10 gallon reservoir tank a good rule of thumb is the longer that you intend on running your machine the larger a reservoir tank you're going to need so that your air compressor doesn't work so hard to keep up with your machine now the second thing that you're going to need that we don't provide which likely you're going to need for both the machine and the air compressor is electricity so pay your electric bill and you'll have a happy machine and a working machine which means a happy business the first piece of equipment there we're going to focus on here that you will receive with your order is this pressure pot now this pressure pot is very important because this is where your material your liquid or oil will go in order to become pressurized and ultimately feed into the machine now this pressure pot is comprised of three individual pieces that all fit together number one you have this hood and through this hood it goes the feeding tube as well as this air pressure regulator valve the air pressure line which is feeding from your air compressor is going to feed pressure into this valve become regulated to a hundred psi fill up this machine and inside of this there's actually two other pieces number one you'll see an inner container here this inner container ultimately can hold your source material or hold a bottle that has your source material in it if you don't want to cover the inner container with your my source material and have increased loss then it's fine to just keep it in the bottle that you have it in the second part is of course this lower holding container once you have put the inner container with your material inside you have placed your cover on top you're going to then make the whole unit airtight by placing these four very heavy-duty wing nuts into place tightening them down in order to secure your top to the pressure pot and then you'll release the valve on your air compressor and begin to pressurize the tank in preparation for running your machine the next important piece of equipment that we're going to focus on is the pressure gun this will actually take a supply line coming from your pressure pot feed directly into the pressure gun which controls the flow of your liquid or oil into each cartridge as it moves along by the machine assisting the pressure gun in doing its job is this third piece of equipment here which is the temperature control unit which controls by degree the temperature of the entire head unit helping and assisting you to process thicker viscosity oils and liquids without encountering any sort of clogs in the needle or head unit as its processing through the machine now the fourth piece of equipment that we're going to focus on here is probably the most impressive as well and that is the filling robot itself it has two control panels that a user should become very familiar with one of them is this handheld controller right here it allows you to program all parameters for this machine as well as containing all pre-mapped programs that will become preset from the factory to work with the cartridges that you want to process through this machine now once all the parameters have been set in this handheld control unit there is a very simple front terminal interface that a new user can step up and start using immediately with a minimal learning curve it only consists of five buttons one is the on/off button number two is the start pause button number three is this stop reset button for use in an emergency number four is this program reset button for whenever the machine becomes out of calibration for any reason and number five is this line purge button this button is used to hold the air pressure gun in place and purge the line of any air bubbles or clogs before you start the machine the final piece of equipment we're going to focus on is arguably the most important and that is this custom cartridge holder we call it a jig it's designed to hold 100 cartridges in rows of 10 by 10 now you may be wondering how do I get one made for the cartridges I use and how do I fill it well these come pre map from the factory to fit transferring cartridges and one of the advantages of ordering transferring cartridges is that they will come in these wonderful foam inserts these foam inserts are designed to match the machining of your jig exactly so that you can simply lay them on top press them down into place vastly reducing your loading times and saving you time and money throughout the life of your machine now as I stated before the front panel has a dead simple user interface so that a new user can immediately step to this machine and get it working to begin the action here I'm simply going to press this lighted start button in order to start our filling now as we zoom in for a closer look at this machine as it begins its filling program you're going to notice how quickly it fills each cartridge it's currently programmed to fill each 1 ml cartridge in under one second meaning this entire 100 cart jig can be filled in under two minutes now as we move in for an even closer look the second thing you'll notice is the incredible accuracy of this machine no cartridge is under-filled no cartridges overfilled and there are no drips between cartridges this helps eliminate human error reduce waste and ultimately increase your profits and yield over the lifetime of this machine now I spoke before about the dead simple operation of this machine let's say you're a new user and you'd like to pause the action well all you need to do is come over here and press the start pause button pausing the machine allowing you to restart the action from where it left off at your leisure by simply repressing the start pause button much like the start or the play pause button on your DVR or DVD player now let's say that you would like to stop the filling completely and reset the machine back to its original starting position all you need to do is press this start button and with a simple twist the machine resets back to its original position releasing the jig and allowing you to address any issues so now that we've seen this machine in action I'm sure that you have a lot of questions including how to order one well I can answer all those questions and more if you contact me directly by emailing me at USA at transferring comm or by giving me a call at 925 four zero five five five eight to offer the only us-based sales and service for this filling machine and I have warranty service that is back directly by the factory so I can answer all your questions about ordering customization installation and ongoing maintenance for this machine also in the meantime be sure to subscribe to our channel as we post more videos about how to clean this machine calibrate it and customize it for your particular operation I want to thank you for watching and stay posted for more informative videos about the transferring vape cartridge autofilter machine", "PXP64j29ueM": "what's going on baby family it's your boy fated Markie and today I'm gonna be comparing two things you guys I got a pod actually this is a cartridge I got a cartridge and I got a pod so you know right now I'm in the car I got I'm probably gonna end up driving so I'm not gonna do the review right now I'm gonna take you guys with me I'm gonna go over to my parents house today's the Super Bowl you guys is the Chiefs versus the 49ers but since it's like I'm not too big of a fan of football to be honest and I'm not too big either team I'm gonna be doing a review for you guys and I'm gonna just do a wholeheartedly like light you guys know well I personally think about pods and when I personally think about cartridges I think they're similar but they're different you know I'm saying so I'll check in with you guys soon all right shot so we just did a car swap and I'm driving my grandparents so you know all the same that's why didn't smoke but when I get there I'm doing the review it's gonna be dope as so stay tuned go 49ers just can't go what are you having the Super Bowl who do you thinks gonna win yeah who do you thinks gonna win I'm Francisco all the 49ers yeah alright that's a good call good call [Music] that's cool all right camera woman where are we going what kind of background do you guys want yeah I want to see the house are you guys gonna see this isn't bad this channel is strictly for viewers ages 18 plus I do not use or promote the sale of illegal drugs or harmful substances this video was recorded in California a legal recreational state under the laws Prop 64 alright Josh so this seems like a pretty good spot we're gonna my mom's backyard right now and it's cold as right now alright so let's get to it let's start with the cartridge so right here guys we got a cartridge nothing special right if you guys are watching this channel you guys should already be familiar with kind of like what cartridges it's a cannabis vape that uses oil and yeah it's pretty simple I wanna say when they cannabis base we first became a thing this is pretty much what everybody had or what everybody was going for it when they were trying to create their own product they were all creating cartridges so you were seeing like thousands of new cartridge brands hit the market and they're all kind of doing the same thing by throwing the oil in a tank which has an atomizer that allows you to burn the oil pretty simple and back in the day everybody's the thing these were bait partridges so this used to be low-key I would say nowadays this is far from it when people see a little cartridge or anything like this they automatically assume or think you're smoking some type of wheat or some type of cannabis so I would say that's the negative which used to be a pro for this but now that this is a negative I would say you're probably gonna see less people smoking this out in public or just you know more plainly like just taking random hits out in the open they're probably gonna start covering this up a little bit more originally cops didn't even really know what this was I feel like every cop every security guard if you go to a club if you go anywhere they automatically know where this is they're gonna either try to take it away from you you can't take this into Disneyland anymore so these are a lot of negativity to having cartridges I would say over pods nowadays just because everybody knows what it is but if you don't go  and the place that you're at really doesn't give a then is the same thing as smoking apart [Applause] alright y'all and this right here this is a plug play and what these are these are cannabis pods and pretty much it's the same thing the same exact oil that goes inside a cartridge you guys is the same world that goes inside of a pod it pretty much just takes a different shape so he now made it so that the cartridge doesn't look like an oil cartridge anymore or a standard small vape they made it look like more of a jewel so now I pods the only difference between the two our pods look like jewels and they're more low-key they have a custom device where they're not Universal and they don't all use the 510 connection where this this cartridge could go almost go on any date device that has the standard 510 threading and so it's very Universal where it pods this isn't gonna go and sit inside of a jewel it's not gonna fit inside of a steezy they all have their own unique device and that's okay oh yeah I would say they both have if they both have good oil they're both gonna have the same potency if they both have really good a good cartridge and they're both a good pot they're gonna have the same type of hit except nowadays when you take this places you can probably take this into the club you would take it almost into Disneyland museum parts because it looks more like a jewel it's more in the norm and it's more like people don't assume when you're hitting this that you're getting high off cannabis they think you're hitting that jewel and so it were trying to be more incognito and more low-profile more low-key I would say the way to go is pods nowadays for me personally since I have family members you know especially younger ones I'd really been thinking I'm hitting that jewel rather than me ingesting cannabis or hitting my cannabis vape all day long but if you guys enjoyed this video and you guys enjoyed hearing about the differences and kind of like my personal preferences between the two please drop a like drop a comment down below subscribe to your boy and I'll see you guys soon", "RW1BFq-z-6Q": "up youtube it's your boy here's a condo brand new video guys what's going on welcome back welcome back all right guys so brand new wheat review right now starting right now

love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video that's for over 18 don't smoke marijuana less your own my personal information alright know what's up guys running right back at you so I'm this video coming at you guys with another cart revealed video you guys seem to like these videos somewhere down below in the comments if you guys do it won't make any more but I think you guys been liking them so if you guys like to see my last video my last part review I did a pineapple express by the Brian Salette and I thought you guys I had a few different flavors in that video this video were actually doing the brown uh I mean not the parent but doing the same brand select but we're doing a wedding cake before I get further into this video I should have edited it edited into the beginning should have put it in the beginning in this video but if I didn't um so yeah I don't watch this video last week 18 or over 21 whatever the legal ages in your state or you have your medical card like I do Justina say that's just to cover my ass I can't get this channel deleted that would suck and uh I will probably cry so this video will do 1 select premium babes or the dad premium bait cartridges parts there we go so it's less premium vape aren't you just down here wedding cake you see it's tested at what 92.5 pretty much to half a gram car wedding cake hybrids pretty much 0% to a CBD you see make back up a little bit I feel like normally close up in your face um I gotta from Sky dispensary it was forty bucks for the UH half gram which is kind of expensive and the only reason I really got this well I mean it's really high quality so it's worth it to be honest but I like the a bit more like out of a Reagan [ __ ] and tends to be honest but pens are still nice life on the go at work or whatever the [ __ ] you know but um don't smoke at work that's bad but you know what I'm saying no and these are fire though but they're kind of expensive forty bucks for a half gram they're dope though because I'm like on the back of them if you haven't seen them it says all that so it you can pause it if you want but it says like what it tastes like what you're gonna feel it's supposed to taste sweet like vanilla kinda earthy it's gonna make you feel relaxed happy you know you're for euphoric [ __ ] I don't know why I'm struggling to say words right now it has a pretty much 4 milligrams of THC per serving and this vape or the card contains a 462 milligrams of THC so I'm guessing that's why it's only 92.5 the other what 7.5% is the missing but it's a 48 milligrams of THC I don't know but I said I was tested and all that [ __ ] you can see it again there it is for you guys one more time this is why I like the cards because it has all this information on them and then just the sides a simple plain and has the warning like it has to have you know I mean all that [ __ ] down here it just says what it's tested out again I'm right here just saying pretty much the ingredients no extra chemicals added just three penis Bob Loblaw I mean just a basic package and it's pretty dope though I like it a lot this is what I thought I found interesting it says home this was not this is pretty much on author cards at least the ones in Arizona I don't really cuz I know some of the packages are different but this one said um the suggested servant is one three second draw so like you hit it for three seconds you know what I mean and you're supposed to be able to get a 125 hits out of this half gram card so that's why the store even said um four milligrams per serving so like in that three second hit you're supposed to get four milligrams so yeah wedding cake hybrid I guess we talked enough about the packaging let's just hop into this so let's open this up the one thing that I normally don't like about the car that's like the packaging is like the front of it and all the detailing is good when you get inside of it you really can't you first open it like it literally looks like there's nothing in there you know I mean you gotta like last time doing something wrong I don't know shake that [ __ ] [ __ ] oh yeah once you get out um it's [ __ ] fire here's the part um keep in mind when I put my hand behind it because the lights I'm using it's gonna the the oriole is like really more it's like a lot more yellow on person but when I put my hand behind it it gives it kind of little more orange tint but it's still gonna look fire like you're gonna see but just keep that in mind that it looks a little bit more orange because my hands behind it so that it's branded selector right there on it that's the oil pretty thick oils you can see that it's moving moving moving moving it's moving like really slow but I mean that just mean kinda like with the Pens I like a lot of different [ __ ] that could be a bunch of different reasons that doesn't really mean that is far for certain but that's a good sign you know I mean but I already know the car as far as I know because I know this brand I've had my million times as far I'm just giving you guys a little tip um the consistency of your oil is if it's thick it's a good sign but that's not the only way I left you or doors like with you because I know there's a lot of fake hearts going around so there's like a little tip for you guys so what I'm going to be smoking this out of it so did you see my other video is just a select heart it's actually the same brand as the card at the des ID card this is the battery this is the card for so that's the same thing in Arizona they have crazy deals all the time because I have my medical card so I'm like I said they got by to get one for you in the cards they had they had buy a car get this for free before and I think this was like $30 if I'm correct I forget I I don't [ __ ] know but I got this for free and it's pretty dope it's like a little carrying case so it comes with the battery to charge you know that was flat for you to put your car's right there and then there was like a little card right here that says his life didn't got the whole three set 33 second hit bought like three second hit serving thing over the plug that was but yeah this is pretty [ __ ] dope I like this case a lot is in the best if you guys like these um court reviews time went down below in the comments like I said because I want to invest in a better battery if you guys like them because I really don't want to buy a better battery if I don't plan on making more of these videos because I don't smoke cards like literally on the regular too often so um I don't really need a better battery oh that's not I'm gonna make more of these videos so if you guys want more of these videos somewhere down below and I'll get a better bit a better battery so I can actually get like the full effect of different parts you know what I mean like the flavor hi all that all that [ __ ] you know I mean so um let's just hop into this now though so here's the Select battery you guys probably seen it if you seen my last videos if you haven't I don't know if you have or not so it just says select just regular stick battery and screw it in so we're gonna pop off a little silicone sheet screw this in and even though this is like a simple stick battery I love the way this looks like it has like that um classy like like fancy fancy look to it but it's still like like dope I don't know how to explain it you know what I mean like it looks kind of classy it's not gonna get all like you would see like a [ __ ] a businessman hitting this you know what I mean like it looked looks dope when you have like the same brand car on the select pen a bit sick that's my personal opinion again you guys can tell me what you guys think down below in the comments what did the packaging for this so it's supposed to taste sweet like vanilla and kind of earthy supposed to make me feel relaxed happy and your for your fork this is kinda exactly what I [ __ ] want right now so oh yeah let's get it alright so it's not into this look take the first set and I can tell you my first thoughts and opinions about how it tastes I already know it's gonna be fired but no no stop into it Vennela I taste the earthiness and I really taste sweetness right that's what I said right sweet yeah sweet but now our earthy I mean I get that earthy vibe not really but never sweet but definitely like I cannot I can I mean I smoked before I made this video um so I mean I was already high but I can already tell the difference I mean I only had one what was that like I mean I was bigger than their servants I don't know seven milligrams of THC so if anything it tastes more like um you know like vanilla extract like the [ __ ] you put in like food or like milkshake sometimes and [ __ ] like that vanilla extract it tastes more like that and [ __ ] like like I was thinking like vanilla ice cream or like you know any but no like would now live another but it doesn't know I don't get that icy earth and like maybe like well vanilla extract but it definitely does not taste sweet to me at all I don't know if there's any make sense how something can taste earthy and sweet at the same time at least to me tell me if that makes sense I don't know earthy and sweet doesn't seem like it really mixes personally I don't think that sounds like it does tell me what you guys think I don't [ __ ] know like I said I get like a hint of the vanilla I guess but it's more of like a vanilla extract then I'm like a pure vanilla flavor you know what I mean but it's definitely making me relaxed it's definitely um like making me calm and happy I mean like you see it I mean if you guys couldn't tell mine xiety was kind of bad in the beginning in this video but I'm kind of more relaxed now chill I'm just talking to you guys so that's definitely like effect that worked um you've worked yeah I guess I'm feeling a little year for you I don't know so yeah I guess the that the feelings it's supposed to give you gets the five out of five because I guess I feel all those mines I yeah I mean I guess that [ __ ] really did help with all of those I'm not gonna lie the only thing the taste it didn't taste bad so I'm not gonna give it a bad rating on the taste but from the packaging I wouldn't say it tasted too sweet and but now that earthy doesn't I don't know but that's just my personal opinion so just the packaging I'm gonna get that like a three out of five of their description of the flavor but the actual flavor so if I'll give like a 4.5 out of 5 because it has like a earthy taste it's not the best flavor but it's not the worst as far but yeah the high 5 out of 5 the look of the car the oil everything else gets a 5 um so the overall overall score of this car I'll give this card a [ __ ] a four and a half out of five alone it would be a five the only reason like I don't give it a five is because they're [ __ ] forty bucks for a half gram which is [ __ ] really really expensive I would rather wait rather just buy a [ __ ] I can get almost two grams of wax for that price so I'd rather just buy a [ __ ] wax and dad than buy one of these two grams for a half gram yet for sure so if there were a little bit cheaper thought that would get a five but just because they're 40 bucks for a half gram four point five out of five if you guys ever tried the brand select tell me down below in the comments what you guys think of them tell me your favorite strains your favorite flavor ease Oh a few guys before indica sativa z-- if you guys
